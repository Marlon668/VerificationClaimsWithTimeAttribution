pomt-06660	"Since the beginning of the year we've created a net increase of 45,000 jobs."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/12/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-touts-administration-role-creating/	Gov. John Kasich recently appeared on Fox News — his old stomping grounds — to tout Ohio’s improved credit and economic outlook. In an interview on "Fox and Friends," the governor noted that Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services had recently announced that it was upping Ohio’s credit outlook to stable from negative, but that it was keeping the state’s actual credit rating at AA+. The vote of confidence is good news, because if S&P decides to increase the rating to AAA in the future, it would make it cheaper for the state to borrow money. S&P showed Ohio some love after Kasich and like-minded legislators approved a state budget that covered a projected deficit estimated in the billions and because the state was undergoing a modest economic recovery. In the interview, Kasich rightly took credit for the budget balancing, adding that the improved credit outlook sends a message that Ohio is a good place to do business. And among his comments: "Since the beginning of the year we’ve created a net increase of 45,000 jobs. Our unemployment has ticked up because we’re not creating as many jobs as we need, but the fact is we are net up in job creation." Creating jobs is Kasich’s job one, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. The statistic itself is easy to check. Ohio did add 45,100 jobs from the end of January through July, according to Ohio Labor Market Information, a division of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. In fact, if you include January (Kasich was sworn in Jan. 10), you could add another 34,100 jobs since the first of the year. But can the governor take credit for the job growth, as he seemed to be doing on Fox News? Specifically, Kasich said the improved credit outlook, "sends a signal, not just to the citizens here but to businesses in our state and businesses around the country that Ohio is open for business because at the end of the day you want to make sure that you’re creating jobs and since the beginning of the year we’ve created a net increase of 45,000 jobs. Our unemployment has ticked up because we’re not creating as many jobs as we need, but the fact is we are net up in job creation." Politicians like to tout good things that happen on their watch (or bad things on their opponent’s). As his term was about to expire, outgoing Gov. Strickland noted the state’s unemployment trend was already improving, just in time for Kasich to take credit for it. "We are one of only two states to have eight consecutive months of declining unemployment," Strickland said. PolitiFact Ohio checked the numbers and rated his claim True. On the flip side, Republicans hammered Strickland over Ohio job losses during the gubernatorial campaign. In their campaign against Strickland. "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch," the Republican Governors Association proclaimed in an attack ad. PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim Half True. The number was correct, but it was inaccurate to put all the blame for Ohio’s economic woes on Strickland. Two experts we talked to agreed Kasich’s policies are pro-business. But neither believes Kasich can take credit for the creation of 45,100 jobs. What really drives job creation is the business cycle, and that began to turn around in June of 2009, said Ken Mayland, an economist with ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio. Job creation numbers going back to January 2010 prove that out. Ohio has created 104,300 jobs over that time. "It helps to have the business cycle for you as opposed to against you," Mayland said. Just ask former President George H.W. Bush. The elder Bush lost his re-election to Bill Clinton despite a recovering economy, Mayland said, because the perception was that the economy was doing poorly. Clinton "basically rode the economic wave upwards through the rest of the ’90s, or a good part of ’90s," he said. Leroy Brooks, Mellen Chair of Finance at John Carroll University, also credits the job growth during Kasich’s term so far to a continuation of what started last year when demand for Ohio products started to increase and inventories started coming down. "He did not cause the growth we had in the first couple quarters," Brooks said. That said, Brooks would agree that Kasich’s policies are more likely to produce jobs, but if the economy retrenches as some are predicting, it won’t really matter. The governor stands by his statement. His spokesman Rob Nichols claims Strickland would have hiked taxes to balance the budget and that would have hurt job creation. "We would not be creating the jobs we are now," he said. He further cites an CNBC survey that pushed Ohio from 34 to 23 in its rankings for "America’s top states for business." But that misses the point. There is an element of truth in the governor’s statement: Ohio did add 45,100 jobs from the end of January through July. But the portion of the statement where the governor says "we’ve created" the jobs ignores some critical facts that would give a different impression. While the economists we talked to agree that the governor’s policies could be good for job creation or retention in the long run, they also agree it’s too soon to tell. There hasn’t been enough time for them to kick in, they say. Standard & Poors cited Ohio’s balanced budget as having a positive impact, but that didn’t happen until the end of June. Ohio has registered job growth since early last year, well before Kasich was elected. And while his efforts have received some positive reviews, there are many factors beyond the governor’s office that impact job growth. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-01378	"Under the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, northern Wisconsin’s mining economy is moving forward and more people are getting good, high-paying jobs."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/16/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperty-says-workers-are-getting-high-/	The state law that aims to help Gogebic Taconite move ahead with an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin stands as one of the most important pieces of legislation passed under Gov. Scott Walker. The bill -- which the company helped shape -- sped up the permitting process and made other changes to state laws to encourage development of the mine, a project billed as potentially bringing thousands of jobs to a sparsely populated part of the state with high unemployment. Gogebic has said that construction of the mine and its related processing plants and infrastructure would create 3,000 jobs. Once operating, the mine would employ about 700 people, with a projected 2,834 total jobs created from related businesses. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group, reminded voters of Walker’s support for the mine in a flier mailed to voters in early October with the headline: "Wisconsin is back to work." Next to a image of a mining helmet, the flier states: "Under the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, northern Wisconsin’s mining economy is moving forward and more people are getting good, high-paying jobs." The statement carries a footnote to Senate Bill 1, the mining bill sought by Gogebic and approved by the Republican-held Legislature and Walker in 2013. Taken together, that suggests a boom in jobs related to the iron ore mine. But we heard a different explanation when we asked AFP’s Wisconsin office for backup. "We didn’t indicate any specific type of job," said David Fladeboe, state director for Americans for Prosperity Foundation-Wisconsin. "We simply stated that the mining economy is allowing folks to get good high-paying jobs." He added: "Many jobs have been created both directly and indirectly because of the iron mine and even more have been created thanks to sand mining." Wait. Sand mining? In addition to the footnote citing the iron mining bill, the mailing specifically cited "Northern Wisconsin’s mining economy," and made no mention of sand mining. Let’s take a closer look. Gogebic moving slowly Let’s start with the iron ore mine, a proposed $1.5 billion project in Iron and Ashland counties. Field work on the sprawling site in the Penokee Hills got underway in early 2014. Roads were built and rock samples were taken. But in August 2014, Gogebic announced a delay. Saying more preliminary work needs to be done, the company pushed filing of its planned application back from spring 2015 to fall 2015. Once an application is filed, state regulators have a year to consider it. And then there are the promises of legal challenges from environmentalists and the Chippewa Indians who oppose the project. So we are early in the process. Even though there’s no mine, some miners -- technically they’re operating engineers who run heavy equipment -- are working at the site, said Gogebic spokesman Bob Seitz. They’re building roads and extracting and crushing rock samples. "We’ve had maybe 10 operators working up there at any given time," said Terry McGowan, president and business manager of Operating Engineers Local 139, the union involved. Those workers are paid about $37 an hour. So that’s 10 miners. To be sure, the mine’s impact would extend beyond those wearing hard hats and would boost other jobs in the local economy. Fladeboe from Americans for Prosperity made that argument in an email exchange with us. Seitz said Gogebic has spent $1.25 million in Iron and surrounding counties so far in 2014. That covers local salaries, consulting fees, motels and lodging, equipment, vehicles, meals, offices and local well drillers and equipment operators. "From spring through the summer, we averaged over 20 people per day physically on the site," Seitz said. The company’s office in Hurley has six workers. He pointed out that "$1.25 million dollars invested in a county with 5,700 people with household incomes among the lowest in the state supports a lot of jobs." Sand mining growing In backing his statement, Fladeboe argued there has also been a boom in the number of sand mining jobs in Wisconsin. That wasn’t part of the original claim, but it is accurate. There are sand mines operating in about 20 counties in western and northwestern Wisconsin, and the state Department of Natural Resources says there are now 140 mines, processing plants and rail sites for sand mining in the state. That compares with five mines and five processing plants in 2010, shortly before Walker took office. A study released in September 2014 by environmental groups -- the Civil Society Institute's Boston Action Research, the Environmental Working Group and Madison-based Midwest Environmental Advocates -- predicts that sand mining will continue to grow and perhaps expand to as many as two dozen other counties. The nearest sand mine to the proposed Gogebic mine, though, is about 120 miles south. Did the passage of SB1, which focused on the iron mine, contribute to the sand mining boom? Fladeboe argues yes. But the bill itself doesn’t make any reference to sand mining. Here’s how the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau described it: "This bill creates new statutes for regulating iron mining and modifies the current laws regulating metallic mining so that they cover only mining for non ferrous minerals." McGowan, the union leader, said the mining law sent a signal that makes all kinds of mining more acceptable. But he noted "frac sand mining was taking off before" the bill was passed. Our rating A direct mail flier from Americans for Prosperity says that "Under the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, northern Wisconsin’s mining economy is moving forward and more people are getting good, high-paying jobs." It cites the bill aimed at the iron mine as its evidence. But that mine is far from being constructed or open. About "maybe 10" well-paid operating engineers have worked there. To be sure, there’s been a boom in the state’s sand mining industry. But that’s not the subject of the statement. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2014-10-16T05:00:00	2014-10-03	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']

pomt-14609	"This is the true picture of ‘Milwaukee's Renaissance’ after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/02/bob-donovan/truly-picture-milwaukees-renaissance-under-mayor-t/	In his campaign for mayor of Milwaukee, Ald. Bob Donovan has criticized the record of Mayor Tom Barrett on crime, the incumbent’s support for a downtown streetcar and the conditions of the city’s neighborhoods. On Jan. 29, 2016, about two weeks ahead of the primary election, Donovan posted on his campaign Facebook page an attack that included a photograph of a dilapidated home. The home was pocked by broken or boarded-up windows, torn-off siding and holes in exterior walls. "This is the true picture of ‘Milwaukee's Renaissance’ after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership," Donovan’s post began. The post had been shared more than 80 times over the next three days. But it didn’t take that long for a Facebook reader to question how true of a picture it was. Several hours after Donovan’s posting, someone identified on Facebook as Gilberto Gonzales Jr. posted a reply, saying: "This structure was used by the Milwaukee Fire Department for a training fire. It is scheduled for demolition. Prior to that fire it did not look like that. This photo by itself is deceiving." Gonzalez, it turns out, is someone who would know -- a lieutenant in the Milwaukee Fire Department who was the lead instructor of its training division until 2015. Donovan responded on Facebook that evening, saying: "Perhaps that's the case, Gilberto. But if you're familiar with the corner, you know too that there's about five additional boarded-up homes in eyesight, a fact that is not deceiving. By the way, I was not familiar with the history of the building, but quite frankly I have seen similar dilapidated residences in my travel throughout the city." The Fire Department confirmed to us that the house, at 3068 N. 20th St., was used for training -- including with live fires in October 2015, which explains the large holes in the structure. The department chose it for training after it was put on the city’s demolition list. Eventually it will be demolished. Donovan told us he didn’t realize the house is in such a condition because of the training. But he contended that didn’t detract from his overall point about deteriorating neighborhoods, saying "I’m certain we’d have no problem locating another home that looks like that" in Milwaukee’s inner city. But whether other homes look something like that one doesn’t bear on whether Donovan’s Facebook statement is accurate. In the nearly six years of PolitiFact Wisconsin, we’ve rated dozens of claims as Pants on Fire. That includes three made by Barrett during his gubernatorial campaigns against Gov. Scott Walker. But none of the POFs were related to actual flames. Until now. Our rating Donovan said in a Facebook post: "This is the true picture of ‘Milwaukee's Renaissance’ after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership." The post included a picture of a dilapidated home, all right. But the condition is explained by the fact that the city Fire Department has set fires inside it and blasted holes in it for training. Donovan’s statement is false and ridiculous -- our definition of Pants on Fire.	None	Bob Donovan	None	None	None	2016-02-02T08:52:56	2016-01-29	['Tom_Barrett_(politician)', 'Milwaukee']

pomt-01257	"According to recent reports, a group of death panels organized under Obamacare ordered their first execution."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/11/americannewscom/first-execution-under-obamacare-death-panels-pants/	An old piece of Affordable Care Act mythology has come back from the dead: death panels. A reader sent us a link to a September American News article that claims an 86-year-old woman was ordered executed after a panel established by the Affordable Care Act determined that "she is no longer useful." "According to recent reports, a group of death panels organized under Obamacare ordered their first execution. "Following a hearing by the president’s Patient Resource Efficiency Board (PREB), 86-year-old Dorothy Zborknak has been ordered to death. The reason? According to the administration, she is no longer useful. "Zborknak worked at Fleur de Lis Florist in Chicago for nearly forty years, before she made the decision to retire in 1998. Since that time, she has struggled with a host of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney failure. " ‘Unfortunately, the cost of her care just became too expensive,’ claims Peter Johnston, a member of the Chicago PREB. ‘Under the Affordable Care Act, we have the power to make choices about end of life care and I stand by our ruling. I know it will be hard for the family to accept what’s going to happen…But from a financial standpoint, this was a very easy decision.’ We’ll offer a quick diagnosis: This claim is not accurate. Back in 2009, the myth of death panels was our inaugural Lie of the Year. Almost five years later, death panels are still not a part of U.S. health care law. Our first clue that the American News article was not real was the name of the woman who was supposedly sentenced to execution: Dorothy Zborknak. That’s the name of Bea Arthur’s character on the TV show The Golden Girls. (Slightly misspelled -- it's actually Zbornak.) It turns out that the story is ripped from an article posted on The Daily Currant in January. The Daily Currant is a satirical website with a mission "to ridicule the timid ignorance which obstructs our progress and promote intelligence," according to the website. Other headlines include things like "Obama Announces Two-Year Golfing Trip" and "Al-Qaeda Member Elected to California City Council." The debunkers at Snopes.com caught this case of copying back in September. As for the American News site, its "About Us" and "Privacy Policy" pages have no information on them besides ads. Stories are posted without attribution or bylines. We attempted to contact them through a form on the site, but did not receive a response. The article was posted on The Patriot Facebook page in September and quickly spread. It has 6,019 likes and was shared 4,906 times. For those who don’t recall it, the death panel discussion stemmed from a post on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s Facebook page on August 7, 2009. "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society,’ whether they are worthy of health care," she wrote. There is no mention of such a system in the massive Affordable Care Act. Instead, the idea originated from changes to Medicare to cover appointments on end-of-life planning, such as living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. The appointments were not required, and AARP backed the addition. The change wasn’t implemented after the controversy over Palin’s comments. Our ruling The chain email claimed that Dorothy Zborknak was ordered executed by an Obamacare death panel. We ruled on this topic five years ago, but we’ll repeat it again: Death squads are not a part of the Affordable Care Act, and you can still catch Dorothy on Golden Girls reruns most nights.

pomt-04361	"A few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/22/barack-obama/obama-romney-called-russia-our-top-geopolitical-fo/	Correction: At PolitiFact, we say words matter. So when we get the words wrong, it stings. At Monday’s presidential debate, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama got into a back-and-forth over whether Romney called Russia America’s No. 1 "geopolitical threat." But we fact-checked something different, whether Romney said Russia was America’s No. 1 "geopolitical foe." We mischaracterized the president’s remarks, which affected our ruling. We have updated the item with the exact quote and changed our ruling accordingly. In the final debate of the presidential campaign, President Barack Obama tried to portray challenger Mitt Romney as a novice who lacks understanding of complex world issues. "Gov. Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaida. You said Russia ... the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years," Obama said. We’ve heard the president make that charge about Russia before, using similar words. Here’s what we found. The hot mic In March 2012, at a summit in South Korea, Obama was caught in a "hot mic" incident. Without realizing he could be overheard, Obama told Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more ability to negotiate with the Russians about missile defense after the November election. "On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved, but it’s important for him to give me space," Obama was heard telling Medvedev, apparently referring to incoming Russian president Vladi­mir Putin. "Yeah, I understand," Medvedev replied. Obama interjected, saying, "This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility." The exchange drew swift rebuke from Republicans, who accused Obama of caving on an important security issue. Romney quickly joined the chorus of critics. In a March 26 interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, he said the president seemed to be willing to negotiate with Russians on matters he was hiding from the American people. Said Romney: "This is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight for every cause for the world's worst actors. The idea that he has more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling indeed." Blitzer asked Romney if he thought Russia is a bigger foe than Iran, China or North Korea. "I'm saying in terms of a geopolitical opponent, the nation that lines up with the world's worst actors," Romney said. "Of course the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear Iran, and a nuclear North Korea is already troubling enough. But when these terrible actors pursue their course in the world and we go to the United Nations looking for ways to stop them ... who is it that always stands up with the world's worst actors? It's always Russia, typically with China alongside. And so in terms of a geopolitical foe, a nation that's on the Security Council that has the heft of the Security Council, and is of course is a massive nuclear power, Russia is the geopolitical foe." The op-ed Romney followed that interview a day later with an op-ed in Foreign Policy magazine. In that piece, he never used the word "enemy" or "foe" to describe Russia. But he did depict it as an adversary and referred to its "intransigence." "Without extracting meaningful concessions from Russia, (Obama) abandoned our missile defense sites in Poland. He granted Russia new limits on our nuclear arsenal. He capitulated to Russia's demand that a United Nations resolution on the Iranian nuclear-weapons program exclude crippling sanctions," Romney wrote. "Moscow has rewarded these gifts with nothing but obstructionism at the United Nations on a whole raft of issues. It has continued to arm the regime of Syria's vicious dictator and blocked multilateral efforts to stop the ongoing carnage there. Across the board, it has been a thorn in our side on questions vital to America's national security. For three years, the sum total of President Obama's policy toward Russia has been: ‘We give, Russia gets.’" Later, on a multi-nation trip in July designed to beef up his foreign policy credentials, Romney condemned Russia as a "country where the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression." The second interview Romney spoke again to CNN’s Blitzer in July. Romney’s campaign previously pointed us to this exchange: Blitzer: "The last time you and I spoke in an interview, you told me that Russia was America’s No. 1 geostrategic foe. Do you still believe that?" Romney: "There's no question but that in terms of geopolitics -- I’m talking about votes at the United Nations and actions of a geopolitical nature -- Russia is the No. 1 adversary in that regard. That doesn't make them an enemy. It doesn’t make them a combatant. They don't represent the No. 1 national security threat. The No. 1 national security threat, of course, to our nation is a nuclear Iran. Time continues to pass. They continue to move towards nuclearization. This is more and more disconcerting and dangerous to the world. But Russia -- particularly look at a place like Syria. Russia has supported the Assad regime even as it has been attacking its own people. Russia likewise has been slow to move to the kinds of sanctions that have been called for in Iran. Russia is a geopolitical adversary, but it's not an enemy with, you know, missiles being fired at one another or things of that nature." So in this interview, as he would do later in the debate, Romney emphasized the difference between Russia, his No. 1 foe or enemy for the United States, and Iran, his No. 1 threat because of its effort to build nuclear weapons. Romney responds in the debate After a few minutes of back and forth, Romney had a chance to respond to Obama’s charge about Russia: "I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned. First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe. Not ... Excuse me. It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face. Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. I have clear eyes on this. I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin. And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election. So Romney revised his own remarks, this time calling Russia "a" geopolitical foe, when to CNN he said "our No. 1 geopolitical foe." But he’s right that in the same interview he called Iran the top national security threat. Our ruling In the debate, Obama said Romney called Russia "the biggest geopolitical threat facing America." Actually, Romney has twice drawn the distinction between his concerns about Iran and Russia. He has called Russia the biggest geopolitical foe or enemy for the U.S., but he has said the biggest threat is Iran. We rate Obama’s statement Half True.

pomt-01351	The Affordable Care Act says that "at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/21/chain-email/five-years-chain-email-about-cancer-treatment-rati/	A reader recently sent us a years-old chain email that has morphed into something more timely. It now has the heading, "IMPORTANT ACTION INFORMATION FOR NOVEMBER, 2014 VOTE." For years before that, though, the chain email has floated around the Internet, making the scary claim that "at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age." PolitiFact Oregon gave this a rating of Pants on Fire when they looked at it in 2013. The email -- which has changed somewhat as it has zigzagged around social media -- can be identified by its attribution of the information to Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. (More on him later.) It opens with a dire warning: "MEDICARE AT AGE 76, IMPORTANT PLEASE READ - ANYONE WHO DOUBTS THIS IS TRUE CAN DOWNLOAD THE NEW OBAMA CARE AND LOOK UP THE PAGES MENTIONED. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING......THIS should be read by everyone, especially important to those over 75..... If you are younger, then it may apply to your parents…." However, the email is hardly up-to-date -- it’s been circulating since 2009 and apparently stems from a list of tweets by blogger Peter Fleckenstein about H.R. 3200. That was an early version of the legislation that later became the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Many aspects of that original bill never made it into law, and other provisions have been misinterpreted or exaggerated by the email’s author. In fact, our friends at FactCheck.org found that just four of the email’s 48 claims were accurate. Here, we'll recap what we know about the cancer claim and a few of the email's other points. The cancer claim The email bases its claim about the age-based rationing of cancer care on page 272 of H.R. 3200, section 1145. But the claim is not correct. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010. It does not include rationing for cancer treatment based on age or any other demographic factor. Nor did the precursor bill, H.R. 3200, include a cut-off age for cancer treatments. One provision of H.R. 3200 did include a section on "treatment of certain cancer hospitals," but this simply allowed Medicare -- the federally run health plan for those older than 65 -- to allocate more funding to cancer hospitals if they incurred higher costs. The American Nurses Association called this the "opposite of rationing." Under current legislation, "all medically necessary treatment is covered by Medicare. Including cancer treatments, regardless of age," said Katherine Fitzpatrick of the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group, in a June 2013 interview. The Medicare Rights Center and AARP, the largest national organization of seniors, agree that hospital admittance has to do with billing under parts A or B of Medicare. Under the version of the Affordable Care Act that was adopted, Medicare payments to hospitals can be reduced if patients are readmitted within 30 days for certain conditions, such as pneumonia, but that’s not what the email claims. Meanwhile, the email raises a legitimate concern -- "rationing" -- but does so in a misleading way. "Everyone hates the word ‘rationing,’ " Harvard University health-policy specialist Katherine Baicker told PolitiFact in 2009. But rationing is not something that suddenly appeared in the Affordable Care Act, she added. "From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything." It’s theoretically possible to spend an unlimited amount on health care, but as a society, we only have a limited amount of public resources -- so tough decisions have to be made on how to allocate those resources. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, "rationing" occurred when private insurers denied coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, or denied reimbursement for certain basic services, or priced their plans too high for certain consumers to pay. If anything, John F. Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center, said in an earlier interview that private insurers are historically more likely to deny health services than Medicare is. "That's the argument you hear people making," he said. "But I think they have it backwards." A final word. Remember Judge Kithil, the supposed author of the email? He’s disowned it. "I wish it would die. I can’t control it," David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon in 2013. "I don’t know how something like that goes viral." The former judge recalled that he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in 2009, protesting the initial version of the health care act. The letter was published in the River Cities Daily Tribune, circulation 5,000. Somehow, he said, it was republished online. Kithil said he wants readers to disregard his letter, since it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law. "I’ve had calls from all over the country -- 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this," he said at the time. He said he pleads with the callers, "Don’t pass it on. It’s not accurate anymore. Trash it." Our ruling The chain email says that the Affordable Care Act requires that, "at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age." With this email, longevity has not meant accuracy: Seniors do not need to worry about their cancer care being yanked away once they reach age 76. The claims are based on an incorrect understanding of a bill that never passed. The Affordable Care Act does not include any sections on seniors losing their treatment eligibility once they reach age 76. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-10607	"I know that Hillary on occasion has said — just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/22/barack-obama/no-evidence-she-said-that/	Trying to depict Hillary Clinton as a flip-flopper on trade, Barack Obama claimed the New York senator considered the North American Free Trade Agreement a plus for the economy, even though she's recently criticized the pact on the campaign trail. "I know that Hillary on occasion has said — just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy," Obama said during a Jan. 21, 2008, debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. "I think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the U.S. were getting a square deal." Obama's charge is designed to stoke suspicions among liberals and labor leaders that Clinton is in the thrall of big business Democrats who served in her husband's administration, such as former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, chairman of Citigroup Inc., and ex-Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, her top economic adviser. Clinton, indeed, energetically promoted NAFTA in the past, thanking corporations for furthering its goals during an address to the 1998 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and adding, "It is certainly clear that we have not by any means finished the job that has begun." But even before she formally announced her candidacy, Clinton was expressing increased skepticism about globalization and questioning whether other nations were taking advantage of the United States' liberalized trade policies. The critical tone intensified during the run-up to the Iowa caucuses. During an Oct. 8, 2007, speech in Iowa, she complained that New York apple growers had failed to gain access to Canadian markets while Canadian growers were having no such problems exporting their products to the United States, and blamed the Bush administration for not vigorously enforcing trade agreements. "I think it is time that we assess trade agreements every five years to make sure they're meeting their goals or make adjustments if they are not and we should start with doing that with NAFTA," Clinton said. The line attributed to Clinton about NAFTA being a "boon" to the economy appears to be based on an issues rundown in the Sept. 11, 2006, edition of Newsday in which the Long Island newspaper, in its own words, stated that Clinton believed the trade agreement to be a boon to the economy. The paper also pointed out that Clinton voted against the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement in 2005 because of concerns that it would drive jobs overseas. Since announcing her candidacy, Clinton has, in fact, tried to distance herself from some of the free-trade policies her husband's administration pursued and repeatedly expressed concern and skepticism about the benefits of globalization. In June 2007, she said NAFTA had some positive effects "but unfortunately it had a lot of downside." And at a debate in December 2007, she announced her intention to review and reform NAFTA if she were elected. Obama implies Clinton views NAFTA as an unqualified success, but more importantly, he attributes words to her that only appear in a newspaper summary of the issues. We judge his statement to be False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-01-22T00:00:00	2008-01-21	['North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-03184	Congress secured special Obamacare rules "to prevent their healthcare costs from rising."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/03/karen-handel/handels-diagnoses-obamacare-rule-bad-legislation/	U.S. Senate candidate Karen Handel recently highlighted an example of what she considers hypocrisy in the place where she wants to work. Handel fired off a couple of emails to supporters attacking two can’t-lose sources of Republican consternation -- Obamacare and Congress. "Only in Washington could Congress seek and secure a special exception to prevent their health care costs from rising while premiums for thousands of Georgians will go up by as much as 198 percent next year," one email read. Another email read: "Last week, Karen asked Congressmen Jack Kingston, Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey to join her in standing against the special Obamacare exemption negotiated by members of Congress in order to prevent their healthcare premiums from rising. We still haven't heard a peep." PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and former candidate for governor, accurately depicted the situation. Did Congress negotiate a special exception or exemption for itself and its staff to prevent their health care premiums from rising? Broun, Gingrey and Kingston, like Handel, are vying for the Republican Party nomination for the Senate. The three U.S. House members have been vocal opponents of the federal health care law, aka Obamacare, which was passed along partisan lines in 2010. The three men have repeatedly voted to repeal it. But those measures have not gotten past the Senate. Handel, who has never run for Congress, has fashioned herself as the only candidate in the crowded field who can shake up Washington and restore some conservative normalcy to Capitol Hill. When Congress passed the health care law, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, included an amendment that required lawmakers and their staffs to buy health insurance through the online exchanges created by the law. Grassley’s amendment was intended to test the commitment of Senate Democrats to the health care law. Would they be as supportive of the law if they had to buy insurance through an exchange? The amendment stayed. The health care law created exchanges for people to buy insurance. A state can create and run its own exchange, it can operate an exchange with the federal government or allow Uncle Sam to handle it. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, like many Republican governors, decided the state should not participate in the exchange program. Members of Congress and their staffs still must obtain coverage from health plans created under Obamacare or through an exchange. In late April, Twitter was atwitter with reports that Congress was negotiating a deal with the Obama administration to exempt itself from the health care law. Not so, Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein explained in April. "[N]o one is discussing ‘exempting’ congressional staffers from Obamacare," he reported. "They’re discussing creating some method through which the federal government can keep making its current contribution to the health insurance of congressional staffers." On Aug. 7, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. A news release does not mention congressional involvement in the decision. So was Handel wrong about the role of Congress in the arrangement? Far from it, said Handel spokesman Dan McLagan, who sent us several news reports to back up his claim. Reuters reported that House and Senate leaders had been in intense negotiations with the Obama administration to reach an agreement about employer contributions. The Wall Street Journal reported that President Barack Obama told congressional Democrats in a closed-door meeting that he would resolve the matter. Some members of Congress were reportedly worried some of their employees would quit if something wasn’t done. A "brain drain" is what they called it. McLagan also forwarded us a news release from U.S. Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, that says congressional leaders were part of the decision. Vitter was not happy about the OPM rule. "[T]his behind-closed-doors deal, announced right after Congress is safely away from the crime scene on break, was fully supported by establishment Republicans," Vitter said. "When it comes to protecting their own, they find a way to work just beautifully with the Democrats." PolitiFact Georgia still wondered whether it was correct for Handel’s emails to label the OPM rule as an exemption or an exception? We asked the OPM, and an official there responded by sending us the news release, which contained links to a fact sheet about its plans and other information. In the news release, the OPM said the amount of the employer contribution toward exchange premiums is no more than would otherwise be made toward coverage under the prior health benefits program for members of Congress and eligible staff. McLagan and many conservatives, though, believe this is part of a special exemption for Congress and its staff. McLagan said the health care law did not provide for a continued taxpayer subsidy of health care costs for members of Congress and their staffs. "This is clearly an exemption. It was done by an administration desperate to keep support of the president's only memorable legislative accomplishment from falling apart. They found a way to exempt Congress from the law. You can call it ‘purple unicorns’ or ‘continuation of purple unicorns’ if you like, but you cannot say that Karen's characterization was inaccurate," McLagan said. U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, a Republican from Coweta County, recently wrote an op-ed with his explanation of what happened. He said a technicality in the health care law ended employer contributions to lawmakers and their staffs, forcing them to pay 100 percent of their health care costs. "What OPM actually did was issue regulations stating the government can continue to make the employer contribution to the health plans of Members of Congress and their staff – exactly as they do right now," said the congressman, who is neither a fan of the decision nor the health care law. So where does this leave us? Handel said Congress negotiated itself a special rule to prevent its health care benefits from rising. She’s used the words "exception" and "exemption" to describe what happened. Congress, according to several news accounts and a GOP senator, was pushing to get this done, although it came from an order by the Obama administration. Most conservatives describe the decision as an exemption. The OPM says the rule is a continuation of past policies for funding health care coverage for congressional workers and their bosses. Handel’s basic claim seems to be in the ballpark. But it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. It’s true that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. But they will also still have to go through the health care exchanges like other people. We rate Handel’s claim Half True.

pomt-09969	The economic stimulus bill created a council that's "modeled after the national board that controls Britain’s health system."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/11/conservatives-patients-rights/health-board-stimulus-bill-not-meant-imitate-brita/	A television ad makes the argument that the United States is on the path to a nationalized health service similar to the United Kingdom's. The advocacy group Conservatives for Patients' Rights created the ad, which features the group's chairman, Rick Scott, talking about the economic stimulus bill that became law Feb. 17, 2009. Scott is a health care executive who founded Solantic, a chain of urgent care clinics in Florida. "Deep inside the stimulus bill Congress buried an innocent-sounding board, the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research," Scott says in the ad. "It's not so innocent. It's the first step in government control over your health care choices. This federal council is modeled after the national board that controls Britain's health system." The ad goes on to quote doctors who complain about lack of choice and long waiting times for care in the national health care systems of Britain and Canada. "Not only could a government board deny your choice in doctors but it can control life and death for some patients," Scott says. "Tell Congress you won't trade your doctor for a national board of bureaucrats. Let's put patients first," he concludes. The ad is correct that the stimulus bill includes language creating the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. But to say it's modeled after the British health system is wrong. The board is simply an effort to pull together disparate federal agencies to find the best health treatments. Comparative effectiveness research is an effort in health care to determine which treatments work best. The new board's goal, according to the bill's conference report, is to "reduce duplication of comparative effectiveness research activities within the federal government." The legislation requires that half of the board's 15 members be physicians or "other experts with clinical expertise." The legislation also specifically states it does not permit the board to "mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer" and that the none of the board's reports or recommendations "shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment, coverage, or treatment." This stands in sharp contrast to the British system, where government entities run the health care system and a national board, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence, determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. In defending its ad, the group has said that its ad makes clear that the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research is simply a "first step" toward the British system. But that seems to be the group's opinion more than a fact. There are relatively few supporters for a government-run health care system in Congress, though Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, both Democrats, support similar models known as single-payer health systems. President Barack Obama has specifically rejected a government-run health care system in the style of Britain or Canada, even though some of his supporters have asked him to consider it as an option. He addressed the matter most directly during a town hall on March 26, 2009, where people submitted questions via the Internet, including, "Why can we not have a universal health care system, like many European countries, where people are treated based on needs rather than financial resources?" Obama said that the British and Canadian systems are too different from what exists in the United States, where the majority of people get health care coverage through their employers. (Read his extended answer via the White House transcript .) "I don't think the best way to fix our health care system is to suddenly completely scrap what everybody is accustomed to and the vast majority of people already have. Rather, what I think we should do is to build on the system that we have and fill some of these gaps," he concluded. He also added that he hoped to "lower costs through reforms in how we reimburse doctors so that they're not getting paid just for the number of operations they're doing, but for whether they're quality outcomes." That seems how a board like the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research would make an impact under Obama's plan. We can't say for sure, though, because Obama and Congress have yet to reveal the full details of health care reform. This is not to say that implementing comparative effectiveness research will be painless for the public, and Obama has admitted as much. In an interview with the New York Times on April 14, 2009, he discussed his grandmother's decision to get a hip replacement even though she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and died soon after the replacement. "I would have paid out of pocket for that hip replacement just because she’s my grandmother," Obama said. "Whether, sort of in the aggregate, society making those decisions to give my grandmother, or everybody else’s aging grandparents or parents, a hip replacement when they’re terminally ill is a sustainable model, is a very difficult question." Obama added that answering tough questions on end-of-life care will "have to be a conversation that is guided by doctors, scientists, ethicists. And then there is going to have to be a very difficult democratic conversation that takes place. It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels. And that’s part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It’s not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance." Getting back to the ad: It is right that the economic stimulus bill created the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. But the ad is wrong that it is "modeled after the national board that controls Britain’s health system." We see no evidence for that. In fact, the president has specifically rejected the British model, while praising comparative effectiveness research as an acceptable way to rein in spending. Because the ad significantly distorts the reason for the board's existence, we rate its claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Conservatives for Patients' Rights	None	None	None	2009-05-11T19:09:35	2009-04-27	['United_Kingdom']
pomt-14634	Donald Trump’s decision to skip the Fox News/Google debate in Des Moines "is near unprecedented."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/jan/28/fox-news-channel/how-often-do-presidential-candidates-skip-debates-/	Donald Trump says he will sit out Thursday’s presidential debate after clashing with Fox News over the network’s inclusion of Megyn Kelly as a moderator. Trump’s beef with Kelly started in the first GOP debate last August, when the Fox anchor questioned him on his remarks about women. The Trump campaign demanded Kelly’s removal from the Jan. 28 debate, but the network refused, inciting the billionaire’s ire and a boycott. In response, the network wrote in an official statement: "Donald Trump is refusing to debate seven of his fellow presidential candidates on stage that night, which is near unprecedented. "We’re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing – Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage. Capitulating to politicians’ ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats, including the one leveled by Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly." We were curious about Fox’s assertion that Trump’s decision is "near unprecedented." We didn’t hear back from the network, but our research finds Fox’s claim is slightly exaggerated. Many other candidates on both sides of the aisle have ditched debate, but the clearest connection to Trump happened more than 35 years ago, when then-frontrunner Ronald Reagan skipped the final debate before the Iowa caucus in 1980. Let’s go through some examples of candidates passing up the chance to debate, tracing back from the cycle we’re in now. 2016 cycle Trump’s Fox News debate boycott marks the third time Trump has threatened to pull out of a debate (though he has showed up to all of them so far). But Trump isn’t the only candidate who’s toyed with the idea, and one candidate actually beat Trump to it. After failing to qualify for the main debate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul skipped the undercard round hosted by Fox Business News and Facebook on Jan. 16. "I won’t participate in anything that’s not first-tier because we have a first-tier campaign," Paul said. Paul’s self-extraction from the earlier debate isn’t quite the same thing as Trump, the front runner, pulling out of the prime time event in Iowa days before the Iowa caucuses. But Paul isn’t the only other example, and Trump isn’t the only leading candidate to have refused to debate. 2012 cycle There were 20 GOP primary debates in 2012. (The Democrats did not have any, given President Barack Obama’s incumbency.) Eventual Republican nominee Mitt Romney was invited to the first Republican debate on May 5, 2011, before he announced his candidacy, but Romney opted out. Similarly, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman declined an invitation for the second debate held June 13, 2011, by CNN and announced his candidacy the following day. Huntsman then skipped another CNN debate to attend a town hall forum instead. Five out of seven Republican candidates (Romney, Huntsman, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Rep. Ron Paul) bowed out of a Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, 2011, — with Trump as the moderator. While the others cited conflicting schedules or didn’t say why they were declining, the Ron Paul campaign specifically named Trump himself as the reason, saying, "Mr. Trump’s participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere." Only former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Kentucky Sen. Rick Santorum accepted the invitation. The debate was cancelled after Trump withdrew from moderating. (Trump took to Twitter to air his grievances.) 2008 cycle In 2008, four leading Republican candidates — Arizona Sen. John McCain, Romney, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson — skipped a primary debate held Sept. 27, 2007, by PBS, citing conflicting schedules. A few months later, Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., boycotted a Univision debate because "a Spanish debate has no place in a presidential campaign," he said. In the Democratic primary, Obama, then a U.S. senator from Illinois, Hillary Clinton, then a U.S. senator from New York, and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards declined to participate in a Sept. 23, 2007, debate hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus and Fox News. The three said they would participate in a CNN debate co-sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus instead, with an Obama spokesman noting that "CNN seemed like a more appropriate venue." The debate was canceled. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson did not participate in a radio-only debate hosted by NPR in December 2007 in order to attend the funeral of a Korean war veteran. Previous elections Beyond the more recent cycles, there are even more examples of major candidates declining to debate in both primary and general elections. "It’s not unprecedented for frontrunners to skip out in primary debates," said Mitchell McKinney, a University of Missouri professor of political communication who specializes in presidential debates. McKinney gave a few other examples of no-shows. In 1980, Ronald Reagan passed on the last debate before the Iowa caucus, thinking he had the state in the bag. However, he lost the caucus to George H.W. Bush, who had a strong performance. In 1996, Bob Dole skipped the first primary debate in order to campaign. And in 1999, then Texas Gov. George W. Bush was absent for the first two primary debates. (He had planned to skip all the debates until January 2000 but began participating in December due to falling poll numbers and pressure from the party, according to USA Today.) Even further back, there’s also Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (who refused to debate Barry Goldwater in 1964) and Richard Nixon (who, after debating and losing to John F. Kennedy in 1960, opted out in 1968 and 1972), according to Ohio University’s William Benoit, who’s authored several books on presidential debates. To debate or not to debate So Trump’s decision to skip the Fox News debate, while rare, isn’t unique. And what’s more, experts said, bowing out is an old strategy for moving forward. "Candidates who lead may not want to risk making a blunder in the debate," Benoit said. "Occasionally a candidate in the primary will skip a debate; for example a candidate who knows he or she will lose in Iowa might skip one or more Iowa debates to concentrate on New Hampshire." Unlike other candidates who choose not to participate, Kinney argues, Trump doesn’t have to fear losing exposure (given his knack for garnering media attention) or being accused of weakness (given his blustery, aggressive brand). "This Megyn Kelly (spat) has obviously been ongoing, but honestly it could be cover," he said. "To use that to dodge attacks from anyone else on that stage — since frontrunners are in line of fire — it’s pretty smart." Our ruling Fox News said Donald Trump’s decision to skip its upcoming debate in Des Moines "is near unprecedented." Fox takes its claim a bit too far, as we found many examples in recent cycles of candidates skipping primary debates and in some cases even sitting out debate for a year at a time. The clearest comparison to Trump happened with Reagan about 35 years ago. However, the news channel has a point that the Trump situation is pretty uncommon. We rate Fox’s claim Half True.

pomt-09709	Three presidents in the last century — Harding, Kennedy and Reagan — all cut taxes during recessions and produced "rapid and dramatic economic recoveries," while two, Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama, did "the opposite."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/02/tom-mcclintock/california-republican-lumps-obama-hoover-his-appro/	President Barack Obama has been in office for just 10 months, but already he's being measured against his predecessors in the Oval Office. In a House floor speech on Oct. 27, 2009, Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said Obama and Herbert Hoover were ineffective at dealing with recessions. "Three presidents within the last 100 years have responded to recessions by reducing taxes and regulations," McClintock said. "Warren Harding, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan all produced rapid and dramatic economic recoveries. We’ve had two presidents in those 100 years who reacted to recessions by doing the opposite — Herbert Hoover in the early 1930s, who radically increased taxes and spending and who imposed unprecedented burdens on trade, and the other is Barack Obama." We contacted a host of presidential historians and economists to see whether they agreed with McClintock. First, let's discuss where the experts generally agree that McClintock is right. Harding, Kennedy and Reagan each acted to lower taxes, and in fact each of them staked some political capital on it. (Technically, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, brought the tax cut to fruition after Kennedy's assassination.) Each of these presidents either inherited a recession upon entering office or saw one emerge early in their first term. Meanwhile, Hoover did indeed hike taxes and spending during his tenure, and he signed the Smoot-Hawley Tarriff Act of 1930, which raised tarriffs on thousands of goods to record levels. Two of those we spoke to -- David Boaz of the Cato Institute and Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute -- were generally favorable toward McClintock's comments. But other scholars we spoke to saw a number of failings in McClintock's thesis. 1. McClintock's list of recessions is selective, in a way that favors Republicans . A look at the official list of recessions compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that McClintock ignores a number of downturns that occurred under Republican presidents — including Dwight Eisenhower (1953, 1957-58), Richard Nixon (1969-70, 1973-75), George H.W. Bush (1990-91) and George W. Bush (2001) — while ignoring recoveries under Democratic President Harry Truman (1945, 1949). 2. Recessions stem from a number of causes . Sometimes they are caused by factors internal to the economy (such a downturn in the business cycle) and sometimes they are prompted by an external development (such as oil shocks in the 1970s or the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks). Because these recessions have different origins, economists say, no single policy prescription works for all of them. This suggests that McClintock is oversimplifying matters. 3. McClintock distorts Hoover's tax record . Hoover is widely blamed for worsening the economy by signing the Smoot-Hawley law. But that was a tariff; Hoover's record on taxes is more complicated. He did sign the Revenue Act of 1932, which more than doubled the top income tax rate and probably worsened the nation's already dire economic situation. But that law came three years after the Depression began, so for the first three years of his tenure, the economic outlook worsened without any assistance from a tax hike. Indeed, the tax laws then in force were initiated by steep tax cuts urged by long-serving Republican Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon and enacted under Hoover's predecessors, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge — not necessarily a winning argument in favor of low taxation. Finally, Hoover did in one instance reduce taxes rather than raise them: He signed a joint congressional resolution that cut taxes by 1 percentage point on Dec. 16, 1929, shortly after the stock market crash of 1929. 4. The Reagan recovery may have been dramatic, but it was anything but "rapid." The second dip of the "double-dip" recession of the early 1980s — which occurred entirely on Reagan's watch — lasted 16 months from peak to trough. That made it the longest recession between the Great Depression and today's "Great Recession." 5. Focusing on the presidential role in combating recessions ignores other important factors . Something McClintock's formulation ignores is the enormous role of the Federal Reserve in leveraging monetary policy to fight recessions. For instance, many give Fed Chairman Paul Volcker significant credit for the 1980s recovery, due to his leadership (supported by Reagan) in lowering double-digit inflation. Meanwhile, some argue that, before the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, federal revenues and spending were so small as a percentage of the nation's economy that presidents had only weak levers to work with as they tried to fight economic downturns. Finally, actions of the 50 state governments can have major effects on the economy, yet cuts at the federal level often prompt spending increases at the state and local level, complicating the influence that government has on the economy. 6. The Obama record isn't settled yet . So far at least, Obama hasn't raised taxes; he's actually cut certain taxes, totaling $288 billion for individuals and companies, as part of his economic stimulus package. It's true that passage of health care reform would involve raising taxes, and passage of a "cap-and-trade" climate-change plan would represent an increase in regulation. But both initiatives are staunchly opposed by Republicans and there's no guarantee they'll be enacted, or, if they are, what their provisions will be. 7. Finally, correlation does not mean causation . Even if tax cuts happened to coincide with recoveries and tax hikes tended to coincide with recessions, it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes the other. For instance, tax cuts and deregulation likely aided the Reagan recovery (as did Volcker's inflation-fighting efforts) but historians say that higher defense spending, another Reagan priority, also helped bring the United States out of recession, as did historically lower oil prices. Meanwhile, Kennedy, in addition to cutting taxes, supported major increases in public works spending, not least the space program. The implementation of so many policies at the same time makes it hard to credit just one or two with launching a recovery. When we showed the criticisms we heard to McClintock's office, he responded with a detailed critique, which we encourage readers to visit here . He made a valid point about the recession and recovery under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, which this story now reflects. But overall, he did not persuade us that the 12-plus experts we consulted were wrong. We will readily acknowledge that it's impossible to encapsulate a century of American political and economic history into three sentences, so some oversimplification is inevitable. And McClintock did get several key facts in his statement correct. Still, most of the dozen-plus scholars we contacted agreed that the congressman greatly oversimplified matters, and we feel that describing history this way will leave an incorrect impression. So we rate McClintock's claim False.	None	Tom McClintock	None	None	None	2009-11-02T18:37:22	2009-10-27	['Herbert_Hoover', 'Ronald_Reagan', 'Warren_G._Harding', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-11213	Says the 2018 defense authorization bill includes raises for the military "for the first time in 10 years."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/10/donald-trump/did-donald-trump-sign-first-military-pay-raise-10-/	President Donald Trump opened up the White House for a celebration of military mothers and spouses. At the May 9 gathering, Trump signed an executive order to increase federal-agency hiring of military spouses. However, Trump errred in his remarks about an issue dear to the families in the attendance — military pay. Trump brought up his role earlier this year in signing the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018, the typical legislative vehicle for providing pay increases for the military. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "We just approved $700 billion for our military," Trump said. "So we’re going to be having the best equipment ever known. And next year, $716 billion. So I wanted to let you know. And, by the way — I know you don’t care about this — but that also includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years." That’s flat wrong. In fact, the last time that service members didn’t receive an annual pay increase was in 1983. And that was only because of a one-time technical quirk. Trump was "totally incorrect," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The military has gotten a pay raise each and every year." The full historical rundown is available in Table 5-12 here. We summarized those figures in this chart: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The increase of 2.4 percent in 2018 represented the biggest bump since 2010. But there have been increases every year since then, ranging from 1 percent to 2.1 percent. For 2019, the White House is proposing a 2.6 percent increase; the bill to enact that pay raise is working its way through Congress. So how about that missing increase in 1983? That was the year Congress began starting pay raises on Jan. 1 of the new year, rather than the first day of the government’s fiscal year in October. So service members received their pay at the start of the fiscal year a few months earlier, just not during the calendar year, Harrison said. Beyond that, you have to go back to 1961 to find a calendar year without a military pay increase. Our ruling Trump said that recent legislation "includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years." That’s wrong. Depending how you count it, the most recent year without a military pay raise was either 35 or 57 years ago — not 10. And the most recent pay raise wasn’t even the biggest in the past 10 years; it was exceeded by raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, during the Bush and Obama administrations.

pomt-15167	"Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college."	false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-no-gop-candidate-has-talked-a/	Hillary Clinton is contrasting her plan to overhaul federal assistance for tuition at public colleges with her potential GOP rivals by saying Republicans haven’t even considered the issue. "Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college," said in an Aug. 23, 2015, tweet. "Disappointing, but not surprising." What is a little surprising to PolitiFact Florida is that Clinton’s tweet omits at least one candidate who has made college costs a major platform plank — the Sunshine State’s Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio said as much by tweeting back the same day, saying Clinton "can't lecture me on student loans. I've had student loans & I have a plan to modernize higher ed." He then linked to a statement on his website excoriating Clinton for planning to put tax dollars into an "outdated system." Clinton’s own idea is a 10-year, $350 billion plan called the "New College Compact." Clinton proposed in August to allow students to attend public colleges without taking out loans to pay tuition. Families would be required to contribute and federal spending would be expanded, but with controls on spending by colleges and universities. Clinton’s campaign has not offered many details beyond the price tag and told PolitiFact Florida they had nothing to add to her tweet. Rubio has been talking about the issue since at least February 2014, when he made a major policy speech about controlling crippling college debt. He repeated his positions in a July speech after he declared his candidacy. His plan includes several specific ideas: Establishing a new accreditation process for nontraditional education. Rubio has not said what these "innovative, low-cost competitors" are, but they are generally considered to be for-profit universities, online courses and others. Requiring schools to tell students what kind of salary they can expect to earn with every degree. Basing loan repayment plans on the amount of money a graduate makes annually. Allow student investment plans, in which investors would pay for a student’s tuition in exchange for a percentage of their post-graduation income for a number of years, whether that covers the investment or not. Expanding apprenticeship and vocational programs for students who don’t want or need to go to a tradition two- or four-year college. Some other candidates have also brought up tuition increases, student debt and federal spending on higher education. In June, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie laid out several ideas for reforming post-secondary education with an eye on reining in costs. Christie suggested itemized tuition bills that detailed what the money was paying for; allowing students to pay just for classes and not facilities or add-ons; and letting students obtain private financing for college with an option to pay it back with a percentage of earnings after graduation. He also floated ideas of providing tax credits for apprenticeship programs and for donating to debt reduction organizations that help students pay for schooling in exchange for community service. Carly Fiorina, the former technology executive, said in a July Q&A on Breitbart.com that student debt was out of control because "the federal government under Democrats has nationalized the student loan business." She suggested letting private banks compete for student loans. She also said the accreditation process should allow for more for-profit universities and online courses. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said in April 2015 he thought college tuition should be tax deductible, although he did not offer specifics of how that plan should work. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush earlier in August sparred with Clinton on Twitter about tuition, while Ben Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, in February wrote a Washington Times editorial suggesting needy people should get jobs if they require help paying for college. Other candidates have been even less vocal on the subject, saying simply that college costs are a problem that have been dealt with, or nothing at all. Our ruling Clinton said, "Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college." While some Republican hopefuls haven’t had much to say on the issue, it’s not accurate to say none of them have. Rubio has made higher education spending a major plank of his campaign, and other candidates like Christie and Fiorina have set forth ideas and positions. Other candidates have at least mentioned the subject at times. We rate Clinton’s statement False.

pomt-09774	"House Republicans pledged to introduce a bill to reform America’s health care system," but "the 'party of no' has . . . failed to produce legislation."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/28/steny-hoyer/hoyer-claims-republicans-have-no-health-care-alter/	No matter which party controls Congress, its leaders usually refer to the opposition as "the party of no." The Republicans did it when they were in control, and now it's Democrats' turn. The latest complaint from House Democratic leaders is that Republicans have failed to produce an alternative to the five major health care bills circulating in Congress. In a Sept. 28, 2009, news release, Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer made this claim: "In June, House Republicans pledged to introduce a bill to reform America’s health care system. Now, over 100 days and numerous excuses later, the 'Party of no' has not only failed to produce legislation, but they have yet to offer any real solutions or ideas on how to make health care more affordable and accessible to American families." It's a matter of opinion whether Republicans have offered any "real solutions." But we can fact-check whether the GOP has, indeed, failed to introduce an alternative. Back in June, when the health care debate was just starting to heat up, Republicans were quick to say they wanted to be involved. Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio said there would be a Republican alternative, one that he said would make health care affordable for everyone; protect people from "being forced into a new government-run health care plan"; let people keep their doctors and their coverage; ensure that medical decisions are made by doctors; and improve health through prevention and disease management programs. "We believe our plan is a big improvement on the current system that will cost far less than what the administration is proposing," said Boehner. Republican Roy Blunt of Missouri, who is leading the GOP's Health Care Solutions Group, pledged his party would offer a bill based on those principles soon enough. "I guarantee you we will provide you with a bill that costs less and provides better care for the American people,” he said. Let's pause for a moment to explain some important Washington parlance. On Capitol Hill, many lawmakers present "plans" or "blueprints." Think of them as a rough draft for an eventual bill. Actually writing a bill is a slightly bigger step, although thousands of bills get introduced every year that never see the light of day — let alone the lights of a committee hearing. In that regard, Republicans have been prolific. Since the beginning of the year, they have introduced more than 35 health care reform bills. Many deal with small slices of the health care debate. For example, one, by Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas, would allow small businesses to band together to negotiate health care plans with providers. Another, by Rep. Darrell Issa of California, would allow nonfederal employees to enroll in the same health care plan that is currently enjoyed by members of Congress and federal employees. One bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee, got our attention because it has 44 co-sponsors and tackles many of the goals the GOP leadership outlined early in the summer. The Empowering Patients First Act, would, for example, allow patients to keep their coverage, as Republicans vowed. But neither that bill nor the others from Republicans has emerged as the Republican alternative. That's partly because the Democrats are in control and have used their own bills as the main legislation, but also because no GOP bill has drawn enough support to get momentum. We asked Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman, whether Price's bill is the Republican-backed legislation that Blunt promised back in June. "It's an alternative," he said of the Price bill, pointing us to a Web site that lists several Republican health care bills. For now, there is no single Republican bill, Steel said. A single bill is exactly what the Democratic leadership is looking for, said Hoyer spokeswoman Stephanie Lundberg. "The RSC bill is not the Republican alternative," she said. "When we say that the Republicans don't have a bill, it's because they said they would have an alternative bill," backed by the party. So, back to Hoyer's claim. He contends that the Republicans "pledged to introduce a bill to reform America’s health care system" but have failed to do so. That's incorrect in that there are dozens of GOP bills, including several that are highlighted on the Republicans' Web site. But he's right that the Republicans have not rallied behind a single bill the way they suggested back in June. That leaves the Truth-O-Meter stuck in the middle. Half True.

pomt-13622	"The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/12/ron-johnson/no-climate-warming-quite-few-years-gop-sen-ron-joh/	On a Wisconsin radio talk show on Aug. 1, 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked about global warming. "Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it," Johnson replied. "We all want a clean environment. It's a goal we all share. I understand that." Then the Republican incumbent, who faces Democrat Russ Feingold in the November 2016 election, made a statement we want to check, saying: "First of all, the climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically." Johnson’s comments on WRJN-AM in Racine prompted stories in the national media, including Talking Points Memo, Slate and the Huffington Post, each of which referred to 2015 being the hottest year on record. The rate of global warming has slowed in recent years, particularly since 1998, but Johnson’s declaration is, well, overheated. Johnson’s evidence To back Johnson’s statement, his campaign pointed us to a global "temperature anomaly" chart from NASA. A temperature anomaly means a change, up or down, from a long-term average. Source: NASA Johnson’s campaign argued that the chart shows the anomalies rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off. The trend on the chart, however, is steadily upward since the 1960s. And there was a "positive anomaly" in each of the past four years. Past fact checks Previous fact checks have found global temperatures hitting record highs in recent years. In 2013, when President Barack Obama said that "the 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years," PolitiFact National’s rating was True. And in 2014 and 2015, our colleagues rated Mostly False two claims that there had been no global warming in the past 17 years. Global surface temperatures remained relatively flat during that period, since the last powerful El Niño, in 1998. But the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been relatively stable -- has been the warmest on record. NASA/NOAA In January 2016, NASA reported that separate, independent analyses by its own scientists and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. The globally-averaged temperatures in 2015 "shattered the previous mark set in 2014," NASA said. The 2015 temperatures, NASA added, "continue a long-term warming trend" -- most of the warming has occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001 (as is shown in the chart below). Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration So, the warmest year on record was 2015, followed by 2014. Moreover, Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that temperatures in the first six months of 2016 are even higher. Our rating Johnson said: "The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically." He argues that temperatures rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off, but it’s wrong to say there hasn’t been warming in many years. In fact, 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001, with the two highest years being 2014 and 2015. We rate Johnson’s statement False.

pomt-13019	"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/06/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweet-air-force-one-bo/	President-elect Donald Trump tweeted criticism about Boeing, the lead contractor on the next generation of Air Force Ones, early in the morning on Dec. 6, 2016. Trump tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com He later elaborated to reporters staking out Trump Tower, "Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program. I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money." The political and defense worlds and the stock market immediately took note, since Boeing is a major American corporation that gets a lot of Pentagon money and employs significant numbers of manufacturing workers in high-wage jobs. When we looked into Trump’s tweet, we found that Trump’s description of the contract lacks some context. (His press office did not respond to an inquiry.) Some background on the Air Force One replacement project As the trade publication Defense One has noted, the two current Air Force Ones -- a modified version of a Boeing 747-200 aircraft known as VC-25 -- were purchased under President Ronald Reagan and were delivered in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush. With Boeing closing down its 747-200 production line 24 years ago, spare parts for the two current planes have become hard to find. And the plane is approaching the end of its expected 30-year life. So during his second term, President Barack Obama ordered a replacement fleet. (By tradition, a president does not order planes that he will expect to use personally.) Since the old model of the basic aircraft isn’t being made any longer, a new one had to be created. The new model will be based on the Boeing 747-8, with four engines and two floors. Trump’s tweet referenced one plane, but the Air Force One program will actually produce two planes, not one. That allows one to undergo maintenance while the other one is available. Of course, Air Force One is more than just a plane. It’s also a mobile command center, with state-of-the-art communications and safety features. The plane must be able to refuel while flying, and the president and his staff need to have communications capabilities equivalent to what is in the Oval Office -- secure video conferences, classified computer access, and nuclear-strike controls. It also needs robust defensive systems such as missile evasion. The new planes will be "both the fastest and longest commercial airliner in the world," according to military.com. They will be able to fly 7,730 nautical miles -- nearly 1,000 more than the current planes -- and will produce 16 tons less of carbon dioxide on a typical flight, according to the company. The extra features, obviously, do not come cheap. In fact, they comprise the bulk of the planes’ cost. Each basic plane costs about $380 million, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group Corporation, an aerospace and defense market analysis firm. Ultimately, Aboulafia said, the basic aircraft itself will account for just one-fifth of the entire project cost. How much will the project cost? The Air Force has published a budgetary document that says research, development, testing and evaluation of the new Air Force Ones -- officially known as the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization -- will cost $2.87 billion between fiscal years 2015 and 2021. However, the project is expected to extend beyond 2021, and experts told PolitiFact it would likely require another $1 billion in subsequent years to finish the job. The Teal Group has estimated that the project will require an additional $858 million between fiscal years 2022 and 2026. That adds up to a grand total of $3.73 billion over 12 years. That’s not "more than $4 billion," as Trump said, but it’s reasonably close -- and it’s no secret that defense contracts have a history of escalating in cost over time. Already, in response to inquiries from the media after Trump’s tweet, an Air Force spokesman told reporters to expect the interim $2.7 billion figure "to change as the program matures." So as a raw number, Trump’s $4 billion figure is in the ballpark. We should add that none of this price-tag includes operations and maintenance, such as aviation fuel, maintenance and pilot salaries. "Operations and maintenance are an inherent part of any such program," said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. "Canada was in line to buy the F-35, but then realized that they would actually had to operate the things, and they had sticker shock. Malaysia bought a bunch of MiG-29s without a service contract, to save money, and they soon turned into hangar queens." Such future costs would not involve Boeing, which is tasked with designing and building the planes, not operating them. What the tweet leaves out Clearly, $4 billion is a lot of money. But it’s important to keep some context in mind. First, it’s not clear that Boeing is behind any spiraling of costs; the demands of the project are dictated by the federal government. In addition, while Boeing is serving as the lead contractor on the project, much of the project’s costs are going for electronics and other items that Boeing itself does not produce. If costs on such items are going to go down, Boeing can’t do that directly. To cut such costs, "it is up to Boeing to jawbone their subcontractors," Pike said. Boeing offered some spin of its own in the statement it released after Trump’s tweet. In the statement, Boeing said: "We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer." By citing only the $170 million allocated to date, the company is ignoring the overwhelming majority of dollars for the project that the company expects to be paid in future years. Second, it’s important to note that the nearly $4 billion figure for the project as a whole is scheduled to be paid out over 12 years, not all at once. And in the context of the entire defense budget, that makes it a pretty small slice. The most recent presidential budget proposal shows defense spending between 2015 and 2026 equaling $8.132 trillion. So the Air Force One project amounts to four-one-hundredths of 1 percent of all defense spending over that 12-year time frame. It’s also a modest project within Boeing’s ledger of business. In 2015, Boeing had $96 billion in revenues. If one assumes the same revenues for all 12 years of the Air Force One project, then the project will account for three-tenths of 1 percent of the company’s overall revenues. Even looking just at the company’s defense, space and security revenues, the Air Force One project would represent about 1 percent. Finally, Trump’s contention that spending is "out of control" is more open to debate. While the program is expensive, it’s so new that it hasn’t busted through budgetary targets yet. "There have been no overruns," Aboulafia said. "This has always been the plan." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" The company is actually building two planes, not one. As for the price tag, Trump has more of a point. The project’s current cost is $3.73 billion, which is within shouting distance of Trump’s "more than $4 billion." That’s a projection over 12 years. Also, that figure is an amount that could rise as time goes on. However, Trump glosses over some important context. National-security requirements, not Boeing, have been the primary driver of high costs. Experts say the costs are broadly in line considering the high-tech and security requirements of a presidential plane. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ff7237d1-b009-406c-a106-f6850c360944	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-12-06T17:33:19	2016-12-06	['Boeing']

Clinton was featured in an old photo that was first posted to Facebook on Oct. 9, 2016 and is still gathering comments, shares and reactions. "In Case Y’all Forgot!!!!" the caption to the photo began, "As a 27 year old staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation, Hillary Rodham was fired by her supervisor, lifelong Democrat Jerry Zeifman." The words surrounded a printed picture of Clinton from back in 1974, when impeachment charges were brought against then-President Richard Nixon. The post continued: "When asked why Hillary Rodham was fired, Zeifman said in an interview, ‘Because she was a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.’" The person who posted the picture wrote on her Facebook page that it was a news clipping she saved 20 years ago. This particular post dates back to October 2016, when Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee, but as of this week, it’s been shared more than 253,000 times with people continuing to comment today. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Though the person who posted the image didn’t respond to a message seeking more information, they’re not alone in circulating the allegation. Clinton was one of dozens of attorneys hired by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in 1972 to work on the Watergate impeachment inquiry. Zeifman, who was Democratic general counsel to the committee during the Watergate scandal, died in 2010, so we can’t ask him if he fired her because she was a liar. But other people have. In 1999, Lance Gay reported for the Scripps Howard News Service that Zeifman didn’t have "flattering memories" of Clinton’s work on the committee. "If I had the power to fire her, I would have fired her," Gay quotes Zeifman as saying. Gay also interviewed Jay Woods, an Oakland attorney who supervised the lawyers, for the story. Gay, who described Woods as Clinton’s "ex-boss," reported that he described her as capable and cheerful. Less than a decade later, Zeifman changed his story, according to the Washington Post. In a 2008 interview on "The Neal Boortz Show," fact-checker Glenn Kessler reports, Zeifman was asked directly if he fired her. "Well, let me put it this way," he said. "I terminated her, along with some other staff members who were — we no longer needed, and advised her that I would not — could not recommend her for further positions." That year, an article by Dan Calabrese, founder of North Star Writers Group, claimed Zeifman was Clinton’s supervisor and had fired her. Clinton, who was making her first run for president that year, denied the allegation. Calabrese also quotes Zeifman as making the same statement that appears in the Facebook post. But Zeifman’s credibility has been questioned over the years. In a 1996 review of his book, "Without Honor: Crimes of Camelot and the Impeachment of President Nixon," Washington Post reviewer Matthew Dallek notes that Zeifman’s book "will surely excite conspiracy buffs on the lookout for sinister coverups in high places. But those wary of such unsubstantiated theories (myself included) will find Zeifman’s book an unconvincing, if imaginative intrigue." Snopes points out that Zeifman didn’t claim he fired Clinton in that book; it wasn’t until later that his recollection changed. Perhaps the best proof of whether Clinton was fired or not is in her pay records. Judiciary Committee pay records that were unearthed in 2016 by Washington Post researcher Alice Crites show that Clinton was paid through Sept. 4, 1974—after Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, and after the committee published its final impeachment report on Aug. 20, 1974. We rate the claim that Hillary Clinton was fired from her job as a staff attorney during the during the Watergate investigation False.

pomt-07348	Says President Barack Obama’s debt commission recommended converting Medicare "to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/10/tom-petri/wisconsin-gop-rep-petri-says-obama-commission-reco/	When House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan submitted his 2012 federal budget plan in April 2011, he touted how much more it cut spending, debt and deficits than President Barack Obama’s plan. Some of the loudest objections to the Wisconsin Republican’s proposal, however, decried its transformation of Medicare. MoveOn.org, a left-leaning political advocacy group, went so far as to say Ryan would abolish the 46-year-old program in 10 years. We ruled that claim False, partly because current Medicare recipients would continue to receive traditional Medicare even after 10 years. But, as we noted, Ryan’s plan would change Medicare dramatically. Starting in 2022, Medicare would no longer directly help pay for doctor visits, hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Rather, future Medicare participants would choose a private insurance plan and Medicare -- through what are called premium-support payments or vouchers -- would help pay for the insurance. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy, noted that in the days after Ryan’s budget plan was released, three national polls found Americans divided on such a change. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wisconsin, was conducting his annual survey of constituents. In his April 2011 newsletter, the 32-year Fond du Lac congressman posed this question to residents in the 6th District, which is north and west of Milwaukee: "One of the recommendations put forth by the president’s debt commission was to convert the Medicare system from a government-run insurance program to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market. Would you support such a change?" That left us with this question: Did a commission created by a Democratic president recommend the same sweeping change to Medicare that was part of the House GOP budget? The debt commission mentioned in Petri’s question -- the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform-- was formed by an Obama executive order in February 2010. The 18-member panel included Ryan, who was appointed by Republican leaders of the House of Representatives. The commission was charged with making recommendations to balance the federal budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. The recommendations came in a report issued in December 2010. This is what Petri’s survey question cited in saying the commission recommended a voucher program for Medicare. The word voucher appears only once in the commission’s 66-page report, as part of Recommendation "3.3.13." The recommendation addressed Federal Employees Health Benefits, the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees. The commission said the insurance should be made into a premium-support or voucher program. Federal retirees could use their voucher to pay part of their Medicare premium. But that is for a limited group, federal employees and retirees. That is not transforming all of Medicare into a voucher program. Had that recommendation been made, it undoubtedly would have stirred the same criticism that the Republican plan has. The commission’s report noted that two commission members -- Ryan and Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton -- had proposed converting Medicare into a voucher system. The commission’s view was that such a system "holds significant promise of controlling costs, but also carries serious potential risks." The commission suggested that, if its recommendation were put in place to make health insurance for federal employees and retirees a premium-support or voucher program, "that experience would be useful in considering a premium-support program for Medicare." So, the president’s commission recommended trying a voucher program with federal employees and retirees and then, based on the results, deciding whether to try it with Medicare. After we contacted Petri’s office on May 6, 2011, spokesman Niel Wright said the wording in the constituent survey question about Medicare was incorrect. He said the question should have stated that the president’s commission "discussed," rather than recommended, making Medicare a voucher program. Also after our call, this note was added to the electronic version of the survey question on Petri’s website: "CORRECTION: The question above is somewhat misleading. Instead of saying that the recommendation was ‘put forth’ by the president's debt commission, the question should read that this recommendation was ‘discussed’ by the president's debt commission." Wright told us that when Petri’s office distributes results of the survey, a note will be included "indicating that a problem with this question was brought to our attention," as would "additional information clarifying how the question should have been phrased." Wright also said the survey was reviewed by the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards, also known as the Franking Commission, and that "neither the Republican nor the Democratic staffers at the commission noticed anything objectionable" or partisan. Turning to the Truth-O-Meter, in surveying constituents, GOP Congressman Tom Petri said a commission created by the Democratic president had recommended making Medicare a voucher program. The commission did not make that recommendation and Petri admitted the wording in his survey was wrong. We rate his statement False.

pomt-10054	The Senate version of the economic stimulus package includes "millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/03/jon-kyl/stimulus-plan-includes-plan-compensate-filipino-ve/	In an interview with Fox News Sunday , Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., argued that the Democratic-backed economic stimulus package is so full of waste and clutter that legislators ought to scrap it entirely and start fresh. "I mean, there are so many different things that you can make fun of in this bill," Kyl said. "Let me just mention one — millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines. Now, that may be a good thing to spend money on, but not in a stimulus bill. It doesn't stimulate anything." Does the Senate version of the stimulus package really include millions for Filipino vets? The answer is yes. And no. Let's start at the beginning. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos fought for the United States with the promise that after the war they'd get a path to U.S. citizenship and would also qualify for full veterans benefits. Thousands of Filipinos died in the infamous Bataan Death March. But soon after the war, Congress reneged and established that Filipino veterans would not be recognized as “active service” for the purpose of any U.S. law conferring "rights, privileges or benefits." Filipino veterans activists have been fighting it ever since. Fast forward to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, otherwise known as the economic stimulus bill. In the 735-page version of the bill now before the Senate, there are a full seven pages dedicated to "Payments to eligible persons who served in the United States armed forces in the Far East during World War II." It details a plan to compensate Filipinos who fought for the United States during World War II with lump-sum payments of $15,000 for those who are U.S. citizens and $9,000 for those still living in the Philippines. There are an estimated 18,000 Filipino vets still living who might qualify for payments; about 7,000 of them U.S. citizens. The total cost: up to $198 million. In a statement explaining its inclusion in the stimulus plan, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said the bill would right a wrong. "This nation made a solemn promise, and with hardly a hearing, we revoked it," Inouye stated. "This is not the America I know and love. This episode is a blight upon the character of the United States, and it must be cleansed." Time is of the essence, Inouye said. "It should be noted that as you read this, many of the Filipinos who would qualify are on their deathbeds. Today, the average age of these men is about 90." Whether or not the bill has merit is beside the point, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "This has no business being in an economic stimulus bill," Eliis said. "It's just catching a ride on this legislation. It's just cluttering up an already complicated and wordy piece of legislation." Retired Col. Romy Monteyro, who has testified several times before Congress to lobby for compensation for Filipino World War II vets, said the bill has kicked around Congress for several years and "Inouye wanted to create a shortcut and put it in the stimulus package." "This is not a waste of money," Monteyro said. "These people are suffering. They are in the twilight of their lives. They should be rewarded for all they did for the U.S. during the war." But here's the thing: If passed as currently written, the money for the program wouldn't come out of the stimulus package. It was approved in another bill passed last year, said Rob Blumenthal, Democratic communications director for the Senate Committee on Appropriations. If the stimulus legislation passes, it would authorize that money to be released, he said, but "the amount of money for it in the stimulus bill is zero. The money was appropriated last year; it's not coming out of the stimulus bill." So why is it even in the stimulus plan? Well, it so happens that Inouye is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the very same committee that wrote this part of the stimulus plan. No, Inouye stated, it would not appropriate any money, but "it will close a dark chapter in the history of this country." Compensation for Filipino vets was not in the version of the stimulus plan passed by the House. The original legislation has another high-profile backer: President Barack Obama. Back in the campaign, in a May 2, 2008 "open letter to the people of Guam," Obama noted that he co-sponsored the Filipino Veterans Equity Act in the Senate "because I believe deeply that we must honor the heroic sacrifices of Filipinos who fought side by side with Americans on behalf of freedom. … This bill finally provides Filipino veterans and their survivors with the benefits that they were promised, and that they bravely earned in battle." However, we could not find any statements by Obama on whether he supports its inclusion in the stimulus package. So back to Kyl's statement that the stimulus plan includes "millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines." The Senate version of the bill does include provisions for a program to compensate Filipino vets; and most of those who would be eligible for payments live in the Philippines. And, yes, the program is "authorized" for up to $198 million. But that wouldn't actually be part of the stimulus spending. That brings us to a Half True.

pomt-00998	"Millions of people have given up looking for work altogether."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/05/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-millions-have-given-looking-work/	During a major policy address intended to increase his profile as a 2016 presidential hopeful, former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush criticized the economic performance of President Barack Obama. "Six years after the recession ended, median incomes are down, households are, on average, poorer, and millions of people have given up looking for work altogether," Bush told the Detroit Economic Club on Feb. 4, 2015. We’ve already fact checked a similar claim about median incomes being down ( we rated it True), but we wondered whether Bush is correct that "millions of people have given up looking for work altogether." When we checked with Bush’s staff, they pointed us to two Bureau of Labor Statistics data points -- persons who are "marginally attached to the labor force" and "discouraged workers." These two measurements are similar, but slightly different. "Marginally attached workers" are those who "want and are available for work, and who have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months," but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks prior to being interviewed by federal survey takers. The "discouraged workers" category is a subset of marginally attached workers, but they have specifically told survey-takers that they aren’t looking for work because they’re discouraged -- specifically, that they "believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify." In December 2014, there were 2.26 million marginally attached workers, of which 740,000 were considered discouraged workers. So if you use the definition for "marginally attached workers," then Bush is right that "millions of people have given up looking for work altogether." If you use the more specific "discouraged workers" definition, the number doesn’t reach into the "millions." We can see an argument for preferring the discouraged workers figures. The four-week period without searching for a job certainly suggests that a person has "given up" (as Bush put it) but it’s not proof positive. The criteria for discouraged workers is somewhat stronger for the purposes of checking Bush’s claim, because survey takers have confirmed that workers are indeed "discouraged." Still, the definition of marginally attached workers isn’t far off from what Bush said, and using that yardstick, the figure is greater than 2 million people, so it qualifies as "millions." We asked economists how close Bush was to the mark, and they agreed that he was largely accurate. "If they want work and are available and have previously looked but haven't looked recently, that sounds to me like they have given up," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. University of Chicago economist Robert Shimer agreed. "No data allows us to answer this with certainty, but the quote seems reasonably likely to be accurate," he said. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, observed that some young workers might not technically fall under the "given up" category because the weak labor market since the Great Recession may have convinced them not to begin seeking work at all, perhaps deciding instead to remain in school or become a stay-at-home parent. Still, Burtless said, "from the perspective of labor-force growth, it amounts to the same thing: A weak job market has kept them from finding work or even looking for work." Burtless said he’s "fairly confident" that roughly 3 million adults between the ages of 25 and 54 who are currently not working or looking for work would have been in the labor force if they had faced the same labor market conditions that existed in December 2007. Our ruling Bush said that "millions of people have given up looking for work altogether." There are two statistics that shed some light on this question; one meets Bush’s "millions" threshold at 2.26 million and one does not. But despite some uncertainty over the definitions and the scope of the data, economists told PolitiFact that Bush is on reasonably safe ground in making this claim. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-02-05T17:27:33	2015-02-04	['None']

pomt-00399	"My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/05/jd-wooten/wooten-says-blocked-medicaid-affected-half-million/	For years, Democrats in North Carolina have pushed to expand Medicaid, a move they say would help hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians afford health insurance. JD Wooten, A Democratic candidate for state Senate, added new fuel to the expansion debate when he blasted his opponent, four-term Republican incumbent Sen. Rick Gunn, in a campaign ad. "My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans," Wooten said in a caption posted with the video. We wondered if Wooten -- who is running in North Carolina’s District 24, which includes Alamance County and part of Guilford County -- was correct in his estimates. We decided to take a look. ‘Blocked the expansion’ Medicaid provides health insurance to low-income people. North Carolina has participated in the program since 1970 but remains one of 17 states that has not moved to expand it. Medicaid expansion — an action made possible by the federal Affordable Care Act — would give coverage to folks with household incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As a result, many North Carolinians who do not qualify for the ACA’s health care subsidies or regular Medicaid coverage would be able to escape the so-called coverage gap. Since his election in 2016, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has battled with conservatives in the state’s Republican-led legislature over the issue. There were signs of a bipartisan agreement when Republicans authored a 2017 bill called "Carolina Cares," but the legislation never got off the ground in committee. But while some state Republicans have worked toward compromise, Gunn was among many co-sponsors of a 2013 bill that rejected the ACA’s optional Medicaid expansion, clarified the state’s intent not to operate a state-run health benefit exchange and determined that Medicaid eligibility decisions would be made by the state rather than the federal government. The bill was adopted by a vote of 74 to 40 in the state House and 31-16 in the state Senate and signed into law by then-Gov. Pat McCrory. Gunn did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Republican leaders in the legislature have consistently opposed Medicaid expansion, saying North Carolina's share of the rising cost of the program would be too expensive. Senate leader Phil Berger called it a "budget-busting" expense, The News & Observer reported in 2017. ‘Half a million people’ The Wooten campaign cited several reports to support the claim that withholding Medicaid expansion was costing half a million North Carolinians health insurance. Among those were articles from the left-leaning North Carolina Justice Center, the pro-expansion Close the Gap NC and the North Carolina Medical Journal, all of which estimated that the expanded benefit would give new coverage to some 500,000 people. Most other reports predicted similar results. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, estimated in 2016 that there are more than 440,000 North Carolinians who are uninsured and earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the actual impact would likely exceed the Census Bureau’s estimate because additional people who are currently insured on ACA exchanges could be expected to transfer to Medicaid if an expansion bill passed. "The estimate of 500,000 North Carolina residents would be covered by Medicaid is a solid estimate well within consensus, expert opinion," Anderson said. Other experts we consulted agreed. "It appears that about a half a million people is close in the estimate," said Lisa Dubay, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning, Washington-based think tank. Predictions and estimates vary, but Wooten’s claim does not seem to oversell the impact Medicaid expansion could have. In a 2017 article, North Carolina Health News reported that the number could even exceed 625,000, according to the state’s Medical Care Advising Committee, a collection of health clinic managers, doctors and administrators. Veterans affected The Wooten campaign did not say how or where it found its estimate for the impact on veterans, but the number may have come from NC Policy Watch, the news arm of the NC Justice Center, which cited a 2013 study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. According to that study, approximately 23,000 North Carolina veterans would receive Medicaid coverage under an expanded program. Anderson noted, however, that although the estimate resulted from a sound statistical process, it is becoming outdated. Jennifer Haley, a research associate in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute who co-authored the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study, also directed us to a more recent report issued by the Urban Institute in 2016. That report estimated that, of the 25,000 veterans projected to be uninsured in North Carolina in 2017, 2,000 would be eligible for but not receiving Medicaid and another 12,000 would fall into the coverage gap, for a total of approximately 14,000 people. This number is short of Wooten’s 23,000, but Anderson explained that the difference between the two studies’ findings is likely due to sampling error and trend changes. "The caveat with Medicaid expansion is that current veterans who make between 100 and 138 percent (of the federal poverty level) would be able to switch their insurance to Medicaid or gain coverage," Anderson said. "There are no good numbers for that. I think it is safe to say that the most recent study gives a floor of 14,000." So Wooten’s estimate may be outdated, but it does not seem unreasonable. And his larger point — that a large number of veterans would gain coverage from Medicaid expansion — holds true. Our ruling In the caption of a video posted to Facebook, Wooten said, "My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans." Wooten is mostly correct on the first two charges and close to correct on the third. Gunn co-sponsored a 2013 bill that rejected Medicaid expansion, so even if he was not solely responsible for blocking expansion, he played a role in it. Experts agree this is costing approximately 500,000 North Carolinians the chance at receiving health coverage. That would include many veterans, although the exact number is less clear than Wooten suggested. But given the available research, Wooten’s number seems reasonable. We rate this statement Mostly True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

pomt-06521	Coca-Cola’s CEO "said he finds it easier to do work in China than in the United States."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/10/rick-perry/did-perrys-coke-claim-pass-taste-test/	Texas may be the home turf of Dr. Pepper, but that state’s governor had another soft drink company on his mind during his recent visit to Georgia. Gov. Rick Perry, a leading contender for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, didn’t mention Atlanta-based Coca-Cola by name in a speech to the Georgia Public Policy Foundation. But it seemed clear Perry had paid some attention to an interview Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent gave a few days earlier to the Financial Times about the company’s business challenges here and abroad. "The CEO of that company said he finds it easier to do work in China than in the United States," Perry said in his speech to the foundation. "Now, think about that for a moment. When a Communist country has less bureaucratic red tape than America, we might just be on the wrong track." A shrewd move, perhaps, to reference Atlanta’s red-labeled soft drink company and its problems on doing business in America to "bureaucratic red tape" to a gathering of fiscal conservatives. Our question for Gov. Perry: Did he correctly characterize Kent’s comments? We were largely left to our own devices on this one. Perry’s camp did not respond to e-mails requesting comment. Coca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers said the company doesn’t comment on political statements. Landers did e-mail us portions of the interview. We read the transcript and watched a 14-minute interview with Kent that the Financial Times posted on its website. Kent and the interviewer were engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about the economy. The CEO was asked if America’s corporate tax structure hinders the company. "I believe the United States owes itself to create a or architect a 21st-century policy for both individuals as well as for companies. … That calls for a simplified tax system. That calls for a tax system that doesn’t include thousands of exemptions, and I hope we can see the leadership and policymakers come up with that tax system." "A company is at a disadvantage doing business here because of that?" came the follow-up question. "Not disadvantaged doing business here per se," Kent replied. "Everyone is disadvantaged in that it is so complicated and I think businesses like simplification, clarity, transparency. That’s not what we have in our tax code now. It’s an evolution of exceptions. "However," Kent continued, "if you talk about an American corporation competing in the world today whether it’s Chinese, whether it’s Russian, whether it’s European, whether it’s Japanese counterparts, of course we are at a disadvantage. Because we go and make an investment in Malaysia and we pay 20-plus percent, 22 percent tax after we make a profit. A Chinese company or a Swiss company comes and makes an investment, makes an investment in Malaysia, generates profit, pays 22 percent, and after the 22 percent, the Chinese or Swiss company can do whatever they want with those funds. We can’t; when we want to bring them back, we are faced with another fairly large tax burden of almost 10 percent, maybe more." Kent’s comments were the only references to China in the video interview. They didn’t really fit into what Perry said, which had us scratching our heads. The 14-minute video, however, does not contain the entire interview. In an article that accompanied the video, Kent is quoted as saying "in many respects" that it is easier to do business in China. The article says Kent cites political gridlock and America’s tax structure for his opinion. "You have a one-stop shop in terms of the Chinese foreign investment agency and local governments are fighting for investment with each other," Kent is quoted as telling the Financial Times. Coca-Cola officials have not disputed the article’s content. We believe Perry’s statement is partially accurate, but omits some details. Kent said it is easier "in many respects" to do business in China. He also blamed political gridlock in the United States, not just "bureaucratic red tape." Our rating: Half True.

pomt-14124	"We're the highest taxed nation in the world."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/	Donald Trump released a tax plan in September that would give huge tax cuts to the top 0.1 percent and bloat the deficit by at least $10 trillion over the next decade. But after he became the GOP’s last man standing and presumptive nominee, Trump said this week he’s considering raising taxes on the rich. "Should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn’t take you at your words, as sort of that they’re floors?" Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Trump. "It is called life, Chuck. It’s not my word, of course. I put in a proposal. You know what they are? They're really proposals. People can say it’s a tax plan. It’s really a tax proposal. Because after I put it in, and I think you know the Senate and Congress, you know as much as anybody, they start working with you and they start fighting," Trump responded. "But I’m not under the illusion that that it’s going to pass. They’re going to come to me. They’re going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else." He then explained why, despite that, he’s still sticking to his guns and giving "a massive" tax cut to businesses: "We’re the highest taxed nation in the world. Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world. That’s why companies are leaving." This is a version of one of Trump’s oft-repeated talking points, and it’s inaccurate. When we looked at this claim in the past, we compared the United States to the 33 other industrialized nations in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Data from 2014, the most recent year available, shows that the United States wasn’t the most highly taxed by the typical metrics and actually places near the bottom or around the middle of the pack. Trump specified this time that he was talking about business taxes, but the essential data doesn’t back him there, either. Trump would have been more accurate if he had been more specific. The United States does have one of the highest top marginal corporate tax rates in the world. However, companies pay less in practice because they can take deductions and exclusions. When we look at the actual tax burden on U.S. companies, it’s far from highest in the world. Here’s a chart breaking it down: Tax revenue as percentage of GDP Corporate tax revenue as percentage of GDP Tax revenue per capita 1. Denmark: 50.9% 2. France: 45.2% 3. Belgium: 44.7% 1. Norway: 7.1% 2. New Zealand: 4.4% 3. Luxembourg: 4.3% 1. Luxembourg: $49,911 2. Norway: $38,016 3. Denmark: $31,054 31. United States: 26.0% 17. United States: 2.6% 19. United States: $14,204 32. Korea: 24.6% 33. Chile: 19.8% 34. Mexico: 19.7% 30. Hungary: 1.5% 31. Slovenia: 1.4% 32. Greece: 1.3% 32. Turkey: $2,985 33. Chile: $2,886 34. Mexico: $2,094 OECD average: 34.2% OECD average: 2.9% OECD average: $14,923 The World Bank’s data for 2012 — the last year for which it has complete figures — also placed the United States near the bottom in tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. Nations with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), a couple of oil-rich countries (Oman and Kuwait) and few impoverished states (like Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). We also looked at a 2016 report by the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers that assessed the total tax burden for a case study company in different places around the world. The total tax rate — which includes not only income taxes but also labor taxes, property taxes, profit taxes, etc. — is expressed as a percentage over the total profit. By this metric, the company would have a total tax rate of 43.9 percent in the United States, placing it at No. 64 out of 189 countries. That’s lower than the rates the company would have paid in the two countries Trump says the United States loses to, China (67.8 percent) and Mexico (51.7 percent). Moreover, it’s nowhere near the top. Our ruling Trump said, "We're the highest taxed nation in the world." By all metrics we looked at, the United States is far from the most taxed nation overall and for businesses. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-06448	With recent growth "it is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/20/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-its-very-clear-private-sector-jobs/	During an Oct. 19, 2011, floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., made the case for passing elements of President Barack Obama’s jobs agenda. He talked about recent patterns in job gains and losses. "The massive layoffs we have had in America today of course are rooted in the last administration," Reid said. "It is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine. It is the public-sector jobs where we have lost huge numbers. That is what this legislation is all about." We wondered whether Reid is right that "it is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine." We first turned to data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. We’ll start our analysis in June 2009, which represented the official end of the most recent recession -- the point at which job numbers typically begin to recover. Here are the net increases between June 2009 and September 2011 for three categories of jobs: Total jobs: increase of 841,000 Private-sector jobs: increase of 1,413,000 Government jobs: decrease of 572,000 And here are the monthly averages for each category: Total jobs: increase of 30,035 per month Private-sector jobs: increase of 50,464 per month Government jobs: decrease of 20,428 per month Here are the same statistics for just the past year: Total jobs: increase of 1,319,000 Private-sector jobs: increase of 1,636,000 Government jobs: decrease of 317,000 And here are the monthly averages for each category over the past year: Total jobs: increase of 109,917 per month Private-sector jobs: increase of 136,333 per month Government jobs: decrease of 26,417 per month So Reid is correct that the job growth in the private-sector has been much healthier than it’s been for government jobs. In fact, government jobs have actually decreased, becoming a consistent drag on the economy as a whole. But is the growth in the private-sector enough to bolster the economy? Many economists say no. -- that for the private-sector jobs to be "doing fine," there would need to be more of them. Dean Baker, a liberal economist, estimates that the economy needs a net increase of 90,000 to 100,000 jobs a month simply to keep pace with population growth, based on extrapolations from Congressional Budget Office and BLS data. Factoring in the ongoing drag from government job losses, the economy is barely meeting that number over the past year, and is well below that number since the official beginning of the recovery in June 2009. Others put the monthly job gains needed to keep pace with population at 140,000 to 150,000. Still, even achieving that benchmark would essentially mean treading water, and "doing fine" would require more net jobs than that to be created every month. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, checked the private-sector job creation numbers for the first 26 months after each of the last four recessions ended. He found that 1981-1982 recession was strongest, with an average increase of 289,000 per month. The recovery from the 1990-1991 recession was second strongest, at 76,300. The current recovery ranked third, with the post-2001 recovery actually losing jobs on average every month. In Burtless’ view, "private-sector job growth falls far short of ‘doing fine,’" especially given the size of private-sector job losses during the preceding recession -- nearly 8 million in 2008-2009. A Reid spokesman, Adam Jentleson, acknowledged that Reid’s statement "could have been put more artfully." He said Reid was trying contrast consistent job gains in the private-sector with consistent job losses in the public-sector. The comment, Jentleson said, was intended to rebut Republican claims that Democrats aren’t doing much to help private-sector job growth, when in fact the Obama jobs agenda includes multiple tax cuts for small businesses that are intended to spur growth. Our ruling We realize that Reid was taking some linguistic liberties, and we agree that he has a point that the biggest culprit in the anemic job market is the situation with government jobs, not private-sector jobs. Still, at PolitiFact, we often say that words matter, and the notion that "private-sector jobs have been doing fine" is not at all "very clear," to use Reid’s characterization. Current levels of job growth are, at best, treading water, and perhaps not even that. For the economy to gain steam, it has to create, by some estimates, two to three times as many jobs per month as are currently being created. We rate Reid’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-14856	Will Hurd "tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record."	true	/texas/statements/2015/nov/15/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-says-will-hurd-votes-house-republican/	The next contest for the U.S. House seat representing Texas’ 23rd District is still a year away, but already incumbent Rep. Will Hurd is a target. Pete Gallego, an Alpine Democrat who represented the district before losing his seat to Hurd by a narrow margin in 2014, went on the attack, telling the Texas Tribune, "One of my biggest disappointments in watching Will is that Will tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record. He’s a follower." In much of Texas, loyalty to the GOP is hardly a liability. But the situation is a little more complicated in the 23rd, a swing district in the state, and the only one expected to see a real contest in the 2016 general election. Following a 2003 Republican redistricting that found the district be in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Supreme Court ordered the district to be re-drawn in 2006. Minority rights and civil rights groups have challenged a most recent 2011 Republican redistricting for congressional seats, claiming lines drawn in the 23rd dilute minority voting strength. The district stretches west from San Antonio almost to El Paso, incorporating a large swath of Texas’ border with Mexico. The competitive nature of the district has resulted in three representatives in as many election cycles. The non-partisan Congressional Quarterly and the Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report have both identified Hurd’s seat as one of the top 10 "toss-up" House seats up for grabs in 2016. In other words, the 23rd is a district in which blind partisanship could conceivably be an impediment to re-election. We were curious whether the 96 percent figure Gallego cited was literally true, or just hyperbole — and whether that number is unusually high — so we took a closer look at Hurd’s voting record. Anthony Gutierrez, the communications representative for Gallego, confirmed that the 96 percent figure was pulled from Hurd’s score by CQ Roll Call. The week Gallego’s comments were made, the number calculated by CQ was actually 96.4 percent, to be exact, although the number fluctuates constantly because it is based on numbers from the current legislative session. As of Nov. 6, 2015, it had fallen to 95.6 percent. It’s also important to put these numbers in context. During his term, Hurd has voted with the party a greater percentage of the time than the Republican average across the House over the same time period, 93.6 percent, but he diverges more often than 17 of his 24 fellow Texas Republicans, a group that has voted with the party an average of 97.4 percent of the time in party unity votes during the 114th Congress. Based on voting in the current legislative session, five of the 10 most party-loyal Republicans in the House are from Texas. Hurd was not among them. Across the aisle, the 11 Texas Democrats in the House have voted with their party 89.6 percent of the time during the 114th Congress, 92.1 percent of the time on party unity votes. If you average the percentage of the time each has voted with their party considering all terms, not just the current one, that number comes up to 92.6 percent. The spread in their voting records is also much bigger compared with the Texas GOP. The most loyal voter, the 35th District’s Lloyd Doggett, has voted with the Democrats 97.9 percent of the time in party unity votes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 28th’s Henry Cuellar sides with the party in only 69.5 percent party unity votes votes. While it’s not strictly relevant to the truth value of Gallego’s claim about Hurd, all this begs the question of Gallego’s own voting record during his tenure in the House. During Gallego’s time in Congress, he voted with his party 81 percent of the time, according to Open Congress voting records. Of course, this number can’t be directly compared with the 89.6 percent average mentioned above for Texas Democrats in the House, because that figure is for the current session, not the one Gallego served. In the interest of comparing apples to apples, we calculated how frequently Gallego’s fellow Texas Democrats in the House voted with their party during his term. The average came out to a slightly more modest 86.2 percent. Gallego was the only one-term Democratic representative from Texas in the 113th Congress, which means that for every other representative, we can compare the percentage of the time they voted with the party during that term to the percentage of the time they voted with the party in all votes over the course of their multi-term career. If we do that, we see that all but one broke with the party more often than average that term. So while Gallego still broke with the party more often than average, it was a Congress in which Texas Democrats in general voted with the party less consistently than usual. Responding by email, Hurd’s campaign manager Justin Hollis did not dispute the voting record. He leveled his own criticism of Gallego. "It took Pete Gallego losing in 2014 to finally become interested in the legislative process." It’s worth keeping in mind that since CQ and Open Congress data don’t weigh votes by importance, the numbers don’t tell the full story as far as whether a representative’s votes against the party are on substantive issues or minor procedural matters. But then again, Gallego never claimed to have the full story. Our ruling Pete Gallego said Will Hurd "tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record." At the time of the statement, Pete Gallego’s claim and the percentage were consistent with Hurd’s voting record. We rate this claim True.

pomt-01426	The state’s overall revenues only returned this year to 2007 levels.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/08/nathan-deal/deal-correct-revenue-recovery-was-long-time-coming/	Public education advocates gave a collective sigh of relief on April 28. Gov. Nathan Deal signed the 2015 state budget that day, and that action gave them hope that school systems might be able to ease up on the worst of the belt-tightening measures. Unpaid furlough days. Larger class sizes. Shorter school years. State austerity cuts to public education started in 2003 --- well before the Great Recession -- and they are not ending. But this year, they total $746.6 million, and that to educators, who can do the math, looked better than the $1 billion-plus-a-year cuts in each of the five prior years. "We have been through tough times since the Great Recession started," Deal said during a candidate forum that was part of the annual meeting of the Professional Association of Georgia Educators’ foundation on September 15th. But just how tough? The governor told the crowd that it has taken until this year for overall state revenues to return to the levels they were in 2007. (The National Bureau of Economic Research declared that the country’s longest recession since World War II lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, although surveys show many people believe it has lasted much longer.) Given all the debate about state budget cuts through the years -- especially in education -- we decided to run Deal’s statement through the Truth-O-Meter. We reached out to the Deal campaign as we always do for supporting evidence. Campaign spokeswoman Jen Talaber said Deal was relying on information from the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget. OPB reports shows that 2007 was a fiscal high water mark for the state. Taxes on everything from personal and corporate income to gasoline and alcohol hit $17.8 billion that year, up $1.3 billion from 2006. Those same documents show that as the national and Georgia economies sank, so did state revenues. At the low point --- which was the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 -- total tax collection were about $14.5 billion -- or $3.3 billion off the peak. It wasn’t until Fiscal 2014, which ended June 30 of this year, that total state tax collections were back to -- and slightly above -- 2007 levels, budget documents show. Tax collections for 2014 were $17.9 billion -- or about $100 million over 2007 levels. The governor is right on the money on this one. We rate Deal’s statement as True.

pomt-11629	Says Evan Jenkins was Sen. Joe Manchin’s "spokesperson. It’s true!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/22/patrick-morrisey/west-virginia-evan-jenkins-joe-manchin-flak/	Did a Republican candidate in the West Virginia primaries for U.S. Senate once serve as a spokesperson for his Democratic opponent? That’s the accusation of Republican hopeful and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey lobbed at his opponent, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins on Twitter on Jan. 18, 2018. "Do you remember when @EvanJenkinsWV was @Sen_JoeManchin’s spokesperson? It’s true! How will Jenkins effectively criticize Manchin when he was his spokesperson & held a fundraiser for him. Manchin will simply portray Jenkins as a dishonest flip-flopper, & it will be true. #wvsen," Morrisey tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Jenkins has switched parties several times. He switched from a Democrat to Republican in July 2013 to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. But Jenkins was never on Manchin’s payroll in the typical manner of a "spokesperson." In the parlance of political campaigns, it is the role of a spokesperson to offer public statements for the candidate that appear in news stories and press releases. That is not what Jenkins did, although he did support Manchin back then as a fellow Democrat. Morrisey’s tweet was in reference to a public candidate forum sponsored by the local chapter of the NAACP and the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition in October 2004. Jenkins, then a Democrat, represented then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Manchin, at the event. "Incumbent legislative candidates present included delegates Kevin Craig, Margarette Leach and James Morgan and senators Bob Plymale and Evan Jenkins, all Democrats," The Huntington, West Virginia Herald-Dispatch reported on Oct. 27, 2004. "Jenkins was there to represent democratic gubernatorial candidate Joe Manchin." Manchin did not attend the forum, where candidates for the state Legislature and county and city offices fielded questions on crime prevention, the environment and education, according to the news report. Morrisey spokeswoman Nachama Soloveichik clarified that Jenkins wasn't an official part of Manchin's team as a spokesperson, but rather, acted as his representative at this event. She did not provide evidence of any other times this occurred. Neither Jenkins nor the reporter, Jean Hardiman, recall how exactly Jenkins represented Manchin. "Evan does not recall that local forum in detail but knows he did not give a speech or answer questions on Manchin’s behalf," Andy Sere, Jenkins’ spokesman, said. Sere offered Jenkins likely passed along his colleague’s regrets for his absence. "At a lot of events, one politician will stand up to speak for someone who couldn’t be there and read something on the person’s behalf, or offer to relay concerns or take questions on the person’s behalf," Hardiman said. "This may or may not have been the case. And he may or may not have been officially asked to be there, but I didn’t ask that question apparently." Morrisey’s spokeswoman said it doesn’t matter that Jenkins wasn’t paid or hired to represent Manchin. "He did it as a friend and political compatriot. That’s the whole point," Soloveichik said. "How can he credibly take on Manchin when he was serving on Manchin’s team not that long ago — representing him at events and hosting fundraisers for him." A spokesman for Manchin’s Senate campaign, Grant Herring, recalled Jenkins as a "big supporter" of Manchin in past campaigns. Jenkins hosted a 2007 fundraiser for Manchin in his Huntington home, referenced in the Morrisey tweet. "Joe Manchin was much different before Washington changed him," Sere of the Jenkins campaign said. "When they served together in Charleston, Evan and Manchin both supported tax cuts, pro-life, pro-gun and pro-coal policies. As governor, Manchin was endorsed by the NRA and West Virginians for Life; Morrisey is thus impugning those conservative groups, as well, when he attacks those who backed Manchin when he was not the liberal he is today." Our ruling Morrisey tweeted, "Do you remember when @EvanJenkinsWV was @Sen_JoeManchin’s spokesperson? It’s true!" Jenkins once represented Manchin at a public candidate forum in Huntington, W. Va. Neither Jenkins nor the reporter recall his role at the event, but Morrisey said Jenkins was not paid to do so, or hired by the Manchin campaign as an official spokesman at any time.

pomt-13871	Says "while serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer-funded junket to China."	pants on fire!	/colorado/statements/2016/jul/05/colorado-citizens-accountable-government/group-says-colorado-senate-candidate-voted-China/	For the second straight election, a conservative group has attacked a Democratic Colorado state Senate candidate with the same claim: "Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer-funded junket to China." In late June, political mailers started arriving at homes in the northwest Denver suburbs of Senate District 19. They featured a photoshopped image of a smiling Zenzinger wearing sunglasses with dollar signs on the lenses and an ornamental Asian bridge in the background. "While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China," the mailer said. The back of the mailer showed a pagoda and elaborated on the claim, saying, "Zenzinger couldn’t be trusted with taxpayer money on the city council -- we definitely can’t trust her to oversee $26 billion in the State Senate." The mailers were produced by Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government, a conservative 527 political group. 527s are tax-exempt entities (organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code) that can collect unlimited donations and influence a political issue, policy, appointment or election. But to maintain nonprofit status, the groups cannot expressly advocate that people vote for or against a candidate. The same group attacked Zenzinger for a taxpayer-backed junket to China in 2014. But just as before, there are key problems with these attacks. "I’ve never been to China," Zenzinger told PolitiFact. "I was joking to friends, believe me if I had been to China, I would have had so many pictures on Facebook they wouldn't have to Photoshop my picture in the ads." Also, while on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China. No city officials ever went on the trip. But you wouldn’t know that from this mailer, or a 2014 TV ad called "China Girl" that targeted Zenzinger, who was running to hang onto her Senate seat. Zenzinger had been appointed in 2013 to the District 19 seat to replace Democratic Sen. Evie Hudak, who resigned in the face of a recall effort by gun-rights groups angered by gun-control laws passed by Democratic lawmakers after the deadly mass shooting at an Aurora movie theater in 2012. Zenzinger lost the election by 663 votes to Republican candidate Laura Woods — a defeat she blames on the misleading TV ad and mailers with the same misleading theme. Now Zenzinger is running in a rematch against Woods. "I would knock on people's doors and they'd be like, 'Oh yeah, you went to China,’ " she said. So if there was no trip, what is the mailer talking about? A 2013 council meeting As evidence, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government emailed PolitiFact a brief excerpt from the minutes of an Arvada City Council meeting on April 1, 2013. Council members were discussing an invitation from the mayor of Arvada’s sister city, Jinzhou, China, to send an official delegation from Arvada to the 2013 World Landscape Art Exposition. A nonprofit group, Arvada Sister Cities International, recommended that the invitation be accepted and that an official delegation -- including Arvada city officials, members of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Arvada Sister Cities -- attend the Jinzhou expo. Councilman Bob Dyer made a motion to accept the group’s recommendation and send a delegation to Jinzhou, according to the meeting minutes. Before the vote on the motion, the 527 group points out, Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip. The mayor said "since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it," according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded. Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3. But that wasn’t the end of the meeting. The group attacking Zenzinger left out what happened next. Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, the money would come from a non-city source. "Councilmember Cook asked if Ms. Zenzinger is suggesting that no city costs be used in the delegation and Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger said yes," the minutes state. "Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified...that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation." Zenzinger’s motion passed on a 5-2 vote. Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found. ‘Outrageous fabrications’ Several people who were at the council meeting on the China delegation proposal blasted the attacks on Zenzinger. City Councilman Mark McGoff called the current mailers and the 2014 TV ad "outrageous fabrications." "I'm appalled by that because it besmirches Rachel Zenzinger's reputation and it's made out of whole cloth. There's just nothing there. She didn't vote to send herself on a junket and she didn't go on a junket," McGoff said. Just because Zenzinger voted to send a delegation doesn't mean she "intended to use city funds," said Edna Gordon, president of Arvada Sister Cities. Participants paid their own way on previous sister city trips, including a 2008 delegation when two councilmembers and the city manager went to Jinzhou (before Zenzinger was on the council), Gordon said. Even the local Arvada Sister Cities group’s members paid for their trips. Williams, the mayor, has a different view of Zenzinger’s initial vote in favor of Dyer’s motion to "send a delegation to Jinzhou." "Did she support a motion that would have funded through city funds the opportunity for her to go? Yes, she did," the mayor said. But he stressed that she also made the subsequent successful motion "with the explicit direction that no city funds be used." "My negativity toward their ad is that it implies that she actually took that trip, and she didn’t," Williams said. Zenzinger disagrees with the mayor’s interpretation. "Yes, I voted to approve an ‘official’ delegation, which meant that an elected official would make the trip," Zenzinger said in an email. "The funding for the delegation was not addressed until the subsequent vote." "Mayor Williams’ comments about funding, even though they were not relevant to the original motion, prompted me to make a second motion that clarified and distinguished that this delegation would receive no funding from the city," Zenzinger added. Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government did not respond to additional requests for comment from PolitiFact. Our ruling In a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, "While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China." As of a member of the Arvada City Council, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city event in China. This hardly supports the political group’s accusation. Not only did Zenzinger initiate a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for the delegation to China. She never even went to China!

pomt-02299	"Two-thirds of the people who receive the minimum wage are female."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/02/cokie-roberts/cokie-roberts-two-thirds-minimum-wage-earners-are-/	Many Democrats are eager to debate raising the federal minimum wage because it’s a popular issue to the party base, especially women, says ABC News political commentator Cokie Roberts. "When you're talking about the minimum wage, you're talking about women," Roberts said March 31 on NPR’s Morning Edition. "Two-thirds of the people who receive the minimum wage are female, and this is one of many attempts on the part of Democrats to get out the voters who normally don't vote in an off-year election, to try to get them to the polls this year. We’ll see whether that works or not." Is her statistic accurate? The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a hub for data on American workers and the unemployed, had just the report, "Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2013." The BLS collects this data through a national monthly survey of households called the Current Population Survey. It does not account for overtime pay, tips or commissions workers earn above their hourly wage. Of the 75.9 million Americans who earn hourly wages (and make up half of the nation’s workforce), 1.5 million earn exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, and 1.8 million earn less than that, according to BLS. Here, we’re focused on the gender composition of those 3.3 million workers who earn at or below the minimum wage. We found it’s true that women have a disproportionately high place in the minimum-wage workforce than men. In 2013, 62.4 percent of workers, or 2.06 million people, who earned at or below the federal minimum wage were women. This was down slightly from the year before, when it was 64 percent. It’s important to know this data only isolates workers who make the federal minimum wage of $7.25 or below. Many states have set a higher minimum wage for their residents. The BLS measure would not account for minimum-wage earners in California, who earn $8 an hour, or their counterparts in Washington, who earn the highest minimum pay in the country of $9.32. A recent Congressional Budget Office report pointed out half of all workers live in states where the minimum wage is more than $7.25 an hour. Still, these caveats do not undermine Roberts’ point, said Heidi Shierholz, a labor economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which supports increasing the minimum wage. An increased federal minimum wage to $10.10 would set a new floor for all workers in the country, even those in states that set their own minimum wages. And it wouldn’t just lift the pay of workers who earn $7.25 an hour, but also those who make slightly more, such as $8 or $9 an hour. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found women would make up 55 percent percent of workers who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $10.10 by the second half of 2016, a congressional proposal backed by the White House. That figure aligns with CBO data, too. "If you raise the wage floor, more women will be affected by that," Shierholz said. "That’s the bottom line." The discrepancy in pay between men and women known as the "gender gap" is closer at the bottom of the income distribution than at the top 1 percent of earners, Shierholz said. The gap is closing as a result of more women going to college and stagnated male wages. The White House argues raising the minimum wage would further tighten the gap because women are overrepresented in low-paying professions. The amount of women in tips-based jobs, such as hairstylists and waitresses, is even higher than the female share of the federal minimum wage workforce, Shierholz said. Employers are allowed to pay workers a minimum of $2.13 an hour as long as their tips or at least $5.12, or the difference between $2.13 and $7.25. The White House also wants an increase in the tipped minimum wage of $2.13 an hour to $4.90 by 2016 under the proposed Harkin-Miller legislation. Efforts to reach Roberts through ABC News were unsuccessful. Our ruling Roberts said, "Two-thirds of the people who receive the minimum wage are female." The actual figure is just a little bit lower. Federal data shows 62 percent of people who earn the federal minimum wage or below are women. The federal data has limitations, as it does not account for women in states with a higher minimum wage. One study says that if the federal government raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, women will benefit more than men by a 55-45 percent spread. Roberts claim is on the right track but needs some additional information. That falls into a rating of Mostly True.	None	Cokie Roberts	None	None	None	2014-04-02T14:42:38	2014-03-31	['None']

pomt-01880	"In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/09/sean-spicer/gop-spokesman-says-supreme-court-unanimously-ruled/	House Speaker John Boehner’s threat to sue President Barack Obama is either a political stunt or a necessary course of action against an errant administration, depending on what side of the aisle you fall. On CNN’s State of the Union July 6, 2014, the debate bore out along expected lines. After liberal radio host Stephanie Miller claimed, "President Bush had way more executive orders than President Obama" (a topic we have tackled in previous fact-checks), Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer said Obama’s actions are "fundamentally different than has ever happened before." Proof? How about his recent record with the Supreme Court. "In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders," Spicer said. This was a bit of deja vu for us. Just one week earlier on another Sunday political show, Fox News Sunday, we heard a very similar claim from Rep. Bob Goodlatte. We rated it False. Goodlatte claimed that the Supreme Court decision in National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning was "the 13th time the Supreme Court has voted 9-0 that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority." Spicer’s statement relies on the same incorrect premise as Goodlatte’s comment, and in fact takes it a step further. (In an email to PolitiFact, he also admitted that he "misspoke in using the statistic.") Let's explain why. Goodlatte provided us a list of the cases he was referring to. We reviewed them, and enlisted the help of constitutional law experts to take a look as well. We had several issues with the list. For starters, nine of the 13 cases actually originated when President George W. Bush was in office. Bush’s Justice Department handled the initial court proceedings in most of those instances. Obama’s Justice Department in many of the cases handled the appellate process and ultimately defended the actions to the Supreme Court. But that’s commonplace, experts we spoke with said. Only one of the 13 cases actually had to do directly with Obama’s overreach: National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning. In that case, decided in June, the Supreme Court said unanimously that Obama went too far when he appointed members to the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate wasn’t technically in session. But even that case had nothing to do with what Spicer said last weekend on CNN. Spicer claimed that the court has unanimously rejected "the president's executive orders" 13 times in three years. Executive orders are a lot different, and a lot more specific, than "constitutional authority," which is what Goodlatte said. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. It does not appear that any of these cases actually have to do with executive orders issued by Obama. In the case concerning the National Labor Relations Board, for example, the issue was the president’s power to make appointments. There was no executive order issued that named individuals to positions to the board. In United States vs. Arizona, another case on the list, Obama’s justice department took Arizona to court over the state’s tough immigration laws. But it wasn’t the result of an executive order from Obama. In one of the cases, McCullen vs. Coakley, the Obama administration was not even a plaintiff or a defendant in the case. The case was a challenge to a Massachusetts law that put no-protest zones around abortion clinics. While the Obama administration filed a brief supporting the Massachusetts law, no executive order was filed or challenged. And again, most of these cases were started under Bush, so any executive action was likely coming from the previous administration, not Obama. Our ruling Spicer said, "In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders." Most of the litigation actually came in response to actions under the Bush administration. In the few cases initiated during Obama’s two terms, the court wasn't even ruling on challenges to Obama’s executive orders. Spicer took an already debunked argument and made another mistake in repeating it, so it was even more incorrect. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05369	Says no Austin City Council "member lives south of" Lady Bird Lake "or north of 45th Street."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/may/09/shaun-ireland/shaun-ireland-says-no-austin-city-council-member-l/	Austin City Council candidate Shaun Ireland recently claimed, in his campaign video among several from candidates posted on the city’s website, "Not a single City Council member lives in South Austin. Nor in North Austin." In May 2011, we looked at a candidate’s statement that "there’s no one from South Austin on the council," and found that was True. Only one face on the council has changed since then, but what about their current home addresses? Ireland, who himself lives on Manchaca Road in the South Lamar neighborhood of South Austin, told us by email that he pulled council members’ addresses from their personal financial statements filed with the city, and sent us his findings. Meanwhile, in an Austin American-Statesman news story published online May 7, 2012, he narrowed his claim, saying that "no council member lives south of (Lady Bird Lake) or north of 45th Street." We called council members’ city and campaign staff for the most up-to-date information. Ireland’s opponent, Place 6 incumbent and Mayor Pro Tem Sheryl Cole, is one of two council members who live in East Austin -- Cole in Wilshire Woods and Mike Martinez in Senate Hills. Mayor Lee Leffingwell lives in the Highland Park West/Balcones Area neighborhood. Laura Morrison resides in Old West Austin, Chris Riley is downtown and Bill Spelman hails from Hyde Park. The council’s newest member, Kathie Tovo, lives north of the University of Texas in the Heritage neighborhood. All the addresses are north of Lady Bird Lake. Are they all south of 45th Street? This is where Ireland’s claim gets interesting, because 45th Street does not extend across the entire city. It’s not oriented directly east-west, either. But if you drew a line extending 45th Street across the entire city map, Martinez and Leffingwell’s homes would both lie less than a mile north of that line. Ireland told us, "All City Council members live within six miles of each other … none live south of downtown or north of Koenig (Lane) -- magnetic north, true north, or past the 45th street parallel, whichever the case may be. There are no council members that reside in the Arboretum or near Parmer and Metric, or Onion Creek or the ‘Y’ at Oak Hill." Our ruling No council members live in South Austin, as Ireland says, and five council members live south of 45th Street. If that street were extended east and west, though, Leffingwell and Martinez would land north of it, though not by much. We rate Ireland’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00098	Says she’s "leading the fight" to "force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2018/oct/30/martha-mcsally/fact-checking-martha-mcsally-pre-existing-conditio/	U.S. Rep. Martha McSally is promoting herself to Arizonans as someone who’s led the fight to guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions. McSally, a Republican running for the state’s open Senate seat, says in a new ad that she is "leading the fight to secure our border, force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and protect girls and women from sex trafficking." Has McSally, an Air Force veteran, led the fight to "force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions"? That’s not what her voting record shows. McSally in 2015 voted for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, she voted for a repeal and replace bill that health care law experts say undermined the Affordable Care Act. It is the Affordable Care Act that forces insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. McSally is competing against Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who’s also taken credit for protecting Arizonans’ health coverage. (See our fact-checks of Sinema’s claims.) McSally’s voting record McSally has aligned with the Republican Party’s goal of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, the health care bill signed into law by former president Barack Obama. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions (health problems people had before a new coverage started). Insurers also were able to charge higher premiums based on health status. The Affordable Care Act prohibited those practices, effectively forcing companies to insure people with pre-existing conditions. McSally in February 2015 voted for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The bill directed House committees to offer new legislative proposals, including one with a provision to "provide people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage." That bill passed the House, 239-186, but died in the Senate. In May 2017, McSally also voted in favor of the American Health Care Act, a Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. It passed the House, 217-213, but again, failed in the Senate. How would the American Health Care Act affect coverage for pre-existing conditions? McSally and other Republicans say that although they want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, they also want to protect people with pre-existing conditions. McSally’s campaign spokeswoman, Torunn Sinclair, said McSally "played a large role" behind the scenes in the American Health Care Act’s amendment process. "Especially by setting the tone with leadership and other members that pre-existing conditions must be protected," Sinclair said. The American Health Care Act said nothing in it "shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions." But it also allowed states to apply for waivers to certain Affordable Care Act rules. In states with a "community rating" waiver, insurers would have been able to raise premiums, for one year, for people with pre-existing health conditions who did not have coverage for at least 63 straight days the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office in a 2017 analysis said that less-healthy people, including those with pre-existing conditions, would ultimately be unable to buy individual health insurance (policies not tied to an employer) at premiums comparable to those under the Affordable Care Act, "if they could purchase it at all." Additional funding from Upton/Long amendment During the 2017 debate for the American Health Care Act, McSally "successfully negotiated $8 billion in additional funding to bring down insurance costs for people with pre-existing conditions," her campaign said. McSally supported a last-minute measure known as the Upton-Long amendment to help secure enough votes to pass the American Health Care Act in the House. The amendment, offered by Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Billy Long of Missouri, made available $8 billion over five years to states granted a community rating waiver. The funds were intended to help reduce premiums or other out-of-pocket medical expenses for people with pre-existing conditions whose monthly premiums increased because of the waiver. Analyses and news reports at the time said it was uncertain how many states would apply for the waiver; the number would tell how the $8 billion would be allocated. Experts find shortcomings in McSally’s claim Health care law experts say McSally’s claim overlooks protections established by the Affordable Care Act, downplays the impact of the American Health Care Act, and overstates the Upton-Long amendment’s reach. The Republican measures would not have forced insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions — they already had to because of the Affordable Care Act. The American Health Care Act, on the contrary, weakened coverage protections, experts said. "The AHCA’s state waivers would have made it much more expensive and, in some cases, effectively impossible for people with pre-existing conditions to obtain coverage," said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings Institution’s Economic Studies Program. The Upton-Long amendment "did very little to undo those adverse effects," Fiedler said. The amendment could be helpful to some extent, "but offering a moderate level of financial assistance falls well short of ‘forcing’ insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions," said David Gamage, a law professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law. "The bottom line is that the American Health Care Act undermined the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to be able to maintain adequate coverage at affordable price," said Allison K. Hoffman, a law professor at Penn Law School. "And then amendments like the Upton-Long amendment tried to soften the blow of some of these harms." The proposal said nothing in it was to be construed as permitting insurers to limit coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. But experts said that was "vague catch-all language," and that the bill included avenues for states to undermine that coverage. Our ruling McSally claimed she’s "leading the fight" to "force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions." It was the Obama-era Affordable Care Act that forced insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. McSally in 2015 voted in favor of a full repeal of the law. The bill directed House committees to offer new proposals, including one that provided people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage. In 2017, McSally voted for the American Health Care Act, a Republican proposal that kept the Affordable Care Act’s pre-existing conditions coverage. Despite language in the bill to protect people with pre-existing conditions, it included provisions that undermined that coverage and increased premiums for certain people, making insurance unaffordable in some cases, experts said. McSally did support an amendment to help reduce over 5 years increased premiums and out-of-pocket expenses that people with pre-existing conditions might face due to a state waiver allowed in the bill. McSally’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14636	"A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/27/dale-kooyenga/gop-wisconsin-lawmaker-says-federal-government-ref/	On Jan. 20, 2016, two lawmakers appeared on Wisconsin Public Radio’s "Joy Cardin Show" to discuss the State of the State speech given the previous night by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. One of the first topics to emerge was college affordability. State Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, called for state legislation to enable student loan borrowers to refinance their student loans. Refinancing, of course, allows you to get a lower interest rate on an existing loan when interest rates drop. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a Republican from the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield, countered by saying it’s important to find ways to reduce the amount of loans students are amassing. And Kooyenga, an accountant, said he is open to discussing refinancing at the state level. Then, however, Kooyenga stated: "A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government." If they are, then why has there been so much debate -- at both the state and federal levels -- about legislation to allow refinancing? Past fact checks We’ve examined claims about college student loans before. Half True was the rating we gave U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., when she said in 2014 that four-year college students, on average, are graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt. The best data available was mixed on whether the figure was accurate. Mostly False was the rating earned a couple of months later by Wisconsin’s other U.S. senator, Republican Ron Johnson. He had said the affluent are taking advantage of student loans at the expense of middle-class families. In some cases, affluent people get a subsidized loan and, based on repayment programs, some small portion hits the federal government’s general fund. But that’s picked up by all taxpayers, not simply middle-class taxpayers with no ties to college. In that item we described in a nutshell how federal student loans work: The Department of Education budget draws on funds from the U.S. Treasury to shoulder the costs of subsidized loans, grants and the repayment of some loans. When loan payments are collected, those funds are then returned to the Treasury. Student loans generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually for the federal government. Private banks also provide student loans. Now to Kooyenga’s claim. Repayment options Private banks, of course, are free to refinance student loans. The decision is based on a number of factors, including whether the borrower has substantial income. After all, a student loan isn’t like a car loan, where there is a car to serve as collateral. But Kooyenga’s claim is that Uncle Sam refinances a lot of student loans. The federal government does offer consolidation for most student loans. That gives you one monthly payment on one loan, rather than multiple monthly payments on multiple student loans. But you might lose benefits such as principal rebates and end up with a longer payment period, racking up more in principal and interest payments in the process. Student borrowers can also take advantage of different payment plans. For example, lower monthly payments in the first few years after college and higher payments over time. But when it comes refinancing, the federal government doesn’t do it. As PolitiFact Texas found in a 2014 fact check, federal law simply makes no provision for the government to offer such refinancing. The non-profit group American Student Assistance states it flatly: "There is no federal refinancing … you cannot refinance federal or private student loans into a federal loan." Indeed, that’s why Democrats have been pushing legislation to allow federal refinancing. Backers include Baldwin and Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold, who is seeking to win back his U.S. Senate seat from Johnson in 2016, as well as 2016 presidential contenders Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley. In January 2016, Minnesota announced its own refinancing program and U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., announced new legislation that would do the same at the federal level. As for Kooyenga, he told us his "comments were not meant that an individual with student loan debt could approach the federal government and refinance. I was speaking to the fact that beginning in 2008 the federal government began purchasing the loans made by private lenders." So, he was using the term refinancing in a more technical way, even though the context of the discussion was about students refinancing their loans through the government. Our rating Kooyenga said: "A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government." Borrowers can refinance student loans through private banks, though it isn’t necessarily easy and comes with down sides. Democrats have pushed legislation to allow the federal government to offer refinancing, so that student borrowers can get lower interest rates. But that legislation has not been adopted, and the federal government does not do refinancing. Which means Kooyenga’s claim is False.

pomt-14564	"Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-offers-overheated-claim-where-all-r/	Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has been contending that all of his Republican opponents are climate change deniers. The matter came up during the Feb. 4 Democratic debate in New Hampshire when Sanders talked about the way money and influence are leveraged to sway political positions. "Let's talk about climate change," he said. "Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system? That is what goes on in America." Not one Republican recognizes that climate change is real? We decided to look at the positions of the GOP candidates who were in the race when Sanders made his statement. The climate change question has several elements. Some candidates acknowledge that Earth's climate has changed in recent decades but insist that natural forces — not human activity — are responsible. Some acknowledge that humans are playing a significant role in climate change but argue that there's little the United States can do by itself to reverse the global warming trend. Others are pushing for specific proposals to address the issue. So where do the Republican candidates stand? Last August, NPR produced a chart showing how all the candidates viewed the various aspects of the climate question. In addition, we repeatedly emailed all the candidates' campaigns to see if that chart was still accurate and whether there were additional nuances that had surfaced in the intervening six months. We heard from the Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and John Kasich campaigns. Spokespeople for Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump didn't respond. We also checked their campaign websites for updated information on how they felt about the climate change question. On the issue of whether climate has been changing significantly in recent decades, Bush, Christie, Fiorina, Kasich and Rubio say that it has. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich say it's man made. Rubio says it's not. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich have called for some degree of action to combat it. For example, Christie's campaign sent us comments from an April town hall meeting in Exeter, N.H., where the candidate said, "I don’t believe we can do this on our own. We have to have cooperation with the rest of the world. If America changes its behavior and puts up with the economic ramifications that will happen from changing that behavior in the short term, the rest of the world has to engage in it with us." Fiorina's campaign made a similar point, quoting the candidate on CNBC in September as saying that innovation would be the key: "That's how you're going to solve an intractable problem. It's always the way you solve an intractable problem. Not with regulation — with innovation." She made the same point during a Nov. 16 town hall meeting. Bush in July said humans have contributed to climate change. "The climate is changing; I don’t think anybody can argue it’s not," Bush told Bloomberg. "Human activity has contributed to it. I think we have a responsibility to adapt to what the possibilities are without destroying our economy, without hollowing out our industrial core." So clearly, some GOP candidates are not denying the problem at all. During the debate, Sanders referred to "Republicans," not the GOP presidential candidates. But two days earlier, at an event in Keene, N.H., he specifically said, "We do not have one Republican candidate for president acknowledging this (climate change) reality." Even if he was referring to party supporters in general, a 2013 Pew poll found that 23 percent of people who lean Republican say there is solid evidence that Earth is warming and human activity is responsible. And a 2013 bipartisan poll found that 53 percent of Republican voters under age 35 picked either "crazy," "ignorant" or "out of touch" to describe someone who denies that climate change is happening. Since those polls, the evidence for warming has only gotten stronger, with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration saying that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, policy director Warren Gunnels said, "The reality is that none of the Republicans have introduced a plan to solve climate change in a way that would transform our energy system. ... Go look at all of their websites. None of them have a plan." Actually, some of the GOP candidates have posted plans that deal with energy issues, although they don't go in the direction that Sanders and scientists concerned about climate change might like. Bush's website, for example, calls for the repeal or reform of the Carbon Rule, which is President Barack Obama's executive order requiring coal-fired power plants to dramatically reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Rubio wants to get rid of some anti-pollution rules and use the free market, not government regulation, to encourage "environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity." Others say little if anything on the issue. Christie's website seems to be silent on the matter. The "climate change" section of Kasich's website has a video saying that he cares about the environment. Carson's website simply says, "Earth is in a constantly cycle of warming or cooling," Some are downright hostile. Cruz's website belittles climate change activists and calls for an end to the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and all other sources and an end to the "regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles." And Trump's issues page bluntly declares, "Climate change: It is a hoax," a claim worthy of a Pants on Fire. Our ruling Sanders said, "Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real." In fact, we found four GOP presidential candidates who have said it is real, it's man-made, and they have offered support for actions to deal with it. Whether their proposed actions — or the actions proposed by Sanders — are the best way of tackling the problem is a matter for debate. We rate Sanders' assertion as False.

pomt-01164	"A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year" in public assistance in Wisconsin.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/12/glenn-grothman/can-single-mother-wisconsin-easily-get-35000-year-/	Once it became clear that Wisconsin Republican Glenn Grothman would win a U.S. House seat in the November 2014 elections, his penchant for making provocative statements gained national attention. So much so that, after Grothman claimed the seat held for 35 years by Tom Petri, we decided to publish an In Context article fleshing out five of his most biting sound bites. It quickly became one of our most popular items of the year. But while those statements were more opinion than fact, Grothman has also taken his turn on our Truth-O-Meter. He earned a True, for example, for saying a study showed that children who lived with a biological parent and the parent’s partner were 20 times more likely to be sexually abused. On Nov. 30, 2014, the congressman-elect made another statement that made us stop and say, "Really?" In an interview on "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a statewide public affairs show on WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Grothman said welfare reform would be one of his priorities in Washington. Saying the first step is to educate people about benefits, he declared: "A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year in total benefits between the healthcare and the earned income credit and the FoodShare and the low-income housing and what-have-you." Grothman went on to say that amount is a "bribe not to work that hard or a bribe not to marry somebody with a full-time job." We wondered how easy it is for a single parent in Wisconsin to get $35,000 a year in state and federal benefits. Grothman’s evidence Grothman based his claim on a September 2012 memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau is a well-respected nonpartisan scorekeeper of state budget matters. But it’s important to note this memo responded to a specific request Grothman made in his capacity as a state senator, rather than something the bureau produced on its own. Lawmakers often make requests of the bureau, but the way they tailor their requests can limit the bureau's analysis. Indeed, the memo was titled: "Value of (state and federal) public assistance and student financial aid benefits and tax credits available to two hypothetical families." Both hypothetical families rented a three-bedroom apartment in West Bend (the Milwaukee suburb where Grothman then lived), had two children -- ages 3 and 7 -- and had no health insurance through an employer. The difference was that one hypothetical family was a single parent working part-time, earning $10,000 per year, and going to technical college full-time. The other example was a married couple. One parent worked full-time and the other worked part-time while attending technical college full-time. They earned $50,000 per year. When the Washington Post Fact Checker checked Grothman’s claim, it said Grothman based his $35,000 figure on what the memo estimated the single parent could potentially receive in two categories: public assistance and tax benefits. That is, more than $29,000 in public assistance -- including child care subsidies, rent assistance and food stamps -- and more than $5,000 in tax credits. When we spoke to Grothman, he cited different tallies from the memo. In addition to public assistance and tax benefits, the memo also did calculations in two more categories: student aid for the parent attending technical college and BadgerCare health care benefits. The grand totals for all four categories of benefits were vastly different. Roughly $47,000 for the single mother (again, public assistance being the largest category). And roughly $8,000 for the married couple (from student aid and health benefits, no public assistance). Although the difference between the two grand totals is about $39,000, Grothman said he claimed $35,000 just to give himself a "cushion." And he said the intent of his claim was to highlight what he called the "marriage penalty" -- lower benefits for a married couple versus a single parent. Regardless of how Grothman explained the figure to the Fact Checker and to us, either way, there are problems with his characterization of the $35,000. Understanding the figure As the Fact Checker pointed out: "It’s easy to pick and choose what would make up a person’s ‘welfare package,’ and tack a number to it. This is essentially what Grothman did" in requesting the memo. The Fact Checker gave Grothman "two Pinocchios," the second-lowest of their five ratings, for a claim that contains "significant omissions and/or exaggerations." Grothman argued to us that his examples weren’t cherry picked -- that a single parent with two children is common, and so are the vast majority of benefits the single parent could receive, including child care, health care and food stamps. But in its memo, the fiscal bureau was careful to say "no data exist on the number of households that may actually be receiving the combination of tax and program benefits" listed for the hypothetical families. The memo added: "Although the number of families who would qualify for all of the benefits described in this memorandum is unknown, it is likely to be quite small relative to the state’s overall population." One other point: Grothman made his claim in the context of reducing "welfare" benefits. But while some of the assistance he cites, such as food stamps, might commonly be considered to be welfare, other benefits -- including tax credits and student aid -- are not. Our rating Grothman said: "A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year" in public assistance in Wisconsin. On one level, Grothman is using a common example in terms of a single parent with two children, but his use of the word "easily" goes too far. The very analysis he cites as evidence concludes that only a small percentage of Wisconsin residents would qualify for all of the various child care subsidies, housing aid, food stamps and tax benefits that Grothman cites. Our rating is Mostly False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2014-12-12T13:47:30	2014-11-30	['Wisconsin']
pomt-07422	"Each day our nation pays communist China $73.9 million in interest on our debt."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/26/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-says-us-pays-china-739-million-day-de/	When Rep. J. Randy Forbes voted against the budget compromise between President Barack Obama and Republican leaders earlier this month, he said the measure did not do enough to cut the nation’s debt. Forbes, R-4th, said failure to address the nation’s borrowing weakens the United States and strengthens China, the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt. The representative is chairman of the Congressional China Caucus and often discusses that nation’s growing military power. "Each day our nation pays communist China $73.9 million in interest on our debt, money that is allowing them to aggressively modernize their military and increase their global influence," Forbes said in an April 14 press release. Forbes’ number -- $73.9 million a day in interest payments to China -- left our heads spinning. We set out to see if it was right. First, a little background. The total federal debt, as of April 22, was $14.29 trillion. Of that amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government. That includes China and other foreign nations. The remaining debt -- about $4.64 trillion -- is held by the Federal Financing Bank, U.S. government trust funds, and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that endows Social Security. Our discussion and calculations for this fact check, as well as Forbes’, are based on the public debt. China buys U.S. Treasury bonds in public auctions, the same way other nations and investment companies purchase our debt. The Treasury Department said that as of February 2011, China, along with Chinese companies and investment groups, held $1.15 trillion in U.S. debt. Japan was the second-largest foreign holder, at $890.3 billion, with Great Britain third at $295.5 billion. In total, about $3.16 trillion of the U.S. public debt, or 33 percent, is held overseas. The rest is owned by Americans. Because American debt has long been considered one of the safest investments in the world, the government can borrow money at very low costs, paying less than 2 percent average annual interest on its debt during the past decade. In fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30, the federal government spent $197 billion on interest payments for public debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If we divide that by 365 days, we reach an average daily interest payment of $539,726,027. Because the Treasury doesn’t make payments on weekends or holidays, and because debt payments vary depending on when a Treasury note was issued, the actual daily number was probably never that exact amount. On Sept. 30, 2010, China held about 12.8 percent of the U.S. public debt. If we assume China got 12.8 percent of our interest payments, it would have received roughly $68.9 million per day during fiscal 2010. Forbes based his comments on fiscal 2011, in which the CBO estimates the government will spend $225 billion, or $616,438,356 per day, on interest payments. China held 12.1 percent of public debt at the end of February. So if the 2011 estimates hold and China holds the same proportion of debt throughout the year, it would receive about $74.4 million per day. Forbes made his calculations with the March 16 public debt figures. That explains the $500,000 difference between his calculation and ours. We don’t know the exact mix of debt held by China. If the debt owned there is primarily short-term bonds, then the interest rates would be lower. If China mostly holds 10-year or 30-year bonds, it would stand to receive higher payments. Our calculations, and those by Forbes, assume China’s debt holdings mirror the larger pool of U.S. debt. Let’s review: Rep. Randy Forbes says the United States pays $73.9 million per day in interest to China. He based his statistic on the percentage of U.S. debt held by China and the CBO’s estimate of how much we will spend on interest payments during the 2011 fiscal year. We looked into the numbers and discovered that based on CBO and Treasury Department data, China likely received about $68.9 million per day during the 2010 fiscal year. Based on the nation’s February holdings and the CBO data, China should receive about $74.4 million per day in payments during the current fiscal year. Forbes got the numbers right. We rate his statement True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2011-04-26T06:00:00	2011-04-14	['China']
pomt-00513	Says Scott Walker "said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.'"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/24/naral-pro-choice/did-scott-walker-say-forced-vaginal-ultrasounds-ar/	The nation’s oldest abortion rights advocacy group attacked Gov. Scott Walker and his presidential aspirations on June 18, 2015 with a TV ad called "Crazy Ideas." In it, NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, made a claim about comments Walker made about abortion and transvaginal ultrasounds. Walker, according to the group, "said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.' " Let’s see if that’s what he said. Forced ultrasound law The ad, which NARAL said would run statewide in Iowa and New Hampshire for a week, begins with a narrator saying: "Scott Walker talks and talks about abortion. He said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was..."; then, to finish the sentence, an audio clip is inserted with Walker saying: "just a cool thing." The reference is to a law Walker signed in July 2013. It requires an ultrasound before getting an abortion. But the woman can choose to receive the ultrasound transabdominally, which is done externally; or transvaginally, which is what NARAL refers to as invasive. (For some women, though -- in cases of early pregnancy or morbid obesity, for example -- the transvaginal procedure may in effect be required because it is medically necessary.) ‘Cool thing’ The audio clip used in the ad is from an interview Walker did May 22, 2015 with Dana Loesch, a conservative radio talk show host in Dallas. About halfway into a 30-minute interview, there was this exchange about ultrasounds: Loesch: What place do social issues have in 2016 and why do you think so many Republican candidates are scared of them -- are scared to embrace them; they're scared to get trapped by the media? Walker: Well, I think a little bit of it is the media is a gotcha; some do at least, I don't want to say universally. But I think that -- Loesch: Oh, most of them do. Walker: Yeah. I mean, well, I'll give you an example. I'm pro-life, I've passed pro-life legislation. We defunded Planned Parenthood, we signed a law that requires an ultrasound -- which, the thing about that -- the media tried to make that sound like that was a crazy idea. Most people I talk to, whether they're pro-life or not -- I find people all the time who'll get out their iPhone and show me a picture of their grandkids' ultrasound and how excited they are; so that's a lovely thing. I think about, my sons are 19 and 20 -- you know we still have their first ultrasound picture. It's just a cool thing out there. We just knew, if we signed that law, if we provided the information, that more people, if they saw that unborn child, would make a decision to protect and keep the life of that unborn child. Walker’s comments led to some contrasting news reports. For example, the headline in the Washington Post was: "Scott Walker, discussing abortion, says ultrasounds are ‘just a cool thing out there.’" But the headline in the Huffington Post was: "Scott Walker defends mandatory ultrasounds: they’re a ‘cool thing.’" Walker did defend mandatory ultrasounds. But what he called cool was the ultrasound technology, not forcing women to get transvaginal ultrasounds. Our rating NARAL Pro-Choice America says that Walker "said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.'" Walker did defend the law he signed requiring an ultrasound in order to get an abortion. But the "cool" reference wasn’t to forcing some women to get vaginal ultrasounds, but rather to the ultrasound technology that produces images from the womb. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-10530	Obama "only wants your children to have health insurance."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/29/hillary-clinton/his-plan-includes-adults/	Sen. Hillary Clinton made a strong new charge against Sen. Barack Obama on Feb. 28, 2008, suggesting that he doesn't care about the health needs of adults. "I want ... each and every member of the family to have health insurance," she said at a campaign event in Hanging Rock, Ohio. "My opponent only wants your children to have health insurance. I don't think that's smart." There's been lots of discussion about the differences in the candidates' health plans, and there are uncertainties about cost estimates and whether the plans could achieve universal coverage. (We have explored the health plans in detail in this article and in previous Truth-O-Meter items on Obama's claim that Clinton would force people to buy insurance even if they can't afford it and on Clinton's claim that Obama's plan would leave out 15-million people). But with her new claim, Sen. Clinton makes her strongest attack yet, suggesting that Obama is ignoring the needs of everyone except children. We find that is not an accurate description of Obama's plan. When PolitiFact asked the Clinton campaign about her comment, spokesman Mo Elleithee said Clinton was referring to the major difference between their plans: She would require everyone to purchase insurance (a mandate that has been likened to state requirements that drivers buy car insurance), while Obama only requires parents buy insurance for their children. Clinton says the mandate is the best way to achieve universal coverage. But Obama says it could penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all his reforms are implemented, people would still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't, he contends. We won't go into all the details of Obama's plan, but it includes several elements that apply to adults: • It would expand Medicaid, the federal program that provides health coverage for the poor. • It would provide income-related subsidies to help people who don't qualify for Medicaid but still need financial help to buy coverage. • It would require employers to provide health insurance for their workers, or contribute to the cost of the insurance. If Clinton had said that Obama's plan "does not mandate insurance for adults," she would have been on solid ground. But she didn't and, given that Obama's plan has elements to expand coverage for adults, it is simply wrong to say he " only wants your children to have health insurance." We find her statement to be False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-02-29T00:00:00	2008-02-28	['None']
pomt-03140	On support for a military strike on Syria	half flip	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/13/johnny-isakson/did-senator-change-course-syria-position/	Did U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson support a military strike against Syria and then reverse course this week? Isakson, a Republican from Cobb County, issued a written statement Aug. 31 in which he stated, "I support the use of military action in Syria." But just over a week later, on Monday, Isakson issued this written statement: "I have decided that I will vote against the resolution to authorize a U.S. military strike in Syria." Did Isakson flip-flop his position in the rapidly evolving Syrian crisis? Or is something more politically nuanced going on here? PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig a little deeper. We invite you to visit our Facebook page and tell us what you think about our digging and whether you agree with our analysis. Isakson’s most recent statement was debated in the conservative blogosphere, with some saying he had completely changed his stance. We contacted Isakson’s office about his statements on Syria. His spokeswoman, Lauren Culbertson, said the senator had previously been undecided about his support for President Barack Obama’s resolution to use force against Syria. Culbertson said Isakson’s statement supporting military action came before the president unveiled his resolution. "Senator Isakson could not support a mission that was so ill-defined," Culbertson told us. Indeed, for days afterward, Isakson seemed hesitant to support the resolution. The senator’s full statement on Monday, said: "After carefully weighing this very important issue, I have decided that I will vote against the resolution to authorize a U.S. military strike in Syria. Over the past week, I have traveled my state and have talked personally to hundreds of Georgians. Thousands more constituents have contacted my office by phone and email. It is clear to me that Georgians overwhelmingly oppose our country getting involved militarily in Syria. The administration’s lack of a clear strategy is troubling, and the potential fallout following a military strike is also troubling." Here’s what Isakson said Aug. 31. "It is appropriate for the president to seek authorization from Congress, although I wish he would have called us back to vote on this immediately rather than waiting until Sept. 9. I support the use of military action in Syria. If we fail to take strong action against Syria for this horrendous attack, then we are sending a signal to Syria as well as to Iran and North Korea that they are accountable to no one." The senator’s initial statement came the same day Obama announced he would seek congressional approval for military action against Syria. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the following day that Isakson and Georgia’s other U.S. senator, Saxby Chambliss, backed military intervention in Syria. Chambliss is undecided on whether he will vote for the congressional resolution. (At press time, Chambliss was the lone member of Georgia’s congressional delegation supporting some sort of intervention. U.S. Reps. John Barrow and Sanford Bishop had not clarified their positions.) Between those two statements, the AJC reported that Isakson wanted a clear strategy from the Obama administration. "There's no question the Syrians crossed the red line the president drew, " Isakson told the AJC in a Sept. 3 phone interview. "And I think when you draw lines, when you don't enforce those lines you become a paper tiger. But I'm not going to blindly give this president a blank check given the commitment he's shown in the past two weeks and what appears to be a lack of a strategy. I want to be part of the debate." During an interview Tuesday with Channel 2 Action News, Isakson reinforced his reluctance to vote for a resolution authorizing military action. When asked whether he stood by comments from Aug. 31 that he supported the use of military action in Syria, Isakson said: "I support that if it was actionable and meaningful and if it sent the right signal to North Korea and Iran. … If in the total context, yes. This one, in my opinion, did not do that." "Is this a change of heart?" Isakson was asked. "No," he answered. "Is this a change of mind?" the interviewer asked. "No," Isakson replied. Some bloggers had a different interpretation. Jason Pye, a prominent Georgia libertarian, believes the senator has changed course. "In his press statement on August 31, Isakson said in no uncertain terms that he supported the use of military action in Syria, making the case that failure to respond would send a signal to the United States' enemies that they are accountable to no one," said Pye, who opposes the strikes. "The lack of strategy from the Obama administration may now be a concern for the senator, but he didn't initially seem to have a problem with that." "If this isn’t a flip-flop, I don’t know what is," Pye said. Political science professor Kerwin Swint disagreed. "Under the circumstances, I think it’s hard to blame him for waiting to see how it all plays out," said Swint, who teaches at Kennesaw State University in Isakson’s home county. "It’s a unique situation especially because so many legislators around the country are revising their positions on this in light of the changing circumstances. It’s just a weird kind of story." Culbertson directed us to recent AJC articles and other comments the senator has made on the subject, including a CNN interview Monday in which Isakson said "this is about the plan and the strategy that has been proposed to us." We wondered whether Isakson still supports military action. Culberston told us via email that Isakson hopes for a diplomatic resolution, but if that fails, "he will reassess at that time. This is a fast-moving situation that is changing every day." So where does all of this leave us? Isakson’s position is that he initially supported the use of military action against Syria. But that was before Obama’s resolution outlined his administration’s plan for what that entailed. Isakson had reservations about the proposal, and he decided to oppose the White House resolution seeking congressional authorization for military strikes. Isakson has altered his initial hard-line position on a military strike against Syria, putting additional conditions on any such attack. He initially backed a strike without stating any reservations.

pomt-05908	AIDS was transmitted to humans because "one guy" had sex with "a monkey" and then started "having sex with men."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/03/stacey-campfield/knoxville-republican-says-aids-came-man-having-sex/	Of the many controversial claims state Sen. Stacey Campfield, R-Knoxville, made in an interview on satellite radio last week with a gay-rights advocate, none was more sensational than his assertion that AIDS in humans came from "one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men." This came about 12 minutes into an interview that ostensibly was about a bill Campfield has championed declaring that only sexuality involving "natural human reproduction" can be addressed in the state’s K-8 public-school classrooms. Campfield calls it a "Don’t Teach Gay" bill, but it’s been more commonly called the "Don’t Say Gay" bill. Critics say it could open the door to allowing anti-gay bullying and harassment and potentially prevent teachers and administrators from helping students properly deal with sexuality issues. We’re working on a separate article to post on Sunday that will cover many of the other claims made by Campfield, who also serves as Tennessee campaign co-director for Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign. This item will explore Campfield's specific claim about AIDS entering the human population because "one guy" had sex with a monkey and then had sex with men. Here's the pertinent exchange for this fact check: CAMPFIELD: Most people realize that AIDS came from the homosexual community. SIGNORILE: No, it did not. Do you know the history of AIDS? CAMPFIELD: It was one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men. SIGNORILE: No, it was not one guy screwing a monkey. It was somebody in Africa. Do you know the history of AIDS? Because I can tell you in a minute? It was somebody in Africa who actually killed a monkey, because they eat the meat of many animals, as I’m sure you do, I’m sure you eat the meat of animals. And they ate the meat of a monkey and the blood, they chopped it up, and it got in a cut and that’s how AIDS then spread among heterosexuals all through Africa, and it is a pandemic around the world. In the days since the interview, Campfield has done other interviews and put up posts on his blog, adding some caveats and qualifiers to some of his claims. But in his blog posts, one of which he titled "More fun than a barrel of monkeys," Campfield stuck by his claim of cross-species simian-human sex as the origin of AIDS. He wrote: "The research on sex with a monkey being the first transmitter of AIDS has not been proven nor firmly dis proven (sic). It is one of about 5 theories I was able to find on the source of AIDS." We figured that because the legendary "Scopes Monkey Trial" happened in our fair state -- about 80 miles southwest of Knoxville -- PolitiFact Tennessee should examine this theory of evolution. Consequence of hunting Signorile had recently interviewed infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist Dr. Jacques Pepin, author of the recently published book, The Origin of AIDS, and Signorile accurately characterized Pepin’s research. Pepin gave PolitiFact Tennessee an even more precise account. Pepin’s research, which relies on meticulous peer-reviewed studies that include DNA evidence going back decades, concludes that HIV in humans originated in Central Africa, likely sometime in 1921, from a hunter who was exposed to contaminated blood from an ape -- perhaps a chimpanzee -- that was killed for food. A slow dissemination through Africa followed, Pepin said, through heterosexual transmission, needle injections and blood transfusions. It stayed at a "low level," he says, until 1966 or 1967 when it "was exported to Haiti" and "from there to the United States, probably at the beginning of the 1970s." Pepin agrees with Campfield on one point: that its spread in North America accelerated through infections transmitted in unprotected sex among gay men. Apes, not monkeys We also talked to Beatrice Hahn, a former longtime University of Alabama-Birmingham professor of medicine and microbiology now at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a 2010 research paper, "Origin of HIV and AIDS Pandemic." She clued us into a key distinction -- a monkey is not an ape and an ape is not a monkey. But they are both simians, the animal classification for what are known as "higher primates." She has concluded that the form of HIV most prevalent around the world, known as HIV-1 Group M, originated in chimpanzees -- and chimps are considered apes, not monkeys. Figure 1 in her paper, which cites studies from 150 research papers and was written with Penn colleague Paul Sharp (formerly of University of Edinburgh) features pictures of 10 kinds of simians and has arrows showing how SIV -- "simian immuno deficiency virus" -- made a path to humans in two major forms, HIV-1 and HIV-2. Hahn said HIV-1, the most common AIDS virus, has been documented to have emerged following "four independent transmissions of ape viruses -- not monkey viruses." A second human AIDS virus that is largely restricted to West Africa is called HIV-2, and it is declining and being replaced by HIV-1, according to the paper. That less prevalent form has been traced to a monkey called the Sooty mangabey. Hahn says the mostly likely way that the simian precursors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 entered the human population was from bushmeat hunters who killed simians for their meat. Pepin and other researchers have written the same thing, and we found no serious academic papers mentioning simian-human sex as a possible transmission route. "Human infection," wrote Martine Peeters of the retrovirus laboratory of the Institute of Research for Development in Montpelier, France, "is thought to have resulted from cutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to infected blood during the hunting and butchering of chimpanzees and Sooty mangabeys for food. Bites from pet animals and possibly contact with fecal and urine samples may have also been involved." Pepin’s book covers the same territory in great detail and cites many studies. Hahn has appeared on panels with renowned primatologist Jane Goodall to discuss the dangers bushmeat hunting poses. Not only does it endanger species of simians like chimpanzees, there is concern the practice could some day lead to other simian viruses getting passed to humans to create a new pandemic. Scientists remain unsure why SIV does not lead to AIDS in some simians, while HIV causes a deadly condition in humans. Our ruling Campfield is unable to provide any convincing evidence to back up his claim and we could find none. The overwhelming scientific research shows Campfield is wrong. Experts believe HIV entered the human population through so-called "bushmeat" hunting, and, furthermore, that the predominant HIV-1 form has never been shown to be transmitted directly from monkeys to humans. Hahn emphasized, too, that there is zero evidence to support the cross-species sex Campfield proposes: "It surely wasn’t transmitted through sexual activity (with simians)."

pomt-13000	"California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world. If you add the GDP’s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/dec/15/antonio-villaraigosa/villaraigosa-claims-california-oregon-washington-p/	Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles and 2018 Democratic candidate for California governor, recently called for the state to unite with like-minded cities and states on the West Coast to oppose "dangerous policies advanced by a Trump administration." California’s large economy, Villaraigosa said in a Dec. 8, 2016 op-ed in the Sacramento Bee, gives it leverage in any possible showdown. In making this call, Villaraigosa repeated a favorite claim by California politicians that the state’s economy ranks as the sixth largest in the world -- a claim PolitiFact California rated Mostly True in July. He then took the economic comparison further -- all the way to the Pacific Northwest. "California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world," Villaraigosa said. "If you add the GDP’s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world." "That’s power – power we must use to protect our people against any dangerous policies advanced by a Trump administration," he added. We decided to fact-check the part of Villaraigosa’s claim that if the GDPs of California, Washington and Oregon were somehow combined, they’d represent the fifth largest economy on the planet, ahead of the United Kingdom. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is used to measure the health of a country’s or state’s economy. It’s the total value of all goods and services. Our research A campaign spokeswoman for Villaraigosa pointed us to 2015 GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund. We used the same data in July to verify that California, with a GDP of nearly $2.5 trillion, had the sixth-largest economy behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. California Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration released GDP figures in June showing the state had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom. In our July fact check, we noted that when adjusted for California’s very high cost of living, the state’s GDP drops several places. This led us to our Mostly True rating for the claim, which we define as "accurate but needs clarification or additional information." To come up with a combined GDP for three West Coast states, we added California’s nearly $2.5 trillion to Oregon’s $217 billion and Washington’s $445 billion, using 2015 figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Together, their GDPs add up to $3.1 trillion. This hypothetical West Coast powerhouse economy would be larger than the United Kingdom’s $2.8 trillion GDP. Villaraigosa’s claim, however, needs the same disclaimer about high cost of living. California, Oregon and Washington are all expensive places to live. We realize Villaraigosa’s comparison is hypothetical -- and it looks like he got his numbers right. But to do this, he creates a fictional California economy that magically annexes the GDPs of two nearby states. Our ruling Antonio Villaraigosa recently said: "California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world. If you add the GDP’s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world." We rated the first portion of this claim Mostly True in a separate fact check in July. We crunched the numbers on the second part of Villaraigosa’s claim, about a combined and hypothetical California-Oregon-Washington economy. At $3.1 trillion, it would surpass the United Kingdom’s $2.8 trillion GDP and would rank fifth in the world. It’s important to note that some economists factor in cost-of-living when assessing a state’s or country’s GDP. Expenses are high in all three states, which means this mega-economy could be knocked down a few spots in the rankings. The former mayor’s statement needs this clarification. Overall, we rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b83a74d-fde6-48d9-9c72-c93824f92b4e	None	Antonio Villaraigosa	None	None	None	2016-12-15T06:00:00	2016-12-08	['California', 'Oregon', 'United_Kingdom', 'Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-09183	"A Houston school district analysis found that the (State Board of Education) more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/02/kathy-miller/miller-state-board-education-more-quadrupled-numbe/	The state's social studies curriculum standards fell under the microscope this year as members of the State Board of Education squabbled over what should be taught to Texas students. In a May 18 opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman -- before the board gave final approval to revised standards May 21 -- Kathy Miller of the Texas Freedom Network, which bills itself as a watchdog group that monitors "far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders," wrote: "Teachers despair that the standards, rather than simply identifying major concepts students should master, are far too long and detailed. For example, a Houston school district analysis found that the board more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about." That sounds like a lot of names and dates to remember. We decided to look it up. In response to our inquiry, Dan Quinn, the network's communications director, pointed us to an entry on School Zone, the Houston Chronicle's education blog, reporting that the Houston school district's social studies curriculum managers had expressed concerns about some proposed changes to the standards during an April 29 district school board meeting. According to the post, the managers, Angela Miller and Michael Dorsey, said the proposed standards contained "262 historical figures that students must learn about from elementary through high school," compared with the current count of "60 people." That's more than four times as many as now. But there's a hitch. The numbers in the Houston school district analysis differ from those reported in the Houston Chronicle blog. The actual counts are 64 required historical figures under the current standards and 252 under the proposed ones -- four names short of a quadrupling. At the time of the Houston analysis, the proposed standards included changes the state education board had already made to recommendations from board-appointed "writing groups" made up largely of teachers. (The new standards are set to be implemented in 2011-12, and classroom materials and tests based on the standards are scheduled to take effect in 2012-13.) In a document prepared for the Houston school board, Angela Miller and Dorsey said they were concerned about the growth in the "number of people who are now required topics of instruction" primarily because "teachers have fewer opportunities to tailor their instruction to address the needs and interests of their students and communities. And, two, the effort to create a 'balanced' list of required individuals inevitably results in very long lists of names as each constituency advocates the inclusion of individuals representative of their interests." In her Statesman article, Kathy Miller followed up: "Historians have warned that such a 'laundry list' approach ... is a lazy and ineffective way to teach and sets up our schools -- and our children -- to fail as they struggle through a blizzard of names and facts." A little background: There are two ways to figure out how many historical figures the curriculum standards require that students be taught. You can read the standards and count the individuals who are named. Or, you can consult the lists of names that the Texas Education Agency has created for both the current and proposed requirements. Some names appear more than once on the lists -- and are counted each time -- because they are studied in more than one grade. At the time the Houston analysis was done, the proposed standards specified more than 40 names more than once. For example, economist Adam Smith was to be taught in both high school economics and world history classes. Houston officials used the first method, making their own grade-by-grade comparison -- between the current standards and the proposed ones -- of the number of historical figures that must be taught in kindergarten through eighth grade, as well as for mandatory high school social studies classes: world geography, world history, U.S. history, government and economics. To tally historical figures that students must be taught now, Angela Miller said, she and a colleague combed the current standards, adopted in 1997. For the proposed standards, Miller said, she relied on the list of names produced by the education agency; it reflected all the changes made to the proposals by the state board through March 2010. For comparison, we consulted the education agency's lists of required historical figures in the current and proposed standards. (To ensure a valid comparison, we removed any names that were part of the curriculum standards for psychology and sociology courses; those classes are electives and were not included in the Houston school district's analysis.) Our counts differed slightly from the Houston district's: 71 now vs. 250 in the proposed standards, 34 names short of a quadrupling. Angela Miller told us that she and her colleague could have erred as they perused the current standards. We also found that a difference in interpreting some objectives in the standards may explain variations in the counts. For example, the TEA list of required historical figures in the high school world history curriculum contains three names: Hammurabi, Emperor Justinian I and John Locke. All three come from this objective in the current standards: "The student is expected to identify the impact of political and legal ideas contained in significant historic documents, including Hammurabi's Code, Justinian's Code of Laws, Magna Carta, John Locke's Two Treatises of Government, and the Declaration of Independence." Angela Miller said the three names were not included in the Houston school district's analysis because knowledge of the document, not the individual, is what is required of the students. Bluntly, counting the figures required to be taught in social studies classes is not a perfect science. And there's a postscript: The proposed curriculum standards changed again when the State Board of Education met in May -- after Kathy Miller's opinion piece ran in the Statesman. Monica Martinez, TEA's managing director of the curriculum division, said that short of watching the videos of the two days of 15-hour meetings during which the state board worked on those changes, we would have to wait for the agency to release updated documents to determine the final number of historical figures that must be taught. She said the agency hoped to have those ready later this month. Based on changes made during the first day alone, indications are the total will drop from what it was when Miller made her statement. Summing up: Kathy Miller leaned on a news report quoting research by the Houston school district. Unfortunately, the blog had the wrong numbers, overstating the number of historical figures required to be taught under the proposed standards being considered at the time. That led Miller to overstate the facts in claiming that the State Board of Education "more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about." Had she relied on the original research, which was linked directly to the Chronicle blog, Miller wouldn't have goofed making her point. The changes made by the state board up to that point meant students were going to have to study a lot more historical figures than they do now -- but it's less than four times as many.

pomt-07386	"We don't have bridges being built" in the United States.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/03/donald-trump/trump-said-us-doesnt-build-bridges-anymore/	Now that President Barack Obama has released his original Certificate of Birth, Donald Trump wants to talk about other things. Like bridges. More specifically, that the United States isn't building them any more, while China is. It has become a regular talking point for the real estate mogul/potential Republican presidential candidate in recent press appearances. Here are a couple examples: "We are rebuilding China. I don't know if you know it. They're building bridges. They're building airports. They're building cities, brand-new cities. When was the last time you saw a bridge being built in the United States? We don't have bridges being built. We have bridges that are falling down." - Trump on CNN's State of the Union on April 17, 2011. "When was the last time – if you go to China, as an example – bridges being built, massive bridges. When is the last time we built a bridge in this country, other than a little toy." - Trump at a press conference in New Hampshire on April 27, 2011. Is the United States no longer in the bridge building game? We contacted the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration to get data on federal spending on bridges over the last decade. The press office prepared a report on funds obligated for highway bridge replacement, rehabilitation and maintenance for the fiscal years 2001 through 2010. The report shows a steady upward trend in federal spending (in other words, not including state and local bridge funding): from $4.8 billion in 2001; to $6.8 billion in 2008; and then jumping to $9.4 billion and $8.5 billion in 2009 and 2010 as a result of an influx of money from the economic stimulus package. It's not that the U.S. isn't spending more on bridges, said Jeffrey Solsby, a spokesman for the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. It's that it isn't nearly enough to keep pace. Over the last 30 years, the number of cars and miles driven has doubled, he said, yet the amount of road and bridge capacity has increased just 7 percent. "We didn't build it, and they came anyway," Solsby said. According to an April 28, 2011, story in The Economist, America is lagging behind most of the rest of the industrialized world in terms of investment in infrastructure such as bridges. "Total public spending on transport and water infrastructure has fallen steadily since the 1960s and now stands at 2.4 percent of GDP," the story notes. "Europe, by contrast, invests 5 percent of GDP in its infrastructure, while China is racing into the future at 9 percent. America’s spending as a share of GDP has not come close to European levels for over 50 years. Over that time funds for both capital investments and operations and maintenance have steadily dropped." Moreover, the article notes, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that "America needs to spend $20 billion more a year just to maintain its infrastructure at the present, inadequate, levels." And that's doesn't include building new bridges. In its "2010 Bridge Inventory" report, Better Roads Magazine analyzed the state of the nation's more than 600,000 bridges and concluded that a "worryingly high" number of them are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Politicians on both sides of the aisle acknowledge the problem, Solsby said. The dilemma is how to pay for it. States are financially strapped as a result of the recession. Federal dollars are stretched, too. The ARTBA would like to see an increase in the gasoline tax to fund more bridges, Solby said, but with gas prices soaring, "Is that politically palatable?" "From one perspective, he (Trump) is right," Solsby said. "Everyone else on the planet realizes infrastructure investments are a major shot of adrenaline for an economy. But it's not like we are not building bridges. We are. It's just slow." Bridge experts we spoke with rattled off a number of major bridges recently completed or well underway. Among them: * The Hoover Dam bypass bridge, which opened October, 2010. The New York Times called it "an engineering marvel and an acrophobe's nightmare." The 1,900-foot-long bridge over the Colorado River gorge, connecting Arizona and Nevada, is the the seventh-highest bridge in the world and the longest single-span concrete arch bridge in the Western hemisphere. In other words, not just a "little toy." * The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, a "major seismic retrofit" with a total project length of 8.4 miles. Cost of the East Span alone is estimated at nearly $5.5 billion. It is projected to open in both directions in 2013. * The replacement 1.1-mile Woodrow Wilson Bridge across the Potomac River, connecting Maryland and Virginia, which was completed in 2008 with a capacity for 295,000 vehicles a day. * The I-35W bridge over Mississippi River in Minneapolis, replacing the bridge that tragically collapsed in August 2007, claiming 13 lives. A new, 10-lane replacement bridge opened -- at a cost of $234 million -- just over a year later. * The Willis Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River connecting Manhattan and the Bronx in New York City. Completed last summer at a cost of $614 million, the 2,400-ton bridge span was shipped 136 miles via two barges. This is by no means an exhaustive list, just a sampling. Which is all to say: the U.S. is still in the bridge-building business. So Trump has overreached with his claims. But allowing for the possibility that Trump was exercising a bit of hyperbole to make a point about needing to prioritize infrastructure investment for things like new bridges -- an issue that data suggests is a valid and pressing concern -- we rate Trump's statement Half True.

pomt-01898	"A salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception … is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-hobby-lobby-salesclerk-not-go/	By now, lots of major political figures have weighed in on the decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, a landmark Supreme Court case. A 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. One of the most closely watched responses was by Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State who is the presumptive frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton addressed the case during a question-and-answer session at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. Clinton blasted the decision as "deeply disturbing." "It’s very troubling that a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception, which is pretty expensive, is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception," Clinton said. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed this claim and gave it Two Pinocchios, out of a maximum of four. We thought we’d take our own look. First, some background. The company’s owners say they object to four out of the 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception -- the four that prevent implantation of the embryo. These include two forms of "emergency contraception," sometimes called the "morning-after pill," and two forms of intra-uterine devices, or IUDs. (Officially, the FDA considers these four methods to be "contraception," but the company’s Christian owners consider them to be a form of abortion.) According to the Wall Street Journal, the company actually supported all 20 forms of contraception until 2012, when the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty informed Hobby Lobby about the Affordable Care Act’s contraception requirement. Owner David Green told the Journal that he was "shocked" at the discovery. He proceeded to revoke the coverage and file the suit that was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court on June 30, 2014. Contrary to Clinton’s claim, Hobby Lobby’s website says the company does in fact support the other 16 forms of contraception. Here are some excerpts from its Frequently Asked Questions page: Q: Is Hobby Lobby preventing its employees from buying contraceptives under its plan? A: Not at all. The Greens (the family that owns the company) and their family businesses respect the individual liberties of all their employees. The Greens and their family businesses have no objection to the other 16 FDA-approved contraceptives required by the law that do not interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg. They provide coverage for such contraceptives under their health care plan. Additionally, the four objectionable drugs and devices are widely available and affordable, and employees are free to obtain them. Q: But isn’t Hobby Lobby depriving its women employees of health care? A: Just the opposite: the Greens and their family businesses, including Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., offer their employees – nearly 70 percent of whom are women – a robust benefit plan that includes coverage for preventive care and almost all of the contraceptives required under the Affordable Care Act. That plan includes an on-site clinic with no co-pay at Hobby Lobby headquarters, and all full-time employees are eligible to enroll in a generous benefit plan: including medical, dental, prescription drugs, along with long-term disability and life insurance, and a 401(k) plan with a generous company match. For the record, the 16 contraceptives the company supports, according to a Hobby Lobby spokeswoman, are: male condoms; female condoms; diaphragms with spermicide; sponges with spermicide; cervical caps with spermicide; spermicide alone; birth-control pills with estrogen and progestin; birth-control pills with progestin alone; birth control pills, extended or continuous use; contraceptive patches; contraceptive rings; progestin injections; implantable rods; vasectomies; female sterilization surgeries; female sterilization implants. Of course, not all of these forms will be equally useful to the salesclerk, particularly vasectomies and male condoms. Still, they include some of the most widely used forms of contraception, including several varieties of the birth-control pill. We found no evidence to dispute the company’s assertion that it pays for 16 out of 20 forms of contraception. So Clinton goes too far when she says the salesclerk "is not going to get" contraception through the company’s health care plan. And the fact that the company pays for 16 types undercuts Clinton’s claim that Hobby Lobby "doesn’t think she should be using contraception." Where Clinton’s claim includes a grain of truth is that the salesclerk will not have an unfettered choice in what form of contraception she gets. Say the salesclerk is unable, for medical reasons, to use the birth control pill. An IUD might be a good alternative, but it would not be available to her under Hobby Lobby’s health care plan. IUD use has been increasing in recent years, and paying for one out-of-pocket means significant up-front expenses. If IUD implantation is taken off the table, the salesclerk may be forced to choose another method -- one that may be less well-suited to the employee. There’s another nuance that leave this question in something of a gray area. The way the decision was written leaves some question about whether closely held, religious companies can choose to opt out of supporting any of the remaining 16 forms of contraception in their health plans. For the record, a spokeswoman said that Hobby Lobby "will continue to cover all 16," but that may not be the case for other companies. Already, some companies have been allowed by lower courts to stop paying for a wider range of contraceptives than were at issue in the Hobby Lobby case, according to the Associated Press. Their cases are likely to work their way through the courts, and the Supreme Court has let those policies stand pending further appeals. While the Hobby Lobby decision may open the door to judicial acceptance of more sweeping contraceptive bans, the specific comment we’re checking targeted Hobby Lobby -- and it’s significantly flawed. "To the extent she was talking about Hobby Lobby as an employer specifically, I think Clinton overstated her case," said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology & Bioethics at Havard Law School. He added, "It may be true for a subset of employees, and to the extent she was also referring to other potential employers who might ban all contraceptives, I think she is on firmer ground." Our ruling Clinton said that "a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception … is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception." There’s reason to believe that future court decisions could allow companies to forgo payment for all types of birth control, but Clinton’s claim refers specifically to Hobby Lobby’s policies toward its employees. And in that context, her claim is greatly exaggerated. Hobby Lobby doesn’t shun contraception entirely for its employees; it pays for access to 16 out of the FDA’s 20 approved methods. Where Clinton has a partial point is that an employee would be barred from having the company pay for four other types, even if one of those may be the best medical option for the employee’s needs. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. UPDATE, July 4, 2014: After this article was published, Hillary Clinton's camp got back to us. A spokesman pointed us to a line from Ginsberg's dissent that "seems to be pretty in line with" Clinton's comments. "The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga (Wood Specialties, another plaintiff in the case) would override significant interests of the corporations’ employees and covered dependents. It would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers’ beliefs access to contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure." We stand by the rating of Mostly False.

pomt-11697	"Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/22/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-overreaches-fentanyl-figures/	Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is requesting information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the United States Postal Services and the U.S. Department of States regarding a drug she claims is illegally making its way into the country. In a press release from Nov. 22, 2017, the senator said, "Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid, and we should use every tool at our disposal to keep it from entering the United States." The number of opioid overdose deaths has been getting a lot of attention in recent years, but is fentanyl now the leading cause? What is fentanyl? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fentanyl is a synthetic, or man-made, opioid sold legally as a pharmaceutical drug to treat pain. It is also illegally made and is increasingly used to intensify the effects (or "high") of other drugs, such as heroin. Most recent cases of fentanyl-related overdose and death have been linked to illicitly-manufactured fentanyl. Heroin is an opioid synthesized from morphine that can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance. Heroin is an illegal, highly-addictive opioid, typically injected but also smoked and snorted. Although fentanyl is similar to heroin, fentanyl is 30 to 50 times more potent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Have overdose deaths increased? There was a 21 percent increase nationally in overall overdose deaths from 2016 to 2017. The CDC categorizes six types of drugs, with fentanyl part of the "synthetic opioids excluding methadone." Fentanyl-related deaths are on the rise. A 2016 study of 10 states over six months detected fentanyl in 56.3 percent of 5,152 synthetic opioid deaths. The CDC reported a total of 20,145 overdose deaths, up from 9,445 in 2015, which means the number of overdoses related to synthetic opioids excluding methadone more than doubled between 2016 and 2017. Sarah Feldman, the deputy communication director for McCaskill, told us that "the term ‘synthetic opioids excluding methadone’ is, according to the CDC, exclusively represented by ‘fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.’" But CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard said the synthetic opioids category isn’t exclusive to fentanyl. She gave an example as prescription pain reliever tramadol, which isn’t fentanyl-based. In other words, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are a subset of synthetic opioids. "Fentanyl deaths cannot be separated out," Lenard said. Our ruling Sen. McCaskill said, "Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid." The CDC says illegally manufactured fentanyl is primarily responsible for the increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids in 10 states. But fentanyl and fentanyl analogs aren’t the only synthetic opioids claiming lives. There is no breakdown of fentanyl from the larger synthetic category number. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13070	"America’s tax code hasn’t been updated in 30 years."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/16/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-federal-tax-code-has-not-been-upda/	Paul Ryan clearly knows his constituents. To bring to life his ideas for tax reform, the Wisconsin congressman employed a video in which he compared the current U.S. tax code to a block of cheese. "Right now, our tax code looks like a block of swiss cheese," he said in the video posted on his website. "It’s got all these carve-outs and loopholes, and the IRS is the one calling the shots." Ryan has made clear he wants to drastically simplify the tax code. Consider this tweet posted on his Twitter account in late September: "FACT: America’s tax code hasn’t been updated in 30 years. We’re past due for a #BetterWay." With Republicans in full control in Washington, D.C., come January, many of Ryan’s ideas -- including on taxes -- may move to the front burner. If it’s been three decades since the tax code was updated, that certainly supports his case. Is he right? Remodeling or repainting? Ryan was referencing The 1986 Tax Reform Act, the second of two major tax cuts passed while Ronald Reagan was president. Enacted just over 30 years ago in October 1986, this major overhaul of the tax code took lawmakers several years to put together. They sought to simplify the tax code and redistribute the tax burden more fairly. Changes included consolidating income levels into fewer groups and closing loopholes that allowed people to evade taxes. The law lowered the tax rate for the highest earners and corporations and raised the rate for the lowest earners while eliminating from the tax roll earners below the poverty line. It’s true we haven’t seen a drastic overhaul of U.S. tax laws since then. But Ryan’s claim was the tax code hadn’t been "updated." Since 1986, the tax code has more than doubled in size. The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit group advocating for a simplified tax code, found that the tax code grew from 30,000 pages to 70,000 pages during that time. (A previous PolitiFact item confirmed Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz’s claim that the tax code is several times longer than the Bible.) A 2013 Tax Foundation analysis found the amount of credits, loopholes and deductions in the tax code increased by 44 percent since 1986. A corresponding report authored by foundation president Scott A. Hodge detailed some of the changes: "Over the decades, lawmakers have increasingly asked the tax code to direct all manner of social and economic objectives, such as encouraging people to buy hybrid vehicles, turn corn into gasoline, purchase health insurance, buy a home, replace that home’s windows, adopt children, put them in day care, purchase school supplies, go to college, invest in historic buildings, spend more on research and the list goes on." In an email, Hodge said though the code grew, the 40,000 additional pages "did not change the basic structure of the 1986 system." "It's the difference between remodeling your home and repainting," he said. "1986 remodeled the tax code, while everything since repainted it." But Ryan’s statement could easily be understood to mean the code hasn’t been touched at all, which is clearly not the case. In fact, revisions to tax code became more frequent after 1986. "There are updates to the tax code all the time," said Fabio Gaertner, an accounting professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Business who specializes in taxation. Gaertner said while it’s true there hasn’t been a major overhaul in 30 years, in his view Ryan’s use of the word "updated" goes too far. When we asked for input from the IRS, which enforces the tax code, spokesman Matthew Leas recommended we ask the Department of Treasury, which collects tax revenues through the IRS. But we didn’t hear back from either. Our rating Ryan said the tax code "hasn’t been updated in 30 years." The statement hinges on how a listener interprets the word "updated." While Ryan’s camp said he meant "reformed," the statement could just as easily be understood to mean tax law hasn’t been touched at all, when there have been around 40,000 pages worth of updates, many of which are commonly-used credits and deductions. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c96058ce-127d-4f29-8ab6-728f0501c092	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-11-16T05:00:00	2016-09-26	['None']

pomt-11019	Says Maxine Waters told CNN, "SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/05/viral-image/phony-image-alleged-maxine-waters-called-undocumen/	As the nation awaits President Donald Trump’s announcement of a nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, social media has erupted with chatter from politicians and pundits about the potential pick. Another person dominating the internet space has been U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who first made headlines on June 23, 2018, when she told protestors at a Los Angeles rally to put pressure on the Trump administration over its policy separating immigrant families at the border with Mexico. Waters has been under constant fire from conservatives — including Trump, who elevated her profile with a series of Twitter attacks — for her comments at the rally. Waters also has become a target of several false reports and internet memes. The latest example: A doctored image purporting to show her telling CNN that an "illegal immigrant" should be nominated as the next Supreme Court justice. "Waters: SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant," said the chyron in what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN interview with Waters. The photo was posted to Facebook on June 28, 2018, by Trump Nation, a group devoted to supporting the president. On a ticker at the bottom of the image, Waters is quoted as saying, "It’s the only way the Democrats can ever win again." In a comment accompanying the image, the post said: "... and this is why WE don't watch CNN... They are bat shit crazy! SHARE if you agree …" But, as several media outlets were quick to point out, the image is fake. The screenshot was likely lifted from an Oct. 24, 2017, interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo in which Waters explained what she had meant when she said she would "take Trump out." In the original clip, Waters can be seen wearing the same attire and jewelry — and speaking in front of the same backdrop — as in the doctored photo. She makes no mention of a judicial nominee being an immigrant. We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any credible reports indicating that the doctored image was real.

pomt-14348	Mitt Romney did not "endorse" Ted Cruz, even though he said he is voting for Cruz and urged others to do likewise.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2016/mar/24/romney-allies/romney-non-endorsement-endorsement-sorts/	Welcome to politics, where "is" is only "is" when someone says it is. Or so it seems. Just a week ago, former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney inserted himself squarely into the current slugfest of a GOP primary via a highly publicized March 18 Facebook message, just a few days before voters in Utah, Idaho and Arizona went to the polls. Romney made no bones of the fact that he was trying to derail GOP front-runner Donald Trump. He wrote that "Trumpism" has been associated with "racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence." He ended with this: "I will vote for Senator Cruz and I encourage others to do so as well, so that we can have an open convention and nominate a Republican," Romney wrote. It certainly appeared to be an endorsement in a GOP primary contest where Romney vowed he would not endorse a candidate. He had also vowed to support the party’s nominee, regardless of who that might be. But Romney aides and "allies" stressed in news reports that this was not an endorsement. "Mr. Romney’s vote in Utah, where he owns a house in Holladay, is not an endorsement, his allies stressed," The New York Times reported. "Rather, it is part of his effort to unite the Republican Party around an alternative to Mr. Trump’ Other news outlets reported Romney’s statement as an outright endorsement of Cruz, a "sort of" endorsement or something short of an endorsement. What’s going on here? Trump certainly took it as an endorsement of Cruz. He fired back on Twitter: "Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who ‘choked’ and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!" Romney’s office declined to comment when PolitiFact contacted a spokeswoman. However, political scientists from across the country weighed in. Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, pointed out that Romney was campaigning for Gov. John Kasich in Ohio a few weeks before he urged Utah voters to support Cruz. "Essentially, Romney is telling Republicans to vote for the candidate who can beat Trump in any given state, with the clear objective to deny Trump 1,237 votes on the first ballot of the GOP convention," Sabato said. "That will create an open convention, and the probability is that someone other than Trump will be picked on a subsequent ballot." Sabato said Romney is essentially endorsing "strategic voting" but not a specific candidate. Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, agreed. "I'd call it a ‘non-endorsement endorsement,’ " Swint said. "Romney is using Cruz, who he clearly dislikes, as a vehicle to try and stop Trump. The only place that might work is Utah. Outside of that, Romney's anti-Trump actions could actually help Trump. Romney reeks of ‘the GOP establishment.’ " Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report said Romney and his allies are "splitting hairs." "If you publicly support and vote for a candidate and encourage others to do the same, the only thing left is to utter the word 'endorse,’ " Gonzales said. "This is a good example of why Donald Trump is leading the field because politicians and party loyalists are playing the game with an old playbook. Instead of trying to stop Trump, Romney and company are arguing with reporters over the meaning of the word ‘endorse.’ " Political scientist Steven Smith of Washington University said the nuanced approach is complex but defendable. "Romney is trying to say that his strategic recommendation (vote for Cruz) is not yet a sincere recommendation (endorsement) of Cruz for president," Smith said. "That’s complicated but reasonable." Our ruling Romney’s aides and allies tried to spin his Facebook post in which he blasted Trump and urged voters to support Cruz as something other than an endorsement. Technically, they have a point, according to political scientists. But the statement is also misleading.

pomt-06729	"As governor, [Mitt Romney] balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/30/ed-lindsey/georgia-pol-whips-debate-romney-record/	Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is trying to gain support for his presidential bid in Georgia, and one of his chief supporters here recently offered a case for Romney’s candidacy we found quite interesting. "Georgians are suffering under the leadership of President [Barack] Obama. Mitt Romney is the candidate with the vision and experience to turn around the failing economy," Edward Lindsey, a Republican state representative from Atlanta, said in a news release pumped out Aug. 22 by the Romney campaign. Lindsey, the House majority whip, one of the most influential positions in the Georgia Legislature, added: "As governor, [Romney] balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs. He has the experience in both the private and public sectors to get Americans back to work." Romney, widely considered one of the Republican front-runners, is trying to make the argument that he can do a better job than Obama in managing the American economy. The candidate that makes the best argument will likely win the presidency in 2012. With that in mind, we wondered whether Lindsey is right about Romney’s record in Massachusetts. Did he balance the budget without raising taxes and create jobs? We talked briefly to Lindsey, who referred our questions about his claim to the Romney campaign. So first, let’s deal with the budget question. Romney took office as Massachusetts’ governor in January 2003. The Massachusetts economy, like much of the country, was struggling before he took office. In 2002, Massachusetts leaders passed tax increases that raised revenue by about $1 billion, said Mike Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Tax Foundation. In 2003, the money problems continued, and it was now Romney’s job to find solutions. That year, the Massachusetts Legislature balanced the budget through spending cuts and raised revenue through some revisions of the corporate tax code. Romney signed off on several other corporate tax revisions in 2004 and 2005. Those changes resulted in an additional $350 million in revenue, Widmer said. When Romney left office, Massachusetts collected about $18 billion in revenue. Were those code changes a tax increase? Romney officials call them "loopholes." Widmer refers to them as "corporate tax increases." "I don’t fault Romney," Widmer said. "I commend him and the Legislature for the balanced approach that they took." Noah Berger, president of the Massachusetts Budget & Policy Center, does not believe they are tax increases. "I think it’s fair to say that’s different than raising taxes," Berger said of the changes. The issue has been debated for years. "[Romney’s] indicating that he balanced a budget without raising taxes is misleading at best," Brian Gilmore, executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state's largest business lobbying group, told MSNBC in 2007. "We respectfully disagree." Romney officials countered that he was trying to stop some companies from using "aggressive accounting" to reduce their tax liability. The changes, according to MSNBC, included real estate investment trust subsidiaries created by banks to hold mortgages. The parent banks received dividend income from the trusts and took advantage of deductions to lower their state taxes. Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams told us the candidate was under pressure from the Legislature, which he described as 87 percent Democrat and among the most "liberal" in the country, to raise taxes. Romney, he said several times, resisted and did not raise "broad-based taxes." We asked whether we should then consider the corporate tax code changes a tax increase. "[Romney] did not increase taxes to solve a difficult situation," Williams said. As for job creation, federal data show the number of employed Massachusetts residents grew by about 1.3 percent during Romney’s four years as governor. The job growth was greater than population growth. Critics argue Romney cannot make much of a case that he was a great job creator as governor. Massachusetts was ahead of only Louisiana, Michigan and Ohio in the percentage of job growth during Romney’s four years in office. Louisiana leaders then had an excuse for slow job growth, contending with the aftermath of a hurricane called Katrina. Some economics experts argue governors should get little credit, or blame, for job growth. Williams, the Romney spokesman, correctly noted that unemployment fell from 5.6 percent the month Romney took office in 2003 to 4.6 percent four years later. He also correctly pointed out that Massachusetts had lost jobs in each of the two years before Romney took office. Massachusetts also had about 30,000 fewer employed residents in the two years after he was no longer governor. Technically, Lindsey has a point on both parts of that specific quote. Romney did preside over an increase in job growth as governor. As past research has shown, it was smaller than nearly every other state. There was improvement, however, on the employment front when he was governor. As for taxes, Massachusetts didn’t raise the property tax rate or other traditional types of taxes during Romney’s time as governor. But he did close several corporate loopholes, which resulted in companies paying more taxes. Because the changes to the corporate tax code resulted in some businesses paying more in taxes, we believe Lindsey’s statement needed some clarification and rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15049	"Almost nine out of every 10 pennies that would be spent" turning a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 70 into a toll road "would be from folks outside Missouri."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2015/sep/29/jay-nixon/jay-nixon-says-90-i-70-toll-road-funding-would-com/	The search for money to fund infrastructure improvements has Gov. Jay Nixon open to the idea of turning a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 70 into a toll road. On Aug. 20, Nixon spoke to nearly 1,000 people at the State Fair’s 63rd annual Governor’s Ham Breakfast. After the event, Nixon took questions from reporters and shared his thoughts on turning I-70 into a toll road. Nixon said, "almost nine out of every 10 pennies" spent on the proposed I-70 toll road would come from non-Missourians. "Almost nine out of every 10 pennies that would be spent there would be from folks outside Missouri, with the federal dollars, and then (with) the folks traveling through here," Nixon said. "So you can get a road built, 90 percent (of) a brand new road, by non-Missourians, (a road) that we use a lot. ... I think that's still is something that should be looked at very carefully." The numbers Nixon cited jumped out at us, so we decided to see if he had his facts right. The journey for answers began by reaching out to Scott Holste, the governor’s press secretary. Holste said Nixon’s claim was "part of an extemporaneous answer to a reporter’s question at the State Fair." The numbers cited by Nixon for the construction revenue of I-70 would be based on tolls collected from vehicles, as well as construction funds received from the federal government, Holste said. He also provided a Missouri Department of Transportation report, which lays out tolling options for I-70. The project cost could range between $2 billion and $4 billion. The report analyzed a 200-mile stretch of I-70 from Independence, Mo. to Wentzville, Mo. (Basically, all of I-70 in Missouri outside the St. Louis and Kansas City metro areas.) No data from the report, however, aligned exactly with Nixon’s claim, but there were some interesting details about truck traffic, which Holste pointed out. "Some 70 percent of the truck traffic on I-70 originates and terminates from outside the 200-mile study limits of Independence to Wentzville – many of those originate or are destined from locations outside Missouri," the report stated. Put another way, trucks passing through this stretch continue on to somewhere else. Holste said this information suggests those trucks come from out-of-state. In addition, trucks would face a toll rate two to three times higher than the 10-15 cents per mile rate for passenger vehicles, according to the report. Add those two facts together, Holste said, and it suggests out-of-state trucks would carry a greater share of the cost a per-vehicle basis. Not 90 percent, but something. In addition to truck traffic bringing in extra dollars, Holste said the federal government will help pave the way. Under The Highway Trust Fund, the federal government is responsible for reimbursing states a certain project types. This means up to 80 percent of construction costs will be paid by funds from the federal level, Holste said. So, in theory, 80 percent of the revenue used to fund an I-70 toll road would come from the federal government. But that by itself is misleading. The transportation trust fund is dependent on fuel taxes paid in each state, which are deposited in the trust fund to pay for transportation projects. In other words, Missourians would be responsible for a portion of the funding for the trust through the gas taxes they’ve paid. We wanted to be thorough in our analysis of Nixon’s claim so we contacted Bob Brendel, the special assignments coordinator for MoDOT and a contributing writer of the original report Nixon’s office cited. When asked about Nixon’s claim, he said the best data for what we are looking for is in the MoDOT report. The data supporting out of state truck traffic comes from a study conducted between 2006 and 2009, Brendel said. The report Holste provided was prepared in 2014 to provide data to support the idea of turning I-70 into a toll road. The data paint an interesting picture for out-of-state truck traffic, but don’t touch on how much toll revenue might be paid by out-of-state or "non-Missourian" drivers if I-70 was a toll road. "To determine the percentage of traffic from out of state would require a detailed origin-and-destination study that has not been conducted," Brendel said. Brendel also pointed out another important feature about the Highway Trust Fund. The portion of money from the federal government would only reimburse Missouri for 80 percent of project work. So Missouri would only see federal money after construction is complete. Our ruling Nixon claimed that "nine out of every 10 pennies" spent on the proposed I-70 toll road would come from non-Missourians. His office later clarified that the remark was "part of an extemporaneous answer" to a question from a reporter. In reality, it’s a guess. The report Nixon’s office cited includes many interesting traffic figures, but none of them support his specific claim. And while the federal highway trust fund would cover much of the work, some of that money comes from gas taxes paid by Missourians. Nixon has a point that a toll road would bring in a good chunk of revenue from out-of-state drivers and the federal government. But 90 percent? That’s an unsubstantiated guess. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Jay Nixon	None	None	None	2015-09-29T13:57:55	2015-08-20	['Missouri']
pomt-03829	Of every "three dollars in food stamps for the needy, seven dollars in salaries and pensions (go to) the bureaucrats who are supposed to be taking care of the poor."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-70-percent-food-stamp-fundin/	Federal bureaucrats are a favorite target at CPAC, the annual conservative conference that was held March 14-17, 2013. And in her address to the conference, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., served up a doozy. How does it help the poor, she asked, when "of every dollar that you hold in your hands, 70 cents of that dollar that's supposed to go to the poor doesn't. It actually goes to benefit the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Seventy cents on the dollar. That's how the president's caring works in practice. So three dollars in food stamps for the needy, seven dollars in salaries and pensions for the bureaucrats who are supposed to be taking care of the poor. So with all due respect, I ask you, how does this show that our president cares about the poor?" Seventy percent of the food stamp budget goes to bureaucrats rather than beneficiaries? This sounded way off to us. So we looked into it. The real numbers We first turned to budget data for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the food stamp program. (We should point out that the food stamp program has officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008). In 2012, the Food and Nutrition Service spent a little over $112 billion, an amount that includes not only food stamps but also several smaller nutrition programs for low-income Americans. Of this, $136.5 million was spent on administration. That works out to one tenth of 1 percent -- nowhere near 70 percent. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came up with a somewhat larger percentage on administration in a 2012 briefing paper. The center came up with administrative costs of about 5 percent by including several other categories of spending, including state administrative costs and educational programs for SNAP participants. Bachmann did mention "pensions," and if you add the retirement costs of SNAP employees it would boost the numbers a bit higher. But even the most generous accounting of SNAP’s administrative costs end up well short of 70 percent. What gives? Where Bachmann went wrong Bachmann’s office did not answer our inquiry, but experts say she probably got it from The Poverty of Welfare: Helping Others in Civil Society, a 1996 book by Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute. Tanner told PolitiFact that Bachmann is "misquoting me in a subtle but important way." In his book, Tanner cited a claim by Robert L. Woodson -- president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise and author of Breaking the Poverty Cycle: Private Sector Alternatives to the Welfare State -- that in the 1980s, 70 percent of every dollar went "not to poor people but to government bureaucrats and others who serve the poor. Few private charities have the bureaucratic overhead and inefficiency of government programs." In a footnote, Tanner added, "It is important to note that the 70 percent figure is not solely government administrative overhead. That figure also includes government payments to the non-poor on behalf of the poor. For example, Medicaid payments go to doctors. Housing subsidies are frequently paid directly to landlords." So, we see three problems here. First, Bachmann’s claim appears to be based on a 17-year-old study that cites data that may be a decade older than that. In an interview, Tanner said he quoted Woodson’s findings and then referenced a number of regional studies that reached similar conclusions. Second, the footnote makes clear that not all the people receiving federal anti-poverty money are "bureaucrats." And third, even if you assume Woodson and Tanner are correct, the finding still doesn’t apply to SNAP, which is a pure cash benefit system without payments made to intermediaries such as doctors or landlords. Our ruling Bachmann said that of every "three dollars in food stamps for the needy, seven dollars in salaries and pensions (go to) the bureaucrats who are supposed to be taking care of the poor." That is ridiculously off-base. Even the broadest calculation of administrative costs for SNAP tops out at 5 percent of program costs, far below the 70 percent Bachmann claims. And the scholar behind the statistic she appears to have used as support said Bachmann has misquoted his work. Pants on Fire!

pomt-08015	"Following the 2009 session," Texas House Speaker Joe Straus "was acknowledged and ‘thanked’ for his ‘tireless efforts’ by Planned Parenthood, the nation’s premier abortion provider."	true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/11/heidi-group/activists-say-planned-parenthood-nations-premier-a/	A letter distributed by a conservative group Jan. 4 ticks off reasons it says Texas House Speaker Joe Straus is not "pro-life," ranging from his past authorship of legislation authorizing stem-cell research to his past designation of a former Democratic legislator as chief of staff. The letter urges Republican legislators, who will have a 101-vote House majority, to deny the San Antonio Republican a second two-year stint as speaker. Straus drew 70 of 100 GOP member votes in the party's caucus meeting Monday and is expected to prevail today when the post is formally filled by the 150-member body after the session starts Tuesday. The Jan. 4 letter, signed by more than 30 anti-abortion activists, floated an unusual warning sign about Straus--involving a thank you. "Following the 2009 session," the letter says, Straus "was acknowledged and ‘thanked’ for his ‘tireless efforts’ by Planned Parenthood, the nation’s premier abortion provider." Some perspective: Planned Parenthood is a reproductive health care provider with facilities nationwide that offer family-planning services, including abortion. The organization advocates for comprehensive sexual health care and education. Carol Everett of Round Rock, a signer of the anti-Straus letter and founder and CEO of the Heidi Group, a non-profit that has run crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth, told us the reference to Planned Parenthood as the nation’s premier abortion provider reflected on her understanding that its clinics provide more than 300,000 of the nation’s 1.2 million legal abortions a year. She forwarded a 2009 report by an anti-abortion group, the Virginia-based American Life League, terming Planned Parenthood the largest "abortion chain" in America with 817 clinics around the country. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, 1.2 million legal abortions were performed in the United States in 2008. Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind told us the institute doesn’t break down which groups provide abortions, but stand-alone clinics provide more abortions than all U.S. Planned Parenthood clinics combined. By our accounting, about 27 percent of abortions in the U.S. are performed at Planned Parenthood clinics versus 73 percent at other medical facilities. To our inquiry, Tait Sye of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said that in 2008-09, Planned Parenthood provided 328,000 abortions. Sye said in an e-mail: "Our health centers do much more than provide abortions. They provide a wide range of safe, reliable health care--and more than 90 percent is preventive, primary care, which helps prevent unintended pregnancies through contraception, reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections through testing and treatment, and screen for cervical and other cancers." Straus has been slammed before from the right for links to Planned Parenthood. In the early 1990s, his wife served on the board of San Antonio’s Planned Parenthood affiliate. And in 2008, before Straus was a candidate for speaker, the local group’s political arm contributed $1,000 to Straus’s campaign kitty. Everett pointed us to an article headlined "2009 Patron Party" in the fall 2009 edition of Horizons, the newsletter of the Planned Parenthood Trust of San Antonio and South Central Texas. The article says the Planned Parenthood affiliate’s president and CEO, Jeffrey Hons, thanked three legislators attending the Oct. 6, 2009, gathering at a San Antonio home, plus state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, and Straus, both in absentia, "for their tireless efforts on behalf of Texas women and children during the last legislative session." Everett said such a mention carries a taint. "If I got any mention from Planned Parenthood, people would wonder about it," Everett said. "You show one other conservative pro-lifer who has had any mention from Planned Parenthood, I would eat the paper that shows it." In an interview, Yvonne Gutierrez, spokeswoman for the San Antonio Planned Parenthood group, said Hons’ shout-out was not intended to underscore any particular action by Straus. The party was at a home in Straus’ district, Gutierrez said, and Hons "thanked the speaker because he thought that for his first session (as speaker) he did an excellent job for women and families... It was almost as if how could you be sitting in the speaker’s district talking about the legislative session and not mention the speaker?" Gutierrez said. The thanks "was really nothing more than that." The four-paragraph newsletter article focuses on more than 120 individuals whose gifts to the group exceed $1,000 a year. But the story also quotes Mindi Alterman, then the departing board chair, stressing strides the group had made in cervical cancer prevention, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and permanent birth control. The 18-page issue opens with a message from Hons describing Planned Parenthood as the city’s most effective teen pregnancy prevention program. "Finally, and perhaps as a footnote, the people who protest on the sidewalk outside my office window do nothing, absolutely nothing, to prevent so much as one teen pregnancy," his message says. "They do nothing to prevent one abortion while Planned Parenthood prevents thousands of abortions with our family planning clinics. And their protests do nothing to help vulnerable, at-risk teens keep their fragile lives pointed toward a successful adulthood." We asked Tracy Young, Straus’s communications director, for the speaker's take. She made no comment. We rate the statement True.

pomt-03180	"There’s only one candidate under investigation -- Terry McAuliffe."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/03/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-under-investigation/	Confused about all charges of poor ethics that the major gubernatorial candidates are lobbing at each other? Republican Ken Cuccinelli wants to help you out. "The truth? There’s only one candidate under investigation: Terry McAuliffe," the announcer says at the start of a Cuccinelli TV commercial that’s been airing since Aug. 22. We wondered whether that is indeed the truth. The ad comes on the heels of a Quinnipiac University poll that showed McAuliffe, a Democrat, had staked out a 48-42 percent lead over Cuccinelli. The survey showed Cuccinelli is being hurt by voter doubts about his trustworthiness, the likely result of a scandal that has touched him as well as Gov. Bob McDonnell. Cuccinelli accepted $18,000 in gifts from Jonnie Williams, the chief executive of Star Scientific Inc., a nutritional supplement company. Williams was the source for more than $145,000 in gifts and loans for McDonnell and his family, most of which went unreported. Cuccinelli, in April, amended four years of personal disclosure reports he had filed with the state to include $12,000 in gifts he said he forgot to report -- including about $5,000 from Williams. Examining Cuccinelli’s ad claim requires a determination whether either major party candidate is under formal investigation. So let’s start. Is McAuliffe under investigation? Cuccinelli says his claim is based on a recent media reports about GreenTech Automotive, an electric car company that McAuliffe founded in 2009. McAuliffe quietly resigned as GreenTech’s chairman last December -- an action that wasn’t made public until April -- but continues to be a major stockholder in the struggling company. On Aug. 2, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that GreenTech is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The full scope of the probe has not been made public, but the newspapers said it focuses, at least in part, on GreenTech’s recruitment of foreign investors. GreenTech and a partner company, Gulf Coast Funds Management, sought to raise money for the electric car venture through a federal program, called EB-5, that gives permanent resident visas to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in a U.S. startup company that creates jobs. The newspapers said the SEC was examining whether GreenTech and Gulf Coast illegally promised foreign investors risk-free returns. GreenTech and Gulf Coast officials have said they have received subpoenas and are cooperating with the investigation. But McAuliffe says the SEC has not contacted him and his only knowledge of the probe comes from newspaper articles. The Post reported on Aug. 22, "there is no indication McAuliffe is personally under investigation." Cuccinelli’s campaign, in defending the ad claim, says the investigation targets a time when McAuliffe was GreenTech’s chairman. Anna Nix, a campaign spokeswoman, referred us to an article on the investigation by Breitbart.com. It quotes Douglas Park, a California business attorney, as saying that corporate board members can be held responsible for the actions of their companies and that "a good plaintiffs’ securities lawyer is going to go after" McAuliffe. Legal experts we spoke to said the facts are not clear cut. "There have been plenty of government investigations of corporations that did not involve misconduct by a high level corporate official, and plenty that have focused on misconduct by CEOs or Boards of Directors," said John G. Douglass, University of RIchmond law professor, in an email. The only way to know, he said, is when prosecutors announce who is involved. We should note that there’s a second investigation swirling around GreenTech, although Cuccinelli’s campaign did not cite it in defense of its ad. The inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security is investigating whether U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas gave preferential treatment to GreenTech and some other firms seeking to establish EB-5 programs. Mayorkas, who has been nominated for deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and is going through Senate confirmation hearings, has denied giving GreenTech special treatment. Records show McAuliffe and several of his business partners lobbied Mayorkas to speed consideration of EB-5 applications. But McAuliffe and officials from GreenTech and Gulf Coast Funds said they did not receive any favors and have not been contacted in the Mayorkas probe. So again, there is no evidence that McAuliffe is being personally investigated. Is Cuccinelli under investigation? Cuccinelli’s name has been tied to two probes this year. He initiated the first one on himself in April after amending his disclosure forms to include $12,000 in unreported gifts he received since lated 2009, when he was elected attorney general. Amid criticism from Democrats, Cuccinelli appointed Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring to investigate whether he had violated state disclosure laws. Herring ended the investigation on July 18 with a nine-page report saying he found "no evidence" that Cuccinelli violated any laws or intentionally failed to disclose gifts." Two days later, PolitiFact Virginia gave a Pants on Fire to McAuliffe’s claim that the probe concluded Cuccinelli "should have been prosecuted" but Virginia’s ethics laws are too weak. The second investigation, being conducted by Virginia’s inspector general, focuses on whether a lawyer in Cuccinelli’s attorney general’s office offered legal advice to two energy companies involved in a dispute over paying royalties for natural gas they extracted from private lands. One of the companies, Consol Energy Inc., has contributed $111,000 to Cuccinelli’s campaign. The probe centers on emails Assistant Attorney General Sharon Pigeon sent to the lawyers for the energy companies. U.S. Magistrate Pamela Mead Sargent wrote in June that the emails "shockingly" show that Pigeon "has been actively involved in assisting" the companies. Cuccinelli has said that although Pigeon’s emails were "overzealous," they ethically carried out his office’s responsibility of defending the constitutionality of a state law that’s at the center of the royalties dispute. For this Truth-O-Meter, here’s the important thing to remember: Inspector General Michael Morehart has said his investigation focuses on attorneys in Cuccinelli’s office -- not Cuccinelli himself. As noted by The Post, the inspector general is not empowered to initiate investigations of elected officials. We should finally note that there are no reports that a third gubernatorial candidate -- Robert Sarvis, a libertarian -- is under investigation. Our ruling Cuccinelli said McAuliffe is the only gubernatorial candidate under formal investigation. He cites an SEC probe into the tactics GreenTech Automotive used to attracted foreign investors. McAuliffe was chairman of the electric car company until last December and remains one of its key stockholders. But there has been no indication that McAuliffe is a target of the SEC investigation. The burden of proof falls on Cuccinelli to prove his charge against McAuliffe, and he comes up empty. The good news for Cuccinelli is that we can also say that he is not the focus of any current investigations. The bad news is that we rate his ad claim False.

"Breaking: Shep Smith to be canned because he can’t control his hate for Donald Trump," said a headline by Newsflash. The website, which lacks original reporting, has a hodgepodge of articles about politics and celebrities. Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. Fake stories stating that Smith will be or has been fired have circulated since 2017 on multiple websites. Snopes, which debunked the claim in 2017, found it first published on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that calls itself satire. We rated that version of the claim Pants on Fire almost a year ago. The latest iteration of the story has been debunked by the Associated Press and Factcheck.org. We did our own reporting and came to the same conclusion that Smith’s job remains safe. One easy giveaway: Smith was just rehired. Smith, one of Fox’s original hires in 1996, is now the anchor of Shepard Smith Reporting (weekdays 3-4PM/ET). In March 2018, Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch announced that Smith, the chief news anchor and managing editor of breaking news, signed a multiyear agreement. In February, network spokeswoman Irena Briganti told the AP that the story that Smith has been let go was "completely false." Smith has drawn the ire of some Trump fans because he has criticized the president on air. Newsflash included an accurate quote by Smith in which he said Trump made a false statement that the media frequently under-reports radical Islamic terror attacks. "In short, the president’s assertion is false," Smith said in February 2017. "The White House knows that it was false or could have learned that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth." Smith told Time in an article published in March that he’s not bothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox’s opinion slate: "We serve different masters. We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don’t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want, if it’s their opinion. I don’t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I’m busy." Bottom line: This headline is recycled fake news from 2017. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-09671	Obama "closed offshore tax safe havens."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/19/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-closed-offshore-tax-safe/	We got a chain e-mail recently that purports to list 90 accomplishments from President Barack Obama's first six months in office. Unlike most chain e-mails we get, this one was signed by its author, Robert Watson, a professor of American Studies at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla. Watson said he spoke last spring at Democratic political clubs and was asked by some members to compile the list as talking points to balance some of the claims about the Obama administration coming from Republicans. The list has since gone viral, and now Watson fields several calls and e-mails every day challenging him on some of the entries. We decided to look into a handful of items on the list to see if they check out. Here, we look at No. 46, that Obama "closed offshore tax safe havens." On May 4, 2009, the White House issued a detailed, six-page plan to curb overseas tax havens and remove tax incentives for companies to shift jobs overseas. The plan to "get tough" on overseas tax havens included eliminating loopholes for certain offshore subsidiaries; cracking down on the abuse of tax havens by individuals; and putting more resources into IRS enforcement to help close the international tax gap. And in late October, the House and Senate introduced the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2009, which seeks to crack down on Americans hiding their assets in overseas tax havens. The president promptly issued a statement in support of the legislation. "Shortly after taking office, I laid out a set of proposals to crack down on illegal overseas tax evasion," Obama stated. "The legislation introduced today would fulfill that promise, putting a stop to billions of dollars worth of abuses. I look forward to working with Congress to turn these proposals into law so that honest Americans no longer shoulder the burden of the few individuals and businesses that put profit before responsibility." Although the legislation enjoys the support of the White House, it is likely to face strong opposition from corporations that do considerable business overseas. According to a story in the New York Times , "about 200 companies and trade associations, including Microsoft Corp., General Electric Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, signed a letter stating that the proposed changes to the tax code would put them at a disadvantage with their rivals." In other words, it's premature to put this one in the "Obama Accomplishments" column. Watson acknowledged as much when we spoke to him on Nov. 19. "The president started it, and Congress is now looking at it, but it's not a done deal," he said. And so we rate this one Half True.

pomt-04382	Says fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years.	true	/texas/statements/2012/oct/19/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-less-30-percent-texas-college-stud/	Rick Perry, who has said he wants the 2013 Legislature to impose a four-year tuition freeze for incoming freshmen, said at a Dallas press conference that such a move would give students an economic incentive to graduate on time. "Less than 30 percent of our students graduate in four years; only 58 percent of our students have their degrees in six years," Perry said, according to an Oct. 2, 2012, Dallas Morning News news story. "That is a system that can and must be improved." He aired a similar claim in a CBS News interview Oct. 10, 2012, saying: "One of the problems we’ve got is that only 30 percent of our college students are graduating in a four-year period of time." We previously explored a similar claim by state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, who said in June 2010 that about a third of Texas high school graduates who go to college end up "getting through" college. His statement rated True; our look also quoted an official from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board pointing out that 57 percent of Texas students were graduating within six years. Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the Republican governor drew his figures from the board, and a board spokesman, Dominic Chavez, guided us to the agency’s 2012 "Higher Education Almanac." A chart in the report says 29.9 percent of Texas students who initially enrolled as full-time students in the state’s four-year public colleges and universities graduated within four years. It says 58.4 percent of full-time students graduated within six years, with 65.6 percent doing so within 10 years. Fewer part-time students graduated within the time periods. Chavez said by email that the four-year graduation rate of nearly 30 percent reflects 18,396 graduates out of 61,485 full-time students in the fiscal year running through August 2011 who had enrolled as first-time students four years earlier. Notably, he said, the state can track students who switch schools by tracking them using Social Security numbers or another identifier. And the 30 percent rate reflects improvement from the previous decade, Chavez said. By the same measure, nearly 20 percent of fourth-year undergraduates had graduated by August 2000, a rate based on 8,352 graduates among 41,925 fourth-year students. "Not only did rate go up," he said, "but the number of students increased as well." As noted in our check of Hochberg’s statement, two caveats apply. First, the data don’t account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include students who attended school out of state, the data don’t track whether they graduated. Separately, the U.S. Department of Education also gauges college graduation rates by state. In 2009, its latest figures indicate, 48.5 percent of Texas students who had enrolled six years earlier had earned bachelor’s degrees, compared with 55.5 percent nationally. The same year, 25.4 percent of Texas students who had enrolled three years earlier seeking community college associate’s degrees had succeeded, compared with 29.2 percent nationally. Based on the raw numbers behind each rate, we reached a combined graduation rate of 38 percent. In contrast to the Texas board’s calculation, the federal figures do not account for students who transferred from one institution to another. We asked Patrick Kelly, who works for the agency that oversees the federal graduation figures, to appraise the Texas board’s method of calculating graduation rates. "This makes sense," he said, calling the approach a straightforward, standard way of tracking students including those who change schools. Our ruling Perry said fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years. That information is drawn from the state’s higher education oversight agency. We rate the claim as True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-10-19T11:41:22	2012-10-01	['Texas']
pomt-13193	"14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-14-percent-noncitizens-a/	One of Trump’s rallying cries as Election Day nears has been that the election system is rigged and rampant with voter fraud. We’ve debunked this idea in more than one way, but more recently, Trump offered several statistics to back his claim up during a rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on Oct. 23. One of those claims was this: "14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote." Trump’s remark stood out to us and piqued our interests. We found that Trump is referencing a study that has been criticized and rebutted multiple times for the methodology it uses. Trump’s proof was rebutted Trump was citing a 2014 article posted on Monkey Cage, a blog hosted by the Washington Post, his campaign told PolitiFact. The blog post was a precursor to a study that discussed the impact noncitizens could have on the November 2014 election. The authors — Jesse Richman and David Earnest — determined more than 14 percent of noncitizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. Richman and Earnest used data collected from a Harvard-affiliated Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). The duo concluded that CCES’ data provided "sufficient samples" to conduct their research. Trump accurately cites the study, but its findings have been highly contested. Three experts wrote rebuttals of the study’s findings after the Post article appeared, and the study spawned another peer-reviewed article. The main issue with the study is the sample size and the unreliable database of Internet respondents. Shortly after Richman and Earnest’s study was published, the CCES released a newsletter encouraging researchers not to use its data in that way. "The example for this analysis is Richman, Chattha, and Earnest (2014), which presents a biased estimate of the rate at which non-citizens voted in recent elections," the letter says. The CCES researchers — Stephen Ansolabehere, Samantha Luks and Brian Schaffner — reiterated their point in a Washington Post analysis last week. (This analysis became the subject of a study published in 2015 by the same authors.) Ansolabehere, Luks and Schaffner say a small percentage of respondents, who are citizens, accidentally misidentify themselves as noncitizens on the survey. This is because the respondents didn’t read the question carefully and accidentally selected the wrong response to the question. How do they know this? Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, said the group has conducted surveys where they ask people questions regarding their citizenship and some people change their answers. "When we took out people who changed their answer on the citizenship question and only look at people who answered consistently that they were noncitizens, we found no reported noncitizens who voted," Schaffner told PolitiFact. News 21, a national investigative reporting project, found 56 cases of noncitizens voting across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Rick Hasen, an election expert at University of California at Irvine’s School of law, told PolitiFact that Trump’s statistic is bogus. He also cited Ansolabehere, Luks and Schaffner’s study rebutting Trump citation. Hasen wrote in the Wall Street Journal recently that "the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded last month than only a ‘tiny fraction’ of voters are noncitizens and that there is no evidence it is a serious problem." Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said there are substantial legal deterrents that are in place to keep a noncitizen from voting. First, it’s a criminal offense to unlawfully vote in a federal election. Second, this offense is worthy of deportation, even without a conviction. "Voting renders an individual permanently inadmissible — again, even without a conviction," Pierce said. "This means that if someone were to be found inadmissible for having voted, they could never return to the United States, even temporarily, no matter the circumstances. Voter identification laws and regulations for registering to vote vary from state to state. In September, the Supreme Court blocked Kansas, Georgia and Alabama from requiring residents from proving they are a U.S. citizen while registering to vote, due to concerns that people who actually are citizens do not have paperwork readily available to prove it. Our ruling Trump said, "14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote." Trump is citing a study that has been refuted by the experts who actually gathered the underlying data. Trump’s remark references an unreliable data point that uses a small sample size to represent an entire population.

pomt-15181	"The United States is about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations, and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/aug/21/bruce-elfant/bruce-elfant-says-us-about-100th-voter-turnout-tex/	A Travis County official declared the United States and Texas lag far behind other countries and states in voting. On Aug. 5, 2015, Democrat Bruce Elfant, the Travis County tax assessor-collector, was interviewed by Dick Ellis of the KOKE-FM Austin Radio Network about the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act. Johnson, Elfant said, "would be very disappointed by the number of Americans who choose to use that right. The United States is about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout," he said. We previously found merit to a claim that Texas had the nation’s worst voter turnout in 2014, though we noted voter statistics weren’t yet final. So, does Texas rank near the bottom nationally in voter registration and turnout? And is U.S. turnout about 100th among industrialized nations? Elfant’s backup To our inquiry, a county official, Tiffany Seward, said by email that Elfant drew the international comparison from one source and reached his conclusion about Texas from a U.S. Census Bureau survey. Seward sent along a chart, attributed to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, showing the U.S. had turnout of nearly 67 percent of registered voters in the 2012 presidential elections, placing it 97th in the world among more than 175 countries with national elections—basically tied with Montserrat, Mongolia and Bahrain. Also based on the 2012 turnout, according to the chart, the United States ranked 139th with 54 percent of its voting-age population turning out, tied with Canada and several smaller countries. The presented turnout percentages for other countries were based on elections from 2007 through 2014, according to the chart. Seward also provided a chart, drawing on bureau survey results released in July 2015, showing 59 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens were registered to vote in November 2014, placing Texas 45th among the states by that metric in a virtual tie with New York and Nevada. Nearly 35 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens turned out that November, according to the chart — about the same share turning out as in Indiana and narrowly better than turnouts in New York, Oklahoma and West Virginia, which each had 34 percent turnout. We confirmed the state-by-state figures by downloading the relevant chart from the bureau’s website which also had a report stating that nationally in 2014, about 42 percent of voting-eligible citizens turned out—the lowest rate since the bureau started asking about both voting and citizenship status in 1978. The report said the figures reflected answers to supplemental questions posed after the November 2014 elections as part of its annual Current Population Survey. According to the report, the bureau has posed supplemental post-election questions every two years since 1964. Turnout in U.S., industrialized nations Next, we turned to Elfant’s moan about U.S. voter turnout ranking about 100th among "industrialized nations." Our whoa: We’re doubtful there are 100 industrialized nations on the planet. The State Department lists 195 independent states in the world and the CIA’s World Factbook breaks out only 34 "developed countries": Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holy See, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Among the developed countries identified by the CIA, U.S. turnouts have been among the lowest by two measures tracked by the International IDEA--the share of voting-age residents casting ballots by country and the share of registered voters turning out. Still, the U.S. turnout of 67 percent of registered voters in 2012 was better than such turnouts in Greece, Canada, Japan, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, San Marino and Switzerland. Also, the U.S. turnout of 54 percent of its voting-age population that year was better than such turnouts in Liechtenstein, Ireland, Austria, Switzerland, Andorra and Monaco, according to the international group, which describes itself as an intergovernmental organization, founded in Stockholm in 1995, whose mission is to "support sustainable democratic change." Asked to assess Elfant's claim, an institute spokeswoman, Lynn Simmonds, told us by email that Elfant got it right, though she added: "Please note that the label ‘industrial nations’ may cause confusion and therefore, we would say among all countries." We asked Elfant about his focus on "industrialized nations." By phone, he said he’d made a misstatement to Ellis in that he meant to roll in more countries. But "any way you slice it, we’re way towards the bottom" in voter participation, he said. Other analyses There are other ways to sort this out. Seema Shah, an institute official, advised by email that if you define voter turnout as the ratio of voters compared to the entire population of citizens eligible to vote, then for presidential elections, the U.S. lately ranks 75th (with 53.58 percent of eligible voters turning out) if you focus only on the 113 countries with presidential elections. And the institute's Peter Wolf said that if the focus is limited to the 34 countries (including the U.S.) that comprise the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, which promotes economic development, the U.S. turnout of nearly 67 percent of registered voters in the 2012 presidential elections landed in a "mid-field position"--lower than turnout, say, in New Zealand (77 percent), comparable to turnout for parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom and yet higher than than turnout in Canada (61 percent). Wolf said the nearly 43 percent U.S. turnout rate in the 2014 congressional elections was among the lowest rates for the countries. In May 2015, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center said U.S. voter turnout typically trails turnout among the other OECD member-nations. An accompanying chart showed the U.S. ranked 31st among the selected nations, based on its 2012 turnout, besting Japan, Chile and Switzerland. Among the member-countries, the highest turnouts were in Belgium (87.2 percent), Turkey (86.4 percent) and Sweden (82.6 percent). Then again, Pew noted, Belgium and Turkey are among 28 nations where voting is compulsory, according to the International IDEA; countries that require voting include Australia, Peru, Singapore and Uruguay. Drew DeSilver, who wrote the Pew analysis, told us by phone he compared turnouts in the OECD nations because they represent the world’s advanced industrialized democracies, hence amounting to reasonable peers. DeSilva added by email: "That is to say, it wouldn't make much sense to compare the U.S. to either developing-world democracies or to developed but not-so-democratic countries." Our ruling Elfant said the U.S. is "about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout." Texas is nearly last among the states in voter registration and turnout and U.S. voter turnout ranks low internationally, though that's among all nations, not the limited number of countries considered industrially developed.

pomt-09333	Says he did not say Republicans would filibuster immigration reform.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/12/jon-kyl/yuma-daily-newspaper-quoted-kyl-saying-republican/	Update: After publishing this item on April 12, 2010, we received new information, including video of a town hall meeting in Yuma, a comment from Sen. Jon Kyl's staff and more information about the Yuma Sun report. We have updated this item on April 13 to fully reflect the new information. The ruling, however, remains the same -- False. What Sen. Jon Kyl did or didn't say about immigration at a town hall in Yuma, Ariz., was in dispute on ABC News' This Week. Host Jake Tapper asked Kyl, "You helped lead the cause of immigration reform in 2007. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that he is going to bring up immigration reform. You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?" "I don't think I said that, Jake, but what I did say is that the conditions for immigration reform no longer exist," Kyl said. "The consensus that existed before does not exist. And among other reasons, because the administration -- this current administration has not done what's necessary to secure the border and enforce the law. We just saw the tragic death of a rancher down on the border, presumably from drug smugglers or illegal immigrants, that simply illustrates once again the fact that we have not controlled the border. And until that's done, I think it's going to be very difficult for Congress to support legislation that would be as comprehensive as that I supported three years ago." The answer indicates Kyl is not optimistic about immigration reform, but we wanted to find out whether Kyl said Republicans would filibuster or not. Kyl made his remarks at a town hall attended by 350 people in Yuma, Ariz., on April 7, according to a report in the Yuma Sun, a daily newspaper owned by Freedom Communications. The newspaper reported the filibuster remark, though very briefly. Here's what the paper's report said: One man in the audience asked Kyl about the GOP's strategy to curtail the efforts of the Democrat-controlled Congress and executive branch. "First of all, our strategy on health care included taking as long as we possibly could so the American people could clearly understand (it).. and it took a year for it to get done," Kyl said, adding they will do their best to slow up any other bills, like immigration reform, in the same manner. "My guess is (immigration reform) won't have the votes to pass, but political promises have been made to key constituency of the party that is in power. Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster..." Kyl's remarks did not go unnoticed. The Wonk Room, a liberal blog run by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, linked to the Sun's report and noted that Kyl's remarks were "the first time a high-ranking GOP member has threatened to block reform entirely." Tapper's question -- "You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?" -- was a verbatim repeat of the quote the Sun reported. But the Sun's quotation of Kyl -- "Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster" -- is a little off. Kyl's staff provided us with a transcript and video; they said it showed more context for Kyl's statement. We reviewed the material; here's an extended version of Kyl remarks. "My guess is, neither (card check and immigration reform) will have the votes to pass. But because political promises have been made to key constituency of the party that is in power, that they're going to do something about these problems, they will bring up very partisan legislation. Republicans will, primarily Republicans, will vote it down, that is to say we will prevent it from coming up through the filibuster, through requiring cloture and they won't get 60 votes. And then they’ll be able to blame us for being anti-union or anti-Hispanic or whatever. It's false, but that’s the political game. But at least those things won't pass." On April 13, the Yuma Sun said it would run a correction on the quote. But Tapper's summary of the misquote is still a fair account of what Kyl said. And of course, there are no quote marks on broadcast television. If anything, the video makes a stronger case that Kyl believes Republicans will filibuster immigration reform, which was the premise of Tapper's question. Kyl's staff told us he only meant that Republicans would filibuster a purely partisan bill, not the kind of bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that Kyl put forward with Sen. Edward Kennedy in 2007. That's why Kyl objected to Tapper's premise. Still, Tapper's question -- "You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?" -- remains an fair summary (though not a quotation) of Kyl's town hall remarks. The video showed that Kyl predicted a Republican filibuster. So Kyl's statement -- that he didn't say Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster -- is False.

pomt-15272	"More than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California this year have gone to illegal aliens."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/28/numbers-usa/did-more-half-all-california-drivers-licenses-go-u/	California is home to more undocumented immigrants than any other state, over 3 million, so any policy shift it makes is bound to catch attention. NumbersUSA, a group that favors reduced immigration, noticed a trend with driver’s licenses in the Golden State and posted a meme with this message on its Facebook page. "More than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California this year have gone to illegal aliens," the meme says. The group is on solid ground with its numbers, although it omits why this has happened. According to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, about 397,000 undocumented immigrants received a driver’s license since January. "This figure represents more than half of the total 759,000 original driver licenses that have distributed during the first half of 2015," the department said in a press release. Behind these numbers is a 2013 law called the Safe and Responsible Driver Act. The measure reversed a 20-year-old law that blocked people without legal status from applying for a license. A large coalition of immigrant advocacy organizations argued that in the state that epitomizes American car culture, that ban made it difficult for people to get to work, drive their kids to school and run simple errands. The result, the advocates argued, was thousands of people on the road without licenses and without any way to make sure they knew how to drive. Under AB 60, all that would be needed to get a license was proof of residency and the ability to pass a driver’s test, both written and on-the-road. California Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill in October 2013. It took effect January 2015. A wave bigger than expected State officials predicted that about 500,000 people would apply in the first six months, with about another million people after three years. By April 2015, they had already hit the 500,000 mark. "The interest in this program is far greater than anyone anticipated," said DMV director Jean Shiomoto in a press release. Shiomoto might have been surprised, but the state had done a lot to make this happen. In January 2014, Brown proposed spending $65 million to open five temporary offices and hire as many as 1,000 additional staffers to handle an application surge. He largely got what he wanted. The department opened four new offices and hired 900 people. In November 2014, the Department of Motor Vehicles announced it would keep longer office hours and stay open on Saturdays. "DMV is committed to successfully implementing this new law to increase safety on California roads by putting licensed drivers behind the steering wheel," Shiomoto said. Our ruling The group NumbersUSA said that this year, more than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California went to undocumented immigrants. By the state’s own tally, that is correct. What the group doesn’t mention is that this is the result of a substantial state effort. First, lawmakers made it possible for over a million unauthorized residents to apply for a license, and then the state spent millions of dollars to speed the application process. The statement had the right numbers but needs additional information. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	NumbersUSA	None	None	None	2015-07-28T11:20:01	2015-07-22	['California']
pomt-14081	Since 2009, "after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/18/penny-pritzker/commerce-secretary-penny-pritzker-says-2009/	President Barack Obama has touted his administration’s record of overseeing economic growth since the Great Recession. But is it correct -- as Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker wrote recently in Medium -- that since 2009, "after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent"? To check Pritzker’s statement, we looked at two economic statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which, as it happens, is part of the department Pritzker oversees. One is real disposable personal income -- that is, the accumulation of all personal incomes in the United States, minus taxes and adjusted for inflation. That statistic rose from $10.9 trillion in 2009 to $12.2 trillion in 2015, the last full year available. That works out to an increase of 11.9 percent. Here’s a summary graph: That’s lower than the 14 percent figure Pritzker cited, but it’s still a double-digit increase over six years, so it’s in the ballpark. We didn’t hear back from Pritzker’s office, but Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said he suspects she arrived at her number through a different but reasonable calculation. He said she was probably referring to a comparison of an average of the 12 monthly figures from 2009 and the three monthly figures (so far) for 2016. We double-checked Burtless’ math and found that it works out to be a 13.7 percent increase -- on target with what Pritzker said. But while Pritzker is either correct or reasonably close when looking at the overall personal income numbers, it’s worth remembering that this number can be affected by population growth, even over a period as short as seven years. Consider an alternative measure -- real disposable personal income per capita, which is the previous statistic, but adjusted for the size of the U.S. population. That measurement has gone up from $35,616 in 2009 to $38,046 in 2015 -- an increase of 6.8 percent. That’s only half as fast as Pritzker said -- and it’s worth remembering that this was a cumulative rise over six years. As a result, disposable personal income rose by only about 1 percent a year above inflation during that period. That doesn’t sound quite as exciting. Why doesn’t this feel right to most Americans? So if Pritzker’s claim about after-tax income growth is reasonably accurate, how does that jibe with equally accurate claims noting that "Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years"? For starters, as we’ve noted, there are various ways to measure income growth, each of them legitimate but some of them show different results. "I agree that we want to think about some sort of per-person measure, but is the right measure per capita or per employed or per labor force participant?" said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. In addition, even if real disposable personal income is going up over time, that doesn’t mean it’s rising as fast as it once was. To measure this, we looked at the average annual increase in real disposable personal income during three recent periods. From 1992 to 2000, real disposable personal income rose an average of 3.7 percent per year. From 2001 to 2008, it rose an average of 2.7 percent per year. And from 2009 to 2015, it rose by 1.6 percent per year. That’s a clear pattern of diminishing growth, even if it’s still growth. Burtless noted that the lack of attention given to the role that rising population has warped perceptions of economic output and income growth. Specifically, he said, the slowdown in population growth since the 1970s, especially in the age groups likeliest to be working, has made it harder for the United States to reach the once-common historical level of 3 percent annual economic growth. Our rating Pritzker said that since 2009, "after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent." Using the most basic, aggregate measure, Pritzker is either on target or reasonably close. However, it’s worth noting that this accomplishment is not quite as impressive once you strip out population growth or look at growth levels historically. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/adb03577-9123-471c-87e4-b3383d5fddcf	None	Penny Pritzker	None	None	None	2016-05-18T13:49:28	2016-05-13	['None']

pomt-07069	"We are one of the most expensive [bus] rides in New England."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/28/charles-odimgbe/transit-ceo-says-rhode-island-bus-fares-are-most-e/	With the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority facing a projected $4.6- million budget shortfall in the coming year, CEO Charles Odimgbe told his board of directors that bus service would have to be cut 10 percent. He ruled out raising fares, something the board has done five times since 2002. "We are one of the most expensive rides in New England," Odimgbe told the board members during the meeting. Does a ticket to ride cost more in Rhode Island? We decided to find out. When we reached Odimgbe, he said he based his statement on knowledge of the industry. He later had a RIPTA employee forward an internal survey. He qualified the remark he made to his board, saying it’s more relevant to compare RIPTA to transit systems that are comparably sized and in areas with a comparable cost of living than to simply look toward other systems in New England. If you did look to Boston or New York for a comparison and took into consideration their higher cost of living, "you will come to the conclusion that the rides in Rhode Island are very high," he said. We’re not sure why cost of living should be a factor, so we focused only on how much it costs to ride the bus. In Rhode Island, the fare for riding a RIPTA bus is $2 one way. Need to transfer to another bus? That costs another 50 cents. Ride frequently? You can get a one-day pass for $6 and a monthly pass for $62. Some people, including seniors, disabled, low-income and students, can ride for free or for half price. [Of the 18.2 million rides RIPTA provided during the past 12 months, about 4.2 million, or one-quarter, were seniors and disabled people who hold free passes -- they number 40,000 -- and another 2 million were students with passes, according to assistant general manager Mark Therrien.] By comparison, in Boston, the base bus fare is $1.50, or 25 cents less with a pre-paid Charlie Card. A monthly local pass costs $40. Let’s look at some other transit systems in New England. In Portland, Maine, the fare is $1.50, with a monthly pass costing $45. The Worcester Regional Transit Authority charges $1.50, with monthly passes going for $48. In Burlington, Vt., the fare for a public bus is $1.25, with a monthly pass costing $42. Connecticut Transit, serving Hartford and New Haven among other communities, charges $1.25, with free transfers. RIPTA’s internal survey draws a comparison with a handful of comparable, or "peer" systems outside of New England. Fares were reported from last summer, but we went to their individual websites and updated those that have changed. In cities such as Albany, Rochester, Memphis, and Louisville, basic fares were lower than RIPTA’s. So far, Odimgbe’s claim seems to be holding up. But comparing only base fares doesn’t give a complete picture of what it costs to ride a bus in any of these systems. And this is where Odimgbe’s claim begins to break down. In Rhode Island, there’s one basic fare, no matter how many miles you travel -- whether it’s within Providence city limits or between outlying communities and the capital city. Get on a bus in Westerly and it will carry you the 43 miles to Providence, all for just $2. Get a transfer for another 50 cents and you could then head to Woonsocket, another 15 miles. [Odimgbe said the agency has concluded that because most RIPTA riders travel within urban areas -- an estimated 85 percent of rides within 7 miles of downtown Providence -- it would not be worth creating a system to charge long-distance riders more.] You’re not going to travel those long distances in Connecticut that cheaply. Express bus service between Hartford and outlying areas is based on zone fares that range from from $2.25 to $4.30. For example, if you board a bus in Old Saybrook or New Haven and travel the 40-plus miles to Hartford, the fare is $4.30, more than double Rhode Island’s fare for a comparable distance. Boston, meanwhile, has higher fares for its Inner Express ($3.50) and Outer Express ($5) services. Let’s make one last stop before we arrive at our destination. The American Public Transportation Association, whose members include RIPTA and 350 other transit systems conducts an annual survey of base fares for adults. Of those that responded to the 2010 survey, only four U.S. systems charged more than RIPTA, ranging from $2.25 in San Diego to $3.65 in San Francisco. So what have we learned during our ride? When we confined our comparison to New England, just as Odimgbe stated, we could not find another bus system charging as much as RIPTA’s $2 base fare. And while several of these do not charge to transfer to other buses, RIPTA tacks on another 50 cents. RIPTA’s monthly pass also is substantially higher. However, while RIPTA lets patrons travel all the way across the state for no more than $2.50, riders in Boston and Connecticut have to pay substantially more to travel comparable distances. So, Odimgbe’s claim that RIPTA is "one of the most expensive rides in New England" is true for base fares, but not when it comes to longer trips. Because 85 percent of RIPTA riders pay the base fare, we rate his claim MostlyTrue. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-07524	"Across the United States, 25 percent of voting age African Americans do not have the photo ID that this bill would require."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/07/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-one-quarter-african-a/	It’s normal for House Democrats and Republicans to have sharp divides, but last month’s heated debate over a controversial voter ID law added a new ingredient to the partisan stew: race. Democrats, including several black members of the caucus, in no uncertain terms, accused Republicans of targeting minority populations with the proposal to require all Ohioans to show government-issued ID at polling locations. Democrats saw the move in racial terms because of what they said was clear evidence black voters are more likely not to have photo IDs than white voters. Rep. Armond Budish, the House Democratic leader, implored House Speaker William G. Batchelder to not move the legislation forward. In a March 22 letter to the speaker, Budish said groups such as senior citizens, college students, poor citizens and black residents would suffer because they are more likely to not have a photo ID. "Across the United States, 25 percent of voting age African Americans do not have the photo ID that this bill would require," Budish wrote. Surely there are African-Americans in the United States who don’t have photo ID (as do a portion of every racial group), but could a full quarter of 41 million black Americans be without IDs? Politifact Ohio decided to take a look. The legislation would require voters to show one of four forms of ID when voting in person — an Ohio driver license, state ID, military ID or passport. House Republicans added a provision that would allow an expired driver license be used - a measure aimed at helping seniors comply with the ID law. The claim about 25 percent of African Americans became the underpinning for the racially-charged accusations lobbed at Ohio Republicans. Rep. Tracy Maxwell Heard, a Columbus Democrat who is black, repeated it at a news conference March 23. Later that same day, the House passed the bill along party lines. It’s now pending in the Ohio Senate. We asked Budish where Democrats got the 25 percent figure they were using to make the case that the Ohio law would impact blacks disproportionately. He cited a report from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. The report, "Citizens Without Proof," is based on a telephone survey conducted by Opinion Research Corp., an independent polling firm. It surveyed 987 randomly selected voting-age Americans over four days in November 2006. Those surveyed were asked, "Do they have a current, unexpired government issued ID with their picture on it?" Among the African Americans, 25 percent have no current government-issued photo ID, according to the survey. For white adults, the rate was 8 percent. The margin of error, the Brennan Center states, for that particular statistic is plus or minus 8 percent—meaning the actual statistic is probably between 17 and 33 percent. It was clear that one five-year-old national survey had found a quarter of African Americans without proper ID, but were there other studies of this issue? Some sleuthing in the political science academic journals turned up a 2007 study done in Georgia — one of only two states in the country with an ID requirement similar to the one proposed in Ohio — that found a much lower portion of African-Americans without photo ID. This study found that only 6.8 percent of blacks did not have a proper government-issued photo ID. However, that same study found that 3.7 percent of white adults in Georgia did not a photo ID — a finding that tended to support the outrage from Ohio Democrats that the proposed law would disproportionately targeting black adults. A study from Wisconsin found much higher percentage of black adults without state ID. Statewide, 80 percent of men and 81 percent of women had a valid drivers license, the study found. But only 45 percent of black males and 51 percent of black females had a driver’s license or other form of state ID PolitiFact Ohio checked with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles for information on how many black Ohioans have driver’s license or state IDs, but the bureau does not track individuals by race. So add it up and what do we have? A national study did find 25 percent of African Americans don’t have the kind of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, that the Ohio proposal would require. But the study has a sizable margin of error -- 8 percent -- and that it was done in 2006. It may be the most current research available, but Budish’s statement was made in the present tense about data that is five years old. Budish was using the national statistic to argue that the new law would disproportionately impact potential black voters in Ohio. Yet there has been no study of this issue in Ohio so there are no specific figures for the state population. ID rates in other states where studies were done differed greatly. So while Budish’s statement is accurate, it leaves out those important details needed to understand it in full context. On the Truth-O-Meter that rates as Half True.

pomt-10992	Since 2014, "each year, (NATO) nations have been increasing their contributions."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/john-kerry/john-kerry-rebuts-trump-nato-spending-was-not-down/	Former Secretary of State John Kerry took exception to President Donald Trump’s criticism of the NATO allies at the recent meeting in Brussels. Trump came into the meeting saying the European members needed to spend more. At a news conference after the meeting, Trump said their defense spending had been falling. "It was going down, the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially, and now it's going up very substantially," Trump said. Kerry said the trend was just the opposite. "President (Barack) Obama raised the issue in a constructive and collegial way that succeeded in securing a pledge from NATO members to increase their defense spending," Kerry said in a statement July 11. That meeting took place in 2014 in Wales. At the end, NATO members said they would spend more on defense and "aim to move towards the 2 percent guideline within a decade." "Each year, (NATO) nations have been increasing their contributions," Kerry said. The European nations had reasons beyond Obama to up their defense game. Open fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists had Europe on high alert. Whatever motivated the Europeans, the numbers say Kerry is right, at least for the time frame he mentioned. Since 2014, the European members collectively increased defense spending by 8 percent, or $20 billion in real terms. (Canada’s spending also rose by $7 billion.) This chart draws from official NATO statistics, with all amounts in constant 2010 U.S. dollars. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Now, it is true that before 2014, Europe had been spending less, but that isn’t what Trump said. Trump said spending was going down when it was rising. In relative terms, the European share of all NATO member defense spending has been rising since before 2014. In 2012, its share stood at 27 percent. That fraction increased every year, reaching 30 percent in 2017. Defense analysts at the conservative Heritage Foundation see the data the same way. Luke Coffey and Daniel Kochis said while non-U.S. spending needs to go higher (as did Kerry), they also said it has been headed in the right direction. "In 2017, NATO members (not including the U.S.) collectively increased spending by 4.8 percent, or $23 billion, since 2015," Coffey and Kochis wrote June 26. NATO broke from its usual practice and issued a projection of 2018 defense spending at the end of the recent gathering. That report shows Europe’s collective spending rising by about $35 billion in current dollars, while U.S. spending would go up by about $20 billion. Our ruling Kerry said that NATO members have been increasing their contributions. Total defense spending by the European members rose 8 percent or $20 billion dollars from 2014 to 2017.

pomt-10084	Obama "changed the rules in Washington. Gone are the free gifts from lobbyists. Gone are the fancy airplane rides for nothing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/barack-obama/a-player-but-not-the-captain/	(Published Oct. 30, 2008) From the start of his presidential bid, Democratic nominee Barack Obama has touted ethics as a major campaign theme. He barred lobbyists and corporate political action committees from contributing money to his campaign, for example, and fairly or not he's repeatedly assailed his Republican rival's ties to lobbyists. But the Illinois senator's oft-repeated theme that he led the effort to pass ethics reform legislation in the Senate last year is much exaggerated, as we pointed out last spring . Obama's 30-minute infomercial made the claim again on October 29, 2008, quoting Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. "He's changed the rules in Washington," McCaskill said during the half hour campaign commercial that ran on major broadcast networks and cable channels. "Gone are the free gifts from lobbyists. Gone are the fancy airplane rides for nothing. He did that." It's clear what McCaskill is referring to here: the 2007 ethics reform law that Congress passed and President Bush signed in the wake of the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. And to be sure, Obama backed the 2007 law, which barred gifts from lobbyists and required that a senator flying on a corporate jet reimburse the plane's owner at the full charter rate. (Senators didn't previously fly free, as McCaskill claims, but rather were required to pay whatever a first class ticket on a commercial airline would have cost for the same route.) But Obama was not the leading player on the new law. Obama was most active on the issue a year earlier, when he was tapped by Democratic party leaders in early 2006 to lead the party's efforts on lobbying reform in the wake of the scandal created by Abramoff, a longtime Washington lobbyist for Indian tribes who pleaded guilty in January 2006 to conspiring to bribe members of Congress. Obama proposed setting tougher rules for the disclosure of earmark requests and creating an outside ethics office, staffed with independent monitors, to evaluate complaints against senators. But Obama was not pleased with what the Senate came up with and in March 2006 he was one of just three Democrats to vote against legislation, which ultimately passed 90-8, by then-GOP Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi that would have made it more difficult to add earmarks to spending bills, required members of Congress to wait two years after leaving public office to lobby their former colleagues and banned gifts from lobbyists. Obama said Lott's bill was not tough enough. In the end, the House and Senate were not able to reconcile their differing versions of the legislation and Lott's bill died. When Democrats took control of both chambers in January 2007, they moved quickly to pass ethics reform legislation, but most of the legwork was done by Obama's Democratic colleagues, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. They negotiated the final legislative language and moved it through both chambers in defiance of skeptical Republicans. During the 2007 debate, Obama was a less central player than he had been in 2006. Though he supported the gift ban, he was not its most vocal backer. In 2007, he continued to push, unsuccessfully, for an independent ethics office and, with Democratic colleague Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, drafted the provision on corporate jets that was ultimately incorporated into the final bill. On that score, then, McCaskill is right. But to imply Obama was the leading force behind the 2007 ethics law goes too far. For that reason, we rate McCaskill's statement Half True.

pomt-11136	New York state has the "second highest millionaires tax in the nation."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2018/may/31/christine-quinn/does-new-york-state-have-second-highest-tax-wealth/	New York state ranks only behind California for taxing the rich, Christine Quinn said at the Democratic Party’s state convention on Long Island. "Second-highest millionaires tax in the nation, highest on the East Coast, only behind California but we'll find a way to beat them, too," Quinn, vice chairperson of the New York State Democratic Committee, said to applause from the party’s delegates. When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took office in 2011 he was staunchly opposed to the tax on the state’s highest earners. He, like Republicans, thought it would prod high-income residents to leave the state and lead to less income-tax revenue. Cuomo, however, has since fought to preserve the tax. He repeated Quinn’s claim in his speech at the convention. "Our millionaires tax is the second-highest in the nation and the highest in the East," Cuomo said. New York state has a reputation as a high-tax state. But does the state have the second-highest millionaires tax rate in the nation? The millionaires tax In 2009, state lawmakers and then-Gov. David Paterson raised the state income tax rate from 6.85 percent to 8.97 percent for earners making $500,000 or more. The tax, intended to help close the state’s deficit, was supposed to expire after three years. Cuomo and state lawmakers agreed to extend the so-called "millionaires tax" before it ended, but lowered the rate to 8.82 percent for people making about $1 million or more. They eliminated the higher rate for filers making less. The top rate remains at 8.82 percent in 2018. Democrats in the Assembly have proposed setting even higher rates for people making more than $5 million annually. Republicans oppose that proposal. Other states Some residents of New York State — but not all — pay the second-highest income taxes in the country. Some cities in New York state, like New York City, collect their own local income tax on top of the state tax. Neither Quinn nor Cuomo made reference to the city in their speeches. The highest earners in New York City pay a local income tax of 3.876 percent. That applies to single filers making more than $50,000 a year and married filers making more than $90,000. That rate was already in place before Cuomo took office. The combined state and local income tax rate in New York City is 12.7 percent for people who make about $1 million or more. That’s less than California’s 13.3 percent state income tax rate, but more than the rates in the other states. We couldn’t find another city in the U.S. with a higher combined state and local income tax rate. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, confirmed that New York City residents pay the second-highest combined rate behind California. Quinn’s claim doesn’t hold up outside New York City. Seven states have higher income tax rates on wealthy earners, according to research from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a tax policy analysis group. Auxier confirmed that finding. California is highest, but two of New York state’s neighboring states also have higher tax rates on the wealthy. Vermont taxes people who make more than $416,650 at 8.95 percent and New Jersey taxes those making more than $500,000 at 8.97 percent. In the Midwest, Iowa and Minnesota tax their highest earners at 8.98 percent and 9.85 percent, respectively. Oregon’s highest rate is 9.90 percent and Hawaii reinstated an 11 percent state income tax for wealthy earners this year. New York state and California are the only two states with an isolated tax bracket for filers who earn about $1 million or more. The highest brackets in the other six states start lower, from $71,190 to $500,000. Washington D.C., while not a state, also has an income tax bracket for filers making $1 million or more, and they are taxed at 8.95 percent. No one from the State Democratic Committee offered an on-the-record explanation supporting Quinn's claim. Our ruling Christine Quinn said New York state has the "second-highest millionaires tax in the nation." That’s only true for New York City residents. Millionaires outside New York City have a lower rate than those in seven other states. Her claim contains an element of truth about New York City. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01723	Austin mayoral candidate "Mike Martinez takes corporate money."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/aug/07/eugene-sepulveda/adler-supporters-mike-martinez-money-claim-unsuppo/	A supporter of an Austin mayoral candidate declared that another candidate accepts corporate donations--which would be illegal, he did not add. In a July 29, 2014, Facebook post, Eugene Sepulveda of Austin, treasurer for attorney Steve Adler’s mayoral campaign, declared Adler isn’t taking "corp money, PAC money or bundled contributions," meaning money gathered from multiple sources by a single person. Commenting below Sepulveda’s post, Austin political consultant Mark Littlefield, who supports City Council member Mike Martinez for mayor, asked: "Are other candidates taking corporate money?" Sepulveda replied: "Mike Martinez takes corporate money. Steve won’t." A Martinez backer, Jose Velasquez, asked us to check Sepulveda’s claim. We wondered first if perhaps laws have changed dramatically so that Texas candidates may accept corporate donations. Not so, we were reminded, in that Texas adopted its ban on corporate donations to candidates more than a century ago. A September 2013 Texas Ethics Commission guide for candidates for local office specified that state law bars contributions to candidates for state and local office from labor unions and most corporations. More recently, Austin lawyer Tim Sorrells, the commission’s former general counsel, advised candidates for city office in an April 2, 2014, blog post: "In Texas, it is still a felony of the third degree for a corporation or labor organization to contribute directly to a candidate or a candidate committee." We asked Sepulveda, a social entreprenuer and philanthropist, to elaborate on his Facebook statement. By email, he told us: "I should have said Mike was taking money from business entities. I was referring to his acceptance of contributions from LLCs as well as PACs and bundlers." LLCs are Limited Liability Companies. "My bad for not being more specific," Sepulveda wrote. In another email, he said that when Velasquez asked him about the corporate claim, "I used the term corporate generically, even referring him to the documents filed with the city clerk. If I'd been trying to mislead anyone, I certainly wouldn't have pointed them to the candidate-filed reports." Sepulveda, who said he made his Facebook comments as an Adler supporter and not as a spokesman for Adler’s campaign, elaborated that according to a campaign-finance filing, Martinez fielded contributions from 13 businesses, which we confirmed from Martinez’s July 15, 2014, campaign finance report, which showed the cited contributions ranging from $50 to $350. We noticed the business contributors included several limited liability companies, which prompted us to ask an election-law expert, Trey Trainor of Austin, if such companies can legally give to candidates for local office. By phone, Trainor said LLCs may legally make donations so long as none of their members are corporations. Also by phone, Austin lawyer Ed Shack, who said he has helped Adler’s campaign, said the same. Martinez campaign spokesman Nick Hudson told us the campaign earlier confirmed from state records and by contacting each contributor that none of the LLCs giving to Martinez’s effort had corporate members. Hudson agreed it would be illegal for Martinez to accept corporate donations. Meanwhile, Sepulveda replied to us that he had since posted a comment on Facebook, below his original claim, stating he should have said Martinez accepted donations from business entities including LLCs rather than corporations. It appeared the afternoon of Aug. 4, 2014. Our ruling Sepulveda said on Facebook that Martinez takes corporate donations. That’s not so. In fact, corporate donations remain forbidden and accepting such could lead to a felony charge. However, any candidate may field contributions from PACs and LLCs (so long as a donor LLC has no corporate members). This advocate’s claim, which he clarified on Facebook six days later, shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-02754	Under President Obama’s health-care reforms, the premium for "an average plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500 per year, it's gone up about $2,500 per year."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/15/ron-johnson/obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-havent-gone-do/	When it comes to statistics, chart-loving U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson seems like the guy who tries to get his comb-over just-so before he goes out for the evening. Meticulous. But the Wisconsin Republican wasn’t pointing to any charts (that we could see) on Dec. 5, 2013 when he did a Fox News Radio interview about one of the federal laws he most likes to skewer: The Affordable Care Act. "It’s not affordable," Johnson stated on "Kilmeade and Friends" before making this claim about health insurance premiums. "An average (annual) plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500, it's gone up about $2,500." So, Johnson is saying that premiums are $2,500 more in 2013 than when Obamacare became law in 2010, and linkin the law to the increase. Let’s give the senator’s claim a fine-tooth examination. Down $2,500 When Johnson said premiums didn’t go down, he was referring to a promise made by candidate Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. Obama pledged to sign a health care bill into law that would "cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year." PolitiFact National rated that a Promise Broken. Now let's see what happened to premiums. Up $2,500 In saying the annual premium has gone up $2,500, Johnson’s office cited figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group. More specifically, we’re looking at the size of the premium for an employer-sponsored family plan -- that is, the total premium paid by the employer and the employee. About 60 percent of Americans under the age of 65 get their health insurance from their employer. Here are the national averages from Kaiser for the past 10 years. Year Annual family health insurance premium Percentage increase 2004 $9,950 -- 2005 $10,880 9.34 2006 $11,480 5.51 2007 $12,106 5.45 2008 $12,680 4.74 2009 $13,375 5.48 2010 $13,770 2.95 2011 $15,073 9.46 2012 $15,745 4.46 2013 $16,351 3.85 (Note: Kaiser says that based on the way its survey of employers is done, it rounds when referring to percentages. For example, Kaiser would say the increase from 2004 to 2005 was 9 percent.) So, as Johnson indicated, the average annual premium was $2,581 higher in 2013 than when the Affordable Care Act was adopted in 2010. But premiums rose each year before Obamacare, too. Why up $2,500? Johnson policy advisor Patrick McIlheran told us the senator was merely observing in the radio interview that premiums had risen in spite of Obama's promise. But implicit in Johnsons' claim is that Obamacare, to some extent, is responsible. The Kaiser figures show a premium increase of 9 percent in 2011, about a year after the health reform law was adopted. But one could argue that the longer the law has been in effect, the lower the premium increases have been (under 5 percent in 2012 and under 4 percent in 2013). Experts say, however, that a number of factors -- including the recession and the sluggish economic recovery -- affect premiums. Moreover, there is no consensus that enough time has passed to determine what effect the Affordable Care Act -- much of which doesn’t even take effect until 2014 -- has had on premiums, particularly for employer-sponsored plans. The president’s Council on Economic Advisers, in a November 2013 report, argues there is a connection between the law and a slowdown in health care costs overall. But the report also notes "the causes of the slowdown are not yet fully understood." Health economist Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told us increases in premiums have slowed, "but I’m one of those people who thinks that has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act." And when The Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post, did a factcheck in September 2013 about Obamacare and premiums, he said the law’s impact "is just now being calculated, adding: "Trust us -- no one really knows yet." So, whether Obamacare has helped raise, or kept a lid, on premiums remains largely unknown. Our rating Johnson said that under Obama’s health-care law, the premium for "an average plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500 per year, it's gone up about $2,500 per year." Johnson is correct that by 2013, three years after the Affordable Care Act became law, the total average premium for employer-provided family insurance had risen by $2,500 per year. But experts say there is little or no evidence that Obamacare is responsible. We rate Johnson’s statement Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2013-12-15T05:00:00	2013-12-05	['None']

pomt-13533	"Inner-city crime is reaching record levels."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-inner-city-crime-reaching-recor/	Aiming to blunt an overwhelming edge among African-American voters, Donald Trump has been decrying longstanding black support for Democratic politicians, who he blames for allowing economic inequality and crime to fester in African-American communities. In an Aug. 29, 2016, tweet, Trump wrote, "Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!" Is Trump correct that "inner-city crime is reaching record levels"? No, not even close. Record levels? There is no official category -- or even a definition -- for "inner-city" crime. So the best we can do is look at crime in large cities. Among the crime data the FBI collects is for that committed in cities over 250,000 in population, so that’s what we used. The chart below shows the rate of all violent crimes -- including homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults -- committed per 100,000 people, which is a standard way of measuring the extent of crime. The top line shows the rate for cities over 250,000 in population, while the lower rate shows it for the country as a whole. The two lines track each other fairly well, but the trend is unmistakable: The frequency of violent crime has declined since the early-to-mid 1990s. We also looked at one subset of the violent crime rate -- the homicide rate -- for both the country as a whole and for cities over 250,000 in population. The patterns for homicide are the same as they are for violent crime generally -- they have been declining since the early-to-mid 1990s. The same pattern holds for the subset of the nation’s very largest cities -- those of 1 million or more residents. In 2014, the violent crime rate in these largest cities was 658.7 per 100,000 residents, a significant decline from 868.9 in 2006 (and even higher in earlier years). Over the same period, the murder rate in these cities fell from 12.3 per 100,000 residents to 7.4 per 100,000 residents. A cursory look at a few specific cities shows that the number of murders, even at their somewhat elevated rate today, are well below their peaks in the 1990s. The number of murders in New York City, for instance, fell from 2,262 in 1990 to 1,927 in 1993, 629 in 1998 and 352 in 2015. And in Chicago, there were 468 murders in 2015, well below the 925 recorded in 1991, according to the Wall Street Journal. The recent spike in crime We should note that even if crime isn’t hitting record levels, there is growing evidence that there has been a one-year uptick, at least in certain cities. Trump’s supporters have seized on this as evidence that Trump isn’t totally off base in claiming that crime is on the rise. Some background: In early June, we gave Trump a Pants on Fire for his statement that "crime is rising," noting that he had made a sweeping statement while ignoring the consistent and long-term decline cited above. Critics took issue with our rating, citing preliminary figures for 2015 that showed crime rising. Scholarly research published since our original fact-check suggests that the uptick is indeed notable. Later in June, the National Institute of Justice -- an office within the U.S. Justice Department -- released a paper that analyzed the uptick. It was written by Richard Rosenfeld, who studies crime at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Rosenfeld found that the preliminary increase in homicides "was real and nearly unprecedented." But he also added that it was not universal in the nation’s big cities. Only certain cities seemed to see significant increases. Specifically, he found that 10 out of the 56 large cities he studied "produced two-thirds of the big-city homicide increase in 2015." Most cities either showed small increases or declines. Here is a chart he assembled showing how big or small a spike each of the cities experienced: Rosenfeld found that the 10 cities with the biggest spikes tended to have higher poverty rates, higher African-American populations and smaller Hispanic populations. However, he wrote that beyond that, there is insufficient public data available at this time to determine the precise cause, or mix of causes, for the top 10 cities’ homicide spikes. In any case, none of this supports Trump’s more recent statement that crime is approaching "record levels." Even if the recent spike proves durable, the rates of homicides and violent crime in general have fallen so much in the past 25 years that the recent increases will not push them up to "record" levels at any time in the near future. "The increase in crime in inner cities in 2015 was a large one-year increase, but you can see that the long-term trend is way down," said Alan Lizotte, a criminologist at the University at Albany. "The recent spike would need to continue for a while to reach early 1990s levels." "Inner-city crime rates are not even close to record levels," agreed James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. "And crime rates among African-Americans, especially youth, were much, much higher in the early 1990s." Our ruling Trump said that "inner-city crime is reaching record levels." Criminologists say that it is worth watching the recent jump in homicides in certain big cities to see whether it represents a lasting trend or just a blip. However, the homicide rate and the violent crime rate has fallen to such an extent over the past quarter century -- both in big cities and in the country at large -- that it would take many years of significant increases to return to the "record levels" of the early 1990s.

pomt-02128	With only 67 bills or so passed into law, "2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping record."	true	/texas/statements/2014/may/09/joaquin-castro/congress-propelled-fewer-bills-law-2013-lowest-pro/	U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro bemoaned inaction in Washington, D.C., in a public breakfast interview with the McAllen Monitor. On April 24, 2014, the first-term San Antonio Democrat told Carlos Sanchez, the newspaper’s editor, that after spending 10 years as a state legislator, he was struck by the slow pace of Congress in his rookie year there. Castro said that "if you look at 2013 in terms of the productivity of Congress, one of the most striking things to me was how each of us ... 535 members of Congress can be very busy during the day ... but at the end of it all not very productive. That was a very strange thing to grasp. 2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping records." Castro continued: "Harry Truman in the 1940s campaigned against a ‘Do-Nothing Congress’ and that ‘Do-Nothing Congress’ passed over 900 bills. Congress last year passed 67 or so. So that gives you a sense of the context and the environment which I came into, which I experienced in that first year." Castro had made the same claim just before President Barack Obama gave his latest State of the Union address, according to a Jan. 27, 2014, entry on the Business Insider blog, which also quoted Castro calling the current Congress "the most gridlocked in American history." "Most gridlocked" strikes us an uncheckable opinion. We asked Castro instead about his "least productive" assessment. By email, Castro spokeswoman Laura Zapata provided an audio clip of Castro’s statement at the breakfast, which we used to transcribe what he said. Castro’s staff confirmed the unproductivity of Congress in 2013, Zapata said, after news reports said as much. She said Castro specified 67 bills passing into law because a few other successful proposals simply re-named buildings. Zapata also pointed out an undated chart published by USA Today attributed to information from the U.S. House Clerk’s Office. The chart indicates that through late December 2013, the 113th Congress had passed 72 measures into law. At a glance, the chart suggests that count was lower than any year going back to 1947 when, the chart says, 395 laws came to be. The National Journal reported Dec. 19, 2013, the year's output amounted to the tiniest fraction of 6,366 bills introduced by lawmakers, according to House and Senate records, adding "fodder to the narrative building in recent years that" Congress "has become a dysfunctional, polarized, overly partisan legislative body." Next, we turned to the website for the clerk’s office, which offers one-page detailed numerical recaps of each year’s congressional proceedings dating back to 1947. According to the web page for 2013, 73 measures made it into law through the year. That was a low compared to previous low-end years including 1995 (88 bills passed into law); 2011 (90); 1981 (145); 1969 (190) and 2012 (193), according to the clerk’s web pages. Our ruling Castro said Congress in 2013 had its least productive year since 1947, advancing 67 bills or so into law. Some 73 bills made it into law in 2013, which was the least by 15 for any year since 1947. We’re taking no position on whether this production was good or bad. Castro’s by-the-numbers' claim is True.

pomt-05061	"Two thirds to three quarters of people without [health] insurance in Rhode Island work."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/08/elizabeth-roberts/ri-lt-gov-elizabeth-roberts-says-two-thirds-three-/	For better or worse, health-care changes are on the way. During the June 29, 2012, edition of Rhode Island Public Television's "A Lively Experiment" program, Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts, who is helping to implement the federal program in Rhode Island, said most of the uninsured Rhode Islanders who will benefit are working people. "Two thirds to three quarters of people without insurance in Rhode Island work, but don't have access to affordable health insurance," she said, pegging the number of uninsured Rhode Islanders at about 120,000. We wondered whether most of the people who don't have insurance are, in fact, getting a regular paycheck. We called Roberts' office and asked for the source of her information. Spokeswoman Maria Tocco quickly sent us to a reliable source: StateHealthFacts.org, a website of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which compiles data on health coverage gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. The survey asks questions every year about who has health insurance and whether they are working. The most recent state data are from 2010. When the elderly were excluded (they are covered by Medicare), the Census Bureau found that 119,100 Rhode Islanders were without health insurance, essentially the 120,000 number cited by Roberts. The Census Bureau also found that 77 percent of the uninsured are from families in which at least one person has a part-time or full-time job. The remaining 23 percent are from families where nobody is working. Because that 77 percent includes children and adults who aren’t working at all, the actual percentage of workers who are uninsured is less than 77 percent -- probably significantly less. As Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller noted, insurance is often sold by family unit, which is why the numbers are framed that way. Koller sent us to another source, a 2010 "Study of Rhode Island's Uninsured" done by the consulting firm Mathematica Policy Research. It estimated that in 2010 there were 103,400 uninsured Rhode Islanders age 20 to 64. That included 49,600 people (or 48 percent) who were employed, significantly less than Roberts' estimate. The remaining people make up two groups, 22,000 (21 percent) traditionally classified as unemployed and 31,800 "not employed" (31 percent). Project director Deborah Chollet said the "not employed" group consists of people who are not looking for work, such as early retirees, people who regard themselves as too disabled to do their job, or parents staying home to care for a child while the other parent works. Koller said the best numbers are probably from the census because they use data that are more recent and they're not extrapolated, as the Mathematica numbers are. "The point that we're trying to make is that the uninsured are people who are working. They're in working situations," said Koller, the health insurance commissioner. "It's not that they're layabouts or something like that. They're working and they don't have access to it, or they have access to it and they can't afford it." Our ruling Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts said, "Two thirds to three quarters of people without [health] insurance in Rhode Island work." Unfortunately, none of the data precisely match up with the way she cast her statement. The Kaiser numbers Roberts cited to support her claim represent families, not individuals. The Mathematica study showed far fewer working people without insurance, but it's based on a projection using older data. In cases where the facts don't precisely match up with the statement, PolitiFact tries to use the data that are available and triangulate to get the truth. Roberts' larger point, that a lot of Rhode Islanders without health insurance are working people, is true. But she gave a range of two thirds to three quarters -- 67 percent to 75 percent. The Rhode Island studies we consulted suggest the true number is higher than 48 percent but lower than 77 percent. We rate her statement as Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-09006	"John Oxendine is under a state ethics investigation because he illegally funneled more than $120,000 to his campaign from shady insurance political action committees in Alabama."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/12/karen-handel/gubernatorial-candidate-karen-handel-said-rival-jo/	A glossy eight-page mailer sent by Republican gubernatorial hopeful Karen Handel casts her as above the allegations of backroom dealings and ethics violations of her primary rivals. "Karen Handel has fought corruption, while the good ole boys are politics as usual," her mailer states. With the help of unflattering photographs and excerpts from newspaper articles, the mailer aired the dirty laundry of her three biggest primary opponents. One was the race's behemoth: state Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine. With his deep campaign coffers, name recognition and high polling numbers, Oxendine has long been considered the campaign front-runner. Handel's mailer hits Oxendine right where it hurts: his ethics. "John Oxendine is under a state ethics investigation because he illegally funneled more than $120,000 to his campaign from shady insurance political action committees in Alabama," it said. Oxendine's run-in with the State Ethics Commission is renown. The commission has been mulling the legality of those campaign contributions ever since The Atlanta Journal-Constitution broke the story in May 2009. Since then, Republicans have said that should Oxendine win the July 20 primary, the party may lose its grip on the governor's seat. But is it correct to call what Oxendine did "illegal"? Oxendine's troubles began with 10 campaign contributions made in late 2008. The $120,000, which is about 10 times what state rules allow, was given by 10 Alabama political action committees set up by Donald V. Watkins, a director of State Mutual Insurance. Oxendine regulates State Mutual and its subsidiary Admiral Life Insurance Co. of America. Both headed by Delos "Dee" Yancey III, a prominent businessmen who is one of Oxendine's friends. The problem is that Georgia's Ethics-in-Government Act prohibits officials from taking money directly from companies that they regulate. It also bans using multiple PACs to skirt contribution limits of $12,200 per candidate in an election cycle. Oxendine returned the money and maintains he did not violate the law. His campaign declined to comment. The accusations are real, but whether they are true is far from settled, said Tom Plank, the commission's legal counsel. Typically, the commission holds a preliminary hearing where members vote on whether there are "reasonable grounds" to think the accused violated the Ethics-in-Government Act, Plank said. If there are, an administrative judge hears the case and issues a written ruling. If there's reason to believe the violation was willful, the case can be booted to criminal court. The defendant is prosecuted on a misdemeanor charge, Plank said. Proceedings for Oxendine's case are in their early stages. State Mutual filed suit in Superior Court of Fulton County accusing members of the commission of political bias. A judge barred the commission from holding a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 24, and it has since decided against holding a hearing before the July 20 primaries. This means the commission has yet to decide whether the case against Oxendine has enough merit to go before a judge. Still, the Handel campaign stands behind its statement. "Just because he hasn't been convicted yet doesn't mean he didn't break the law," Handel campaign manager Dan McLagan said. But it doesn't mean he broke the law, either. The bulk of Handel's statement is accurate. Oxendine is under a state ethics investigation. It does concern $120,000 worth of questionable campaign contributions that came from Alabama PACs. Those PACs were set up by the director of two insurance companies regulated by Oxendine and headed by Yancey, one of his friends. But stating as a fact that Oxendine "illegally funneled" money is incorrect. Handel's mailer said a violation took place even though the commission has yet to vote on whether the case has merit. No judge has been assigned to the case, much less issued a ruling. If the mailer said Oxendine was "accused" of illegally funneling money it would have been correct. But it didn't. We rate Handel's statement Half True.	None	Karen Handel	None	None	None	2010-07-12T06:00:00	2010-06-28	['Alabama']

pomt-04504	Because of Obamacare, "over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-said-health-care-premiums-went-slower-any-ti/	Mitt Romney likes to say that if he’s elected, he will repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law "on day one." During the Oct. 3, 2012, presidential debate, he predicted what would happen if he isn’t elected: The Affordable Care Act would take full effect in 2014 and "health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family." That prompted the following response from Obama: "The fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we're already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate." For this fact-check, we’re focusing on Obama’s claim that, "over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years." We’ll also examine whether Obama was correct to suggest this slowing in premium growth is connected to reforms in his health care law. Health care spending -- not premiums -- grew slower than at any time in 50 years Obama’s statement about historically low growth is rooted in a real study. Economists from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published a report in January 2012 that said health care spending grew less in 2009 and 2010 than any time in 51 years. Preliminary estimates for 2011 show the same trend. But Obama got himself into trouble by saying "premiums" instead of "total health care spending." It’s not his first time, either. We dealt with this linguistic confusion before when we evaluated Obama’s pledge to reduce health care premiums for the typical family by $2,500 -- a Promise Broken on the Obameter. Using Project Vote Smart, a database of public statements by politicians, we found evidence of Obama using the two terms interchangeably, which is a mistake. Premiums, what people pay to buy health insurance coverage, are only one part of health care spending. Total health care spending includes out-of-pocket costs such as copays, coinsurance and deductibles; depending on the insurance plan, some medical services and physicians aren’t covered at all. It’s worth noting that evidence exists to back up the part of Obama’s claim about premiums. A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group, found slowing growth in the cost of premiums. Dr. Drew Altman, president and CEO of Kaiser, called annual growth in premiums -- along with total health care spending and per capita spending -- "strikingly low." The Kaiser survey, however, goes back 14 years, not 50. Credit the recession, not Obamacare We also wondered: Are premiums and total health spending growing at slower rates because of Obama’s health care law? Obama characterized the slowing growth of premiums as "progress" and mentioned rebates -- a piece of the Affordable Care Act -- in the same breath. We asked for an assessment from Dr. Bradley Herring, a health economist who teaches a course on the history of U.S. health reform at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. "I don’t think it’s fair for one to attribute that slowed growth in healthcare spending to the ACA," Herring said. "Most health economists attribute much of the slowdown (in) the growth in healthcare spending to the recession." Even the government study Obama used to make his claim gives credit to the economic downturn -- not the new health care law. It says the recession between 2007 and 2009 had a delayed effect on health care spending. When the economy goes south, high unemployment, losses in private health insurance coverage, drops in household income and companies’ reluctance to hire new employees result in less health care spending, according to the report. The study noted that much of the Affordable Care Act isn’t in place yet, so its effect on recent health care spending has been minimal. For instance, the report estimated the law’s net impact on 2010 spending to be less than 1 percentage point. "Most of the 2010 provisions, other than a few specific provisions affecting Medicare payments, had a negligible impact on total spending or shifted the distribution of spending without affecting the overall rate of growth," the report said. Our ruling Obama said health care premiums have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years and suggested it was because of the Affordable Care Act. He mistakenly referred to premiums, not all health care spending for 50 years. The historical data for premiums is generally consistent with his claim, but they only go back 14 years. He also vastly exaggerated the impact of his health care law on the costs. Experts say that's due to the recession, not the law. We rate his claim False.

pomt-07002	"We’re losing almost 6,000 state jobs."	true	/texas/statements/2011/jul/09/eddie-rodriguez/austin-rep-eddie-rodriguez-says-budget-cuts-almost/	Critiquing the new state budget, state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez told the Central Texas Democratic Forum that Austin will suffer because of cuts imposed by the Republican-controlled Legislature. "We’re losing almost 6,000 state jobs," the Austin Democrat said June 22. "If you lose a lot of state employees, it affects Austin" — the state capital — "more than almost any other place in Texas." We wondered whether Rodriguez was right about the number of state jobs getting cut in the 2012-13 budget. Nate Walker, Rodriguez's chief of staff, pointed us to an analysis of the adopted budget by the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. The report has a section on "full-time-equivalent positions," which include state agency jobs as well as higher-education jobs that are funded with money appropriated by the Legislature. According to the report, the new state budget provides for 235,240 FTEs in fiscal year 2012 and 235,135 FTEs in 2013. Compared with the 240,862 FTEs that were budgeted for the current fiscal year, which ends Aug. 31, that's a reduction of 5,727 FTEs by 2013, or 2.4 percent. But does that mean 5,727 fewer state jobs by 2013? Sort of. According to the state auditor's office, which collects information on the state's work force, one full-time-equivalent position is "any combination of employees whose hours total 40." That means that an FTE total is not necessarily equivalent to a head count — one FTE position could be filled by two people working 20 hours a week, for example — and that the number of jobs being cut over the next two years could actually be greater than 5,727. It's also important to note that eliminating a position doesn't always mean someone gets laid off. Employers frequently trim their work forces by getting rid of unfilled jobs. And after the 2004-05 budget was written, the last time the state faced a significant revenue shortfall, most of the 10,000 eliminated state jobs were cleared through attrition and a retirement incentive, not layoffs, according to a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman article. According to the most recent information from the state auditor’s office, there were about 255,000 full- and part-time state agency and state-paid higher education employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. So, how many of those people are expected to lose their state government jobs because of the budget cuts? That's difficult to determine because we don't know how many of the positions destined to be eliminated are currently filled. Also, the state doesn't have a centralized, single source to go to for layoff plans; those decisions are made at the agency level. Still, news about layoffs at state agencies has been trickling out. The Statesman recently reported that the Texas Education Agency and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department are each expected to lay off more than 100 people. And in an interview with the Statesman published July 2, University of Texas President William Powers Jr. said that roughly 600 UT employees would be laid off "over a couple-year period." In Dallas, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center announced June 29 that it had cut 105 employees, according to a Fort Worth Star-Telegram article. Summing up: Rodriguez’s statement refers to full-time-equivalent positions as jobs. While that's not a perfect fit, it's understandable shorthand for what the new budget requires. We rate this statement as True.	None	Eddie Rodriguez	None	None	None	2011-07-09T06:00:00	2011-06-22	['None']

pomt-10367	"He won't even support his colleague's ... motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/30/ralph-nader/obama-hasnt-backed-censure-for-bush/	Longtime consumer advocate and independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader, seeking to attract voters to the left of Sen. Barack Obama, tweaked the Democratic candidate for his unwillingness to censure President Bush. "He won't even support his colleague Sen. Russ Feingold's motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps," Nader said in a June 18 interview on the radio program Democracy Now! "He — you know, he's letting the corporate-dominated city of Washington, the corporations who actually rule us now in Washington, determine his agenda. And that does not augur well." Feingold of Wisconsin, known as one of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, proposed a resolution to censure Bush in March 2006, three months after the New York Times reported that the president had secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants. Censure, a congressional action that is not defined in the Constitution, has evolved as a formal expression of strong condemnation that is short of impeachment. The Senate has censured only one U.S. president — Andrew Jackson, in 1834, for firing the secretary of the treasury in a dispute over deposits in a national bank. Jackson's party, the Democrats, later expunged the censure. Feingold's proposal was to "condemn [Bush's] unlawful authorization of wiretaps of Americans within the United States without obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978." Republicans immediately attacked the measure, and many Democrats distanced themselves from it, including the senator and future presidential candidate from Illinois. "It's not impeachment, but it's not something you apply lightly," Obama told the Chicago Tribune at the time. "And whether we want to start applying censure motions or impeachment when there are questions about a president's authority in national security is something that you have to be judicious about." Only three senators — Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and John Kerry, D-Mass. — have co-sponsored Feingold's resolution. It has not moved out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Obama campaign did not respond to requests to clarify his position on this censure proposal. His past comments and his decision not to co-sponsor Feingold's resolution lead us to conclude Nader was correct in saying Obama does not support it. We find Nader's claim to be True.

pomt-05697	Giant companies like Toyota will not locate in a state that has not passed a right-to-work law	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/11/stephen-laffey/former-cranston-mayor-stephen-laffey-says-giant-co/	Stephen Laffey, the former Cranston mayor and unsuccessful Republican U.S. Senate candidate, was in Rhode Island recently to promote his new film, "Fixing America." The movie is a documentary about Laffey’s travels through 18 states, where he asked a question that is the film’s premise: "What if regular Americans were asked for their ideas on how to fix America's problems?" Laffey, who now lives on a ranch in Fort Collins, Colo., made several appearances on local radio programs to tout the film. On WPRO’s "Morning News" show, he talked about one possible fix: passing right-to-work laws, which allow workers in union jobs to opt out of union membership and paying dues. Giant companies like Toyota, he said, would not locate in states without right-to-work laws. Some Rhode Island Republicans have been pushing for a right-to-work law in Rhode Island, arguing that it would help make the state more business friendly and attract new jobs. In January, we checked a claim from Republican state Sen. Nicholas Kettle, who said right-to-work states don't have budget deficits, ruling it Mostly False. Certainly, Toyota has a giant impact on the U.S. economy. The Japanese auto manufacturer has been doing business in the United States since 1957 and assembling cars here for 25 years. With 10 U.S. manufacturing facilities, Toyota directly employs 29,089 people and has a direct investment of $17.9 billion in the country, according to the company’s 2011 U.S. operations brochure. So we wondered: Was Laffey was on target on his very specific assertion that the company would not locate in states without right-to-work laws? We quickly got our answer when we checked Toyota’s website and saw that it did, indeed, have plants in states without right-to-work laws. Then, we called Toyota and asked spokesman Ed Lewis if Toyota refuses to locate in states that lack right-to-work laws. "No," he said. Lewis confirmed that Toyota has two manufacturing plants in Missouri, plus one each in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and California. How many of those plants are in right-to-work states? According to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, there are 23 right-to-work states. Five of the Toyota plants are in one of those states (Tennessee, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas) while the five others are in non-right-to-work states (two in Missouri and one each in West Virginia, Kentucky and California). Lewis said the most significant factors in locating a plant include easy access to highways and railways, access to supplier networks and tax incentive packages. The location of the existing Toyota plants shows that right-to-work laws is not among the most significant factors in locating a plant, he said. Kentucky, the state with Toyota’s largest direct employment and investment, is not a right-to-work state. California, the state with Toyota’s second-largest direct employment figures, is also not a right-to-work state. The state with Toyota's second largest direct investment, Indiana, became a right-to-work state on Feb. 1 -- more than 15 years after Toyota located there. It is the first state in more than a decade to enact right-to-work legislation and the only one in the Midwestern manufacturing belt to have such a law. When we asked him what he based his statement on, Laffey responded in an e-mail, "The right to work vs. not right to work issue sure is a major consideration of any manufacturing company that is looking to locate a plant in the United States. Let’s take a look!" Laffey included numerous links to stories touting the advantages of right-to-work states to manufacturers. And he attached a spreadsheet he’d created, using U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data, that shows a state-by-state comparison of the growth in real gross domestic product for manufacturing between 2000 and 2010. Laffey’s table showed an 18.63-percent increase in right-to-work states compared with an 8.28-percent increase in other states. "It would seem to be better, all else [being equal], and it never is, to be a right to work state instead of not -- if you would like jobs for the people," he wrote. But that’s a broader public policy question. Turning to the more narrow question about his statement on WPRO, Laffey said, "If I overstated the case in my hours on the radio, I apologize. If it helps educate the people of Rhode Island about the necessity of taking action to improve the business climate, that would be a good step forward." Our ruling Laffey said big companies such as Toyota don’t locate in states without right-to-work laws. A quick web search showed that four of the nine states where Toyota has manufacturing plants do not have right-to-work laws. And a spokesman for Toyota said such laws are not a significant factor in the company’s deciding where to build plants. We rule his statement False.

pomt-14188	"We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/24/bob-graham/bob-graham-saudi-arabia-created-al-qaida/	Controversy is swirling over 28 pages from the congressional report on the 9/11 terror attacks that have been kept hidden from the public. There is a suspicion that they implicate Saudi Arabia, a United States ally in the Middle East. The Saudis have, for years, vigorously denied any involvement in the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. Former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., co-chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee that helped write the report and has pushed for release of all the documents looking at Saudi involvement in the attacks. Sunday on Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked why United States and Saudi officials don't want the information released. "To me, the most important unanswered question of 9/11 is, did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported?" Graham said. "I think it's implausible to think that people who couldn't speak English, had never been in the United States before, (and) as a group were not well-educated could have done that. So who was the most likely entity to have provided them that support? And I think all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia. We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida. It was a creation of Saudi Arabia." We wondered if, in fact, it was Saudi Arabia that created al-Qaida, the organization led by Osama bin Laden that engineered the attacks. Origin stories The terrorist group's origins can be traced to Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union waged a long and ultimately fruitless war from 1979 to 1989. It was the era of the Cold War, and the United States backed the Muslim insurgents who were fighting the Soviets. The Afghan freedom fighters were also getting backing from fellow Muslims in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries. One person giving money was bin Laden, the son of a wealthy construction magnate. But he also helped establish what was known as the "Golden Chain," a group of Arab donors who gave millions for the cause. The money went to something known as the Services Office, which was run by bin Laden and a Palestinian religious scholar name Abdullah Azzam. The office recruited, trained and equipped thousands of foreign "holy warriors," known as mujahideen, from more than 50 countries. Their training camp was known as "the base," which translates to al-Qaida. In 1988, when the war against the Soviets was winding down, there was a meeting in Pakistan where al-Qaida was formed. Bin Laden wanted to take the fight of jihad to other countries, driving out the corrupting influence of Western countries and replace it with fundamentalist Islam. Bin Laden moved to Saudi Arabia. In 1990, after Iraq President Saddam Hussein invaded neighboring Kuwait, Saudi Arabia's rulers felt vulnerable and asked the United States to intervene. That upset bin Laden. "Bin Laden viewed this development as an unbearable humiliation for all Muslims — the land of the Prophet defiled by infidels," said Philippe Migaux, writing in The History of Terrorism. He offered his mujahideen fighters to help defend the country, but the offer was rejected. He then issued a fatwa, or religious edict, that denounced the ruling House of Saud, calling it corrupt. The Saudi government expelled him in 1991, ultimately stripping him of Saudi citizenship in 1994. He ended up in Sudan, where he operated al-Qaida and coordinated terrorist attacks. Sudan expelled him on May 18, 1996 — but not before he took millions with him raised from his Golden Chain — and he went to Afghanistan, which had just been taken over by the Taliban, a fundamentalist Muslim group. He was in Afghanistan when the 9/11 attacks were launched. A question of financing So did Saudi Arabia start al-Qaida? Clearly Saudi money was directly invested to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan. But once that goal was accomplished and al-Qaida became an entity, the funding became less direct. Daniel Byman, research director at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, said in a email, "Osama bin Laden's personal wealth mattered tremendously when the group was formed in 1988. In a way this wealth was ‘Saudi’ in that his family was a Saudi family, but it's different than the Saudi state or Saudi organizations." "Over time," Byman said, "Bin Laden lost his money and/or the Saudi government froze it. A network of wealthy donors, many from the Gulf states (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia) became vital to al-Qaida funding (and easily eclipsed Bin Laden's personal wealth)." Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, "It's not as though everyone in the government supported funding al-Qaida." But there was so much Saudi-based support from individual Saudis and organizations that directed money from the Saudi government that the statement should be considered true, Gartenstein-Ross said, even if Graham's statement "is a bit under-nuanced." "He's talking about Saudi financiers. He's not claiming the state itself is a major supporter for al-Qaeda," he said. "Government-sponsored charities were doing it, and the government had to be aware it was going on." "It's clear you had government money that went through these charities," he said. "And while you could talk about lack of oversight for these charities, which used to be the line the government used, mere lack of oversight doesn't fully explain the government's position." It would be more accurate to say that the terrorist organization was created, Gartenstein-Ross said, by "Saudi financiers including organizations financed by the government that don't represent official government policy." Graham directed us to a 2003 Wall Street Journal article that reported "some of Saudi Arabia's richest and most influential families as among the first financial supporters of Osama bin Laden." However, as the article notes, that support came as bin Laden was transitioning away from fighting the Soviets. The families involved have denied funding the al-Qaida-involved terrorist attacks. Graham harked back to his comment on Meet the Press when Todd asked about the distinction between the government and wealthy individuals who happen to be Saudi Arabian. "That is a very murky line. Saudi Arabia has made it murky by its own legal action," Graham said. "Whenever a U.S. group sues a Saudi Arabian entity, whether it’s a bank, a foundation, a charity, immediately, the defense of sovereign immunity is raised. The Saudis don't recognize the difference between a royal decision and a societal decision in the same way that other countries might." Our ruling Graham said, "We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida." Al-Qaida was started in an effort, largely backed by Saudi Arabia, to force the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan. The government did not, strictly speaking, create the organization. It was the product of jihadists wanting to continue the fight after the Soviets left, using the funds of Saudi backers to do it. It prospered because of donations from Saudi interests, including groups tied to the government. The Saudis deserve significant responsibility for its existence. But Graham's phrasing could leave people believing the Saudi government itself created the terrorist organization. The truth is fuzzier, and the caveats are important. So we rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c651dc1e-3467-4404-96a7-78286af7f362	None	Bob Graham	None	None	None	2016-04-24T18:04:06	2016-04-24	['Saudi_Arabia']

pomt-10949	Says Joe Manchin said "yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/24/patrick-morrisey/did-joe-manchin-say-yes-repealing-obamacare-oppone/	The U.S. Senate race in West Virginia got a little hotter with the release of an ad by Republican Patrick Morrisey, who’s challenging incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin. The ad’s narration features the words "lied" or "lying" no fewer than four times. In the ad released July 17, the narrator said, "Liberal lying Joe’s got to go. Told Trump yes to tax cuts. He lied. Yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied. Now Manchin says he’s pro-life but seems to only want a pro-abortion Supreme Court justice. Does Manchin back abortion on demand up to the day of birth? Liberal lying Joe’s got to go." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The narration includes a lot of claims, but in this article we’ll fact check one of them — that Manchin was "yes to repealing Obamacare." At best, the ad oversimplifies Manchin’s record on Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. The law, signed by President Barack Obama, overhauled the nation’s health care insurance markets and provided other consumer protections. Manchin has been open about not liking certain parts of the law, and has said that he’d like to repeal those portions. But we were unable to find an example in which he supported a repeal of the entire law. Manchin’s comments from 2010 Here are some of the instances of Manchin’s comments in 2010, when he was the state’s governor running in a tight special election for Senate. His Republican challenger, businessman John Raese, was accusing him of being a rubber stamp for Obama. • On Sept. 18, 2010, the Gazette-Mail reported, "The governor recently told the Gazette-Mail that he backed only certain provisions (of the Affordable Care Act) — for instance, those that allow people with pre-existing conditions to get health care, or let young adults stay on their parents' health plans. ‘I wouldn't have voted for the final version of that thing with the way that it came out,’" he said. • On Sept. 27, 2010, Real Clear Politics wrote that Manchin, previously a strong supporter of the law, now "favored ‘repealing the things that are bad in that bill.’ He ticked off a list of reforms in the law that he supports and asserted there is broad agreement in both parties for many of them. ‘Can't you keep that as a good base?’ he said, adding, ‘It's a great bill.’ He emphasized that he's not calling for wholesale repeal and just wants to roll back parts of it… ." • On Oct. 8, 2010, MSNBC’s Hardball host Chris Matthews asked Manchin, "Do you like the health care bill that Obama got through? Do you like it?" Manchin responded, "No, not the way it passed." • On Oct. 11, 2010, Manchin said on Fox And Friends that he’s "always been in favor of health reform" but the law was "far too reaching … . It needs to have a lot of it repealed." • On Oct. 24, 2010, Manchin was pressed on his stance by host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Wallace asked, "You're saying now that if you'd known what was really in the bill, although last March you said you'd have voted for it, you now say you would have voted against it?" Manchin responded, "Correct. Now, knowing the existence as far as how reaching it had been, as far as an onerous, I would have." He added, however, "There's a lot of good parts to it. Why won't we fix what's wrong with it and make it better?" • Perhaps most notably, on Oct. 12, 2010, the Charleston Daily Mail quoted remarks by Manchin that had been reported previously in the Wheeling Intelligencer: "They can absolutely be sure I will vote to repeal the whole thing unless we can find common ground and common sense." That's the closest example we could find of an affirmative vote to repeal, but we couldn't find it corroborated. The Daily Mail article added, "The Daily Mail has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to talk directly to Manchin about his position on health care over the past couple of weeks." It’s clear that Manchin, facing a tough election, was walking a tightrope on the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Presented with the hypothetical question of whether he would have voted for the bill if he’d been in Congress at the time, Manchin said — some of the time — that he would not have. But that’s not the same as saying "yes to repealing Obamacare," as the ad asserts. In fact, his message in these comments was that he had some problems with the law, but he wanted to repeal the problematic portions, not the whole bill. Manchin’s 2014 comment Morrisey’s campaign also pointed us to an article in the Register-Herald of Beckley, W.Va., on Feb 20, 2014. It’s about a local town hall appearance by Manchin. Here’s the relevant portion: Both parties agree on many aspects of the ACA, such as pre-existing conditions not being excluded from coverage and no lifetime caps, but there are still many kinks that need to be fixed, Manchin said. "I will vote tomorrow to repeal (the ACA), but I want to fix the problems in it." He said the ACA is essentially a product and the government needs to find a way to "sell it" and make their customers want to buy it. The phrasing of the quote is odd, because there was no Obamacare repeal vote held the next day or the succeeding few days, according to Senate records. Indeed, Manchin’s camp quickly sought to clarify the comments at the time. After the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, reported the contents of the Register-Herald’s article, Manchin’s office provided a rebuttal that was added to the article: In an email to The Hill, Manchin said that despite his comments, he does not support repealing the law. "I have never supported repealing the Affordable Care Act because I came to Washington to find solutions to our country’s problems," he said. ... Still, Manchin said the law has "many flaws," and that those parts that can’t be fixed and should be eliminated. "We should be working together to identify which parts of the law are broken and need to be fixed," he continued. "We may learn that some parts of the law can’t be repaired, and we should eliminate those parts entirely. …" It’s incomplete to cite Manchin’s words as reported in the local newspaper, since Manchin immediately sought to clarify what was reported. Manchin’s votes on repeal bills Since his election to the Senate, Manchin has voted consistently against repealing the Affordable Care Act wholesale. In eight Senate repeal votes tracked by healthreformvotes.org, a website affiliated with the liberal-leaning group healthinsurance.org, Manchin spurned GOP-led repeal efforts and voted for the "pro-consumer" side on all eight occasions. Those eight votes included one in 2011, two in 2015, and five in 2017. Manchin’s more recent comments on the Affordable Care Act Recently, Manchin’s message on the Affordable Care Act has been consistent: He strongly approves of many things in the bill, and wants to fix the bill’s shortcomings rather than repealing it wholesale. Here’s a sampling of comments since early 2017, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans sought to repeal the law: • In March 2017, he told reporters on Capitol Hill that in West Virginia, "I got an older population, I got a poorer population, and I got an opiate issue we need to clean up. And now, talk about insult to injury. You’ve got to have a moral compass inside of you." • Manchin said in May 2017 that "if they can get rid of the word 'repeal,' Democrats can sit down," according to the Washington Examiner. • In July 2017, Manchin told WTOV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio, "I'm not voting to repeal any of the votes (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.) wants on repealing (Obamacare). I don't think you can throw the baby out with the bathwater thinking that you're going to save the baby when the baby might've needed a diaper change." • He also told the Intelligencer and the News-Register in Wheeling, W.Va., "I don’t think we should be repealing," Manchin said, adding, "Come on guys, let’s sit down and fix it." Our ruling Morrisey’s ad said that Manchin said "yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied." During his tough initial Senate race in 2010, Manchin did rhetorically put some distance between himself and the law, which was passed before he was a senator. However, to the extent that he supported repeals, he was talking about repealing portions of the law he saw as problematic — not the whole law, much of which he said he supported. Indeed, Manchin has consistently voted against and criticized wholesale repeal efforts, saying that he favored reforming portions of the law instead. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02061	41,200 veterans in Florida "don’t have health care because Scott didn’t expand Medicaid."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/may/28/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-veterans-lack-health-care-due-r/	As Memorial Day approached, both Gov. Rick Scott and his anticipated Democratic rival Charlie Crist called on Veterans Administration Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign amid news reports that VA staff falsified documentation about how long veterans were waiting to receive health care. But then Crist pointed the finger at Scott in a series of tweets on May 22 and 23: • "In addition -- if I were governor, I would take immediate action to make sure our veterans here in FL are getting the care they need." • "I’d call a special session to expand health care to the more than 41,000 FL vets who are left w/o coverage due to Scott’s failure." • "41.2k vets in FL don’t have health care because Scott didn't expand Medicaid. Unconscionable." It was that last tweet that caught our eye. We decided to fact-check the number Crist cited and whether they lack health care because Scott failed to expand Medicaid. Florida rejects Medicaid expansion Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government to care for low-income people. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand the program. Specifically, the law would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 was $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. Scott, who campaigned on his opposition to Obamacare, initially opposed Medicaid expansion. But in February 2013 he changed his position and came out in support of it. Scott didn’t push the Republican-led Legislature to approve it, and ultimately legislators rejected it. The result is that now more than 800,000 uninsured Floridians earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies to help buy insurance in the federal marketplace. Urban Institute study About 40 percent of veterans nationwide are on VA care. Generally, veterans have to serve for two consecutive years and not be discharged dishonorably to be eligible for VA health care, which gives priority to those with service-related injuries or who are low income. Also, some veterans choose not to enroll in VA care, for example, if they don’t live near any VA facilities. Some veterans who either aren’t eligible or choose not to enroll in VA could be eligible for Medicaid. In tweeting his attack, Crist linked to a March 2013 nationwide study by the Washington-based Urban Institute. The study analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data to estimate how many military veterans aged 19 to 64 don’t have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) The study found that 535,000 uninsured veterans nationwide would qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. However, the majority would only qualify for Medicaid if their state chose to expand it. The institute’s report said in Florida there were 103,700 non-elderly veterans who lacked health insurance, which included 41,200 who would qualify for Medicaid if the state expanded the program. We ran the study by Jack Tsai, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale who co-wrote a separate study about the number of uninsured veterans and Medicaid expansion, but didn’t include a state-by-state breakdown. Tsai said that the methodology of the Urban Institute study is "fairly solid." However, he noted it is based on data from a few years ago, and that Crist’s statement didn’t include details about the study’s limitations. There are various reasons why some veterans remain uninsured: Some might feel they don’t need insurance or haven’t gotten around to obtaining it or may not be aware of their VA eligibility or don’t want anything to go to the VA. Likewise, there might be similar reasons to not enroll with Medicaid, while others could be in between jobs. We asked spokespersons for the governor’s office and his campaign if they had any evidence to refute Crist’s claim. Campaign spokesman Greg Blair reiterated that Scott supported Medicaid but the Legislature didn’t go along with it. He also pointed to 2011 Medicaid reform intended to lower the cost of health care. Our ruling Crist said in a tweet that 41,200 veterans in Florida "don’t have health care because Scott didn’t expand Medicaid." Crist’s tweet linked to a map that cited the Urban Institute study showing the number of uninsured veterans in each state that might qualify for the Medicaid expansion. Crist’s tweet omits two major points: Some of those 41,200 veterans could get health care other ways. It’s possible some are eligible for services through the VA but for a variety of reasons haven’t sought those benefits. Also, Scott’s not solely responsible for Florida failing to expand Medicaid. After Scott opposed the expansion, he came out in support of it in February 2013. But Scott didn’t lobby for it, and the Legislature rejected it last year. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14164	"Pat Toomey advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/29/katie-mcginty/did-sen-pat-toomey-say-he-wanted-eliminate-all-cor/	Katie McGinty has been the Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania Senate for all of three days, but the general election campaign between her and incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey has already begun. In a press release circulated Thursday, McGinty’s campaign -- running on the "working families" platform -- wrote that "Pat Toomey advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes." It cited a 2007 CNBC interview in which Toomey, a Republican, said he was in favor of eliminating the tax burden on corporations. Eliminating all taxes didn’t sound like Toomey’s campaign platform. In fact, on his campaign website, Toomey has an entire section of his "issues" page dedicated to "eliminating corporate welfare." So we decided to check the claim. In 2007, Toomey was a congressman from Allentown and the president of the Club For Growth, a conservative group that advocates for the reduction or elimination of corporate taxes. Toomey appeared on CNBC to discuss tax reform and cutting the corporate tax rate (the top marginal tax rate is 35 percent) which, he says in the interview, would stimulate the economy. "I would disagree with the idea that we want to have a corporate tax burden at all," he says in the interview, going on to say: "All it really does is it creates this insidious opportunity for politicians to play games, to create winners and losers, to have manipulative deductions and loopholes and write-offs. We shouldn’t have any of that. Let’s have a transparent system. Let’s not tax corporations. Let’s allow them to compete most aggressively on the global economy." When the interviewer skeptically asks Toomey if that type of reform would be possible in today’s political environment, he seems to acknowledge it’s a stretch, saying, "a rational discussion can only lead to the conclusion that we should have a simpler tax code and rates, at a minimum, much lower. I’d prefer none on corporations. But much lower would be better." Toomey's campaign pointed out the senator's formally proposed tax plans have included lowering the corporate tax rate -- the highest in the developed world -- in a "revenue neutral manner by eliminating tax loopholes." His budget proposals for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. The CNBC interview is one of the only examples of a time when Toomey advocated specifically for the full elimination of corporate income taxes; in front of Congress and in otherwise public appearances, he typically calls for a simple reduction in the tax. "This old clip was simply a discussion about how higher taxes hurts job creation," Toomey's spokesman Ted Kwong said. His CNBC comments in 2007 don’t exactly jibe with what he wrote in his 2009 book "The Road to Prosperity: How to Grow Our Economy and Revive the American Dream." In the book, Toomey wrote about two other tax systems he’d favor over our current one: A flat tax, which would require businesses pay a 17 percent tax on income (a decrease from the current 35 percent), and a "fair tax," which would totally eliminate corporate and income taxes in favor of a sales tax. Still, he writes, "my preference lies with the flat tax." Toomey’s campaign website notes the senator "supports closing special-interest loopholes and lowering rates for all Americans," but doesn’t mention lowering or eliminating taxes on corporations. Decreasing or eliminating corporate taxes is a tough sell. A 2014 Gallup poll showed two thirds of Americans think corporations "pay too little" in taxes. Despite that, reducing the corporate tax rate has some bipartisan backing. In 2012, President Obama proposed reducing the rate to 28 percent. Our ruling McGinty’s campaign says Toomey "advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes." While he told CNBC back in 2007 "Let’s not tax corporations" and his book mentions it as one of his two favored tax plans, the incumbent Senator seems to know that corporate taxes aren’t going away completely anytime soon. While it's true he’s most recently advocated for a lower tax rate and a simplified system, he did tell CNBC viewers he’d prefer no tax at all. We rate the claim True.

pomt-06716	"In (Sen. Marco) Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/sep/01/ed-schultz/ed-schultz-says-social-security-lifts-million-flor/	Sen. Marco Rubio, in a recent speech from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, said Social Security and Medicare "weakened us as a people." We used to take care of one another, and our neighbors, until government took over, he explained. Liberal MSNBC pundit Ed Schultz called that "Psychotalk." It's a segment on the Ed Show he uses to scorn comments by politicians and other pundits, most recently Donald Trump, Jon Huntsman, Mitt Romney and George Will. On Aug. 25, he challenged the star Florida conservative, calling him a political hack who wants to get rid of social safety nets. (Rubio, for his part, said in the speech he believes in America's retirement programs, but that they must be changed for those who aren't in them yet to make them sustainable.) A Florida statistic during the segment caught our attention: "In Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty." PolitiFact Florida wanted to know, is that true? (We also checked a statement by Rubio from the same speech about the ratio of workers to retirees in the Social Security program dipping from 16 to 1 down to 3 to 1.) On its face, the number seems plausible. Social Security benefits, set up as a result of a 1935 law signed by President Franklin Roosevelt, helped support 52 million retired and disabled workers and their relatives in 2009, according to the agency that administers them. But who provided Schultz's number? We took a closer look at a Nexis transcript, which we edited slightly after watching the segment ourselves: SCHULTZ: And in Psychotalk tonight, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, he's on the attack against the Big Three. Now Rubio is an early favorite to take the No. 2 spot on the Republican presidential ticket next year thanks to his tea party ideology and his pretty boy looks. But his policies are downright ugly. During a speech at the Reagan Library this week, Rubio had this to say about programs like Social Security and Medicare. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: These programs actually weakened us as a people. You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them. You saved for your retirement and for your future because you had to. … But all of that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. ... And as government crowded out the institutions in our society that did these things traditionally, it weakened our people. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCHULTZ: I will tell you what's weakening our people: political hacks like Marco Rubio, who want to get rid of social safety nets. Before Medicare -- check this out -- half of American seniors didn't have hospital insurance. Almost a third of Americans lived in poverty. But after Medicare was signed into law, the poverty rate among senior citizens plummeted from 30 percent to around 10 percent in just 30 years. And it's the same story with Social Security. According to the Census Bureau data, 20 million more Americans would live below the poverty line if Social Security did not exist. Forty five percent of senior citizens would be poor. And in Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty. But these right wingers remain determined to dismantle the Big Three, no matter how many Americans suffer. For Marco Rubio to say programs like Medicare and Social Security weaken Americans is flat out Psychotalk. For this fact-check, we're setting aside the national statistics Schultz offered about Medicare and Social Security and focusing on his Florida claim. Where did the Florida statistic come from? Schultz had said in a previous paragraph, "according to Census Bureau data," and a spokeswoman for his show, Tanya Hayre, confirmed "we source the Census Bureau in our reporting." But a graphic on the screen as Schultz spoke gave a different source: the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. We found the report. It shows Schultz accurately repeated numbers from the think tank's 2010 analysis of Census data. The authors of the analysis, Paul Van de Water and Arloc Sherman, took the official definition of poverty used by the Census Bureau, then crunched Census-provided numbers on families' poverty status with and without Social Security benefits. Without Social Security, they found, 19.8 million more Americans would have been poor in 2008, including 1.07 million in Florida. (The state numbers relied on a three-year average for 2006-08, to boost the reliability of the results.) So far, so good, for Schultz. But whenever someone cites government data but, in fact, is relying on analysis of that data by a think tank, we check to see whether other experts interpret the same data differently. For example, in July Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., cited the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in a claim about the effect of tax cuts on the national debt -- when her conclusion came from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In that case it turned out that conservative think tanks used the same CBO numbers to support a different conclusion. We ultimately rated her statement Half True. In this case, Van de Water and Sherman named in their report a conservative critic of their analysis, Charles Blahous, one of two public trustees of Social Security and Medicare and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. We traded e-mails with him. We also called up Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. A note: These people all know each other. Biggs and Van de Water worked together at the Social Security Administration while Blahous was a special assistant to the president for economic policy focusing on "retirement security issues." Now they all work at think tanks, helping shape how we view public policy. And as Van de Water put it, "We worked together, but we disagree on a number of things." Indeed. Here's what Biggs and Blahous say about Van de Water's analysis: It's meaningless and misleading. "The SSA used to publish these figures but stopped because they were deceptive, so now the lefty think tanks calculate the figures themselves," Biggs said. "That says something!" Van de Water confirmed the Social Security Administration used to do the same analysis while he was there but stopped early into President George W. Bush's administration -- because of views like Blahous'. So the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities started computing the the poverty figures, using the same methodology, he said. What do Blahous and Biggs find misleading? The analysis focuses on benefits only, not the years and years of payroll taxes that families fed into the system. What if those tax dollars had stayed in workers' pockets? Would they still face poverty? "To make any reasonable statements about the program's net effect on poverty, one needs to come up with a model for how high poverty would be without each of Social Security benefits or taxes," Blahous said. He says to get a truer sense of the program's current effect, you would have to consult studies like these from the Social Security actuary. In the early years of Social Security, its effect on poverty was much greater -- workers got out in benefits much more than they paid in taxes. It offered a windfall to early beneficiaries at the expense of later ones. But look at Tables 2 or 3 in the actuary's July 2010 publication, he said, and you see that would shift if the program raises taxes or cuts benefits, as it would need to to fully finance benefits more than 25 years from now. For example, low-wage single males born in 1937 or later -- retiring this century -- would actually get out less than they put in. (Very low-wage males, plus females and couples would fare better longer.) As an aside, that crunch will continue as fewer and fewer workers support more retirees. Meanwhile, the Social Security Administration had to dip into its trust fund several years earlier than anticipated, in part because of the economy. Still, as PolitiFact has ruled twice, it's wrong to say the program's out of money. That makes it all the more misleading, Blahous and Biggs say, to claim that Social Security lifts more than a million people out of poverty in Florida based on analysis of benefits only. They might not have been in poverty if not for the taxes they paid, and for some it would have been a better deal to invest directly in Treasury bonds rather than in the Social Security system. "I'm sure it does reduce poverty, but not by anything like they're talking about," Biggs said. "... They're looking at one side of an equation in a very simplistic way." Is that the whole story? Not quite. Let's say low-income workers -- presumably at higher risk for poverty in retirement -- didn't have to pay Social Security taxes. Would they carefully put aside that amount? It's more likely they would spend it, Van de Water said. Not only that, Social Security is designed to pay out more to low-income workers than they put in. In other words, letting them keep their payroll taxes wouldn't support them as well as providing them Social Security checks. "It's clear that Social Security keeps lots of low-income elderly out of poverty in retirement," Van de Water said. He acknowledges his analysis answers a very narrow question: How many people would fall into poverty if Social Security checks stopped today? It's not as good for answering the broader question: What if Social Security had never existed at all? And of course, that's not an easy question to answer, said another expert, Olivia Mitchell of the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania. "If we had no Social Security, people would have to work longer, save more, become more financially literate, buy annuities and private disability insurance, contribute to their own IRAs and pensions, and probably rely more on family and charity if they were hoping to retire," she said. "We can't easily run the counterfactual experiment!" Yet it's the broader question that Schultz suggests on his MSNBC show in his setup for the Florida statistic. He says, "20 million more Americans would live below the poverty line if Social Security did not exist." If it had disappeared into thin air one day in 2008, sure. If it had never come into being? Much tougher to say. So when he says, "In Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty," he's accurately quoting a study by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities about what would happen if Social Security checks suddenly stopped. But the statistic doesn't directly address Rubio's apparent point, that America would be stronger if FDR had never signed Social Security into existence. That's a matter for thoughtful speculation or a raft of much more complicated studies. We also found it misleading that Schultz mentioned just the Census Bureau as his source, while graphics on the screen in small type confirmed the numbers were in fact crunched by a think tank. For those reasons, we find he used the statistic out of context, and rate it Half True.	None	Ed Schultz	None	None	None	2011-09-01T11:46:41	2011-08-25	['None']
pomt-14400	The rate of U.S. female homicide victims outnumbers 24 other developed countries by more than 2½ to 1.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/14/everytown-gun-safety/anti-gun-group-uses-old-data-incorrectly-compare-i/	We see a lot of statistics about the murder rate in the United States, particularly as part of the debate over gun control. But a Facebook meme making the rounds is contending that the homicide rate for American women is more than two and a half times higher that it is for other developed countries. A reader in Utah pointed us to the meme on the page of a group called Everytown for Gun Safety, whose web page lists former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a member of the advisory board. The reader wondered if it was accurate. We did, too. Posted March 8, the meme reports the rates of female homicide for 25 countries. The United States' is 1.54 per 100,000 women. That's just over 2½ times the rate for the second-ranked country, Switzerland, whose rate is listed as 0.61 per 100,000. The chart does not list a source. First, a few things to note about the meme. Although Everytown is an anti-gun violence group, the meme mentions nothing about weapons. The legend at the bottom simply says the chart is listing murder rates. Also, because the headline on the meme talks about "America's Deadly Domestic Violence Problem," it's not clear if the group is talking about all causes of homicide or just domestic violence homicide. The answer turns out to be neither. Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for the group, said the data come from a 2002 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association that used World Health Organization statistics on female murder rates — both gun related and non-gun related — from 1994 to 1999. The data in the Everytown meme are the rates for gun homicides, not all homicides. The rates were from 25 populous high-income countries. But when you look at all homicides — which the chart claims to be measuring — the rates are different. The United States was still No. 1, with 3.21 murders per 100,000 women during the 1990s. But the United States was not as far ahead of the rest of the pack. The rate was 1.7 times higher than No. 2 Finland and about 2.4 times higher than the countries in third, fourth and fifth place, which were Switzerland, Belgium and New Zealand respectively. "The U.S. female homicide victimization rate was 5 times higher than the rate for the other high-income countries combined," said the researchers, led by David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. More recent data When we contacted Hemenway seeking newer data, he sent us a November 2015 paper done with Erin Grinshteyn of the University of Nevada-Reno, which found that the U.S. homicide rate was 7 times higher than 23 other high-income countries — 25 times higher if you only look at gun deaths. But the paper offers no breakdown by gender. It used 2010 mortality data from the World Health Organization. We contacted Grinshteyn directly, and she sent us the 2010 rates for women in more detail. We've put it in chart form. Newer homicide estimates are available in a WHO report released in 2014. They show a similar pattern. In that ranking, female murder rates in the United States in 2012 were much higher than 22 other countries. Finland and Belgium ranked second and third, at 1.3 each, but the difference is not as dramatic as the Everytown Facebook chart. The report did not compile rates for female gun deaths. Lamb also said the group was in the process of fixing the chart, which had been shared 1,869 times when we last checked. Our ruling Everytown for Gun Safety produced a chart showing that the rate of U.S. female homicides outnumbers the rates in 24 other developed countries by more than 2½ to 1. But the rates in the chart are for gun-related homicides, not all homicides. Nor are they the rates for domestic violence deaths among women, contrary to the headline on the chart. Finally, the data are about two decades out of date. The relationship that caught our eye — female homicides being 2½ times more common than other developed countries — is not as extreme, according to the latest estimates, although the United States is clearly far ahead of other developed countries. The chart gets the general trend right, but most of its actual numbers are off. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09427	Several times, Obama "has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally ... ."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/15/mitt-romney/obama-remarks-never-true-apology/	Mitt Romney's new book is called No Apology. The first chapter makes it clear who he thinks is apologizing: President Barack Obama. "Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined," Romney writes. "It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." Obama might give compliments to America here and there, Romney adds. "But what makes his speeches jump out at his audience are the steady stream of criticisms, put-downs, and jabs directed at the nation he was elected to represent and defend. "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Mulism sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." As we did our research, we noticed that the idea that Obama has traveled the world apologizing is popular among some conservative Web sites. The Heritage Foundation, for example, published an analysis in June 2009 called "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies." Similar compilations are available elsewhere, and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has mentioned Obama apologizing several times. But as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: "sorry." Merriam-Webster defines an apology as "an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret." If someone is apologizing, it seems that is a discrete act that can be verified and fact-checked. We set out to discover how accurate Romney was in describing Obama as constantly apologizing. What Obama said We read the seven Obama speeches and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks, and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now. To summarize them here, the remarks include major speeches, press conferences, and remarks at a town hall meeting. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he is tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together. At a town hall meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. "On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated," Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team. "Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable," Obama said. "I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply "move forward." Here are his exact remarks: "In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward." Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in the fact we're checking. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; it remains open as of this writing.) Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism. Obama said that after 9/11, "our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions." He also said that the Guantanamo prison "likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies." Did Obama apologize? We sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing. • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advanage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the U.S. has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. "There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation," he said. • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret." Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. "There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will," Murphy said. "The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that. • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." Other presidential apologies Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. "The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well," Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. "We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope." Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. "The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong," Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. "To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry." Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. "My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy and it is not over," he said. "The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all." Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. "We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America," Bush said. "I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America." Obama's praise and motivations While Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledges as much when he writes that Obama "always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there." In Cairo, Obama called the United States "one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world." At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, "What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history." And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama said: "Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity." We reviewed several analyses of what Obama's foreign policy goals are in traveling the world and readily admitting to America's mistakes. One of the most interesting essays we read was written by historian Walter Russell Mead for the journal Foreign Policy. Obama's foreign policy follows in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson and more recently of Jimmy Carter, Mead writes. Obama's goal is to reduce America's costs and risks overseas. In Obama's view, Mead writes, "Large military budgets divert resources from pressing domestic needs; close association with corrupt and tyrannical foreign regimes involves the United States in dirty and cynical alliances; the swelling national-security state threatens civil liberties and leads to powerful pro-war, pro-engagement lobbies among corporations nourished on grossly swollen federal defense budgets. ... "Obama seeks a quiet world in order to focus his efforts on domestic reform -- and to create conditions that would allow him to dismantle some of the national-security state inherited from the Cold War and given new life and vigor after 9/11. Preferring disarmament agreements to military buildups and hoping to substitute regional balance-of-power arrangements for massive unilateral U.S. force commitments all over the globe, the president wishes ultimately for an orderly world in which burdens are shared and the military power of the United States is a less prominent feature on the international scene." Our ruling In reviewing Romney's book, we couldn't help but notice that Romney's diagnosis of the problems America faces are very similar to the themes Obama often repeats: The U.S. needs to educate its children better to remain competitive in the global marketplace. We spend too much money on health care. The fiscal future is ultimately unsustainable. It is in the matter of foreign policy that Romney lays out the most aggressive case against Obama, warning that the United States needs to maintain its military dominance in the world, particularly in the face of threats from China, Russia and Islamic jihadists. Obama, Romney writes, needs to "proudly defend her rather than continually apologize for her." Here, we're checking Romney's statement that Obama "has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision" and a host of other reasons. If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. We set out to discover whether Obama really had apologized in his speeches, and what he was apologizing for. But in our review of his words, we came up short. Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well. There's not a full-throated, sincere apology in the bunch. And so we rate Romney's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e94d364b-9df6-4b93-93f7-05cc58722c8e	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2010-03-15T09:58:59	2010-03-02	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-05757	"We've seen in this last year tremendous things happening, including our unemployment rate come down 2 percentage points."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/01/cory-booker/cory-booker-claims-jobless-rate-fell-two-percentag/	Newark Mayor Cory Booker said his city is doing "unprecedented things to move forward" despite wrenching economic circumstances. Asked in a radio interview last week about the State of the City address he’ll deliver today, Booker said Newark’s population is rising, development projects are going up downtown and businesses are moving to town. Amid that growth, the mayor also highlighted a trend moving in the opposite direction: the city’s jobless rate is shrinking, he claimed. "We've seen in this last year tremendous things happening, including our unemployment rate come down 2 percentage points," Booker said on WBGO’s "Newark Today" on Feb. 23. A spokeswoman for the mayor provided data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from January 2011 to December 2011 to support Booker’s claim. During that time frame the unemployment rate in Newark fell from 15.9 percent to 13.9 percent. But that comparison has flaws. The data on unemployment rates in New Jersey’s cities are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations such as holiday and summer hiring. Garrett Schmitt, an economist with U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, said for that reason, the agency recommends comparing annual averages or year-over-year data, meaning one month from one year to the same month the next year, when using nonseasonally adjusted data.. The average annual rate for 2011 is not yet available. From December 2010 to December 2011, the most recent month of federal data available, Newark’s unemployment rate fell from 14.6 percent to 13.9 percent, or 0.7 percentage points. "The Mayor’s statement was 100% true and factually accurate. The unemployment rate in Newark in 2011 fell by 2 percentage points," Adam Zipkin, the city’s deputy mayor for economic and housing development, said in a statement. "This is significant because it is the first time in seven years that Newark has seen the unemployment rate fall within a calendar year by two full percentage points. While experts, economists and others may want to color, shape or contextualize that fact with other statistics over different time periods, it is still a fact. Just as when monthly job and unemployment numbers are reported broadly on national networks, many people will have comments on those facts but the numbers themselves are indisputable." It’s worth noting that using the time frame Booker’s office cited, a similar claim about the jobless rate could have been made in 2010. That year, the unemployment rate fell from 16.1 percent in January to 14.6 percent in December. But the next month, in January 2011, the rate jumped to 15.9 percent. That’s not an isolated incident. Since 2006, the unemployment rate has increased in January from the previous December. Our ruling Booker claimed that in the past year, Newark’s unemployment rate fell two percentage points. A spokeswoman for the Newark mayor cited nonseasonally adjusted federal data from January 2011 to December 2011 to support his claim. Within that time frame, the unemployment rate fell two percentage points. But an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said his agency recommends comparing year-over-year data or annual averages when using statistics that are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. From December 2010 to December of last year, the city’s unemployment rate dropped 0.7 percentage points, not two percentage points. We rate this claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05114	Says because of Texas lawmakers’ choices, "hundreds of thousands of women no longer have access to basic medical care, life-saving cancer screenings and contraception."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/27/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-lawmakers-cut-basic-health-/	"Those in charge in Austin are failing to invest in our future," state Sen. Wendy Davis told the Texas Democratic Party convention June 9, 2012. Among the examples in the Fort Worth Democrat’s speech: "Hundreds of thousands of women no longer have access to basic medical care, life-saving cancer screenings and contraception." That sounds like a large-scale, life-threatening concern. We asked Davis how she reached her conclusion, and learned that she was referring to 2011 budget cuts to the Texas Department of State Health Services’ family planning program. Spokesman Anthony Spangler emailed us a collection of links to news stories as well as letters, memos and Davis’ written responses. According to the program’s website, the services it provides include a health check and follow-ups on health problems as well as contraception, counseling and tests for cervical cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and diabetes. Department spokeswoman Carrie Williams told us by email that clients must fall under 250 percent of the federal poverty level to receive help through the program. By 2012 guidelines, that would translate to an annual income of $57,625 for a family of four. How many affected? The funding cuts, according to an April 24, 2011, Associated Press news article and a May 24, 2011, news article in the Austin American-Statesman, emerged in April 2011 when some of the Republican-led House's most conservative lawmakers pushed a series of floor amendments, shifting money from family planning services to programs for poor and disabled children, anti-abortion-rights programs and crisis pregnancy centers. Spangler sent us a May 5, 2011, memo from the Legislative Budget Board estimating that 283,909 women would lose basic health care in the 2012-13 biennium if the program got $37.9 million from the state instead of $99.6 million listed in the first version of the budget taken up by lawmakers. The board has not made a more recent estimate, spokesman John Barton told us by phone. State Health Services bases its calculation on slightly different figures. Williams told us that because the family planning program’s 2010-11 budget was $111.5 million, the Legislature’s approval of $37.9 million for 2012-13 was a decrease of $73.6 million. Williams said that dividing that number by $205 -- the average cost per client -- and taking into account that 95 percent of clients are women, the department estimates the program would serve 160,000 to 180,000 fewer women per year. The full effect of the cuts won’t be felt until next year, Williams said, because the department was allowed to carry over $5 million from the 2011 budget to ease the transition. Precise data were not immediately available, but the one-time money helped provide services to "thousands" of women, she said. Going by the $205-per-client cost, it appears the number could be up to 23,000. Spangler also sent us a March 8, 2012 report from the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities that put the per-year number at 150,000. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the center, said her group used budget board numbers from the 2012-13 state appropriations act and State Health Services’ 2012 operating budget. In sum: Assorted estimates say between 137,000 and 180,000 women are losing State Health Services family planning in 2012. For 2013, estimates range from 150,000 to 180,000. Already lost access? Considering that Davis said the women "no longer have access," we sought to determine how many of those women already have been affected by the cuts. Davis told us that women lost coverage when the 2011 budget changes took effect September 1, 2011. Williams told us 157 of the State Health Services program’s 300 clinics have closed and that whereas in the first half of fiscal 2011 the state program had served 116,410 people, in the first half of fiscal 2012 it had served 34,185. So, from September 2011 to June 2012, some 82,225 fewer people, almost all of them women, got services through the state program than from September 2010 to June 2011, Williams said. She said the department can’t estimate whether more clinics might close. Davis told us that when she spoke, she was not limiting her count to the women already no longer getting services previously funded through the Department of State Health Services. Instead, she said, she was speaking to the projected effect of the adopted budget cuts through the two-year budget period ending Aug. 31, 2013. She said that because the 2011 Legislature’s cut has been enacted and, short of an unlikely special session, won't be reversed, hundreds of thousands of women will be denied care during the two-year period covered by the budget. No other options? It’s one thing for the services singled out by Davis not to be provided by Department of State Health Services-supported clinics. We asked the senator how she knows hundreds of thousands of women no longer have access to such services from any providers. Davis said, "The women accessing health care through family planning services turned to the DSHS services because they have no other options. That option no longer exists." Separately, we tried -- and failed -- to get a sense of how many women have no resource for health care including cancer screenings and contraception other than the State Health Services family planning program, but did not come up with specific counts or estimates. Williams at State Health Services and Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said they have numbers on how many women use their departments’ programs, but not on how many women have access to alternatives. News stories Spangler sent us from the Texas Observer, a liberal-oriented news magazine, and from the Austin Chronicle weekly newspaper described women who relied solely on state services, but gave no numbers other than Legislative Budget Board projections, which include the assumption that the women would not find equivalent services elsewhere. Planned Parenthood officials in Texas whom Davis suggested we contact, as well as the group’s statewide public affairs coordinator, Dyana Limon-Mercado, said they could not estimate the exact number of women newly lacking access to services. Kelly Hart, director of public affairs for Dallas-based Planned Parenthood of North Texas, to whom we spoke by phone, described the difficulty in finding such an estimate: "Access" can depend on circumstances such as the woman’s income, her transportation options, how far away a clinic is and what hours it’s open. Another concern, perhaps particularly in pre-natal care, is how long women must wait for appointments. "At this point we don’t have the data," she said. In a 2010 fact-check, PolitiFact Texas gave a Mostly False rating to Gov. Rick Perry’s statement that "Everyone in this country has access to health care." Federal law requires hospitals to treat emergency medical conditions, and other avenues exist for non-emergency health concerns; however, many people cannot get to them and millions do not get the care they need. Texans’ state-funded options for family planning services could be further reduced if federal courts let the state enforce its February 2012 rule excluding Planned Parenthood clinics from Texas’ Medicaid-financed Women’s Health Program. That legal battle won’t be resolved until this fall at the earliest. But in any case it’s unclear how many Texas women would be affected: possibly more than 50,000, as the Statesman wrote in an April 17, 2012, news story, or perhaps none, if the state is able to fulfill its promise to serve the same number of women by taking over the program November 1, 2012, and operating it entirely with state dollars. Our ruling Davis overstated the number of women who have already lost services, at least as provided by State Health Services-supported clinics; the best information available suggests it’s closer to 83,000. Then again, through August 2013, the state projects that more than 200,000 women will lose access to the state's family planning services, and it seems likely they have few other options.

pomt-14586	"With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, (Sen. Rob) Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success’."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/feb/05/ted-strickland/job-losses-under-nafta-ohio-murky/	Ohio voters may have a sense of deja vu with some of the talking points rolled out by Ohio Senate candidate Ted Strickland. Strickland, the former Democratic governor, is again knocking opponents over job losses from the North American Free Trade Agreement. In a Facebook post about "skewed priorities," Strickland attacks Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican, for embracing the agreement as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush while criticizing the auto bailout. "With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success,’ " the post says. "With 160,000 auto jobs saved, Portman called the auto rescue a ‘lousy deal.’ " The attack about lost jobs from NAFTA sounded a lot like an attack PolitiFact Ohio checked out in the 2010 governor’s race against Republican John Kasich. Strickland’s campaign blamed NAFTA for a loss of 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China. (Kasich, of course, won the gubernatorial election and is now running for president. And Strickland’s claim rated False.) We wanted to know if NAFTA really killed a net 320,000 Ohio manufacturing jobs. NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, with the intent to smooth importing and exporting between Canada, the United States and Mexico. The deal is a big issue in Ohio, home to unions that are typically among NAFTA’s fiercest critics. Unions argue that trade deals like NAFTA send American jobs overseas. Portman indeed called NAFTA a "proven success" when he was the U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush in a 2006 news release. The news release didn’t say anything about lost jobs, though, so we kept digging. Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein confirmed that they sourced their data from the Washington-based think tank Public Citizen, founded by activist and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader. The data behind their findings, accessed Aug. 11, 2015, come partly from another left-leaning think tank, the Economic Policy Institute, and the nonpartisan, federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the report, Public Citizen claims, "Ohio has endured a net loss of more than 323,000 manufacturing jobs – one out of every three – since the 1994 NAFTA and the World Trade Organization agreements took effect." (The group has since reduced the figure of 323,000 jobs lost to 307,000 in a revised version.) But then, the report acknowledges that only some of those lost jobs are directly tied to overseas trade. "More than 139,000 specific Ohio jobs have been certified under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program as lost to offshoring or imports since NAFTA," the report says. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, part of the Department of Labor, provides federal aid to manufacturers who can prove that they lost revenue due to import policies like NAFTA. Subtracting the TAA-certified number of net jobs lost due to trade agreements -- 139,000 -- from the original figure of 323,000 jobs, leaves 184,000 jobs that were lost for reasons the report doesn’t, or can’t, explain. In fact, one of the sources cited in the Public Citizen report, the BLS, reports that in the first quarter of 2004, 10 years after NAFTA went into effect, just 4,633 of 239,361 private sector non-farm layoffs can be "associated with movement of work outside of the country." Economists say that other factors – say, a global economic downturn rivaling the Great Depression – also contribute to job losses. Ohio’s dip in employment was part of a nationwide trend from 2008 to 2011, when unemployment doubled from 5 to 10 percent. Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University, says that Wall Street has much more to do with the recession and associated job losses than NAFTA. Unemployment surged "largely due to the collapse of financial markets following the failure of risky bundled mortgage investments." Economists have also noted that shifts in employment in sectors like manufacturing or agriculture could also be attributed to technological breakthroughs that created jobs in some sectors and cost jobs in others, like when machines replace humans on the assembly line. In other words, the effects of NAFTA can’t be measured without considering all the other forces pushing and pulling the state’s economy. So noted the Congressional Research Service in its 2004 report about NAFTA 10 years out, which concludes, "NAFTA had little or no impact on aggregate employment." Our ruling Strickland said, "With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success.’ " The implication that NAFTA is solely responsible is a gross oversimplification of a very complex economic phenomenon. Just as one politician’s four-year term can’t be the sole cause of over a quarter-million lost jobs, the NAFTA trade deal isn’t wholly to blame either.

pomt-02297	Under Mary Burke’s leadership, Commerce Department business-incentive programs had "major shortcomings" and "40 percent of jobs...didn’t materialize."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/03/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-40-percent-j/	Major problems at his redesigned job-creation agency created a political headache for Gov. Scott Walker when millions of dollars in taxpayer money given to businesses was not tracked. Now Walker’s allies in his 2014 re-election campaign are hoping to spread the pain to Democratic challenger Mary Burke. Burke, as Commerce secretary under Walker predecessor Jim Doyle, ran the predecessor agency to Walker’s Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. Now Burke’s record at the Commerce Department is under attack in a series of TV ads from the Republican Governors Association. The most recent came after a Burke ad claimed that "under Walker, unemployment’s up." We rated that Pants on Fire, noting unemployment has gone steadily down since Walker took office. "Burke is desperate to hide her failed record on jobs," the ad begins. The spot cites a 2007 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation into Commerce Department subsidies given to businesses that promised to create jobs. An announcer says: "What is clear is in Madison, Burke wasted millions of tax dollars, and promised jobs didn’t materialize." Two quotes attributed to the newspaper are featured on-screen, including "Major shortcomings" and "40% of jobs … failed to materialize." We’re not going to fact check whether millions was "wasted" in the subsidy programs. There’s considerable disagreement on whether such programs work or are necessary, even when promised jobs get created. So in some respects that is a matter of opinion. But we decided to take a look at how the RGA was characterizing the Journal Sentinel’s work and Burke’s role in the problems it noted. About the program Subsidy programs for corporations have proliferated since Wisconsin began providing grants, tax credits and forgivable loans in the 1980s to keep businesses from fleeing the state, the Journal Sentinel reported in that 2007 series. The taxpayer-provided aid, about $50 million a year as of 2007, generally comes with some strings: creating or preserving jobs, or helping low-income areas, the stories said. Now, back to the RGA’s TV spot. The Journal Sentinel series, "Subsidies Without Scrutiny," found 40% of jobs promised by 25 firms that won $80 million in state aid over a six-year period "failed to materialize," a Journal Sentinel follow-up story noted on July 5, 2007. The RGA ad cites this follow-up story specifically. The group of 25 firms included the 10 largest aid recipients, accounting for roughly one-fourth of all business subsidies given. The series also found what were termed "major shortcomings" in state subsidy records. Firms receiving help rarely complied with their aid agreements, state officials routinely eased rules for business recipients and no reliable process existed to track success or failure, it found. Many of the state subsidy files examined by the Journal Sentinel were in disarray, the series found. Companies were supposed to file with the agency annual or semiannual progress reports on job creation. But many of the reports were late or missing. That hobbled the Commerce Department's ability to tally how successful its aid programs had been, the paper found. (It’s worth noting, in addition, that that the stories took a snapshot of the job creation as of 2007, but additional jobs may have been created or lost since then at the firms receiving aid. The 40 percent figure has not been updated). In short, the RGA’s claim accurately, if ever so briefly, summarizes the problems in the business-aid programs identified by the newspaper. How much responsibility? A trickier question is what was Burke’s role in this. The newspaper examined information on subsidies dating from January 2000 to March 2006. Doyle tapped Burke in February 2005 to run Commerce and she left in November 2007. So how much responsibility does she bear? There’s no doubt Burke was in charge when some of the incentives examined by the newspaper were initially granted. It’s also clear that many of the 25 firms won approval for state help before Burke was on the scene -- 70 percent, we found in looking back at the reporting of the 2007 Journal Sentinel series. Many of the deals originated earlier under Doyle or even before that under Republican Governors Tommy Thompson and Scott McCallum. Still, even on many of those older subsidy arrangements, Burke would have been responsible for monitoring the promised jobs and handing out the money. That’s because the money was portioned out as jobs were created, often over up to a seven-year period. In the 2007 Journal Sentinel series, Burke took responsibility for some problems, defended the program in general and pointed out specific successes. She blamed tight budgets for record-keeping she acknowledged had shortcomings. She argued that the incentives are necessary in some cases just to preserve jobs at a company weighing lucrative offers from other states. "They need to see a sign ... that we value their presence," Burke said in 2007. Burke said at the time that improvements were underway in tracking firms’ progress on jobs goals. She also noted at the time that one safeguard in place was that companies can’t claim tax credits unless they meet job goals. The newspaper, however, found companies often got tax credits for preserving old jobs as well as for creating new ones and that companies routinely got more time to meet job goals than contracts specified. The paper’s findings mirrored those of an earlier legislative audit that examined various state economic development programs in a narrower period than the newspaper’s review. The state audit looked at mid-2003 to mid-2005. That period overlaps Burke’s tenure, but by just six months. The 2006 audit found: • Insurance companies claimed more than $29 million in tax credits over six years under a program that created just 316 jobs. For each job created, taxpayers spent $91,871 — far more than what they spent to create jobs in other programs. The audit found a wide range in the cost of creating or retaining jobs under other programs, from a low of $556 to a high of $22,727 per job. • At least two companies laid off employees within three years of receiving state grants. The state does little long-term follow-up with grant recipients and so is unaware of other such examples, auditors said. • The state Department of Commerce did not adequately follow up on the performance of companies that received assistance. Its regular reports to the Legislature detailed expected outcomes, rather than results. In response to the audit, Burke, whose job was to oversee many of the state’s economic development programs, said in 2006 that the audit made welcome recommendations on improving reporting and streamlining the programs. But she said the state was doing a good job in getting money to the right businesses. Doyle, in the wake of the audit, acknowledged that targeting money to the right areas can be difficult. "What you really have to do is make sure that the grants that are going out are going to companies that have good plans. . . . (But) you can never predict exactly what the future is," he said. "You’ve got to have smart people who are really looking at whether the applications are ones that show real promise." Our rating The Republican Governors Association said that under Burke, Commerce Department business-incentive programs had "major shortcomings" and "40 percent of jobs … didn’t materialize." The programs did have significant problems, some acknowledged by Burke at the time. And the 40 percent figure is accurately drawn from the Journal Sentinel series that sampled the job-creation progress for 25 companies. But the ad’s claim needs clarification in that the newspaper series focused mainly on deals that originated before Burke took office, though she was responsible for overseeing the disbursal of money. That fact puts some of the blame on Burke’s predecessors. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Republican Governors Association	None	None	None	2014-04-03T05:00:00	2014-03-17	['None']
pomt-09384	"The American people will be appalled to learn the health care bill exempts (congressional) leadership and committee staff."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/26/tom-coburn/health-bill-appears-exempt-some-congressional-staf/	Since President Barack Obama signed the health care bill into law, we've seen many criticisms that some congressional staffers are exempt from buying health coverage through an insurance exchange. Here's the latest iteration from Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn: "The American people will be appalled to learn the health care bill exempts leadership and committee staff," Coburn told a group of reporters on March 23, 2010. "This special deal for unelected staff underscores everything the public detests about the arrogance of power in Washington." Conservative bloggers have picked up on the issue as well. Ben Domenech of the New Ledger wrote on March 22, 2010, that a surprise "is found on page 158 of the legislation, which appears to create a carve-out for senior staff members in the leadership offices and on congressional committees, essentially exempting those senior Democrat staffers who wrote the bill from being forced to purchase health care plans in the same way as other Americans." The issue has even become the subject of a poll on Facebook that states, "The staffers who wrote Obamacare slipped in a hidden gem: They exempted themselves, Obama, and his staff from the new regulations. Should this exemption be repealed?" We should note here that the new requirements in the bill do not, and never have applied to the president, vice president and members of the administration, though there have been legislative efforts to change that. And the Associated Press reported on March 24 that Obama plans to get his health care through the exchange. Coburn's quote may make it sound like lawmakers and congressional staff are exempt from broader health care reform, but they are not. Instead, he's talking about a specific provision in the bill that would require lawmakers and their staff to buy health insurance through an exchange, a virtual marketplace where consumers can pick and choose among plans based on coverage and price. To our knowledge, members of Congress and their aides are the only people who are being forced to give up their employer's health care plan -- in this case, one administered by the federal government. To check Coburn's claim, we turned to page 158 of the health care bill Obama just signed -- the Senate version of the bill -- and here's what it says: "The only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are — (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)." The provision goes on: "The term 'Member of Congress' means any member of the House of Representatives or the Senate... The term 'congressional staff' means all full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or outside of Washington, DC." The history of this provision deserves some attention. In the summer of 2009, when the lawmakers were in a heated debate over whether the health care bill should create the public option, a government-run health care plan, Coburn and his Republican colleague Charles Grassley argued that if Democrats were so keen on creating new health care programs, the president, administration officials, members of Congress and their staff should also be required to participate. Up until this point, members of Congress and their staff have been enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which offers employees a stipend to cover the cost of their health insurance. Now, staff will use that subsidy to buy a plan through the exchange. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee adopted a Coburn amendment that would have required lawmakers and their staff to enroll in the public option, while the Finance Committee incorporated a proposal by Grassley that would have required lawmakers and their staff to participate in the health insurance exchange. Over the next couple of months, Senate leadership merged the two bills. The legislation that ended up on the floor included the above language. Coburn and Grassley contend that the Senate leadership made some subtle but important changes to the language in the process, rephrasing the definition of "congressional staff" from "an employee whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of Representatives," which was in the Finance Committee bill, to "full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or outside of Washington, DC" -- the same exact definition included in the HELP committee bill as a result of Coburn's amendment. So, what's the big deal about semantics? Coburn and Grassley argue that the narrow definition of "congressional staff" as someone who works for a member of Congress excludes higher-paid committee aides and leadership aides. Grassley and Coburn tried in December to offer an amendment to the Senate bill that would have broadened the definition of a congressional staffer and include the president, vice president and political appointees in the executive branch in the requirement, but the duo say they were prevented from offering it. Coburn and Grassley tried again to expand the definition during the latest round of discussions over a package of "fixes" to the new health care law, but the amendment was defeated. We should note that Coburn and Grassley have implied that changes to the provision were the result of back-room dealings. While we know that the provision did morph over time, we don't know exactly why or under what circumstances. What we are checking is whether the language excludes committee and leadership staff as Coburn says. A report issued by the Congressional Research Service, on Dec. 2, 2009, at Grassley's request provides this insight: "It appears possible to argue that the definition of 'congressional staff' used . . . excludes any staff not directly affiliated with a Member’s individual or personal office," the independent research office concluded. "Should this interpretation be adopted by an implementing body or a court, it would appear that it would exclude professional committee staff, joint committee staff, some shared staff, as well as potentially those staff employed by leadership offices including, but not limited to, the Speaker of the House, Majority Leader of the Senate, Minority Leader of the House, Minority Leader of the Senate, as well as the Whip offices in both the House and Senate. Moreover, this interpretation would arguably exclude other congressional employees, for example, those employed by the Office of the House Clerk, House Parliamentarian, House Historian, Secretary of the Senate, Senate Legal Counsel, House and Senate Legislative Counsel offices." In an e-mail, Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, pointed out that the final language reflects Coburn's original proposal from the summer of 2009. He went further with Roll Call and Politico, saying that the provision does not apply to committee staff, but that leadership staff may not be exempted. When the two bills were merged, they chose Coburn's language over Grassley's because leadership was worried that Grassley's proposal was too broad; it may have required legislative counsel and employees of the Architect of the Capitol to participate as well, Manley said. So, that brings us back to Coburn's claim that committee and leadership staff are excluded from new rules in the health care bill. He is correct that the bill does not clearly include committee and leadership staff, and a CRS report unequivocally backs this concern. However, we quibble with two things: First, Coburn is quite definitive in his conclusion that committee and leadership staff are exempted. But the CRS report provides more wiggle room; it states "it appears possible" that the language could be interpreted that way. It would have been more accurate to say that the language "may exempt" some staffers. Furthermore, it is true that Coburn's original amendment language was as restrictive as the provision that ended up in the final version of the bill. However, on two occasions, Coburn tried to fix the problem. All that said, we find Coburn's claim to be Mostly True.	None	Tom Coburn	None	None	None	2010-03-26T18:02:53	2010-03-23	['United_States']
pomt-01319	Ebola is "incredibly contagious," "very transmissible" and "easy to catch."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/27/rand-paul/ebola-virus-incredibly-contagious-and-easy-catch-r/	Count Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., among Republicans who don’t think the White House has taken the Ebola threat seriously enough. While campaigning for Republicans in New Hampshire on Oct. 16, Paul told Concord News Radio that President Barack Obama "has so tried to downplay the transmissibility of" the Ebola virus that it’s putting people at risk. "This is an incredibly contagious disease," Paul said. "People in full gloves and gowns are getting it. So really they need to be honest — this is a very transmissible disease." Paul added: "They’re still learning about this. We’re all still learning about this. But this is not something that is hard to catch, this is something that appears to be very easy to catch." Is the Ebola virus "incredibly contagious," "very transmissible" and "easy to catch"? We decided to check it out. Paul’s office said his comments implied that he was talking about how easy it is to get the virus from contact with an infected individual. In a lengthy response to PolitiFact, spokesman Brian Darling said that "exposure to even a small amount of virus can cause infection." The 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa is the largest in history, according to the World Health Organization. It’s also the first time the virus has made its way to the United States; health officials confirmed the fourth U.S. case Thursday in a doctor returning to New York from treating Ebola patients in West Africa. So far, though, only two individuals — both Texas health care workers that treated an African man who later died from the disease — have contracted the virus on U.S. soil. This despite the fact that infected individuals have come into contact with dozens, if not hundreds, of people while they purportedly had the disease, including close family members. That seems to dispel, at least anecdotally, the idea that the disease is "incredibly contagious" and "easy to catch," even from an infected person. But let’s get into the nitty gritty. How does Ebola spread? Ebola is not an airborne infection. For example, it is rare — if it’s even possible at all — that the disease would spread through coughing or sneezing (which are not even symptoms of Ebola, as our colleagues at PunditFact recently noted). According to the World Health Organization, Ebola spreads through "human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people." This means that the most common way Ebola is spread is direct contact with vomit, blood or fecal matter of an infected patient. Individuals who have such contact are at high risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says "being within approximately 3 feet of an (Ebola) patient or within the patient’s room or care area for a prolonged period of time," is also potential cause for concern. But the organization noted the risk is low. There is also potential risk of transmission through contaminated surfaces and objects, however the World Health Organization notes the danger is, again, low, and most studies from previous Ebola outbreaks show that "all cases were infected by direct close contact with symptomatic patients." Finally, experts note that individuals are not infectious — meaning they cannot spread the virus — until they are showing symptoms, which takes between 2 and 21 days. Symptoms start with a fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. So to be at a high risk of contracting Ebola, you need to come into contact with the blood, feces or vomit of someone who is showing symptoms. The number of people who find themselves in this situation are relatively small. There is potential for it to spread other ways — such as being in close range with someone who has the disease or touching an object contaminated by an infected person — but the risk is low, because "as an enveloped virus, it has a low tendency to stay viable outside the body," said Thomas Fekete, a professor of infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine. "And because it is not aerosolized it isn't especially easy to catch through the respiratory tract." How contagious is it? The CDC defines contagious as "a very communicable disease capable of spreading rapidly from one person to another by contact or close proximity." In Africa, the disease has claimed so many victims because of poor health systems that lack supplies and safeguards and because of burial practices where people directly handle bodies without necessary protections. This is what caused such a large outbreak there. Burials are especially problematic because the near dead or recently dead have very high levels of the virus and are "very infectious as a result," said Christopher Whalen, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Georgia College of Public Health. But even in the worst outbreak Africa has experienced, health care officials have noted that the disease does not spread from one host to many others. The basic reproduction number, or R0, of a disease is calculated as the average number of secondary cases resulting from an infected individual entering an uninfected population. The higher the R0 is above 1, the greater the chances it has of spreading. The R0 of the Ebola virus in Africa during the recent outbreak has ranged from 1.20 to 2.02, depending on the country. That’s in line with historical data on the disease. How does that compare to other viruses? Well, HIV, which is only transmitted by sexual intercourse and blood transfers, has a R0 of 4. The measles has a R0 of 18. Meaning, while the disease has the potential to spread, "minimum requirements for the containment of Ebola are far less severe than for the containment of more contagious diseases, such as measles," according to the World Health Organization Ebola Response Team. Rachael Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago School of Public Health, told PolitiFact: "The epidemiological evidence suggests that Ebola is less infectious than many other viruses that commonly affect people, such as influenza." What if you come in contact with someone who has Ebola? Ebola is "easy to catch" in the sense that you don't need prolonged contact with infected fluids to pick it up, Fekete said. However, not many people come in contact with these infected fluids. And, the evidence shows some people who do spend time around an infected patient don’t get the virus, either. "It seems as though even a brief exposure to the virus can lead to a transmission event, as some patients describe one contact event with an ill patient," Whalen said. "But, on the other side, think of all of the family members of Ebola patients who were exposed in the household of a case, but didn’t develop the disease. We tend not to hear about them, yet they constitute an important part of our understanding the attack rate." But Paul’s spokesman, Darling, argued, "The reason why doctors and nurses who come into contact with an infected individual wear 100 percent protection then have to go through a thorough disinfection process, is because it is ‘easy to catch’ from somebody who is showing symptoms." That’s not necessarily the case, according to health experts we spoke with. For one, health care workers are in close contact with infected individuals at their most infectious state and are handling bodily fluids known to carry higher concentrations of the virus. That puts them at greater risk than someone sitting next to a person who is infected, even if that person is showing symptoms. Further, unlike much more contagious diseases, Ebola causes death in 50 percent of patients. That sparks extra precaution. "These recommendations arise from the seriousness of the infection, not from the infectivity of the pathogen," Jones said. Given the high mortality rate from the disease, if it was "incredibly contagious" and "easy to catch," the United States would likely have more deaths already. "The joke that more Americans have been married to Kim Kardashian than have died of Ebola would not be true if it were so easy to catch," Fekete said. Our ruling Paul called Ebola "incredibly contagious," "very transmissible" and "easy to catch." A person who comes into contact with bodily fluids from an Ebola patient for a short period can contract the virus. In that limited sense, Ebola is "easy to catch." Health care workers and individuals handling patients at or near death are also at greater risk, because that appears to be when the disease is at its most infectious, experts said. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that Ebola is less contagious and transmissible than many other diseases. By the numbers, Ebola patients go on to infect relatively few people. This is because a patient only spreads the disease while showing symptoms; the virus cannot be spread through the air; and people don’t often come into contact with the bodily fluids of other individuals. Contracting the disease through other methods, like touching surfaces or standing close to infected patients, while possible, are rare and present a low risk. Ebola is a serious and deadly disease that is absolutely capable of spreading if necessary precautions aren’t taken. But in using words like "incredibly," "very" and "easy," Paul vastly inflates the virus’ ability to move from person to person. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-01279	The last time Republican U.S. Senate candidates "beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/02/sean-spicer/last-time-gop-defeated-two-senate-incumbent-democr/	For the past couple decades, Republicans have struggled to oust Democratic senators, though that trend is expected to change Tuesday. Many forecasters have Republicans taking up to eight Democratic Senate seats -- beating incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska and Colorado. If this scenario pans out, Republicans will gain control of the Senate, and they will have overcome a historical challenge. "The last time we beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980," said Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer on CNN’s State of the Union on Nov. 2. It’s commonly understood that incumbent candidates have an advantage over their challengers for many reasons including visibility, accomplishments in the position, and being a high-quality candidate (why they were elected in the first place). But have Republican challengers really struggled so much to take Democratic seats? We looked at past Senate election results and found that Republicans have had some successful gains in the past 35 years, but many of those wins were in races for an open seat when a Democratic senator was retiring. In 1980, Republicans took 12 Democrat Senate seats (nine incumbents lost in the general election, while three lost in their primaries.). Spicer is correct to say they haven’t beat more than two incumbents since then. We found a great chart showing Senate seat turnover for the past half-century in the Brookings Institution’s most recent "Vital Statistics on Congress" report. (h/t to Sabato’s Crystal Ball.) The arrows show when a Democratic (D) seat switched to a Republican (R) seat and vice versa. From 1981 on, Republicans have beaten only 12 incumbent Democrats for Senate seats. Republicans’ biggest Senate gains in that time frame all involve taking open seats -- such as 1994, 2004 and 2010, when they gained four, five and six open seats, respectively. Senate Democrats haven’t had quite the same struggle against Republican incumbents in recent years. Since 1981, they’ve beaten 37 incumbents total, compared to Republicans’ 12. So if Republicans are able to beat more than two incumbent Democratic senators Tuesday, it would be a clear break with the recent past. If Republicans take seven seats, both beating incumbents and taking open seats (which the New York Times’ election model has as the most likely outcome), that will be their second-biggest overall gain since 1980. In 1994, Republicans won eight Senate seats -- beating two incumbents and taking six open seats. What made 1980 so special? In the same election, former President Ronald Reagan beat incumbent Democrat President Jimmy Carter. Carter was fast falling out of favor with voters, considering the Iran hostage crisis, a floundering economy and other issues. On top of Carter’s struggles, there was a major rift between Southern and Northern Democrats. It was an extraordinary political environment that allowed Republicans to sweep the congressional elections. Compare that to this year’s Senate elections where, although there is no presidential election, Republicans are using President Barack Obama’s relatively low popularity to their advantage in races against incumbent Democrats. Our ruling Spicer said the last time Republican Senate candidates "beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980." Republicans kicked a total of 9 incumbent Democrats out of office in 1980 (another three lost in a primary). Since then, Republicans have turned two or fewer seats each election. Most of their success has been in winning formerly Democratic open seats. We rate Spicer’s claim True.

pomt-03573	Historically, the Social Security tax has been assessed on about 90% of U.S. income. Now it captures 83% because there's been such a growth of income among the highest earners.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/19/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-only-83-percent-income/	The question of how to properly finance Social Security was one of the topics when U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was interviewed on WPRI's "Newsmakers," which aired May 12, 2013. Cicilline expressed support for one proposal that would eliminate the limit on the Social Security payroll tax. Currently, employees stop paying the 6.2-percent tax for the year once their income hits $113,700. Applying the tax to everyone regardless of their income would keep Social Security solvent for the next 75 years, according to the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. On "Newsmakers," Cicilline said more and more income is now exempt from the tax. "Social Security used to be a tax which was assessed on approximately 90 percent of the income generated in this country, which was where it has sort of been historically. It currently collects taxes on about 83 percent of wages earned because the cap . . . only captures 83 percent of earnings because there's been such a growth of income at the very top," the congressman said. We were interested in seeing if his percentages were correct. We didn't get an immediate response from his office, so we went looking on our own. According to a Social Security "Policy Brief" from 2011, and other sources, Social Security sometimes refers to this limit as the "tax max." It's been the subject of a lot of tinkering since the 1930s, when it was set at $3,000. The tax rate then was just one percent. The tax max started going up in 1951. Annual increases began in 1972. The tax rate itself started to rise in 1950. It has been 6.2 percent since 1990. Returning to Cicilline's statement, we found that he got a key number wrong. He said that, historically, 90 percent of income was subject to the Social Security tax. In fact, 83 percent is the average proportion of wages subjected to the tax from the founding of Social Security through 2009. For several years during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s it was below 80 percent, dropping to 71 percent in 1965. The percentage peaked at 90 percent in only two years -- 1982 and 1983. It's been on the decline since then. It was about 86 percent in 2010. Cicilline's office subsequently sent us two reports that confirmed the 90 percent represents a historical peak, not an average. One was a 2010 document from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which predicted that the rate would hit 83 percent around 2014. The other was a compilation of statistical tables from the Social Security Administration showing that the 2011 rate was expected to be 83 percent, as Cicilline said. The reports showed something else. Since 1983, about 6 percent of the population each year has earned enough money to reach the cap and stop paying Social Security taxes that year. The fact that the percentage has changed very little (yet the amount of wages subjected to the Social Security tax has steadily declined) shows that the wealthiest Americans have been seeing less and less of their income subjected to the tax, which was Cicilline's other point. As the 2011 policy brief concluded, "The percentage of earnings covered by the tax max has fallen since the early 1980s because earnings among above-max earners have grown faster than earnings among the rest of the working population." One final interesting note for the folks in Cicilline's home state: the Congressional Research Service report has a state-by-state breakdown of the percentage of workers with income subject to the Social Security tax who exceeded the limit in 2007. Rhode Island had the fewest workers -- only 1.6 percent in that category. South Dakota was next to the bottom, at 2.1 percent. New Jersey was highest at 11.6 percent. Our ruling U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said only 83 percent of wages are being subjected to the Social Security tax when, historically, it has been 90 percent. Analyses by the Social Security Administration and the Congressional Research Service show that he is on the mark for the current rate of taxation, but 90 percent applies to only two years in the 1980s. It has been declining since then, as better-paid Americans have seen their incomes grow at a faster rate than other workers. The judges felt that Cicilline needed to get both facts correct to make his point. When a key part of his premise turns out to be inaccurate, his overarching argument fails. We rate the claim Mostly False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-09056	"The majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/30/jan-brewer/arizona-gov-brewer-says-majority-illegals-are-drug/	Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer created a frenzy in April 2010 when she signed a law that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their status. Then in late June, she linked illegal immigrants and drug smuggling. The string of controversial comments began June 15, 2010, during a debate with three other candidates running for the Republican nomination for governor. Republican candidate Matt Jette said that most people who cross illegally into Arizona are "just trying to feed their families." Brewer, according to the Arizona Republic, disputed that, saying, "They're coming here, and they're bringing drugs. And they're doing drop houses, and they're extorting people and they're terrorizing the families." A few days later, on June 25, Brewer expanded upon her comments during a question-and-answer session with reporters. (A verbatim account of the exchange is available here.) "Well, we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules," Brewer said. "They're coming across our borders in huge numbers. The drug cartels have taken control of the immigration. … So they are criminals. They're breaking the law when they are trespassing and they're criminals when they pack the marijuana and the drugs on their backs." Brewer added, "I believe today and in the circumstances that we are facing, that the majority of the illegal trespassers that are coming in the state of Arizona are under the direction and control of organized drug cartels, and they are bringing drugs in." Finally, later the same day, Brewer released a statement clarifying her comments for a second time. "There has been some media attention in the last several hours regarding statements I made this morning regarding the level of drug and crime activity being perpetrated by illegal immigrants coming into and residing in Arizona. The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs," the statement said. "It is common knowledge that Mexican drug cartels have merged human smuggling with drug trafficking. For example, the Los Angeles Times on March 23, 2009, reported, 'The business of smuggling humans across the Mexican border has been brisk, with many thousands coming across every year. But smugglers affiliated with the drug cartels have taken the enterprise to a new level – and made it more violent – by commandeering much of the operation from independent coyotes, according to these officials and recent congressional testimonies.' This article and many federal government reports have drawn the same conclusions. "The human rights violations that have taken place victimizing immigrants and their families are abhorrent. Border crossers are used by drug cartels as commodities. Mexican drug cartels have merged human smugglers who use their expertise in gathering intelligence on border patrols, logistics and communication devices to get around even tighter controls. U.S. border officials have stated that traffickers are gaining control of much of the illegal passage of immigrants from Mexico to the United States." Though Brewer did not use her written statement to retract any of her prior comments, she did change her focus a bit, singling out the criminal elements running joint drug-and-human smuggling operations rather than the immigrants that the cartels have been, in her words, "victimizing." Whether or not this represents a backpedaling, we thought her earlier comments deserve scrutiny because they raise an interesting question -- whether there is a substantial connection between illegal immigrants and drug smuggling. So we talked to experts and looked over statistical data to see whether Brewer was justified in claiming that "the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules." The governor's staff did not respond to PolitiFact's request for comment, nor did Customs and Border Protection. But most of the experts we spoke to agreed with the notion, raised in the Los Angeles Times article and by Brewer, that there is growing overlap between drug smuggling and human smuggling. "Because of the militarization of the border and the increased difficulty in crossing, most border-crossers turn to 'coyotes,' " or human smugglers, said Aarti Kohli, the director of immigration policy and legislative counsel for the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity, and Diversity at the University of California (Berkeley) School of Law. "Sometimes these coyotes have links with drug cartels and are engaging in drug smuggling along with alien smuggling. Both are federal offenses." That said, Kohli and others draw a clear distinction with Brewer's suggestion that the majority of illegal border crossers are "drug mules." "If caught along the southwest border, the vast majority of migrants are prosecuted in federal district court, often 70 at a time, for misdemeanor illegal entry," Kohli said. "If they are caught smuggling drugs, they would not be prosecuted" in this way. Federal statistics bear this out. We looked at the latest available statistics, covering March 2010, for prosecutions stemming from immigrations and customs activities by the Department of Homeland Security. They show that "immigration" charges accounted for almost 89 percent of cases, while drug and drug-trafficking charges accounted for just over 5 percent. "These apprehensions do not catch everyone, obviously, but as the Border Patrol is particularly interested in interdicting contraband, I don't know of any strong reason to believe that the Border Patrol's arrests would have a disproportionately low share of smugglers," said Gabriel "Jack" Chin, a professor of law, public administration and policy at the University of Arizona. The statistics also track with accounts of law enforcement sources. "Based on conversations with front-line Border Patrol agents, it is clear that the majority of people encountered by the Border Patrol are not carrying drugs," said T.J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council. "While it is true that the majority of human smuggling is controlled or at least regulated by the cartels, it does not logically follow that the majority of people who are smuggled by the cartels are therefore transporting drugs. The penalties for transporting drugs are far greater than the penalties for entering the country illegally, so people do not engage in that type of criminal behavior unless they are so inclined, are extremely desperate or are coerced by the cartels. The two latter categories are the exceptions rather than the rule." On the broader issue, it's worth noting that statistics have consistently shown that immigrants, including illegal immigrants, actually have lower rates of criminal activity and incarceration than do the native-born children of immigrants. Rubén G. Rumbaut, a sociologist at the University of California (Irvine), has written that 2000 Census figures show consistently lower incarceration rates for foreign-born Mexicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Colombians, Ecuadorians and Peruvians when compared to incarceration rates of U.S.-born members of the same ethnic groups. While the category "foreign-born" is not identical to "illegal immigrant," there is significant overlap in these particular ethnic groups, Rumbaut writes. Ultimately, Brewer would have been on safe ground if she'd said that drug smuggling and human smuggling have become increasingly intertwined, and that sometimes, illegal immigrants have been coerced into serving as drug couriers. But that's a much more limited claim than what she initially said -- that "the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules." While the source she eventually cited -- the Los Angeles Times -- says that "sometimes (smugglers) loaded up their human cargo with backpacks full of marijuana," the article doesn't back up her assertion that that "the majority" of illegal immigrants carry drugs into the country. More to the point, Brewer's contention is undercut by both federal prosecution statistics and the accounts of experts we spoke to. So we rate Brewer's statement False.

pomt-00099	Says Texas Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher contradicted herself on her health care position by saying "we need universal health care."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/30/john-culberson/lizzie-fletcher-does-not-want-government-funded-un/	A new ad from John Culberson, a nine-term Republican congressman from Texas, takes an ad from his opponent Lizzie Pannill Fletcher and uses her own words against her. Culberson is looking to hold onto his seat in the state’s 7th Congressional District, which covers a portion of western Houston. His campaign aired the ad "Orders" which puts up a Fletcher ad and compares it to comments she made in a debate. The 30-second slot begins with a clip of Fletcher in her ad saying she doesn’t "support a government takeover of health care." Then, it immediately switches to a clip of Fletcher in a debate saying "we need universal health care." With such a stark contrast, we wondered whether Fletcher had backtracked on her position, as the ad makes it appear. While universal health care refers to any system where all residents have health coverage, it is best connected, at least right now, to the single-payer plan "Medicare for All" that was proposed in 2017 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. So does Fletcher support a government-supported, universal single-payer system like Medicare for All? No. The debate clip is cut, and takes Fletcher out of context by not revealing her full quote. We also found Fletcher has voiced opposition to such a program several times. Medicare for All, a quick recap Under Sanders’ plan, the country would eliminate the current system of multiple insurers competing for premiums. Instead, the government would expand Medicare, a federally tax-payer supported program, to cover everyone, rather than just those age 65 and older. Backers say the plan would end up saving people money, because it would cut administrative costs, help slow the increase in health care spending and improve access. But skeptics argue that it would be too costly for the federal government, result in lower quality care and would amount to a "government takeover" of health care. What Fletcher said (and supports) We tracked down the full video of the debate from May 2018, and found that Fletcher was responding to her Democratic primary opponent at the time, Laura Moser, who had said she backed a single-payer program like "Medicare for All". Fletcher disagreed. Fletcher did say "we need universal health care" but if you continue to watch, you see that’s not exactly what she meant. "We need universal health care. Not just health care coverage, not just health care insurance, but that we all need access to health care," she goes on to say. Fletcher then discusses her support of keeping the Affordable Care Act and adding a public option to buy into Medicare – not Medicare for All or any other single-payer plan. "There has been extensive study that the plan Bernie Sanders has proposed will cost $32 trillion over 10 years," Fletcher said, "and we don’t know how we’re going to pay for it." (She is referring to a study from the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank at George Mason University, that estimated Medicare for All would increase the demand for health care services while also cutting payments to providers. The report suggests the system would cost $32 trillion over the next 10 years) The Fletcher campaign also told us she has never advocated for a "complete government takeover" of health care. That checks out. We looked into Fletcher’s stance on health care and reviewed various reports, as well as her remarks in interviews and information on her campaign website. In every instance, Fletcher has repeated that she wants to build on the Affordable Care Act, and has not endorsed any single-payer health care system, including Medicare for All. The Culberson campaign defended the ad by saying that universal health care isn’t universal access to health care. "Because health care is already available to everyone in America – you just have to pay for it," said Culberson spokesperson Catherine Kelly. "Her plan is more expensive than Medicare for All because it raises taxes on people who want to keep their coverage and gives it to people to anyone who wants to 'opt in.’" Our ruling Culberson attempts to display Fletcher contradicting herself on her health care position. But the ad uses an incomplete sound bite that ultimately takes Fletcher out of context. Fletcher did use the words "universal health care," and has so in the past, but not in the context of a single-payer or "Medicare for All" type health plan. Fletcher has advocated for improvements to the Affordable Care Act and a public option to buy into Medicare, not through a government-funded single-payer type of program. The ad uses an incomplete sound bite that ultimately misleads viewers on her stance. We rate it False.

pomt-05552	Says his reform efforts improved performance at all 10 low-performing schools in Palm Beach, Florida.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/08/jeffrey-hernandez/consultant-says-his-efforts-improved-performance-a/	In the quest to improve its struggling school system, Providence voted at the end of March to spend $5 million in federal money to hire consultant Jeffrey Hernandez to help reform three struggling high schools. His appointment in Providence was controversial because his stint in Palm Beach, Florida, sparked strong criticism from parents and teachers and he resigned after only a year on the job. Hernandez bills himself as an agent for transforming low-performing schools. Part of his sales pitch to the Providence School Committee was a six-page letter, dated March 23, 2012, that talks about his experience as chief academic officer for the Palm Beach County school district. "One of the goals I was charged with was to improve the student achievement at our 10 lowest performing high schools, which were in Corrective Action under Florida's Differentiated Accountability. After implementing rigorous and robust strategic reform initiatives, 100% of the high schools improved their performance as evidenced by all of them receiving a grade of 'C' or higher (mostly 'A' and 'B')," he wrote. After seeing his claim summarized in a March 26 Journal story about the controversy surrounding his then-pending appointment, we decided to check his claim. His letter includes a chart detailing improvements -- some substantial -- in the letter grade given to each school by the Florida Department of Education. "The grade improvements above are one of the many transformations that NAEP Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey J. Hernandez was responsible for as a district administrator," the chart says. NAEP is National Academic Educational Partners Inc. During the 2009-2010 school year, Hernandez was Palm Beach County's chief academic officer. We confirmed all the grades with the Florida Department of Education, although the dates given in the chart are misleading. (It suggests the results compare the two school years from 2009-2011; it's actually 2008-2010.) Among the seven high schools that had a D rating in 2009, when Hernandez began his job at the district, two rose to a C in 2010, three increased to a B and two jumped to an A. Among the three C-level schools, two rose to a B and one jumped to an A. (The 11th school started out with a ranking of B and jumped to an A.) Overall, 54 percent of the schools showed a higher grade and none showed a lower ranking. That's pretty impressive. But was Hernandez, who was employed by the district for just one year, responsible? For comparison, we looked at the grades for high schools in Broward County, just to the south of Palm Beach County. It turns out that those schools had a great year as well -- without Hernandez's involvement. In the Broward County school system, 53 percent of the 34 high schools got a higher grade in the spring of 2010 while 3 percent (one school) showed a decline. So we looked at all Florida high schools, excluding those in Palm Beach for that time period. Just over half -- 51 percent -- saw their grades increase for 2010. So not only were the Palm Beach high schools getting better grades when Hernandez was in charge of academics, schools throughout Florida were getting higher scores as well. The reason: the state changed its grading system. For example, the formula used to determine a school's grade began including graduation rates and accelerated course work. "I would expect to see a difference between '08-'09 and '09-'10 because the formula for high school grades changed in that time frame," said Jane Fletcher, director of accountability and policy research at the Florida Department of Education. "It's not surprising at all." When we called Hernandez to ask about the grade inflation statewide, he said, "I can't say what was happening in other districts. I can only say what happened in the district that I was working on." We did see one difference between Hernandez's district and the rest of Florida. Palm Beach high schools showed a greater propensity to improve more than one letter grade. While 16 percent of Florida's high schools showed a jump of two or more letter grades (such as from a D to a B), 27 percent of Palm Beach schools made that type of jump. Our ruling Jeffrey Hernandez said that after implementing his reform measures, "100% of the [10 lowest performing high schools in Palm Beach] improved their performance as evidenced by all of them receiving a grade of 'C' or higher." He is correct that there was improvement -- those low-performing schools did pull better grades (two went from a D to an A). But that was part of a larger trend, prompted by a change in the grading system, that caused half of all high schools throughout the state to score better.

pomt-14098	Says Ted Strickland admits his record on jobs and taxes is "mixed and spotty."	false	/ohio/statements/2016/may/13/fighting-ohio-pac/fighting-ohio-pac-ad-takes-ted-stricklands-mixed-a/	A campaign ad by the political action committee supporting Republican Sen. Rob Portman features a video clip of his opponent, former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat, saying, "My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that," before the ad launches into attacks on his economic record. The narrator says that Strickland is speaking "on his record," then slams Strickland for 350,000 jobs lost and $8 million in taxes raised. PolitiFact Ohio has checked those two figures before and rated the claims Half True and Mostly True, respectively. Now we’d like to know where Fighting for Ohio got that "mixed and spotty" clip. Did the former Ohio governor really fall on his sword over the economic upshot of his tenure? No, he didn’t. The ad takes Strickland’s words out of context. Text under the video cites a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board’s February interview of Democratic primary Senate candidates, which is posted in its entirety on YouTube. The context tells the tale. At the 26:13 mark of the interview, primary hopeful P.G. Sittenfeld asked Strickland, "Why should Democratic voters not judge you by your record on guns?" He criticized Strickland for reversing his anti-gun control stance, a change of heart Strickland’s aides have attributed to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., that resulted in the deaths of 20 children and six adults. Strickland countered that he welcomed voters to judge him by his record, then changed the subject to the diversity of his cabinet appointees during his term as Ohio’s governor from 2007 to 2011. But the topic snapped back to guns (at the 28-minute mark) when one of the off-camera Plain Dealer interviewers asked Strickland to clarify his stance. "Has my position changed over time? It has," Strickland answered. "Can people criticize me for that? Absolutely. You’re not going to find me out there saying my records with guns is not a legitimate -- you know, it’s one of many issues that people will look at and make a decision about me and this race, and so on and so forth." From there, Strickland tried to explain his gun rights position, calling President Bill Clinton’s 1994 crime bill, which he voted against in Congress, "one of the worst pieces of legislation that’s been passed in decades." He said he dropped his NRA membership "five or six years ago," and defended a recent radio interview in which he boasted about his A+ rating from the NRA in 2010. Strickland’s monologue concluded at the 31:40 minute mark, when he said, "My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that." The next 12 minutes of discussion is fixed on the candidates’ stances on gun control. Not employment, not taxes. Steiner Public Relations in Columbus, Ohio, is fielding questions for Fighting for Ohio. Their spokesperson, Jen Detwiler, said, "We’ll let the content of the ad stand on its own." Our ruling An attack ad juxtaposes employment figures and tax dollars with a video clip of Strickland saying, "My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that." Strickland’s stance on gun control may have wavered, but the context in which he made the "mixed and spotty" statement did not. Strickland was talking about guns, not jobs or taxes. The Fighting for Ohio PAC’s "Spotty" ad distorts the context of his statement.

pomt-07879	Says "every school will be negatively impacted" if Education Stability Fund is not tapped.	true	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/07/dave-hunt/dave-hunt-says-schools-will-suffer-without-planned/	The Oregon Legislature is up and running, which means battles over the budget -- both for the current two-year cycle and the next -- aren’t far off. In fact, they might have already started. In an end-of-year e-mail sent out in December, Dave Hunt, the leader of the House Democrats, said the Legislature was obligated to release some $35.5 million from the Education Stability Fund. Without it, he said, "every school across Oregon will be negatively impacted during this school year. The combined loss to schools across Clackamas County alone would be $3,371,694. (North Clackamas Schools would lose $1,026,281, Oregon City Schools would lose $470,150, and Gladstone Schools would lose $121,028 for this school year.)" Clackamas County is home to 10 school districts in all, according to the state. (For those wondering why he’s so concerned about Clackamas County -- he’s the representative from Gladstone.) We wondered whether this was true. To start with, we gave Hunt’s office a call. Michael Cox, the House Democrats’ spokesman, pointed us to an analysis of school funding. It spelled out two scenarios: what schools would get under the current budget and what schools would get under the current budget minus $35.5 million. It backed up Hunt’s statement exactly. Every school would see a loss of dollars. And the numbers he cited for specific schools were accurate. There were a few caveats, however. According to the fine print, the analysis: 1) "Assumes districts have same formula high cost disability grant as 09-10 preliminary" 2) "Excludes $12.5 million for formula facility grants which can vary greatly by district by year" 3) "Uses August 2010 school district data and estimates of school formula local revenue" These caveats are understandable; there’s some information the state just doesn't have at this point. But, even in the event that these assumptions are way off, they apply to such a small portion of the overall budget that the outcome of the analysis wouldn’t be affected much. When all of that checked out, we still had one nagging question: Were schools really counting on this cash? You could draw up an annual budget for PolitiFact Oregon and show our funding before and after a $35.5 million infusion (yeah, right), but if we were never expecting it in the first place, it’s not as though we’d be taking a loss. Similarly if schools were never counting on the $35.5 million -- if it was never built into their budgets -- it wouldn’t be fair to say they’d suffer without it. For that piece, we called Oregon’s Legislative Fiscal Office. There, Monica Brown told us that the current school year was operating on a $2.86 billion budget and that, yes, in fact, that number did include the $35.5 million that Hunt was all worked up about. We wondered when, exactly, that yet-to-be-released $35.5 million got folded into the budget, so we gave Cox another call. He pointed us in the direction of an Aug. 26, 2010, news release. At the time of the release, the state economist had just released a budget forecast that showed an additional $377.5 million shortfall. To help offset educational cuts that might come as a result, then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski, Senate President Peter Courtney and then-Speaker of the House Dave Hunt "agreed that in order to protect schools, approximately $34 million of the state reserve funds will be committed to K-12 when the Legislature convenes in February 2011." Well, it’s February 2011, so Hunt is reminding legislators about the deal. Of course, a few things have since changed, not the least of which is that the House is now evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. (You’ll notice that none of the parties who agreed to this move is a Republican.) This is all beside the point, but we did contact Nick Smith, the spokesman for Co-Speaker of the House Bruce Hanna, a Republican from Roseburg, to see if there was any movement to resist tapping into the Education Stability Fund. Smith couldn’t say definitively but added "we certainly have no interest in blocking whatever needs to be done to keep the budget balanced and the schools open." So, back to the statement, would every school be negatively impacted without this cash? Well, each and every school budget would take a hit. Hunt had the analysis to prove his point.

pomt-08795	"Most AGs don't go to court.."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/19/holly-benson/benson-claims-mccollum-last-courtroom-70s/	The three Republican candidates for attorney general are all trying to distinguish their records based on their resumes. Holly Benson, whose last job was the head of a state agency, downplayed courtroom experience in a recent debate. After one of her opponents, former prosecutor Pam Bondi, touted her own courtroom experience, Benson tried to portray logging hours in the courtroom as something that isn't necessary for an AG. Instead, Benson highlighted her own administrative experience overseeing the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation and then the state Agency for Health Care Administration. "Yesterday I was talking to somebody from General McCollum's team who said 'I think the last time he was in court was the late '70s,' '' Benson said. "So most AGs don't go to court and it's not a primary requirement of the job." That wasn't intended as a swipe at Attorney General Bill McCollum -- a fellow Republican who is now running for governor. Instead, Benson was trying to suggest that Bondi's courtroom experience isn't essential to the AG position. But we wanted to check to see if Benson is right: do most AGs stay out of court? We delved into the backgrounds of Florida's three most recent AGs. Florida's current AG, McCollum, was elected to the job in 2006. AG spokeswoman Ryan Wiggins said McCollum hasn't been in the courtroom while AG. AG spokeswoman Sandi Copes declined to comment on whether the amount of courtroom experience matters for an AG. She said she found no information that showed that McCollum's predecessor Charlie Crist was in court either while he held that post between 2002 and 2006. But Crist's spokesman in the governor's office, Sterling Ivey, said that Crist was in the courtroom while he was AG on a telecom case. He referred us to Chris Kise, then the solicitor general. In Crist vs. Jaber, the case involved a challenge to a $350 million rate hike that the Public Service Commission had approved for Florida telecoms, Kise told us in an e-mail. The AG's office argued that the PSC did not follow the statutory mandate because the rates would not remain affordable. Crist argued the case before the Florida Supreme Court along with Deputy Solicitor General Lynn Hearn. Kise said he personally prepared Crist for the oral argument and "he actually stood up and argued part of the case." We asked Kise his thoughts on AGs and courtroom experience. He said it helps to have a "substantial legal background whether it be trial work or otherwise what I would call real lawyer background. It's an advantage because you understand more about the legal system and the challenges in representing clients. It provides a perspective. Is it essential? I guess its not essential." We also spoke to Bob Butterworth who served as AG between 1987 and 2002. He guessed that he was in the courtroom about 25 times. "Many times I sat second chair for a couple of hearings or Supreme Court arguments, but I never handled (the case) myself because it took two, three solid weeks to get prepared," Butterworth said. "It's very hard as the AG of a large state to do that. A number of AGs do it, but relatively few." Butterworth said though he never handled a jury trial as AG he did handle other matters: "I handled motions. I would also handle a number of settlements that had to be approved by the court such as (the landmark tobacco lawsuit) where Gov. Lawton Chiles and I both represented to a court why we wanted to accept a settlement." Butterworth did not see extensive courtroom experience as essential to the job. "Your job is primarily administration, basically being up front in the agency," he said. "I do not see it as a negative for any person running for the office of AG to not have argued cases." To get a nationwide perspective on how often AGs go to court we spoke with Patrick Lynch, the attorney general of Rhode Island for about eight years and a past president of the National Association of Attorneys General. As AG, Lynch also handles criminal cases but we focused our discussion on his role that relates to more typical AG work. Lynch said it's more common to see a district attorney try cases than an AG. Generally speaking, Lynch said AGs are seen in court when their office has a case before the U.S. Supreme Court or a higher court. But "in the everyday drudgery of trying cases, going in front of the bar is more rare than not. It's too time consuming. You have too many other responsibilities." Lynch said that he will sometimes make appearances in court to show support for his attorneys -- for example he was in the courtroom for arguments in a high-profile lawsuit involving companies that manufactured lead paint but did not deliver these arguments himself. But Lynch could not recall himself delivering the opening or closing arguments or making an oral argument himself in court as the AG. Since we're on the topic of experience, we asked all three Republican AG campaigns about their candidate's recent time in the courtroom. Bondi worked for the state attorney's office in Hillsborough County for 18 years until she resigned in December to run for office, said Brett Doster, a campaign spokesman. She was in the courtroom throughout her tenure, he said. "Two of her cases are on death row right now," said Doster, who said Bondi also handled "any criminal issue you can imagine." Kottkamp, elected as Gov. Crist's lieutenant governor in 2006, "did extensive trial and appeals work" before he held his current position, according to campaign spokesman David Bishop. The last case he could recall in the courtroom was in 2005. "It was while he was with the law firm Henderson, Franklin, Starnes & Holt. He represented Publix Super Markets. Case was in Florida 2nd DCA,'' Bishop wrote. And now Benson. Benson's campaign said that since she was a transactional lawyer -- a term that refers to business deals -- most of her legal experience was outside of the courtroom. She was the secretary for DBPR in 2007 and 2008 and secretary for AHCA 2008-2009. Before those administrative positions, she was a state representative between 2000 and 2007. Benson worked as a municipal bond lawyer from 1996-2007 "and while she occasionally had bond validation hearings in front of judges, she did not routinely appear in court," Bridges said in an e-mail. "The main role for AG is to actually manage and run an agency -- not to try cases on a regular basis," Bridges said in an interview. So where does that leave us? Benson said that "most AGs don't appear in court." McCollum's AG office says he hasn't appeared in court and had no record of Crist appearing in court although we were able to find an example of a case in which Crist did appear. Butterworth said he might have gone to court 25 times in 16 years -- so less than twice a year. By looking at the three most recent examples in Florida, AGs rarely go to court -- but it does happen. So we give Benson a Mostly True.	None	Holly Benson	None	None	None	2010-08-19T10:09:52	2010-07-31	['None']
pomt-01598	"Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies: corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns" and got $570 million in job-development incentives	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/03/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-walker-gave-570-m/	A TV ad by a liberal political group blames lagging job growth on Gov. Scott Walker, charging that millions in precious job-development funds went to his pals and campaign donors. The ad begins with snippets of TV news reports highlighting Wisconsin’s employment struggles compared with its neighbors, then a narrator does the rest: "What’s Scott Walker doing wrong? Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies … corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns … $570 million of our jobs money to Scott Walker’s friends. That’s how things work in Scott Walker’s Wisconsin." The ad, which began airing Aug. 20, 2014, is from the Greater Wisconsin Committee, a group funded by labor unions and Democratic ideological groups, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. Is the group right to say $570 million went to Walker "cronies?" The figure comes from a document released in May 2014 by the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now. It was entitled "W is for WEDC: Gov. Scott Walker’s privatized Commerce Department: A case study in corruption, cronyism and incompetence." Early in his term, Walker replaced the public Commerce Department with the private-public Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC). His stated rationale was to narrow the focus to job creation. In 2013, state auditors found the agency didn't adequately follow up to see if jobs were being created by companies granted incentives; didn't clearly report the jobs numbers it did have; and gave awards to ineligible businesses and projects. In the wake of that, One Wisconsin Now sought to connect Walker’s gubernatorial campaign donors to the loans, grants, bonds, tax credits or other financial assistance granted or overseen by the WEDC agency, which is chaired by Walker. The group said it found $570 million in financial incentives to 192 firms whose employees were a source of campaign donations to Walker. It said Walker received more than $1 million between 2009 and 2013 from people associated with the firms, and in some cases their spouses. (The incentives are paid in full over several years, unless goals are not met.) We ran our own checks on the $570 million figure and talked to One Wisconsin Now, the Greater Wisconsin Committee and the Walker campaign about the ad. Bottom line: There is a way to get to that number, but it’s a big stretch to characterize it as the Greater Wisconsin Committee did in its ad. Looking at the contributions There’s no doubt that people associated with companies that received WEDC help have given to Walker’s campaigns. One example: In 2011 and 2013, WEDC gave Sargento Foods access to $1.5 million in tax credits to support capital projects. From 2009 to 2013, Sargento company executives and their spouses, and other company employees, gave more than $81,000 to Walker’s campaigns. They gave nothing to Walker’s opponents in that period. All of that’s nothing new -- Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, received such donations, as no doubt every governor has. And it is perhaps particularly unsurprising in Walker’s case, given that the Republican’s natural base of support is business. But the TV ad plays fast and loose in describing all these donors as Walker "cronies," which it defines as "corporate friends." The use of the word "crony" itself, of course, carries a negative spin. And when the ad cites two media sources to back the language it uses, it misleads on both. The ad lists WKOW-TV in Madison as the source of the "friends" description in relation to the incentives. But the station’s online story cited in the ad just called them donors. The ad cites Isthmus, Madison’s free weekly newspaper, for the "cronies" term. The publication did use the phrase, but in a story from July 18, 2013 -- a year before the $570 million number came out. Equal opportunity givers More significantly, the research that underlies the $570 million figure counts numerous companies whose employees have also given to Democrats. Indeed, major candidates from both parties typically receive backing from business -- money flows to the party in power, and its allies. The Greater Wisconsin Committee itself has received money from groups supported by wealthy business interests, according to data from the Democracy Campaign. Our examination found that 35 companies that received more than $295 million in help from Walker’s WEDC have in the past supported Doyle through employee donations. That includes givers at major firms such as Menards, Ashley Furniture and Kohl’s. If you knock out just those Doyle-connected firms, the $570 million is already down to about $275 million. Similar connections can be found for contributions to Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (who faced Walker in 2010 and in the 2012 recall) and other Democrats, including to a much lesser extent Walker’s 2014 opponent Mary Burke. Even more revealing is the case of biotech firm Promega Corp. of Fitchburg, which got $75 million in bonding authority overseen by WEDC. That put it on the ad's "crony" list. But the firm’s founder, William Linton, has given nothing to Walker. In contrast, he gave $6,000 to Doyle, $17,500 to Barrett for his two campaigns against Walker and $1,000 to Burke, late last year. Promega employees have given overwhelmingly to Democrats and liberals for years, to the tune of more than $30,000. Just two employees gave a total of $600 to Walker, based on our check of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign’s searchable campaign finance database. Yet the company makes the list. More issues To be sure, donations from workers at some firms have been sizeable. Donations totalled $5,000 or more to Walker from employees at 45 firms that won $172 million in assistance. But the analysis used in the ad didn’t distinguish between CEOs making maximum donations and rank-and-file workers whose small donations may have had nothing to do with any desire of the company to stay in Walker’s good graces. Nor did it matter if donors gave right around the time of getting an award, or made a small gift three years earlier. Eleven firms that received $14 million in help were counted even though their employees gave $100 or less in total. Was Walker rewarding "friends" when WEDC awarded retail giant Amazon $7 million in tax credits in October 2013? An Amazon software engineer in Ohio did give Walker’s campaign a total of $160 that year in two donations, the only ones identified as from Amazon employees to Walker. That alone put Amazon on the list. A contribution that size is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Walker’s $56 million, 50-state fundraising take since mid-2009. We tried an exercise, selecting $1,000 in donations as a minimum "crony" threshold -- surely your close friends at one firm would give that much over 5 years. Companies whose owners and employees cumulatively gave less than $1,000 -- and didn’t give to Doyle -- account for $160 million in aid out of the $570 million. If you take out that $160 million, the bottom line falls to around $115 million. 275 from above - 160 Plus, we found that $7.5 million in deals were wrongly attributed to the Walker era when they were made under Doyle. One last note: More than $295 million of the $570 million in WEDC aid cited by the ad came from flood-relief loans for developers as part of the federal flood-relief program known as Midwest Disaster Area Bonds. The Walker campaign protests that it’s misleading to include those in the WEDC aid total because local communities, not WEDC, issue the bond funds. Still, the agency assists developers in some cases, allocates bonding authority and reviews the deals, even bragging that the program helps toward Walker’s goal of 250,000 new private-sector jobs. Our rating The liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee PAC claimed that "Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies: corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns" and got $570 million in incentives. The list of companies that won $570 million and gave to Walker is a starting point for trying to spot instances in which a true Walker crony got a sweet deal. But that’s all it is. Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past. Many of the donations were small, and Walker’s jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. The ad makes a red-hot charge that suggests corruption, even putting a dollar figure on it, but can’t deliver the goods. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12577	"Data shows that vehicle break-in is the No. 1 crime in the city, but also the No. 1 crime in the South Side Flats, and it’s closely followed by assault."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/11/bruce-kraus/vehicle-break-most-common-crime-pittsburgh/	Parking is a contentious issue in the nightlife hotspot South Side Flats — and according to Pittsburgh City Council President Bruce Kraus, it’s also the source of the city’s most common crime. As part of an effort to ease parking woes for residents and improve public safety, the city launched shuttle service Nite Rider on March 17. The fare-free shuttle runs Friday and Saturday evenings, allowing Pittsburghers to leave their cars at the Second Avenue Parking Plaza to go to the nightlife on East Carson Street and the surrounding South Side Flats. It’s part of a "public safety strategy designed as a transportation strategy," Kraus told The Incline, adding that vehicle break-ins are the most frequent crime in the South Side Flats — and overall in the city. Within the Flats, assault is the No. 2 crime (if simple and aggravated assaults are combined), Kraus said. "Data shows that vehicle break-in is the No. 1 crime in the city, but also the No. 1 crime in the South Side Flats, and it’s closely followed by assault. So it’s always been my dream that if we take cars out of residential areas, put them in a single, secure lighted location, they’re easier to patrol, there’s less chance of miscreant behavior, and I’m hoping at the end of the year to show a drastic reduction in vehicle break-ins," Kraus said. While the Nite Ride and other changes, including extended parking meter hours, are designed to make it easier and more inviting to go to the South Side business district, we wondered, are vehicle break-ins really the top crime in the South Side Flats? And in the city? Kraus told The Incline that he based his statement on conversations with Zone 3 Pittsburgh Police Commander Karen Dixon, and the data they discussed is reflected in the police bureau’s Annual Report. The most current version of that report available is from 2015. In it, police breakdown reported crimes into 24 categories, plus an "other" section. Of the 24 specific crimes, theft was No. 1 in 2015 with 7,101 reported incidents out of the year’s total of 30,900 reports. Those numbers are tabulated based on reports to police. But theft is a broad category that includes more than just vehicle break-ins. In 2015, there were 2,311 reports of vehicle break-ins or "theft from auto," as police call it, per Emily Schaffer, spokeswoman for the public safety department. When theft is split into those two categories — theft from auto and other theft — that puts theft from auto as the fourth most common crime in 2015, behind simple assault at No. 1 (5,446), followed by other theft (4,790) and vandalism (3,507). In the report’s neighborhood breakdown, theft was also No. 1 for 2015 at 505. Of those, 190 were "theft from auto" per Schaffer. Using the same list of 24 specific crimes for 2015, after theft is public drunkenness in second with 323 incidents, and in third, 310 simple assault incidents. However, combining simple assault with the 61 aggravated assaults brings it to No. 2, as Kraus said, with a total of 371 assaults. But, split theft from auto and other theft, and vehicle break-ins come in at No. 5. First is 323 incidents of public drunkenness, second is 315 reported thefts, third is 310 reports of simple assault and fourth is 211 reports of vandalism. If aggravated and simple assaults are combined, it becomes the most common crime in the South Side Flats in 2015, followed by public drunkenness, other theft, vandalism and theft from auto. Our ruling When theft is split into "theft from auto" and "other theft," vehicle break-ins fall to the fourth most common crime across the city and No. 5 in the South Side Flats. That split also makes simple and aggravated assaults the most common crime in the neighborhood for 2015. The councilmember would have been on firm ground if he had said theft — the category vehicle break-ins falls into — was the most common crime in the city and South Side Flats. When looking at the overall theft category and combining the two assault categories, theft does become the most common crime, and Kraus also would be correct that the second most common crime in the Flats is assault. We rule the claim False.	None	Bruce Kraus	None	None	None	2017-04-11T13:17:54	2017-03-22	['None']

pomt-09185	"The Democratic Congress has already taken significant steps to create jobs and jump-start the economy, resulting in the lowest tax rates in over 50 years and the creation of over 500,000 new jobs so far this year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/02/mark-critz/critz-touts-democratic-role-low-taxes-job-creation/	On May 27, 2010 -- less than 10 days after winning a House seat in a special election -- Rep. Mark Critz, D-Pa., took to the House floor to tout what his fellow Democrats have been doing to improve the nation's dismal economy. "The Democratic Congress has already taken significant steps to create jobs and jump-start the economy, resulting in the lowest tax rates in over 50 years and the creation of over 500,000 new jobs so far this year," Critz said. We'll analyze his points one by one. • Are tax rates the lowest in over 50 years? It depends on the definition of the phrase "tax rate" -- whether you literally mean the rate, or whether you look at how the tax burden falls on the average American. If you only look at the rate for the federal income tax, the lowest bracket -- currently applying to families earning up to $16,750 -- has been 10 percent since 2002. That's the lowest it has been in the past 50 years, with the exception of the period 1977 to 1986, when it was zero (but when there was no standard deduction, as there is today). If you look at the top tax bracket, the rates today are also low, though -- as is the case with the lowest bracket -- not the lowest in 50 years. Since 2003, the top rate, which is currently levied on families earning above $373,650, has been 35 percent. The only period when it was lower was between 1988 and 1992, when the top rate ranged from 31 to 33 percent. (And it's been far higher: As late as 1963, the top rate was 91 percent.) Of course, Americans also pay state and local taxes. The rates vary widely by state, but the most recent available national average, for 2008, is 9.7 percent. That's well within the historical range: Since 1977, the national average has remained within a narrow band of 9.3 percent to 10.3 percent. So tax rates today are fairly low, but not at absolute record lows for the past 50 years. What about tax burden? Although he didn't use that word, when people talk about rates, they often mean the overall burden. The most complete accounting we've seen is a table of tax data assembled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that measures the average federal income tax rate -- that is, federal income taxes paid divided by income -- for four-person families at three representative levels of income. The data covers the years 1955 to 2009: At half the median national income and at the median income, the rates for 2008 and 2009 are the lowest on record, and at twice the median income, it is lower than every year since 1967 except for one (2003). In fact, a family at half the median income (which calculates to roughly $38,000) actually got 8.33 percent of their income back from the government in 2008 and 8.28 percent back in 2009. (That's due to refundable credits, mainly the Earned Income Tax Credit.) The rate for median families ($76,000 last year) paid just 3.54 percent of their income in taxes in 2008 and 4.63 percent in 2009, while families at twice the median income (nearly $152,000) paid 12.35 percent of their income in taxes in 2008 and 12.58 percent in 2009. Other measures confirm the general trendline. The Tax Foundation, an independent tax-research group in Washington, has found that the average taxpayer's combined tax burden accounted for 26.6 percent of income in 2009 and 26.9 percent in 2010, the lowest since 1965. And according to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, total federal tax receipts were 14.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, the lowest percentage since 1950. So Critz is on safe ground when he says that the rate of taxes paid to income earned is at low levels compared to the past 50 years. He probably should have used the phrase "tax burden" rather than "tax rate," but the terminology he used isn't incorrect. So for this portion of his statement, we rate him Mostly True. • Have 500,000 new jobs been created so far this year? Politicians love to talk about "jobs created," but in reality, there's no statistic that specifically calculates the numbers of jobs created. Instead, this number usually refers to the net increase in jobs from one time period to another. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the net monthly increases were 14,000 jobs for January, 39,000 for February, 230,000 for March, and 290,000 for April. If you add these up, they total 573,000 jobs, making Critz's statement correct. We'll note that the March and April figures are preliminary. But given what we know now, we rate this part of Critz's statement True. • Does the Democratic Congress deserve credit for the low tax rates and the jobs created? Let's take jobs first. To the extent that any political entity deserves credit for the job growth, the Democratic Congress would qualify. Along with President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat, they have exercised unified control of the government since January 2009. But it's a huge stretch to say all the job gains are the work of the Democratic-run government. There is considerable debate among economists about how much the Democratic stimulus bill truly helped the economy. And given the many factors that help shape the national and international economy, many observers have argued that the president and Congress usually get too much credit during good times and too much blame during bad times. On taxes, it's also complicated. The Democrats can rightly take credit for the inclusion of tax cuts in Obama's economic stimulus bill since only three Congressional Republicans voted for it. The administration says that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $288 billion in tax relief, of which roughly $163 billion has been paid out so far. And stimulus money helped many states stave off tax increases that they might otherwise have been forced to impose had there been no stimulus. But economists we interviewed emphasized that two other major factors have also played a role in keeping taxes low -- and Congressional Democrats can hardly claim credit for these. The first is the Republican-driven tax-cutting measures passed in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. They were largely opposed by Democrats, but established today's relatively low federal income tax rates. The second factor is the recession. By nature, all recessions depress taxation rates, as individuals and families shift to lower tax brackets and, as a result, pay out less of their income in taxes. The Bush tax cuts and the recession are "hardly facets of the issue that a newly minted Democrat should be touting," said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Overall, then, Critz was mostly right on the stats -- that taxes are relatively low right now, and that 500,000 jobs have been created this year. But it's a stretch for him to suggest that the Democrats deserve any more than partial credit for the shape of today's tax landscape. So we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-08591	A bill by Earl Blumenauer would "mandate GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/delia-lopez/delia-lopez-says-earl-blumenauer-trying-track-amer/	Rep. Earl Blumenauer wants to know where you are and where you’re going. At least that’s what his Republican challenger has been telling voters these days on her website and in talk radio appearances. According to Republican congressional hopeful Delia Lopez, Blumenauer sponsored a bill that would put "GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles." Here’s her grievance in detail:: "Earl Blumenauer is the sponsor of HR-3311 to mandate GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles. To track our every mile and know everywhere we go. The pilot program will waste hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when we are already deep in debt and spending too much. ... This bill is designed to transition us to a per mile vehicle tax system called The Road User Fee Pilot Project and would be administered by the Treasury Department otherwise know as the IRS. This system will track all American cars using a new form of taxation. Cars will be taxed by the mileage they drive. Under the bill the IRS or Treasury will appropriate $154,000,000 of taxpayers money in the form of free grants to well connected commercial manufactures. It means that every car in America will be tracked through whatever method they choose. This constitutes absolute surveillance whether on public or private property, welcome to another attack on the 4th amendment." Sounds more than a little Orwellian, right? The government, with one little-noticed bill, is going to start tracking your every vehicular movement. Or is it? PolitiFact Oregon decided to dig into this claim, which has been making the rounds on conservative websites even outside the state. First, let’s start with the basics: It’s true that Blumenauer is the sponsor of H.R. 3311, and it’s also true that the bill, if passed, would cost the government a little over $154 million. But beyond that, Lopez’s argument doesn’t track. A reading of the actual bill shows that, rather than install GPS tracking devices into all cars nationwide, Blumenauer is looking to set up a national pilot program that would test alternative ways of taxing road use. This shouldn’t be too new to Oregonians. For more than a decade, state policy makers have been trying to figure out how to pay for road maintenance once gas taxes drop because hybrids and electric cars rule the roads. It’s true, GPS could be used in one or more the programs that might spring up if this bill becomes law. In Oregon’s own statewide pilot program, the Department of Transportation used GPS as its main method of tracking mileage. But, as Blumenauer spokesman Willie Smith points out, GPS is just one way to go about this, and, in fact, there’s no stipulation in the bill that GPS (which isn’t even mentioned in the legislation) be a part of the trial program. "There’s a number of methods for this," Smith said. "Our bill doesn’t prescribe one way or another." PolitiFact Oregon reads the bill the same way. Moreover, it should be noted that the bill includes a provision that all pilot programs be evaluated on the basis of a few criteria, including "protection of personal privacy." Candidate Lopez, however, remains unconvinced. "I think it’s quite plain that the idea in there is to put the GPS tracking in all of our vehicles," she said. "It may be squirmy verbiage that’s put in there. They don’t want to admit that this is exactly what they want to do." Squirmy verbiage or not, a $154 million pilot program with no specific mandates for GPS and a clause that keeps an eye out for personal privacy is miles away from Lopez’s description of a bill that would mandate tracking devices in "all our vehicles." Lopez is significantly distorting what Blumenauer's bill would do and ignoring the fact that GPS isn't even mentioned in it. With all that in mind, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-13532	Says U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin voted to "force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/30/end-citizens-united/pac-ad-say-bruce-poliquin-voted-force-seniors-pay-/	The political action committee End Citizens United has launched a multi-pronged attack ad against Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, accusing the businessman of making health care more costly for older Americans. In a 30-second television commercial, the PAC says Poliquin voted for a Medicare proposal that would "force seniors to pay thousands more." "He’d even force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs," the ad says. Poliquin's office objected to the ad, saying in a news release, "Congressman Poliquin has been working to get prescription drug prices down, not up. That’s why he strongly supported Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for our seniors." Who's right here? Both sides are spinning the truth. End Citizens United spokesman Adam Bozzi says the claim is a reference to Poliquin's March 25, 2015, vote for a Republican budget that called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure passed the House, but it had no shot of passing the Senate and surviving the veto of President Barack Obama Obama. The language of the ad itself if difficult to understand. We watched the ad several times and weren’t entirely sure if the ad said, "He’d even force seniors to pay …" or "He even forced seniors to pay …" The wording difference might mislead voters as to what Poliquin did or hoped to do. Either way, End Citizens United says a vote to repeal Obamacare is a vote to force seniors to pay more for drugs because repealing Obamacare would eliminate a fix to Medicare Part D known as the prescription drug doughnut hole. Here's what they’re talking about. In 2010, seniors had to pay full price for the first $310 worth of prescription drugs purchased. Between $310 and $2,830, insurance kicked in and Medicare paid 75 percent of the cost. But once the bill exceeded $2,830, seniors had to pay the full price of their drugs until the annual bill reached $4,550 (the doughnut hole). Then catastrophic insurance kicked in and insurance covered 95 percent of the cost. So the "hole" was the $1,720 gap between $2,830 and $4,550. In 2006, 4 million seniors ended up paying full price for some of their prescriptions because of the gap. The health care law, passed in 2010, sought to shrink and eliminate that gap in coverage. The gap is in the process of being phased out and will close completely in 2020. But even closing it gradually, combined with other features of Obamacare saved nearly 10.7 million seniors more than $20 billion on drug costs, according to a February 2016 estimate by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That's nearly $2,000 per senior since the law was enacted. Repealing Obamacare would cost seniors in other ways, as we outlined two years ago. Poliquin’s campaign argued that Poliquin actually voted against an attempt to repeal Obamacare in February 2015, because there was no plan to replace it. He voted for repeal the following month because the Republican budget had a better plan that would have kept traditional Medicare "as a plan option" for people in or near retirement but privatized part of the program. There was another vote on repealing Obamacare on Jan. 6, 2016. Poliquin voted in favor of it. His spokesman, Michael Byerly, said that wasn't really a vote to repeal "as it technically only repealed the harmful taxes and provisions that have caused prices to go up." But sponsor Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, opened debate on the measure by saying, "For the first time since the law was enacted, Congress is one vote away from sending a broad repeal of Obamacare to the president’s desk." Byerly, Poliquin's spokesman, also argued that prescription drug prices have gone up because of Obamacare itself, referring us to a 2010 letter from the Congressional Budget Office predicting a 1 percent increase for established drugs. Democrats, in turn, have argued that Obamacare has kept health costs lower than they would have been without the legislation. As we've reported in the past, such arguments are debatable. To sum it up, Poliquin never voted to raise drug prices directly. He voted to repeal the health care law -- a show vote that could have resulted in drug prices going up for Medicare recipients. Our ruling End Citizens United's ad says Poliquin voted to "force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs." It gives the misleading impression that he voted on that specific issue when, in fact, he was voting to repeal the 2010 health care law. If the repeal bill had become law — it didn’t — it would have removed provisions phasing out a prescription drug doughnut hole for Medicare recipients. End Citizens United’s claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

pomt-06057	Barack Obama’s recess appointment of Richard Cordray "is precisely what then-Sen. Obama claimed would be ‘the wrong thing to do.’"	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-once-criticized-appointment/	With the presidential race intensifying, Richard Cordray is about to become a household name -- Republican shorthand for the recess appointment heard ‘round the political world. Last week, President Barack Obama bypassed a Senate roadblock to install the former Ohio attorney general as the nation’s top consumer-finance watchdog. The decision, which Obama announced in a visit to Shaker Heights High School, brought immediate scorn from the GOP. Mindful of the election-year climate, PolitiFact Ohio was eager for reaction from Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and favorite for the Republican presidential nomination. Romney, in a pejorative nod to Obama’s hometown, delivered as might be expected. "This action represents Chicago-style politics at its worst and is precisely what then-Sen. Obama claimed would be ‘the wrong thing to do,’ " Romney said in an emailed statement. PolitiFact Ohio will leave alone the "Chicago-style politics" remark. But because Republicans are likely to repeat variations of this argument in the coming months, we decided to dig deeper to learn whether the president had indeed departed from an earlier stance on recess appointments. So first we checked in with the Romney campaign to ask for citations. Spokesman Ryan Williams quickly referred us to two Obama quotes from 2005. That was the year then-President George W. Bush bypassed Congress to install John Bolton as United Nations ambassador. And as the quotes Ryan offered show, then-Sen. Obama was not at all happy about it. On July 30, 2005, the Associated Press reported that Obama said a recess appointment would be "the wrong thing to do." Bolton, Obama added, "is the wrong person for the job." The other article the Romney campaign cited appeared a few days later in the State Journal-Register of Springfield, Ill. Here’s how Williams presented Obama’s quote about Bolton to PolitiFact Ohio: "To some degree, he’s damaged goods … somebody who couldn’t get through a nomination in the Senate. And I think that means we will have less credibility …" But when we tracked down the original quotes, we found Williams left out key context. In the AP story, Obama followed up his "wrong thing to do" comment by acknowledging that Bush "is entitled to take that action, but I don't think it will serve American foreign policy well." And here is Obama’s full quote from the State Journal-Register: "To some degree, he’s damaged goods. Not in the history of the United Nations representatives have we ever had a recess appointment, somebody who couldn’t get through a nomination in the Senate. And I think that means we will have less credibility and ironically be less equipped to reform the United Nations in the way that it needs to be reformed." In their entirety, these quotes suggest Obama’s reservations were less about the process and more about the appointee. Obama clearly recognized Bush’s right to make the recess appointment. But Obama and other Senate Democrats had opposed Bolton’s appointment primarily because he was a known critic of the U.N. They argued that Bolton’s record made him a bad fit for the job, a point that would be underscored by Bush’s recess appointment. This is not the first time an Obama recess appointment has been compared with the Bolton pick. In early 2010, the president took flak for appointing Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board. Republicans feared Becker, a lawyer who had worked for the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO, would favor unions in labor-management disputes. At the time, PolitiFact noted that during the Bolton controversy, Democrats accused him of submitting inaccurate information to the Senate. PolitiFact also considered a letter that Obama and 35 other Senate Democrats sent to Bush in protest of the Bolton appointment. They asked that Bush "submit a new nomination," rather than send an unconfirmed ambassador to the U.N. PolitiFact found Obama’s recess appointment of Becker to be a "Half Flip," noting that the GOP objected to Becker, as the Democrats objected to Bolton, on "policy grounds" and merits. "If every appointee for whom Obama made a recess appointment was noncontroversial, Obama would have a good argument that the two situations were different," PolitiFact ruled. Cordray, conversely, was not himself controversial. Republicans who blocked his appointment expressed little if any concern about his temperament or views. Many had kind words for him. Their beef was with the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau he now leads. Jay Carney, Obama’s press secretary, explained the differences thusly in a Jan. 5 briefing: "There is no question about [Cordray’s] qualifications for this job. In the case of Mr. Bolton there were a great many questions about his qualifications for the job and a great deal of opposition to his nomination on the merits, on his qualifications, and that makes this quite different." After reviewing the Bolton appointment and the full statements on which Romney bases his claim, we’re not sure the Cordray situation is, as Carney contends, "quite different." Nor is it, as Romney asserts, "precisely" what Obama once said was "the wrong thing to do." Romney’s claim is partially accurate. In both cases you have a president ignoring the protests of the opposing party in Congress. And Obama did criticize the Bolton appointment. But in Bolton’s case you have Democrats scrutinizing the appointee himself and then-Sen. Obama questioning whether Bolton can effectively work with an institution he has criticized. In Cordray’s case, you have Republicans blocking an appointee because they are unhappy with the agency. Romney used the word "precisely" to draw a comparison that was not nearly as black and white as he implied. And the versions of the quotes that his staff cited in support of his claim were abridged, leaving out important details that would help the listener put Obama’s statements in context. As such, on the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Romney’s claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-11T06:00:00	2012-01-04	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-06159	Says Newt Gingrich "made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who were in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-newt-gingrich-promised-sup/	Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann says that, as president, she will be "100 percent pro-life from conception until natural death." And she says the same can’t be said of her opponents. In a Republican presidential primary debate in Sioux City, Iowa, on Dec. 15, 2011, Bachmann attacked front-runner Newt Gingrich, the former U.S. House speaker, for his past actions on abortion. She said he passed on a chance to defund Planned Parenthood, then lobbed this bombshell: "And also I think even more troubling, when he was in Washington, D.C., he made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who are in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion," Bachmann said. Did we hear that right? The man who led the Republican takeover of Congress and authored the conservative Contract with America said he’d campaign for late-term abortion proponents? This called for a fact check. The background In 1998, when Gingrich was speaker, a feud erupted within the Republican National Committee over a proposal to cut off funding for any Republican candidate who refused to support a ban on partial-birth abortion, a procedure involving the extraction of a late-term fetus. Republicans in Congress had failed to get a ban enacted -- President Bill Clinton had vetoed two measures. So GOP leaders sought to ensure that any Republican who got elected would support the ban. But many in the party -- Gingrich among them -- objected to the funding cut, saying the approach would "set an unhealthy precedent -- the party hierarchy trying to dictate to rank and file voters whom they should elect and why," according to the Boston Globe. Gingrich spoke at a luncheon during the RNC’s winter meeting in California on Jan. 16, 1998. Here are excerpts of his remarks on the subject: "Let me make very clear I have voted to ban partial births. I have consistently sided with Henry Hyde and Chris Smith on issues that are matters of right to life. I believe deeply and passionately in the right to life, and I think those of us who believe that have an obligation to do all we can. "I am also the Republican speaker of the House, and I can tell you that Henry Hyde would not be chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Orrin Hatch would not be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee if the Republican Party decides that we are no longer a broad party that invites people who broadly share our views, but we are going to start going down a road where we start limiting who people get to pick in primaries. After all, it is the voters of America who choose who the nominees are. It is the voters of America who have a right -- some places they are going to pick people who are to my right; some places they are going to pick people who are to my left. "And in both cases, if they are the Republican nominee, I am going to actively campaign for them, because when they get to Congress, whether they are a moderate Republican from the Northeast, whether they are a very conservative Republican from the South or West -- whatever their background, I am going to turn to them and say, ‘This is the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- of course you are going to vote to make him chairman.’" He called the funding ban a "tactical mistake" because it pulled focus from Clinton’s vetoes. "The country doesn't think it makes any sense to have children killed in the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth months, particularly killed in this horrible, barbaric procedure. That's where the attention was focused, on the president's veto. And we should go back," Gingrich said. The funding ban failed on a voice vote in the RNC. A substitute amendment, saying that the party "reaffirms its principled opposition to partial-birth abortions and commits to banning this heinous procedure from America forever," passed instead. When we contacted the Bachmann campaign, a spokeswoman sent us a press release that included this quote from an Associated Press story dated a week after the RNC meeting. "Gingrich said he opposes the ‘barbaric’ abortion procedure, and would continue to vote to ban it. But he argued that the resolution was the wrong way to eliminate partial-birth abortions. ‘We don’t want to say to that the Republican National Committee is going to say to the primary voters of Charlotte, the primary voters of Greensboro, the primary voters of Columbia, S.C., if you pick the wrong person, we’re not going to support you,’ Gingrich said. ‘I think there’s a certain arrogance in saying (RNC members) nationally are now going to dictate in the primaries in every part of the country,’ he said." Our ruling Bachmann said of Gingrich, "When he was in Washington, D.C., he made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who were in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion." She correctly stated what Gingrich told the RNC in 1998. She even used his exact words to describe partial-birth abortion, calling it a "barbaric procedure." Gingrich said he was being a pragmatist in order to maintain a majority in Congress so that it could successfully ban the procedure. He said he’d campaign for all Republicans, even those to the left of him, because he didn’t think party leaders should be "purging" Republican candidates and dictating to voters whom they should choose.

pomt-01982	"Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/16/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-said-senate-democrats-only-moved-fund/	As details of the turmoil within the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to unfold, Congress is scrambling to pass legislation to fix to the problem. One House Republican accused Democrats of closing the barn door after the horse got out. "It’s been more than 177 days since the House passed bipartisan legislation that would authorize these VA clinics," Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement on June 5, 2014. "Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action. We need to continue working towards patient-centered solutions so all veterans have access to quality healthcare." Is it true that Senate Democrats only moved to fund new veterans health clinics after the scandal broke in April? In a word: No. The bill Cassidy references is H.R. 3251, the Department of Veterans Affairs Major Medical Facility Lease Authorization Act of 2013. The bill, authored by Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., authorized the funding of 27 new Veterans Affairs health facilities around the country. On Dec. 10, 2013, the House passed the bill almost unanimously with a vote of 346 to 1. (Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., was the lone "no" vote.) The bill stalled in the Senate. In fact, it never made it out of the Veterans' Affairs committee. But as is so often the case, the Senate was working on its own bill, and that one failed because Senate Republicans objected to it. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced S. 1950, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014, on Jan. 16. (It would later be renumbered S. 1982). The scope of the bill was much broader than just funding 27 new VA health clinics. For example, it also included an expansion of physical and mental health benefits for some veterans and their families. Whereas Miller’s bill was nine pages, Sanders’ was 367 pages. Republicans objected to several components of Sanders’ bill, including its funding mechanism. Sanders would pay for his bill with money that would have gone toward the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Republicans said those savings were already expected, so it wasn’t a real source of money. (For what it’s worth, the House bill did not really specify where its funding would be taken from.) Republicans also hinged support for the bill on the inclusion of sanctions against Iran. Democrats tried to bring Sanders’ bill up for a vote on Feb. 27. Republicans made a parliamentary maneuver that imposed a 60-vote threshold to bring it to the floor. With just 56 Senators voting "yea" — including two Republicans — the bill failed to advance. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Veterans' Affairs committee, said he was concerned about the costs and the expansion of the VA when there were already considerable problems with wait times. In a press release, the American Legion lamented the bill’s failure. "There was a right way to vote and a wrong way to vote today, and 41 senators chose the wrong way," American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger said. "That’s inexcusable." That said, there wasn’t unanimous backing of the bill by veterans groups. In an op-ed, Stew­art Hickey, national exec­u­tive direc­tor for American Veterans, or AMVETS, said Sanders’ "kitchen sink-like" bill "would be morally irre­spon­si­ble and fis­cally unsound." For the next couple months, Sen. David Vitter, R-La., and Sanders went back and forth on the status of the veterans bill. On March 11, Vitter offered an amendment to to the House bill that would pay for the new VA clinics through price controls for prescription drugs purchased by the Defense Department. Sanders said he supported the new clinics, but also wanted other provisions included in the comprehensive legislation. On April 9, Miller, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, announced that dozens of Arizona veterans died waiting for care from the VA, and he had evidence showing that administrators at the Phoenix office were forging wait times. There were multiple points along the way when Sam Foote, a doctor of internal medicine at the Phoenix VA before he retired, attempted to blow the whistle on the bad practices in Arizona, including a December meeting with the Arizona Republic and a letter to the VA inspector general. But it wasn’t until Miller’s comments that the story broke and became a national scandal, eventually leading to the resignation of Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. Also on April 9, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. — who Cassidy is challenging for Senate in November — actually called for the House Republican bill to be discharged from the Senate Veteran Affairs committee. But that effort was blocked by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who asked for Vitter’s amendment to be included. Sanders objected. "Both parties had a role in this," said Joe Davis, spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars. A spokeswoman for Cassidy said the congressman was only referring to Senate inaction on the House measure in his statement. However, that isn’t how his statement reads. If that were the case, it would mean that Senate Democrats had decided to take up the House bill after the scandal hit, which isn’t true. Our ruling Cassidy said that "only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action." That’s not accurate. Democrats tried to pass an expansive veterans’ bill that included funding for the same 27 new clinics that Cassidy and the House passed last December. The bill was blocked by Senate Republicans, who were concerned about its funding and its scope. They also wanted to include sanctions against Iran. It’s fine for Cassidy to say Democrats bear some responsibility for not taking up the simpler House legislation, but it’s incorrect for him to claim that it took the scandal to propel Democrats into efforts to pass a VA bill. That’s revisionist history, so we rate Cassidy’s statement False.	None	Bill Cassidy	None	None	None	2014-06-16T14:10:17	2014-06-05	['Harry_Reid', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13634	"U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!"	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2016/aug/10/allen-buckley/libertarian-buckley-target-about-gops-isakson-and-/	Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley knows he faces an uphill battle in his campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Libertarians usually pull only low single-digits of the overall Georgia voter turnout. And Isakson is a veteran lawmaker and a founding member of the state Republican establishment, which today holds sway over all statewide offices. Buckley ran unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2004 and 2008. But in 2008, he won enough votes in the general election to force a runoff between Republican Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin. An Atlanta tax attorney, Buckley thinks he has an issue that will resonate with voters if he can only get them to pay attention and understand the gravitas of the soaring federal debt. "U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!" Buckley states on his website as part of a graphic about Isakson votes to raise the federal debt limit. Is that possible? Has Isakson, who has pushed for a balanced budget amendment and who also blasts the federal debt on his campaign website, actually assisted the spending spree? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Buckley and Democrat Jim Barksdale will face Isakson in the November election. We first contacted Buckley, who said the graphic refers to Isakson’s repeated votes to raise the federal debt limit, which essentially means raising the cap on what the government is permitted to spend to pay the bills. "I believe Mr. Isakson has, irresponsibly and immorally, voted to grow the federal government through debt spending to the detriment of young people and our country." Buckley said in an email. He later added: "He largely created the mess and then voted to fund what he created." Buckley said Isakson voted for debt-bloating items like the war in Iraq and the Medicare prescription drug benefit and subsequently voted for debt-ceiling increases to cover the cost of the increased spending. Isakson’s campaign manager, Trey Kilpatrick, dismissed Buckley assertions, but did not dispute Isakson’s vote to raise the debt limit. "Mr. Buckley is trying to mislead voters by citing debt ceiling votes (required for solvency) without citing Johnny's votes against trillions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including voting against a minimum of $5 trillion in debt ceiling votes alone, or his vote for the Budget Control Act, which cut spending by over $2 trillion and, according to the Heritage Foundation, 'has shrunk the size of government more effectively than any budget tool in a generation," Kilpatrick wrote in an email. The debate over the federal debt comes at an interesting time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this month released a report that warned of vastly increased federal debt when compared to the Gross Domestic Product over the next three decades. Federal debt held by the public was 39 percent of GDP in 2008, but is now about 75 percent, the budget office said. That could rise to 86 percent by 2026 and a whopping 141 percent by 2046. "The prospect of such large debt poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policymakers with significant challenges," the budget office warned. The CBO said the government’s spending growth is outpacing revenues as spending soars for popular programs like Social Security and Medicare and interest on the government’s existing debt. The most popular programs cost a lot to maintain, and neither Democrats nor Republicans want to be blamed for cuts, experts told PolitiFact. PolitiFact consulted political and budget experts across the county. Their verdict: Buckley has a point about Isakson’s spending votes, but there is a lot of context missing. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said many of the most popular federal programs are also the most expensive. That puts politicians of all stripes in a difficult spot. "Some, like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Defense spending, interest on the debt etc. are bigger than others," Sabato said. "Given that many of these categories are mandatory, it’s hard to imagine that any member of Congress hasn’t cast votes that effectively increase the amount of debt the country incurs." Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute, said that by voting for debt-limit increases members of Congress have "kicked the can down the road" on the government’s debt problem. "Voting for annual deficit-financed budgets causes the accumulated debt to rise, but voting to increase the legal debt limit—as Isakson and others do regularly—ratifies the unsound practice of endlessly spending more than is taken in," Edwards wrote in an email. Kennesaw State University political scientist Kerwin Swint said voting to raise the debt ceiling is not quite the same thing as voting to create new programs or authorize new spending items "The alternative to not raising the debt ceiling is shutting down the government," Swint said. Buckley’s claim is "technically accurate of course but totally misleading," saidAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. Abramowitz said the U.S. should take advantage of extremely low interest rates to borrow more money to invest in much needed infrastructure improvements and other projects. "It cannot be emphasized enough that the debt obsession of some conservative politicians and pundits is totally misplaced at a time when the investing community is practically begging to purchase U.S. treasury notes at extremely low interest rates," Abramowitz said. Our ruling: Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley proclaimed on his campaign website: "U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!" Isakson did indeed vote to raise the debt ceiling, so Buckley has a valid point. But the alternative would be risking a government shutdown. That said, Buckley also pointed at that Isakson voted for some of the very programs that bloated the debt in the first place. We rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/678c89f4-52af-4e46-a0c6-780d26e73caf	None	Allen Buckley	None	None	None	2016-08-10T06:00:00	2016-07-13	['United_States']
pomt-01433	Says Rick Scott signed "laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/07/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-rick-scott-signed-laws-ultrasounds-a/	In his quest for the women’s vote. Democrat Charlie Crist continues to attack Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s record on abortion. "After it happened, Rick Scott threw a party back at the mansion. What was he celebrating?" says the Sept. 30 TV ad. "This: with a stroke of a pen Scott passed some of the most extreme anti-choice laws in the country. Laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion, even in cases of rape or incest." "Rick Scott celebrated taking away your voice and your choice," the ad concludes. We have written a lot about Crist’s record of conflicting statements about abortion -- though in this campaign he has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood. Scott, meanwhile, has consistently favored abortion restrictions. We wanted to know if the ad accurately presented what Scott signed into law. We found it was largely correct; Scott did sign legislation that restricted access to abortion. But there a few details here that are important. Scott signed ultrasound bill in 2011 In 2011, Scott signed four abortion-related bills, including one that required all women to receive an ultrasound before undergoing an abortion. Crist had vetoed a similar ultrasound law in 2010, calling it "almost mean-spirited." That was shortly after he left the GOP for his failed bid as an independent candidate for U.S. Senate. The law Scott signed requires women to get the ultrasound as well as an opportunity to review the ultrasound and have it explained to them. (Women can decline to review the ultrasound if they sign a form.) Previously, Florida law required ultrasounds prior to second trimester or later abortions, not first trimester abortions. Though the former law didn’t require first trimester ultrasounds, 29 of 31 abortion clinics did them anyway. The Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog reported that a month after signing the bills in 2011, Scott held a ceremonial signing with dozens of abortion opponents -- that’s the "party" that the ad references. "You should have the opportunity to see see an ultrasound of your child," Scott said in 2011. "It's your choice. You don't have to. This creates choice. I think it's very positive." Abortion law about viability in 2014 Crist’s ad also says Scott signed a law "restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest." That refers to HB 1047, which Scott signed in 2014 to change the timeline for cutting off abortions. The bill banned abortions once a fetus is considered viable, which is typically around 23 or 24 weeks of gestation. Previously, Florida banned abortions in the third trimester, or starting about two weeks later than the new restriction. The main purpose of the 2014 bill was to make all abortions occur earlier -- no matter if the pregnancies were a result of rape or incest. The new law only allows abortion after the point of viability to save the woman’s life or prevent major permanent damage "other than a psychological condition." It doesn’t mention rape or incest. The previous law didn’t mention rape or incest, but it did include a broad exception to "preserve the health of the pregnant woman." That broad language was what some people interpreted to potentially include rape or incest survivors. In reality, however, no woman has received a third-trimester abortion under any exception between 2011 and so far in 2014, according to state data. In 2013, 91 percent of abortions were in the first trimester and 9 percent in the second trimester, according to state data. So that means that women who want to terminate pregnancies that occurred as a result of rape or incest can still do so in the first semester and most of the second trimester -- depending on when a doctor determines viability. Rape and incest are rarely cited in abortions, according to state data. In 2013 there were about 73,000 abortions -- two were in cases of incest and about 272 due to rape -- so combined that equals less than one percent. At the time, Scott spokesman John Tupps wrote in a statement about the law that "Gov. Scott is pro-life and was glad to sign this bill that protects the lives of children." We asked Scott campaign spokesman Greg Blair if Scott supports the rape/incest exception throughout pregnancy or only until the point of viability and Blair told us that he supports those exceptions in "all cases." We asked why Scott then signed the law this session that doesn’t include those exceptions. We didn’t get a response. Finally, the ad said Scott signed "some of the most extreme anti-choice laws in the country." That’s a subjective call, but we should note that Florida hasn’t had widespread clinic closures. A Texas law caused 13 abortion clinics to close there. In Florida, there were 68 abortion clinics when Scott took office and there are 65 now. (Seven closed under Scott, but four new ones opened.) And, Florida had restrictive laws about abortion before Scott took office. Americans United for Life, a group that opposes abortion rights, ranked Florida 26th among states for restricting abortion in 2010 and 25th among states in 2014. NARAL, an organization that supports abortion rights, has given an "F" to about half the states, including Florida. Our ruling Crist said in an ad that Scott signed "laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest." Scott signed a law in 2011 that requires ultrasounds for all women before they get an abortion, and in 2014 he signed a law that stated women could not have an abortion after the point of viability. That means women could not have an abortion about two weeks earlier than before. The only stated exception was to save the woman's life. However, the previous law didn’t expressly include those exceptions either, though it had broad language that could potentially have been used to seek abortion for a rape or incest survivor in the third trimester. No woman, though, has had an abortion in Florida during the third trimester for any reason in recent years, even before the new law. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-10-07T14:26:13	2014-10-01	['None']

pomt-13061	Says John Bolton supported the Iraq War and said last year that "I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/17/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-john-bolton-still-thinks-iraq-war-w/	It's speculated that one of Donald Trump’s potential nominees for secretary of state is former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. Bolton received some hostile fire this week from a senator on his own side of the aisle. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blasted Bolton in a column on the media platform rare.us: "Rumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid." Paul is a libertarian who has often expressed skepticism about the United States launching wars overseas. Bolton is a staunch hawk who served as part of the national security brain trust of then-President George W. Bush during the launch of the Iraq War. In his column, Paul said Bolton was "one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. ‘I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,’ Bolton said just last year." In recent years, many Americans have turned against the war -- 51 percent in Gallup’s most recent poll, taken in June 2015 said it was a mistake, and Trump himself repeatedly argued that he was against the war. (He actually wasn’t, we and other fact-checkers found.) So has Bolton really remained steadfast about the wisdom of the decision to go after Saddam Hussein? Apparently, the answer is yes. We did not hear back from either Bolton’s office or from Paul’s office. However, Paul’s column included a link to his evidence. Paul pointed to a Talking Points Memo article, which in turn referenced an article in the Washington Examiner. In the Examiner article, published on May 14, 2015, senior congressional correspondent David Drucker quoted Bolton saying, "I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct. I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces. The people who say, ‘Oh, things would have been much better if you didn't overthrow Saddam,’ miss the point that today's Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone." This supports Paul’s assertion. Before drawing a final conclusion, we looked at two additional questions. First, did Bolton complain after the fact that the article misquoted him? We asked Drucker, who said, "No, they never complained -- him or his people." And second, has Bolton said anything else since then that would make his comment in the Examiner interview outdated? The answer here seems to be no, as well. We searched in both Google and Nexis and found no contrary comments by Bolton in the subsequent year and a half. The only relevant quote we found in our searches was published on the same day as the Examiner article. It was a blog post in the Washington Post that quoted Bolton saying, "My answer would have been: 'If you knew everything you do today, of course you'd make different choices, but I'd still overthrow Saddam Hussein, who was a threat to peace and stability in the region.' " This only supports the gist of what Paul said. Our ruling Paul said Bolton was a supporter of the Iraq War who said last year, "I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct." Bolton did indeed say that to a reporter for the Washington Examiner, and he also made a similar comment published in the Washington Post on the same day. We were not able to find any published comments in which Bolton offered a substantially different opinion. So we rate Paul’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/99a9169d-7feb-470e-abc0-55a7c0b1eef7	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2016-11-17T17:07:49	2016-11-15	['John_R._Bolton', 'Saddam_Hussein', 'Iraq_War']
pomt-03716	"In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year."	false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/16/americans-united-life/americans-united-life-says-1270-babies-survived-ab/	A bill requiring physicians to treat infants who survive abortion attempts is moving through the Legislature without the usual partisan fight, though some lawmakers have questioned whether it addresses an ongoing problem. An anti-abortion activist used a specific figure in a recent committee hearing to reassure lawmakers HB 1129/SB 1636 is necessary. "The tragedy of infants born alive following attempted abortions is real," said Charmaine Yoest, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, on April 9. "It is not the hypothetical that is sometimes reported. In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year." Yoest said without elaborating there are two cases in Florida. After the meeting, reporters asked Yoest about the number she used. Yoest told them the figure came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC, which collects data from most state health departments on the number of legal induced abortions performed each year, does not collect data on infants who die after surviving abortion attempts. Neither does the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that supports women’s access to abortions and collects abortion data. Neither Guttmacher nor the CDC has published its 2010 data for abortions. "We have no idea where this number comes from," said Rebecca Wind, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman. A committee analysis says there is no federal requirement to report the number of infants born alive during an attempted abortions. So Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, included in his legislation a requirement for physicians who perform abortions in Florida to report cases of infants born alive to the state. "If in two years time or four years time we find that there are zero cases, it’s a prayer answered," Pigman said at an April 4 committee hearing of his bill. "If we find in two years time that there’s a half dozen cases a year, then we have some issues." If there are no statistics or reporting requirements, where did Americans United for Life find this figure? We dug in. Twenty-eight states have laws protecting infants born alive. "Infants Born Alive" mirrors a federal law signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Supporters say it is necessary to enact a state law so there is no doubt that an infant "born alive" -- defined as an infant who breathes or has heartbeats or muscle movements, regardless of whether the extraction method was natural or induced -- must be taken to a hospital for treatment appropriate for gestation age. A failed abortion could result in a live birth in a late-term abortion, which can only be performed if two physicians agree the mother's life is at risk, or if the mother was further into her pregnancy than thought. Physicians under the Florida proposal would have to provide medical care for an infant born alive after an abortion or face a first-degree misdemeanor charge. Pigman, an emergency physician, has referenced similar or exact figures as Yoest in committee hearings, but he characterized them differently and stressed the lack of exact data. In the bill’s first hearing, Pigman mentioned CDC data on deaths for infants from 22 weeks of gestation to seven days after birth called "other perinatal conditions." This category -- which totaled 1,270 deaths in 2010 -- is further broken down into categories of international medical codes for causes of death, including cardiovascular disorders (838 deaths), digestive system disorders (92 deaths), undefined cerebral problems (183 deaths) and "other conditions originating in the perinatal period" (130 deaths). "I don’t know which portion of that 1,270 were due to abortions or some other rare circumstances," Pigman said in the April 4 committee. Inside that latter subcategory -- "other conditions originating in the perinatal period" -- is a designation called "termination of pregnancy, affecting fetus and newborn." The CDC doesn’t have numbers for that designation for 2010 yet. In 2008, the CDC reported 33 deaths using that designation. Whether the abortion was elective or performed to save the life of the mother is unclear. Americans United for Life spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick said any number is problematic because abortion data is always incomplete. California, for instance, is one of a few states that does not report the number of abortion procedures that happen there. Hamrick directed us to a blog post written by the group's legal team about limited CDC data and anecdotal evidence of infants born alive, including two Florida cases of infants surviving abortion procedures (one died, one survived with catastrophic injuries) and the trial of Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell. The post does not support Yoest's specific claim about 1,270 infants who die after abortion procedures, offering instead the more nuanced breakdown for the 1,270 figure that we heard from Pigman. Our ruling Yoest said 1,270 infants in 2010 "were reported to have died following attempted abortions." The figure is based on an "other" category of perinatal deaths, but it does not mean what she says it means. Included in this category are babies who die of various other issues, mainly heart problems. We rate her statement False.

pomt-14389	"Six justices" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been "confirmed in presidential election years since 1912."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/17/gwen-moore/urging-vote-merrick-garland-congresswoman-says-6-j/	As President Barack Obama was nominating Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore argued that despite pushback from Republicans, there is precedent for a Supreme Court nomination to be approved during a presidential election year. The Milwaukee Democrat urged in a tweet on March 16, 2016 that the U.S. Senate give Garland a 'fair hearing' and a timely vote on his nomination. Her claim was made in an image she attached, which said: '6 justices confirmed in presidential election years since 1912.' Virtually since the moment it was announced that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over when he should be replaced. Democrats such as Moore and Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin contend that Obama should make an appointment, regardless of the fact the presidential election will be held in November 2016. Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, both of Wisconsin, argue the Senate should not confirm any nominee until after Obama is replaced in January 2017. So let’s see if Moore is right -- that six times since 1912, a justice nominated to the high court during a presidential election year has been confirmed by the Senate. The nominee According to The HIll: Garland, 63, is a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; he currently serves as chief judge, a position he’s held since February 2013. He was nominated to that court by Democratic President Bill Clinton. He is sometimes described as a moderate, though some conservatives label him anti-gun. In nominating Garland, Obama highlighted his work as a top Justice Department official in directing the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the 1994 Oklahoma City bombings. The president noted that Garland received past praise from John Roberts, the current chief justice, and GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. A partisan battle over the nomination is expected. Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, reiterated immediately after Obama’s announcement that Scalia’s seat should not be filled until a new president is elected. The history As to Moore’s claim, we covered much of this ground in a March 2016 fact check when Ryan said: "There is a precedent" for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court "in the middle of a presidential election." We rated his statement False. We found that going back to 1912, five nominees who were nominated during a presidential election year were confirmed: President Nominee Nomination Outcome Franklin Roosevelt (D) Frank Murphy, to replace Pierce Butler January 1940 Confirmed Herbert Hoover (R) Benjamin Cardozo, to replace Oliver Wendell Holmes February 1932 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) Louis Brandeis, to replace Joseph Rucker Lamar January 1916 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) John Clarke, to replace Charles Evans Hughes July 1916 Confirmed William Taft Mahlon Pitney, to replace John Marshall Harlan February 1912 Confirmed As Moore’s tweet notes, current Justice Anthony Kennedy also was confirmed in a presidential election year -- in February 1988. President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, had nominated Kennedy in November 1987, a year ahead of the election, to replace Louis Powell, who retired. It’s worth noting that in June 1968, five months before the presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations, though there was not technically a vacancy, and neither were approved. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated. We’ll also note that in October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day.

pomt-10648	As secretary of the Department of Energy under former President Bill Clinton, "I created reserves of home heating oil."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/bill-richardson/he-did-as-he-was-asked/	With oil prices setting record highs and hovering around $100 a barrel, most candidates talked during a Jan. 5, 2008, debate about what they would do to bring prices down. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson talked about what he had already done. Richardson served as secretary of the Energy Department under former President Bill Clinton, from late 1998 until the end of 2000. "I went to OPEC countries and tried to get them to increase production so prices would go down," Richardson boasted. "At the time, there was a home heating oil crisis here in New England. I created reserves of home heating oil." Richardson did indeed visit several OPEC countries in the spring of 2000, including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, encouraging them to increase supply, which would help keep prices lower, according to the Energy Department Web site. Those visits followed a memorably expensive winter for New Englanders, who suffered spiking prices for home heating oil, giving rise to what many called the Northeastern home heating oil crisis. Winter prices for home heating oil in New Hampshire more than doubled from February 1999 to February 2000, when New Hampshire prices peaked at $1.89 a gallon. On July 10, 2000, President Clinton directed Richardson "to establish a 2-million barrel home heating oil component of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the Northeast." With Richardson in charge, the Energy Department established the 2-million-barrel reserve later that year. The following winter, prices fell back slightly, hovering in the mid $1.50s. The Bush administration continued the home heating oil reserves, according to the Energy Department Web site. In mid 2007, those reserves stood just shy of 2-million barrels. But that hasn't stopped prices from surging, as Richardson himself pointed out. "Look at prices now in New Hampshire, $3.20, something like that. It's the highest ever." In fact, Richardson underestimated New Hampshire prices. The weekly average topped $3.34 a gallon on Dec. 31, 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration. PolitiFact looked back at peak prices from the previous crisis. In February 2000 in New Hampshire, prices hit $1.89 per gallon. Using an inflation calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we calculated that it equaled $2.31 in 2007 dollars, more than a dollar shy of the current price. We also looked back over Energy Information Administration prices for New Hampshire going back to 1990, adjusting several price spikes for inflation. None came close to today's price. Richardson told the truth: He visited OPEC countries around the same time as the home heating oil crisis in New England, and he helped establish the home heating oil reserve. Did that reserve lower prices? That's unclear, since the reserve remains today, even though — as Richardson himself points out — heating oil prices in New Hampshire are "the highest ever." Still, Richardson earns a True.	None	Bill Richardson	None	None	None	2008-01-06T00:00:00	2008-01-05	['Bill_Clinton']

pomt-02202	Says he hasn’t changed his view on abortion restrictions.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/apr/24/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-portrays-his-view-abortion-consisten/	As Charlie Crist has been attacked for flip-flopping on an array of issues, he argued during an April 20 TV interview that one topic he has been consistent on is abortion. While Crist enthusiastically admitted he changed his view on gay marriage and now supports it, he argued with interviewer Michael Williams of WPTV about whether he changed his views on abortion. Williams: "In the heat of the campaign you were once quoted ‘listen I’m pro-life, I’m pro-gun,’ on and on and on. You changed your view on abortion as well." Crist: "That’s not true. No. I am pro-life -- by my definition." Williams: "But you changed your mind on abortion restrictions in the state of Florida. That’s a matter of record...." Crist: "I am pro-life. And what I mean by that is I am for life. I think most of us are for life. And I think that’s very important to state because even though I am pro-life, which I mean for life, (it) doesn’t mean that I want to tell a woman what to do with her body, and I never have. Even as a Republican governor I vetoed the ultrasound bill on women ... " Williams: "The ultrasound bill, yes, but on the larger issue in the prior incarnation politically of Charlie Crist, you supported abortion restrictions outside of the ultrasound bill. That's a matter of record. You have changed the nuance or your view there." Crist: "No, I haven’t. That’s not true." Crist then said he voted against a bill for a waiting period for women who wanted an abortion when he was a state senator in the 1990s. A couple of days later, at a meeting of the Capital Tiger Bay Club in Tallahassee, Crist repeated, "I also don’t want to tell any woman what to do with her body. I never have." Crist’s comments left viewers with the impression that he hasn't changed his views on abortion restrictions. But does his record back that up? Crist on abortion in the 1990s and 2006 race We’ve been tracking Crist’s views on abortion for some time now. Overall, he’s been all over the map on the issue, calling himself both "pro-choice" and "pro-life" in the past. In 1992, when he ran for the state Legislature, Crist said he was "pro-choice" but opposed state-funded abortion. Crist won that race. In 1995, Crist was a Republican state senator from St. Petersburg serving on a Senate health care committee. As he mentioned in the recent interview, Crist voted against a bill that would have required a 24-hour waiting period for women to obtain an abortion. The 3-3 vote meant that the bill failed. "I generally don't like the government telling people what to do," Crist said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. "I believe in individual rights and freedom. That's why I'm a Republican." But in 1996, the health care committee approved a waiting period bill on a 5-3 vote, after an amendment offered by Crist to restrict the bill to women younger than 18. News reports at the time said Crist favored abortion rights but wanted minors to be adequately counseled. The bill failed in the House. In March 1998, Crist took a position against abortion when he voted to override Gov. Lawton Chiles’ veto of a bill that banned what opponents call a "partial birth" abortion, a late-term procedure. The House and Senate successfully overrode the veto. When he was running for the U.S. Senate for the first time in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Times: "I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government." When debating his Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Bob Graham, Crist was asked if he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortion. "No, I would not," Crist said. "I think this is a very personal decision. And I think it is a decision that a woman should make and have the right to make after consulting with her family, her physician and her clergy but not her government." During Crist’s 2006 race for governor he again reiterated, "I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians." However, he also told a priest in Pensacola that he would sign a bill outlawing abortions except when the mother’s life was at stake. But then he told an AP reporter that he would only sign such a bill if it included exceptions for rape and incest. As Crist and then CFO Tom Gallagher competed in a Republican primary, Crist launched an attack ad calling Gallagher "pro-choice" and referring to himself as "pro-life." Later, in the general election debate against Democrat Jim Davis, Crist said: "I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,"' Crist said. "I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law. . . . I'm pro-life and I'm proud of it, but I don't think that I should impose my will on other people as a result of it." Crist on abortion 2010-14 In January 2010, Crist’s Republican U.S. Senate campaign released a statement saying he would "fight for pro-life legislative efforts." In April, as he lagged in a primary against Marco Rubio, Crist left the Republican Party to become a "no-party affiliation" candidate. Weeks later, he vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure "punitive" and that the measure was "almost mean-spirited." Crist lost the Senate race in 2010 and left the governor’s office in January 2011. In November, he announced he would challenge Republican Gov. Rick Scott as a Democrat. Crist spokesman Kevin Cate told PolitiFact that "Charlie Crist doesn't believe it's government's role to tell women what they can or can't do with their own bodies. That's always been his position and always will be." On his campaign website, Crist states: "Charlie supports a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions — as Governor, he vetoed a measure that required women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound, a law that Rick Scott signed. Charlie believes that government should stay out of personal health decisions between a woman and her doctor." Our ruling Crist said in a TV interview that he hasn’t changed his view on abortion restrictions. We find that misleading -- unless you're talking about having views that have always been difficult to pin down. Even before he switched parties, Crist voted both for and against abortion restrictions: In the 1990s, he opposed a waiting period for adults but also backed restrictions that included a waiting period for minors and a ban on partial birth abortion. In 2010, he vetoed a bill to require women to undergo ultrasounds before they have an abortion. He's also called himself both "pro-life" and "pro-choice," and he seems comfortable offering up his own personal definitions of the terms. If he's shown a kernel of consistency, it's that he often -- but not always -- talked about being personally "pro-life" but wanting to respect the right of women to make decisions with their doctors and without government interference. Interestingly, this is not a case of a politician changing his stance after switching parties. Crist has always been all over the map on abortion. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-13845	Says he "voted to remove Common Core from our schools."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/11/ritch-workman/workman-voted-remove-common-core/	State Rep. Ritch Workman is looking to win a Florida Senate seat this fall, so he’s hoping to educate voters on his record of opposing Common Core. In an online campaign ad posted June 20, 2016, Workman said that eight years ago he "promised to go to Tallahassee and cut taxes and shrink the size and scope of government." He said he followed through, passing tax cuts, changes to government pensions and ethics reform. "I also voted to remove Common Core from our schools," he said in the video. That statement riled up groups like Florida Parents Against Common Core, which accused Workman of "misrepresenting the facts." The group supports Workman’s opponent, Rep. Debbie Mayfield, who in 2013 sponsored a bill to repeal the standards. That bill never got out of committee. But Workman told us he is telling the truth. We wanted to find out whether Workman voted to get rid of Common Core standards in Florida. A common history lesson Common Core is a set of voluntary, state-based standards developed by the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association. Created with input from teachers, parents and education experts, Common Core’s goal was to make an education in one state comparable with the education in another. The final guidelines for math and English came out in 2010, and states could then decide whether to use them. Forty-five states, including Florida, voluntarily decided to accept the standards. Like most states, Florida was good with the plan at first, and the state Board of Education adopted Common Core in 2010. But critics of Common Core attacked it as a federal takeover of education, and support for the guidelines waned. Workman describes it on his Senate campaign website as "the federal government’s effort to nationalize our public schools." But this fairly common misperception isn’t accurate. Washington is not in charge of creating or implementing the benchmarks, the states are — and they are free to change or abandon the standards as they see fit. What the federal government has done is encourage state standards and offer some grant money to aid the process. Florida, for example, won a $700 million federal grant for that purpose. That support has aroused suspicion among detractors. Florida’s method of dealing with the backlash, meanwhile, has been complex. Gov. Rick Scott initially supported Common Core, but in 2013 he ordered Florida to pull out of a consortium of states that were working together to create a new test they all would share to track progress. Eventually, the state chose to develop its own replacement to the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT. Scott also called for public hearings that led state education officials in 2014 to recommend 98 changes to the benchmarks. Those proposed changes included things like 52 new calculus goals, guidelines for subjects beyond math and English, and a cursive writing requirement. The revisions were enough for the Florida Department of Education to consider the new guidelines separate from Common Core. Policy experts we talked to said they were more like extensions of the original standards. "The resulting standards as we see them are closely aligned to the Common Core and high-quality (College and Career Readiness) standards in general," said Alyssa Schwenk, a spokeswoman at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education. The state Board of Education approved the revisions unanimously in February 2014 and renamed them the Florida Standards. So what, if anything, did Workman have to do with kicking Common Core out of class? A different standard Workman told us the votes he mentioned came during the legislative session after Scott’s intervention and the education department’s changes, which Workman said he supported. In April 2014, lawmakers passed HB 7031, a broad education bill that removed more than 30 mentions of the term "Common Core" from the books as the Department of Education adopted the Florida Standards. That bill passed the House and Senate unanimously. Workman also voted for SB 1642, which froze sanctions based on school grading for a year, while the FCAT replacement (eventually known as the Florida Standards Assessment) was created. "Those two bills repealed Common Core from the DOE's education policy," Workman told us in an email. Keep in mind, the Florida Standards had already been adopted at this point. The Legislature didn’t decide to revise the guidelines, the Board of Education did. While Workman may have opposed Common Core, the provisions he’s touting as his votes to remove the benchmarks were largely procedural after the change had already been made. So does that mean Common Core is out of Florida schools entirely? The name is certainly gone — "Common Core is out," Scott said in a 2014 interview — and the state says as much. "My understanding is that Florida is no longer a participating state," Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters told PolitiFact Florida. But the Common Core State Standards Initiative still lists Florida as a Common Core state. Olympia Meola, a spokeswoman for the Council of Chief State School Officers, told us the map showing those states on the initiative’s website lists both "states that have adopted the standards without any changes and those that have built upon and updated the Common Core State Standards to further fit their state’s unique context and priorities." "It is common practice for states to revise their academic standards periodically, and, in doing so, to build upon previously adopted standards," Meola said. That’s what Florida did by adopting the Florida Standards. Blair Mann, spokeswoman for the pro-Common Core nonprofit Collaborative for Student Success, noted "the standards are still remarkably similar, and considered comparable to, the Common Core State Standards that other states are implementing." So while the term "Common Core" is gone, the bones of the standards remain. That means it’s not quite accurate to say Common Core is gone. A better term may be to say it has evolved. Many critics of the Florida Standards agree, saying the new standards didn’t go far enough, and were essentially based on Common Core guidelines with "cosmetic changes." That makes it difficult for Workman to make the claim he did, according to Abigail Swisher, an analyst at the New America Foundation’s Education Policy Program. "Given that Florida is still designated a Common Core State, it would appear contradictory for any one person to claim that they have ‘removed’ the Common Core in that state," she said. Our ruling Workman said he "voted to remove Common Core from our schools." Workman did vote to literally remove the term "Common Core" from state records as Florida switched over to the revised Florida Standards. Indeed, the broad education bill that made it law was voted for unanimously. But that was only after the Board of Education, and not the Legislature, agreed to revise the Common Core standards. Workman’s vote did not affect the decision to make that change. Furthermore, the new benchmarks were largely additions to the original standards, so it’s difficult to definitively say Common Core is out of schools. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01113	A recent economic uptick appears to "coincide" with "the expectation of a new Republican Congress."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/08/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-economic-uptick-coincides-exp/	In remarks from the Senate floor, newly elevated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested that his party’s takeover of Senate control "appears to coincide" with recent good economic news. "After so many years of sluggish growth, we’re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope," McConnell said. "The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration’s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress." McConnell stopped short of saying the Republican Senate takeover actually caused an economic improvement, though many media observers assumed that was what he was trying to imply. In the liberal New Republic, Brian Beutler joked, "It absolutely does coincide with the expectation of a new Republican Congress. Relatedly, things that coincide are called ‘coincidences.’ " But is McConnell even right that the economic data and the political expectations coincided? We focused on two questions. First, when did "the expectation of a new Republican Congress" actually solidify? And second, was there an uptick in economic data that actually coincided with that time frame? We’ll also briefly address the question of causation, even though McConnell didn’t explicitly claim that. The data we found suggest McConnell is engaging in some wishful thinking. When did "the expectation of a new Republican Congress" actually emerge? To answer this question, we checked with political analysts who handicapped the 2014 battle for the Senate and also looked at poll-based forecasting models. McConnell said "expectation," a stronger word than "possibility" and one that requires a reasonable degree of consensus. Going into the 2014 Senate elections, most observers expected the GOP to gain seats, due primarily to a favorable map for the GOP (far more Democrats were up for re-election, especially in conservative states) combined with the longstanding history of "six-year-itch" midterm elections bedeviling second-term presidents, in this case Democrat Barack Obama. But whether the GOP would actually manage to win enough seats to seize control of the chamber -- six -- was less certain. Going into the election, the Democrats held a 55-45 edge (counting two Democratic-caucusing Independents as Democrats). With many individual races rated as highly competitive right through Election Day, winning a net six seats was no slam dunk. Jennifer Duffy, who handicaps Senate races for the Cook Political Report, said different political experts settled on a Republican takeover at different times but added that she felt "pretty comfortable with a gain of six seats around Labor Day," which was on Sept. 1 last year. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, agreed that Labor Day was a turning point, though he added that "there were slivers of doubt right up until the end. We formally called the Senate for the Republicans the week before the election, but we also suggested that a GOP Senate was likely in the months prior to the election." The forecasters at fivethirtyeight.com suggested the toss-up lasted past Labor Day. They calculated the likelihood of a GOP takeover at just over 50 percent as late as mid September, before rising again, ultimately to 76 percent on the eve of the election. The New York Times’ in-house forecast saw much the same pattern, narrowing to essentially a coin flip in mid September before climbing to a 75 percent chance of a GOP takeover by Election Day. All told, this suggests that an "expectation" of a GOP takeover didn’t emerge until the beginning of September at the earliest, and possibly as late as the second half of September. This leads to our next question. Has there been an economic "uptick" that "appears to coincide" with this timeline? McConnell’s office pointed us to the announcement that the economy grew at an annualized 5 percent rate in the third quarter of 2014, the biggest expansion in more than a decade. So we’ll start there. The figure was indeed impressive. But there are two problems with citing this as evidence for McConnell’s point. First, the third quarter covers July, August and September. So the bulk of this growth occurred before the expectation of a GOP Senate began to jell. Second, GDP growth for the second quarter -- covering April, May and June of 2014 -- was almost as impressive, 4.6 percent. And that was well before the "expectation" of a GOP takeover seemed to take hold. (In fact, for much of that quarter, the New York Times model showed the Democrats likelier to win control than the Republicans.) Indeed, the longer-term trend for GDP growth shows that three of the past five quarters -- that is, since mid 2013 -- have exceeded 4 percent growth, and another quarter came close to that. Only one quarter, the first quarter of 2014, was a dud. So it’s not as if the impressive third-quarter growth of 2014 came totally out of the blue. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis We also looked at another major yardstick for the economy -- the monthly change in employment. During 2014, total monthly employment gains averaged 241,000. In October -- the month after the "expectation" of a GOP takeover would have taken hold -- the gain was almost exactly that, 243,000. The November total was 321,000 -- the highest of the year, but not far out of line when compared with the general trend for job creation since early 2011 (see chart below). It’s too soon to tell whether November’s figure kicks off a new, higher threshold or whether the number settles back again into the 240,000 range. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics The strongest evidence for McConnell’s point is consumer confidence. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment did experience an uptick between November and December, but even with this measurement, confidence had been rising consistently since July. And other evidence actually points in the opposite direction. Data for new orders of capital goods -- a good statistic for gauging how much confidence there is in future economic conditions -- actually fell every month between August and November. The question of causation Even if the statistical timeline fit perfectly, it’s worth remembering that correlation does not equal causation. "I don't think that either party has that much power to affect short-run economic movements, except by royally screwing up, and I haven't seen any evidence that the expectation of a regime change of this sort would affect economic outcomes," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. It’s even possible to draw up a theory that runs the opposite direction as McConnell’s linkage. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, said one reason GDP and employment have increased a bit faster in recent months "is that government investment, government consumption, and public employee payrolls have recently been rising instead of falling." Given this, McConnell’s comments linking the GOP and accelerated economic growth are ironic, Burtless said, since Republicans have been at the forefront of cutting government spending and payrolls. Our ruling McConnell said a recent economic uptick appears to "coincide" with "the expectation of a new Republican Congress." Even leaving aside the question of causation, key statistics show that the economic recovery was under way well before September, which is our best estimate for when the "expectation" of a GOP Senate solidified. We rate the statement False. Help fund PolitiFact's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.

pomt-05070	The United States has "the best health care delivery system in the world."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/05/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-us-health-care-system-best-world/	House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, says the health care law signed by President Barack Obama -- and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court -- imperiled the nation’s health care system. "Gov. Romney understands that Obamacare will bankrupt our country and ruin the best health care delivery system in the world," Boehner said, during the July 1, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. Boehner wasn’t the only one making that claim on the Sunday talk-show circuit. On Fox News Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., added that the U.S. has "the finest health care system in the world." A reader asked us to check whether there is any statistical evidence showing that the U.S. has "the best health care delivery system in the world." So we took a look. Boehner’s case When we asked Boehner’s office whether they had a particular study in mind, a spokesman acknowledged that there is no generally accepted measure for quality of care. However, they cited several narrower measures in which the U.S. scored well. For instance, the Commonwealth Fund rated the U.S. the best in four out of five preventive-care categories in 2004 when compared with four other advanced industrialized nations. Boehner’s office also cited data showing strong survival rates in the U.S. for patients with cancer when compared with other nations. Boehner’s office also noted that wealthy foreigners flock to the U.S. to receive care because of its cutting-edge facilities, and that the U.S. is among the leaders, if not No. 1, in medical research and pharmaceutical development. "As the speaker made clear, there are things we must do to improve the system we have, but there are many things that work well and Obamacare would only increase government involvement in patient care," spokesman Brendan Buck said. The U.S.: 37th in the world? But is there any data on the health-care system as a whole? There is, though it’s not perfect. We’ll start with a recap of our previous fact-check of the claim that the U.S. health care system ranks 37th in the world. The number refers to the World Health Organization's ranking of the United States as the 37th best health care system out of 191 countries. WHO, an arm of the United Nations, published the international comparison in its World Health Report 2000. We found that observers generally agreed on two things about the report. One, it was a landmark study that attracted a lot of attention around the world. And two, its conclusions have inspired intense controversy ever since it was released. Five factors went into WHO's calculation: • Health level, as defined by a measure of life expectancy, which shows how healthy a country's population is. This factor gets a 25 percent weight. • Responsiveness, which includes factors such as speed of health services, privacy protections, choice of doctors and quality of amenities. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight. • Financial fairness, which measures how progressive or regressive the financing of a country's health care system is — that is, whether or not the financial burdens are borne by those who are economically better off. This factor receives a 25 percent weight. • Health distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care resources are allocated among the population. This factor receives a 25 percent weight. • Responsiveness distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care responsiveness (which we defined above) is spread through society. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight. Once these statistics were collected, the WHO combined them into two summary rankings. One, called "overall attainment," is the basic weighted average of the five factors listed above. The other, called "overall performance," took that number and adjusted it for how well a country's health system was doing compared to how well WHO's experts believed it should be doing based on education level and economic resources. Using the second of the two ratings — overall performance — the United States ranks 37th. France ranked first, with the list of nations ranking ahead of the U.S. including a mix of industrialized countries in Western Europe, Scandinavia and Asia; wealthy oil producers from the Middle East; tiny realms of prosperity such as Monaco and Luxembourg; and some seemingly unlikely nations such as Colombia, Cyprus, Morocco, Dominica and Costa Rica. Using the first factor — overall attainment — the United States does better, finishing 15th. Most observers broadly agree that two of the WHO's five measures — health level and responsiveness — are reasonable. The first statistic gauges health outcomes, which are obviously a health care system's No. 1 goal, and the second seeks to measure how well a health system works when interacting with patients, another widely agreed upon mission. But there is far less consensus over the other three factors. Concerns stem from a mix of methodology and ideology. For instance, some critics, many of them conservative, reject the assumption that the rich should pay a similar percentage of their income for health care as the poor do. They argue that basic mathematics suggests that those with smaller incomes will naturally spend a larger share on highly important items such as food and health care, doing well in WHO's rankings almost requires a steeply progressive tax structure. Other studies Another study that included a smaller number of nations found the U.S. health system’s performance to be mediocre. The third edition of a periodic study by the Commonwealth Fund found that "compared with six other nations — Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom — the U.S. health care system ranks last or next-to-last on five dimensions of a high performance health system: quality, access, efficiency, equity, and healthy lives." Meanwhile, this chart by National Geographic compares health care expenditures with health outcomes and frequency of doctor visits in 20 other nations. It shows that the U.S. is a major exception, combining extraordinarily high costs, mid-level outcomes and a low frequency of doctor visits. The U.S. system does a good job at some things, such as keeping down wait times. A study of five English-speaking countries found that in the U.S., only 5 percent of patients reported a wait longer than four months for surgery, compared to 23 percent in Australia, 26 percent in New Zealand, 27 percent in Canada, and 38 percent in the United Kingdom. But it does poorly in other ways -- particularly in having so many people uninsured. A paper published by Urban Institute scholars in 2009 noted that the U.S. was one of only three countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the group of advanced industrialized nations -- with a sizeable share of its population lacking coverage. The others were Mexico and Turkey. (A wide range of other international comparisons are linked to here, though most of them tackle different questions, such as spending on health care, than Boehner addressed in his Face the Nation comment.) Glen Whitman, a professor of economics at California State University at Northridge, has offered strong criticism of the WHO’s methodology in a paper for the libertarian Cato Institute. Still, he suggests that Boehner went too far with his claim. "The assertion that the U.S. is ‘the best’ across the board has little support -- as does the assertion that the U.S. is ‘the worst,’" Whitman said. "It's a mixed bag. We're better in some ways, worse in others -- and in many categories of potential comparison, there's just not good evidence available, so we have to remain agnostic. People who assert confidently that the U.S. health care system is simply ‘the best’ are probably doing so out of national pride." Our ruling It’s true that specific aspects of the U.S. health care system are either the best or among the best in the world. But other aspects of the U.S. system fall short of what other advanced nations provide. Boehner’s claim that the United States has "the best health care delivery system in the world" is too glib to accurately characterize a much more nuanced reality. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2012-07-05T10:25:05	2012-07-01	['United_States']
pomt-15072	Says Pope Francis "took the name of a saint who basically reached out to Muslims."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/22/matthew-dowd/did-popes-namesake-st-francis-reach-out-muslims/	Pope Francis has shown an unusual readiness to take on divisive issues. He has spoken forcefully about the twin threats of global warming and runaway consumerism. The pope has decried the gulf between the haves and the have-nots. ABC News analyst Matthew Dowd said there’s no way to separate the pope’s visit to the United States from the ideological conflicts that dominate the American political scene. "He's coming in as basically not only a spiritual leader, but a political leader that everybody is going to have to, in the course of that, respond to," Dowd said on ABC’s This Week on Sept. 20, 2015. Then, Dowd made passing reference to tensions between the West and the Islamic world and brought up an historical point about Pope Francis. "He took the name of a saint who basically reached out to Muslims," he said. This piqued our curiosity. St. Francis of Assisi lived in the early 1200s during the Crusades, so he might have had contact with the Arab world. The order he founded - the Franciscans -- embraced poverty and service to the poor as the purest expression of Christ’s teachings. He saw animals as his brothers and sisters and is the patron saint of the environment. We decided to dig in on the Muslim angle. Dowd told us he learned this about St. Francis from a number of biographies and articles he’s read over the years. "St. Francis journeyed to see the sultan in the midst of the Crusades," Dowd said. That fits with the historical record, we found. But what St. Francis did during his time with the sultan and the aim of his visit is far less certain. That said, the meaning of "reaching out to Muslims" is broad enough to cover Dowd’s statement. As interesting as anything else, we learned that in invoking this episode, Dowd joins a long line of people who have applied various interpretations to this moment in the life of St. Francis. The Fifth Crusade From 1217 until about 1229, various Catholic leaders launched forays into the Middle East. In 1219, Cardinal Pelagius led a crusade against al-Kamil the Sultan of Egypt. The cardinal’s forces seized the city of Damietta and were able to hold it for a time, but not do much more. St. Francis made it to Damietta in July or August 1219. John Tolan is a professor of medieval history at the University of Nantes in France, and the author of St. Francis and the Sultan. Tolan’s book provides this description of what St. Francis did next, taken from a letter written in early 1220 by Jacques de Vitry, the bishop of Acre who was in the Damietta encampment at the time. "He was so inflamed with zeal for the faith that he did not fear to cross the lines to the army of our enemy. For several days he preached the Word of God to the Saracens and made little progress. The Sultan, king of Egypt, privately asked him to pray to the Lord for him, so that he might be inspired by God to adhere to that religion which most pleased God." We found no dispute that St. Francis indeed spent a few days with the sultan. Another historian, Lawrence Cunningham, professor emeritus of theology at the University of Notre Dame and the author of Francis of Assisi: Performing the Gospel of Life, said in a 2006 interview that there’s other evidence of the meeting. "My book mentions an Arabic inscription in stone in a Cairo museum that recounts the caliph spoke to Western holy men," Cunningham said. "You also can see in Assisi a gift from the caliph to Francis: a piece of ivory horn on a gold stand." If meeting with the sultan falls within the meaning of reaching out, then St. Francis reached out to the Muslims. Beyond that, the story gets murky. A range of interpretations Tolan told us no one knows much more than that St. Francis spent time with the sultan and returned safe and sound. "What the two men said to each other has been a matter of speculation ever since the meeting itself in 1219," Tolan said. "St. Francis has indeed come to represent, for 21st-century Catholics -- especially but not only Franciscans -- a voice for peace and in particular for dialogue with Islam. This was not always so. For his 13th-century Franciscan hagiographers, he went to Egypt principally because he was hoping to obtain the crown of martyrdom. It is all of course a matter of interpretation, all the more so as Francis himself never wrote anything about Islam." There are apocryphal stories that the sultan had St. Francis walk over a bed of crosses, or even challenged him to walk over a bed of coals. These are later embellishments to the tale. In his book and a shorter article, Tolan wrote that over the centuries, St. Francis has been cast as "a scholastic theologian proving the truth of Christianity, a champion of the crusading ideal, a naive and quixotic wanderer, a crazed religious fanatic, or a medieval Gandhi preaching peace, love and understanding." Paul Moses, a professor of English at Brooklyn College, wrote the book The Saint and the Sultan: The Crusades, Islam and Francis of Assisi's Mission of Peace. Moses agrees with other researchers that St. Francis’s main goal was to convert the sultan to Christianity. That was certainly the presumption at the time, based on the letter from the bishop of Acre. Cunningham at Notre Dame also assumes that was the goal. But Moses sees evidence that St. Francis represented more. "Upon his return home, Francis advocated a revolutionary new way for his friars to interact with Muslims, Moses said. "Rather than preach at them, he said, they could just live peacefully among them and even ‘be subject’ to them. So here he is reaching out not just to the sultan but to Muslims in general." Moses pointed us to the Early Rule, St. Francis’s first recorded guide for members of his order. In it, St. Francis says friars who go to the land of "the Saracens and other nonbelievers" can choose to act in two ways: "One way is not to engage in arguments or disputes but to be subject to every human being for God's sake and to acknowledge that they are Christians. The other way is to announce the Word of God, when they see it pleases the Lord, in order that (unbelievers) may believe in almighty God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Creator of all, the Son, the Redeemer and Savior, and be baptized and become Christians because no one can enter the kingdom of God without being reborn of water and the Holy Spirit." For Moses, the first option in particular speaks to a sort of religious tolerance. In contrast, Tolan describes the relevant section as "basically a string of gospel citations" that is "quite ambiguous." Our ruling Dowd said that Pope Francis’ namesake, St. Francis, reached out to Muslims. The historical record tells us that indeed, St. Francis, likely at great personal risk, left the safety of the crusaders’ camp and spent a few days with the Sultan of Egypt. No one actually knows what the two men said to each other. From all that we read and heard from historians, the presumption is that St. Francis tried to convert the sultan. Over the centuries, depending on the point a person wanted to prove, the story has been presented in different ways. In some versions, St. Francis challenges the Muslims. In others, he is attempting to bridge a religious gulf. The word "outreach" can have different meanings. The record doesn’t clarify the nature of the outreach, but, taken broadly, it does confirm that some kind of meeting took place. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-08763	"Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds"	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/26/anthony-gemma/gemma-says-bill-lynch-told-three-lies-10-seconds/	When congressional candidate Anthony Gemma sent out a news release with the headline "Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds," he practically challenged PolitiFact to check the accusation. Not only did he call one of his Democratic primary opponents a liar, but in specifying a time frame, he forced us to pull out our stopwatch. The action started during the 1st Congressional District debate Aug. 18 on WPRO (630-AM) radio when the two candidates took several good shots at each other. A day later, Gemma ratcheted up the rhetoric by sending out a news release that accused Lynch of multiple lies -- and fast ones at that. It was part of what Gemma calls his "Enough is Enough Initiative," his vehicle for attacking opponents. A video tape of the debate shows this is what Lynch said: "What I am going to tell Anthony, and it’s understandable that he wouldn’t know — not having been involved, not even registered to vote as recently as a few years ago, and someone who didn’t bother to vote in the last crucial presidential election, has only been a Democrat for a couple of months, and really his only involvement in the governmental process in Rhode Island has been to support Governor Carcieri." First of all, Lynch's somewhat rambling statement is more like 23 seconds. If you cut out the introductory clauses, it gets down to about 15 seconds. Either way, it’s not 10. And Lynch makes five claims, not three. Let's take a look at them, point by point. Keep in mind that we're fact-checking Gemma's statement. But to do so, we need to check what Lynch said. 1) Gemma has not been "involved" in politics. We can't evaluate this one, because it's a subjective comment, not a fact. 2) Gemma was "not even registered to vote as recently as a few years ago." Gemma told us he first registered in Providence many years ago, moving his registration to Cumberland when he relocated there in the 1990s, before moving again, to Lincoln, in 2004. The Cumberland Board of Canvassers has a record showing Gemma registered to vote there in 1998. In Lincoln, town records show Gemma has been registered to vote since 2004 and voted in the November 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections. It was difficult to verify Gemma's entire registration history, in part because of record-keeping problems at the boards of canvassers and the move from paper to computer records. But we verified that Gemma has been registered for at least six years, so Lynch's second claim is false. 3) Gemma "didn’t bother to vote in the last crucial presidential election." The Lynch team now says it was referring to Gemma's failure to vote in the March 2008 presidential primary. But the Lincoln Board of Canvassers and the secretary of state's office both confirm that Gemma voted in the November 2008 general election. So Lynch is wrong on that one too. (For the record, we asked Gemma whom he voted for, and he said Barack Obama.) 4) Gemma "has only been a Democrat for a couple of months." Records from Lincoln and the secretary of state show that Gemma registered as a Democrat in May 2010 -- the month before he announced his candidacy for Congress. Prior to that, he was registered as unaffiliated since 2004. When we asked Gemma why he accused Lynch of lying about this fact, he insisted he has "always been a Democrat" even if his voter registration doesn't indicate so. He can call himself whatever he wants, but his official designation tells a different story. Therefore, Lynch's claim is true. 5) "Really [Gemma’s] only involvement in the governmental process in Rhode Island has been to support Governor Carcieri." Gemma’s campaign finance reports show that in recent years he gave about $3,000 to a small group of candidates. Carcieri received the largest sum: $1,000, almost a third of the total. But Gemma also donated to U.S. Rep. James Langevin, Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts and former Providence Mayor Joseph Paolino, a developer. So Lynch's claim is false. Now let’s get back to Gemma's original accusation: "Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds." As we know there were five statements -- of which we checked four -- and it was at least 15 seconds, not 10. So we’re not sure how Gemma did his timing. His explanation: if you take any three of these claims they’ll add up to 10 seconds. That's very creative timekeeping. But we understand we're nitpicking. So let’s look at the more substantive part of the claim. Three of the four factual accusations Lynch made were wrong. Whether they were lies or misstatements is for someone other than PolitiFact to decide. Remember though, we’re ruling on what Gemma said, not Lynch's accuracy. While Lynch’s claims might have warranted a check, Gemma trumped them by putting out a news release that was intended to be provocative. Instead of just pointing out Lynch’s inaccuracies, he called him a liar and he cited a precise time frame. Neither point was completely right and Gemma deserves to be called out on that. But the meat of what Gemma said about his opponent's accusations was correct. So we’ll give him a Mostly True.	None	Anthony Gemma	None	None	None	2010-08-26T00:01:00	2010-08-19	['None']

pomt-05045	Cuts in local government and school funding in John Kasich’s budget caused "many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/11/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-kasich-budget-forced-lo/	After a recent appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" in which Gov. John Kasich said he had balanced Ohio's budget and cut taxes, the Ohio Democratic Party issued a statement that his budget had negative consequences for local communities. "Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone," the statement said, "causing many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs" to offset budget cuts. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim. The governor's office answered with its own statement. It said the number of local government workers in Ohio has increased under Kasich after decreasing under his Democratic predecessor, Ted Strickland, and that the number of local tax issues has declined. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. Kasich and other Republicans often talk about shrinking the size of government. We found he was accurate, three months ago, when he said the number of state workers in Ohio had gone down. So it was something like a "man bites dog" story for him to boast that local government employment increased on his watch after declining under a Democratic administration. Kasich's spokesman referred us to the employment database of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. It showed that the number of local government workers in Ohio in July 2011, when the Kasich budget went into effect, was 520,600. It was 526,200 in preliminary numbers for May, the most recent number available -- an increase of 5,600 workers. The number stood at 554,700 in July 2007, when the first Strickland budget went into effect, and 523,400 in June 2011 -- a decrease of 31,300. The decrease continued until last January, when it reached 520,000, the lowest level since 1999. The peak of local government employment in Ohio was 560,600, reached in July 2004, according to the BLS. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols also pointed to the local election tallies on the Ohio secretary of state website. The figures show "tax issues were at the lowest levels since 2003," he said, countering the claim that Kasich's budget led to local tax increases. We looked, though we find it difficult to draw any conclusions about local finances from a simple count of the number of tax issues on local ballots. For consistency of comparison, we looked at November general-election tallies. (There has been one November general election and one spring primary since Kasich's budget went into effect.) What we found was a general consistency in the number of tax issues: a total of 1,009 last November; 1,059 in November 2010; 1,100 in November 2009; 1,053 in November 2008, and 995 in 2007 -- the lowest level in the years for which a local issues summary was available. Kasich's two-year budget, signed a year ago, cut state funding for local governments by about $630 million over the two years, and cut funding for schools by about $700 million. The governor challenged local governments to be more efficient and creative to deal with the cuts without raising taxes. Ohio Democratic Party Spokesman Jerid Kurtz cited 10 municipalities and school districts looking at layoffs and tax hikes that officials blamed on the funding cuts. One was the city of Lima. Its finance director said it had a balanced budget as recently as 2008, but faced a $2 million deficit in its general fund, largely because of state budget cuts, despite "reducing the general fund consistently for the past 10 years," the Lima News reported. Another was Sycamore Township, near Cincinnati. It laid off most of its firefighters in May 2012 because, township officials said, state budget cuts would eliminate half of the community's general fund revenue. A third was the Berea school district, which passed a 3.9-mill operating levy in March 2012 after reducing its budget by $5.1 million for reasons that included the loss of state dollars. According to the Ohio School Boards Association, school levies passed in March 2012 at an "exceptionally high" rate of 74 percent, the highest level since November 2000. The usual passage rate for school levies in Ohio is about 54 percent, the group said. The growth in local government employment "is more likely due to the Ohio recovery that began a full year before Kasich took office," Kurtz said. "There is absolutely no proof Kasich's budget is the cause." Seeking further perspective, we called the Ohio Municipal League, which lobbies for cities and villages. Communications director Kent Scarrett said he "certainly" agreed "there is more of an uptick in school levies" because of state funding cuts, and said the full impact has not yet been felt. The biggest cuts in direct payments to municipalities through the Local Government Fund will come in year two of Kasich's budget in 2013. The elimination of the estate tax in 2013, which is also part of the budget, will further reduce revenue to local governments. "They're going to be up against it next year," Scarrett said. "In 2013 the cuts are going to be much more profound. It's kind of scary." That's looking into the future, which we won't do. Let's get back to the statement we're checking: "Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone," causing many communities to seek tax increases and lay off workers. The claim is partially accurate. Kasich's budget did cut funding for local governments significantly. Some school districts and municipalities have sought, considered or passed tax issues to deal with budget shortfalls to which the funding cuts have contributed. And the Ohio Democrats can provide anecdotal evidence that some budget shortfalls have threatened or led to layoffs. But the claim also overlooks important details that give the it context. The number of local government jobs in Ohio has actually increased since Kasich's budget was enacted, after dipping to a 12-year low. And the number of local tax issues to appear on ballots across Ohio has been steady for several years. Further, one of the outside experts we talked to says it is too soon to tell the full impact of cuts in funding because the biggest cuts through the Local Government Fund haven’t kicked in yet, nor has the elimination of the estate tax. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-07-11T06:00:00	2012-06-03	['None']

pomt-13990	Polls show Bernie Sanders would do better than Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head battle against Donald Trump.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2016/jun/08/georgians-bernie-sanders-president/pro-sanders-group-target-about-their-candidates-po/	Georgia supporters of Bernie Sanders are vastly outnumbered. The Peach State is solidly red -- all statewide offices are held by Republicans. And Sanders was trounced by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton (71 percent to 28 percent) in their March 1 primary here. But Sanders’ supporters insist there is a larger point to be made as Clinton and Sanders get ready for the June 7 California primary. Despite the fact that Clinton is well positioned to get enough delegates to take the Democratic nod, Sanders is the better choice when it comes to a head-to-head matchup with presumed GOP nominee Donald Trump, according to Sanders’ Southern backers. And they took to Facebook recently to insist that a cross section of polls backs them up. Could the group Georgians for Bernie Sanders for President be correct? Do the polls suggest Sanders would run stronger against Trump than Clinton? PolitiFact looked at a similar statement by Sanders himself earlier this year. That fact check looked at polls from January and February. We rated it Mostly True. We reached out to the Sanders and Clinton camps for their reads on the more recent polls. Clinton’s campaign did not respond. Clinton has previously said she will win the nomination and is focusing on Trump. Warren Gunnels of the Sanders campaign provided a series of polls from Real Clear Politics that shows Sanders leading Trump by more than 10 points. Another group of polls shows Trump and Clinton neck-and-neck. Most of the polls were conducted in mid-May. In the Clinton-Trump matchup, a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Trump up by 2 points. Trump leads Clinton by 6 points in a CBS News/New York Times poll, but Clinton is up by 3 points in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. In the Trump-Sanders contest, a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Sanders up by 15 points, while a CBS News/New York Times poll shows Sanders ahead by 13 points. A Fox News poll shows Sanders ahead by 3 points. A May 9-12 poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found Trump would best Clinton 45 percent to 41 percent in Georgia. But Sanders was favored over Trump by Georgia voters, 47 percent to 42 percent. The sweep of the poll numbers could have an impact on the remainder of the Democratic race, said state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, a Sanders delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Fort admitted that Sanders has an "uphill battle" against Clinton. "It makes the argument to the superdelegates stronger," Fort said. "And these polls are not outliers. It’s a convincing argument. "Bernie Sanders has changed the Democratic Party forever." University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato added a word of caution about reading too much into the snapshots of voters’ opinions at this stage of the contest. "Almost all polls I've seen since Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee show a close race between Trump and Clinton but a wider margin of victory for Sanders," Sabato said. "What the polls cannot show is whether this matters." He said Sanders has received relatively little vetting by the press. Sabato added that Republicans would like nothing better than to run against "a self-proclaimed socialist." "I might have missed an ad or two, but I haven't seen a single negative TV ad run against Sanders," he said. "For Clinton and Trump, being the target of negative ads is a daily hazard." Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, said Sanders shows up so strongly in head-to-head polls because Trump and Clinton have such high negatives. "General election polls don’t mean much until the conventions are over and you get to late summer or early fall," Swint said. "A lot of voters don’t look at Sanders as a legitimate threat. It’s almost like he’s an imaginary candidate." Our ruling. A pro-Sanders Facebook group in Georgia said polls indicate Bernie Sanders would do better than Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head battle with Donald Trump. Major polls support that contention. But it’s difficult to say what the polls mean at this stage of the election cycle, when Sanders -- a relative unknown on the national stage -- is theoretically pitted against two well-known personalities, each with substantial baggage. That’s important context when looking at the numbers.

pomt-13806	"We defied the stand-down orders" during the Benghazi attack.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/18/mark-geist/stand-down-story-ignores-critical-facts-about-effo/	When the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, came under attack on Sept. 11, 2012, the only United States force able to respond quickly was a CIA security team made of up of private contractors stationed in a nearby annex. While promoting their bestselling book on the attack, at least three members of the six-person team have asserted that they defied "stand-down" orders to rush to stop the attack, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens. During the first night of the Republican convention in Cleveland, one of them, Mark "Oz" Geist said that because of their actions, "there were more than 30 American lives that were saved that night. And it’s because Americans never give up. We refuse to lose. Benghazi has been a four-letter word for the left but is not about politics. Benghazi was about opportunities. Opportunities taken when we defied the stand-down orders." We talked about the stand-down issue when we gave Fox News' Sean Hannity a Mostly False for his assertion that "during the (Benghazi) attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times." Our ruling was based on the Republican-written report on the crisis, released June 28 by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. We'll use that report as the basis for this fact-check as well. Technically, when a military force is told to "stand-down," it means the force is no longer on alert or operational. It's clear from the report, though, that the security team never stood down. Whether the team was ever told to stand down is a matter of debate. It was told to wait, for reasons the report makes clear. The attack on the Benghazi compound began at 9:42 p.m. At the time, according to the report, the United States was working with several militia groups that were active and cooperative after the regime of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled a year earlier. One militia group was the Feb. 17 Martyrs Brigade, which had pledged to help with compound security. When the attack began, a frantic call for help was made to the CIA annex about a mile away. The annex security team, known as the GRS, started getting their gear together as annex officials made fruitless calls trying to contact the local groups — including the Feb. 17 militia. Their goal: find out who was involved in the fight and whether they could get additional equipment for the security team. The GOP report goes into this issue in some detail. The unnamed man in charge of the CIA annex, the chief of base, told the committee that the leader of the security team asked for a gun truck from the Feb. 17 militia. The chief made the call and was told one wasn't available but they would try to work on it. The report says the base chief "was adamant that he never told the Annex team members to 'stand down,'" quoting him as saying he was working with the team leader "the whole time in an effort to get them, go get them gone, to have them go." "I never had any doubt about the GRS people going to the State Department compound." he base chief told the committee. "I had great concerns and great worry about it, but I did not, I did not tell anybody to stand down." But he did tell them to wait so he could try to get the gun truck for them, "but it wasn't 10 minutes, or five minutes," he also said, "There was nobody, myself or anybody else in Benghazi, that did anything to hold up the GRS deploying. The team lead was always cleared to go. ... I think I carried an ammo can at one time to get those guys out the door." The deputy chief of base, according to the report, told the committee that the team leader told him and the base chief, "We got to go get those guys. And the Chief of Base responded, 'Absolutely.' 'Absolutely.' Not, 'I got to go call the chief of station.' Not, 'I got to go check with somebody in Washington. All he said was, 'Absolutely.' "So I want to make that very clear because I know there’s conflicting accounts about that discussion," he said. "There were three people in that discussion: myself, the GRS team leader, and the chief of base. And anybody writing any books or making movies, or whatever else, I can tell you none of those guys (who claim there was stand-down order) were in the room when that discussion occurred." The decision to allow the six to go was made even though it would have left the CIA annex essentially defenseless, according to the officials. They were also trying to contact the militia so the squad wouldn't get into a firefight with friendly militia forces. "I feel like the narrative that I have seen in public does not account for this and does not account for the consideration that there was a green-on-blue situation that could have wiped all of those guys out. And then where would we have been?" the deputy CIA chief of base said. "We wouldn’t have had the ability to do anything to help the State Department people, and we wouldn’t have had the ability to evacuate ourselves or defend ourselves if we came under attack." Video from the annex showed that 23 minutes elapsed between the time of the frantic call from the mission to the time the annex team was rolling. The report says another member of the security also could not recall the chief ever saying the stand down, "but he did recall the chief of base telling them to wait." "I respected the fact that he wanted us to wait and see if he can gather additional fire power to help," he told the committee. "At some point, though, the wait was too long, and we decided, you know, we couldn’t wait any longer and we left." Other team members also recalled being required to wait while the base chief, his deputy and the team leader worked the phones to get information or assistance. But one did put it this way. "And I just say: Hey, you know, we've got to get over there. We're losing the initiative. The chief of base looks at me, he says: Stand down, you need to wait. You need to come up with a plan." According to the report, that security team member was asked why he had not disclosed the "stand-down" order during previous testimony to Congress. He didn't give a direct answer. "I just know when we got told to stand down and when (the team lead) kind of gave the brief of kind of like why we're told to stand down, it was kind of understandable, you know." Kris Paronto, a former Army ranger hired for the team, told Hannity in a June 28 interview, "Twice the word 'wait' was used. Once the words 'stand down' was used. But to me that's semantics." We don't think so. Being told to stand down means you're not going. According to all the evidence in the GOP report it's clear that — short of some sudden intervention by Benghazi militia friendly to the United States coming in to save the day — they were. Our ruling Geist said, "We defied the stand-down orders" during the Benghazi attack. All the evidence suggests that if the phrase "stand down" was used by officials — and there's debate about that — it was said only once in an effort to buy time to get intelligence information and equipment to a security team that was justifiably chomping at the bit to respond. Testimony in the House Select Committee on Benghazi report shows there was no stand-down order to defy because there was never an order to not intervene in the unfolding disaster. The "stand-down" story contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/34e74e97-56fe-47b1-9036-1078e78cbb74	None	Mark Geist	None	None	None	2016-07-18T23:25:22	2016-07-18	['None']
pomt-10242	Drilling in ANWR would have minimal impact, covering only "2,000 out of 20-million acres."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/01/sarah-palin/yes-2000-acres-but-spread-all-over/	Energy exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, has been a top Republican policy priority for years. And even before she joined the GOP's presidential ticket, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was making the case for oil and gas drilling in the desolate region, asserting it would lessen the United States' dependence on foreign oil. In an interview on CNBC's "Closing Bell With Maria Bartiromo" that aired on Aug. 29 (though it took place days earlier), Palin asserted energy production would cover a minuscule portion of the coastal plain on her home state's North Slope, no larger than the space of a big-city airport. "Well, ANWR at that point it's about 2,000 acres that is being asked to be looked at and to be explored and to be produced. Two-thousand acres out of 20-million acres," Palin said. "That footprint, it's about the size of LAX or one of the larger airports across the nation. And that should allow some perspective there also." ANWR comprises about 19-million acres, 1.5-million of which were set aside by Congress and President Jimmy Carter in 1980 to study the potential for energy production. But in describing the possible environmental impact, Palin is harking back to a House Republican proposal floated during energy debates in 2001 and 2003, that Democrats, environmentalists and some moderate Republicans rejected as unrealistic. Facing determined opposition to drilling for oil in the ecologically sensitive area, Republicans tried to make the idea more palatable by limiting the surface area of oil company operations in the refuge and offering to share federal lease revenue with a heating oil assistance program for low-income people. Specifically, the Republicans would have put a 2,000-acre limit on surface that could be covered by "production and support facilities, including airstrips and any acres covered by gravel berms or piers for support of pipeline." Palin and other pro-drilling lawmakers now say new technologies, including directional drilling, would probably make viable energy development possible on a footprint even smaller than 2,000 acres. But the reality of tapping the oil reserves in ANWR isn't that simple and debates over economic benefits and environmental costs rely on plenty of conjecture. An authoritative estimate of what ANWR might hold for oil production comes from a three-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey that was released in 1998, which estimates that between 5.7-billion and 16-billion barrels of recoverable oil might be found in ANWR. But the report concludes that the oil is not concentrated in a single area but is instead spread throughout the refuge, meaning the 2,000-acre cap could only be viable if those acres weren't contiguous. And, between those acres would have to be a network of roads and pipelines connecting them. In fact, the GOP proposal that would have set the 2,000-acre cap acknowledges this fact without stating it outright. For example, the legislation specified that the acres would be used on production equipment, airstrips and berms and structural supports for pipeplines. But it wouldn't include roads, and the legislation also says the acreage toward that limit only would count equipment that touches the ground so that miles of pipeline wouldn't count, only the stanchions holding it up. Environmentalists contend pipelines and roads and related infrastructure would cover a much larger area than a mere 2,000 acres, which could fragment fragile wildlife habitat. The Geologic Survey concludes that nearly 80 percent of the estimated oil reserve is thought to be located in the western part of the reserve, closest to existing roads and infrastructure. But individual drilling sites would still need to be connected with additional pipes and roads. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a drilling foe, notes that the potential for industrial sprawl is great, contending that existing production elsewhere on the North Slope, while technically takes up 12,000 acres, actually spreads across an area of 640,000 acres, or 1,000 square miles, when one includes airports, roads and gravel mines. Such arguments have carried the day in recent congressional debates over expanded drilling in the refuge. In 2001, the House endorsed the limited ANWR drilling plan, but it died during negotiations with the Senate on a broader energy bill. In 2003, a nearly identical proposal won approval in the House but was dropped during negotiations on a final energy package. Each time, Democrats and some moderate Republicans expressed deep reservations about lasting environmental damage to the ecosystem, including herds of native caribou. Republicans managed to advance a broader drilling plan out of the House in 2005, but it fell victim to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Palin is technically correct that viable drilling operations could be confined to a small portion of the refuge. But to take full advantage of the oil resources in ANWR would almost certainly require an extensive network of roads, pipelines and related infrastructure that couldn't possibly be contained on such a footprint. Because of the economic realities associated with large-scale energy development, we find her claim Half True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-09-01T00:00:00	2008-08-29	['None']
pomt-08357	Rick Scott "has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/26/alex-sink/sink-claims-scott-said-he-wants-do-away-state-dca/	The Florida Department of Community Affairs, the state's growth management agency hated by developers, is one of the smallest state agencies. But the DCA became a big point of contention in the Oct. 25, 2010, gubernatorial debate between Democrat Alex Sink and Republican Rick Scott. During the debate at the University of South Florida televised on CNN, Sink said, according to the transcript: "Well my opponent has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs. It’s the one state agency that holds local governments accountable for the dealings they have with developers. That’s why we have Amendment 4 on the ballot because people were so frustrated about these out-of-control developments. I oppose Amendment 4 because I think it would be a job killer. But we cannot do away with our Department of Community Affairs, which is the only organization that handles growth management in Florida. He would just hand Florida over to development, to just go wild and that’s not what Floridians want." (Amendment 4, which is also on the ballot Nov. 2, would give voters the right to vote on adopting or amending local land-use plans.) Scott responded: "Let’s go back to the last question on DCA. I have not said that I would eliminate DCA. What I would do is go back to the original purpose of DCA. My opponent is an Obama liberal. She thinks people in Tallahassee can tell local communities exactly what they ought to do. Let’s look at what’s happened across our state. You can go all across the state and developments have been killed by all the regulation, all the paperwork. In fact you have to go to three or four agencies. I’ll give you an example. Down close where I live (in Naples), Ave Maria University was recently built. Just in permits, just — not any building — just for the land, 78 permits, took years to do. DCA has killed jobs all across this state. We need to go back to the original purpose." In this Truth-O-Meter we will explore, has Scott said "he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs?" First, some background on DCA that we found in an Oct. 8, 2010, St. Petersburg Times article about Scott's criticism of the state agency, and from our Oct. 26 interview with DCA secretary Tom Pelham. Created in 1969, the agency reviews growth management decisions by cities and counties and distributes federal grants for neighborhood revitalization and other programs. DCA has a budget of about $315 million -- about $27 million is state money and the rest is federal -- and about 220 employees. About 57 employees work in the growth management section. "The next governor will be forced to slash costs to cover an estimated $2.5 billion shortfall, but wiping out the DCA won't help much,'' stated the Oct. 8 article. "That's because about 10 cents of every dollar it spends comes from state taxes." The article paraphrased Pelham saying that the agency is necessary to mediate growth disputes between adjoining local governments and to review large development projects for their impacts on roads and other services. Proposals to eliminate DCA have surfaced frequently, but the agency has survived. But does Scott want to wipe it out entirely? We looked for comments Scott had made about the DCA in the campaign. • In a Sept. 18 Pensacola News Journal article about Scott campaigning alongside Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Scott was quoted as saying: "Amendment 4 would kill jobs, and like the DCA (Department of Community Affairs), it would slow down everything." • In the Oct. 8 St. Petersburg Times article, Scott didn't say if he would get rid of DCA or how he would change it -- he was only quoted as criticizing it: "On the campaign trail, I'll tell you the one that everybody's fed up with. It's DCA. It's really impacted people that want to build things. Their attitude is, 'How can somebody in Tallahassee tell my local community what we want, and DCA sits there and tells us we can't do it?' … I'll tell you, it's really killing jobs." • A columnist wrote in the Florida Times-Union Oct. 12: Scott "wants to do away with the Department of Community Affairs, the state agency that at least provides some review of land use changes." But columnist Ron Littlepage didn't attribute or explain his claim. He told us in an e-mail that he based his column on the Oct. 8 St. Petersburg Times article. • Charles Pattison, president of the environmental group 1000 Friends of Florida, wrote in a column Oct. 13 in the Gainesville Sun that "According to recent news reports, gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott would support eliminating the state's land planning agency, the Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA). He claims, 'It's really impacted people that want to build things.... It's really killing jobs.' " Again, no details showing Scott said he would eliminate it. We also looked at Scott's campaign website. Under a headline "Reduce Government Spending" Scott wrote: "A 5% reduction in the state workforce will save almost $300 million" -- but again, no specifics about the DCA. We asked Pelham directly if he had heard Scott say that he wants to eliminate DCA. "What we've heard is what was indicated in the ... St. Pete Times article in which he says DCA is really killing jobs, and everybody is fed up with DCA, etc.,'' said Pelham, who served as DCA secretary between 1987 and 1991 and was appointed again in 2007. "I don't recall reading anything where he used the words we should eliminate DCA." We also asked Pelham whether the "original purpose" of DCA had changed, since Scott said he wanted to return to that original purpose. The agency changed dramatically over the years -- at one point it also encompassed Veteran Affairs and programs dealing with juvenile justice, Pelham said. Florida didn't have the growth management act until 1985, which led to DCA overseeing the growth management office. Pelham was brought in to do that when he served as secretary from 1987 to 1991. Prior to that act, there was a division of state planning that oversaw a much weaker act that didn't give the state authority to reject comprehensive plan amendments but only give recommendations, Pelham said. If Scott wins the election, he can't simply shut down DCA. Eliminating the agency would require a vote by the Legislature and eliminating its functions or assigning them to other agencies, said Pelham. Pelham disputes Scott's claim that DCA is "killing jobs". DCA reviews proposed amendments to comprehensive plans. Since 2007, DCA has approved more than 90 percent of those amendments for 700,000 acres in land allowing an increase in residential development potential of more than a half-million units and an increase in non-residential development capacity of 1.4 billion square feet, Pelham said. "How anyone could say DCA is killing jobs is beyond me," Pelham said. "It's an irresponsible statement -- not supported by facts. I challenge anyone to show me one job the department has killed. When we say 'no,' none of our decisions are final. They are subject to appeal." Rejected applicants can appeal to an administrative law judge, then the governor and cabinet and then the district court of appeal. "We don't have final decision-making authority on anything," he said. He said his department may reject land-use amendments, for example, when people propose large developments in the middle of wetlands or that pose safety concerns. "It's not DCA that killed jobs," Pelham said. "It's the national and international global economy that has crashed." On Oct. 26, the morning after the debate, we contacted Sink's campaign by e-mail and asked for evidence that Scott said "he would do away with" the DCA. The Sink campaign sent us back quotes from the same newspaper articles or columns that we had already found. We interviewed Sink campaign spokesman Dan McLaughlin who did not point us to any proof that Scott "has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs." But McLaughlin said in an interview that Scott has sent a "clear signal" that the department should be returned to its "original purpose" which wasn't about growth management. Scott's comments, McLaughlin said, "set against the background of a very extremely conservative Legislature and sunsetting of the department that would come up in the first year of the next governor's administration, it is our belief it is totally accurate with Rick Scott as governor the DCA would go away. He has said he does not want it existing in its current form." (The "sunsetting" refers to a review by the Legislature -- earlier this year the Senate voted to let the DCA survive but the House failed to act, leaving it in limbo for now. The St. Petersburg Times article stated that Rep. Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, the incoming House speaker, says he wouldn't mind seeing the DCA disappear.) We also contacted Scott's campaign and asked for his plans for the state agency. Scott consultant Donna Arduin said that Scott has said he will "put all regulations to a freeze and review plan so he could determine whether or not the benefits are worth the cost," but he hasn't said he would get rid of DCA. By returning DCA to its "original purpose," Scott meant "we need to make sure development meets environmental standards rather than killing jobs." We also asked Arduin to explain what Scott meant about the DCA "killing jobs." She said that some potential investors decide not to come to Florida because they determine the "length and expense of the process they must go through in Florida that other states don't have. They have to pay for consultants, lawyers, lobbyists. They have a time delay to go through the process. Even if they have a 90 percent chance of getting approved, they have now added a huge expense and delay to the potential of investing in Florida." And for investors who do proceed with development here, if they didn't have to spend money to go through the DCA process, they could use that money for other jobs, she said. She didn't have any examples of investors who turned away. Was Sink correct to claim that Scott "has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs?" Sink's campaign has not produced evidence that Scott made that statement and the burden of proof is on her to back up her attack made in the final full week of the campaign. Scott has clearly criticized the agency, saying it has been "killing jobs," but during the debate he denied saying he wanted to eliminate it. Scott's campaign repeated his denial but didn't provide specifics for his plans for the DCA. So other than a review, Scott's plan for the agency, if he wins, remains a mystery. Still, without evidence that Scott said it, we rate this claim False.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-10-26T19:09:21	2010-10-25	['None']
pomt-09742	An Iowa policy "provides for a state round up of Iowa citizens who might be exposed to the swine flu virus."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/14/chain-email/e-mail-claims-iowa-policy-seeks-round-iowans-who-m/	Patty Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, has been amazed by the amount of misinformation and blatant lies swirling around about the H1N1 virus and the federal plans to distribute a vaccine. But even she was a bit thrown when a man called last month and asked her whether Iowa was creating concentration camps for people with H1N1. Seriously. "We don't have concentration camps here in Iowa," she said. And then she sighed. "Those are words I never thought I'd have to say." The rumor spread wide enough that the Iowa Department of Public Health felt the need to isssue a press release on Aug. 31 to knock it down. We're not sure what version of the chain e-mail the department got, but here at PolitiFact, a reader sent us one that claimed, "The state of Iowa has an internal document that was recently leaked on the Internet that ... provides for a state round up of Iowa citizens who might be exposed to the swine flu virus." The e-mail links to a "Facility Quarantine Order." It's a legitimate document, a template to be used in the event that Iowa ever did decide to quarantine people. It reads, in part: "The Iowa Department of Public Health (Department) has determined that you have had contact with a person with Novel Influenza A H1N1. Novel Influenza A H1N1 is a disease which is spread from person to person and is associated with fever (greater than 100.0 F), cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea (runny nose), nasal congestion, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Novel Influenza A H1N1 presents a risk of serious harm to public health and if it spreads in the community severe public health consequences may result. "The Department has determined that it is necessary to quarantine your movement to a specific facility to prevent further spread of this disease. The Department has determined that quarantine in your home and other less restrictive alternatives are not acceptable because — insert the reason home quarantine is not acceptable, the person violated a previously issued home quarantine order, the person does not have an appropriate home setting conducive to home quarantine, etc. The Department is therefore ordering you to comply with the following provisions during the entire period of quarantine." You set that to ominous music under a title calling them "concentration camps," as some have done in YouTube videos, and it comes off as pretty scary. Here's the response from Iowa officials: "To ensure there is no confusion on this issue, Iowa Department of Public Health wants to make it clear that Iowa has not issued any isolation and quarantine orders for novel influenza A (H1N1), and has no plans to issue any this fall. "In preparation for public health emergencies, these types of templates are often prepared in case they are needed, but isolation and quarantine orders are only very rarely used in very specific situations." The templates were prepared when H1N1 first reared up in Mexico, when it was feared to be much more deadly than it turned out to be, Quinlisk said. "As soon as we realized it wasn't that bad, or at least that it was similar to the seasonal flu, that was the end of that," she said. There are a couple of other claims in the e-mail we received. One is that Massachusetts state officials are "in the process of passing a law that will mandate vaccines for the swine flu." According to the chain e-mail, the bill would allow " 'authorities' to impose vaccinations. If you refuse, they can haul you away into quarantine. If you refuse that, you'll be fined up to $1,000 per day, and possibly be incarcerated in prison for 30 days." On Oct. 8, the Massachusetts legislature did sign off on a bill to tighten the powers of public health officials to isolate or quarantine people to contain the outbreak of serious contagious diseases. But that doesn't translate to "a law that will mandate vaccines for the swine flu." In fact, said Jennifer Manley, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Health, "There will absolutely, positively not be any mandatory vaccines for the H1N1 virus in Massachusetts." Most states have laws more than 100 years old that allow people who pose a public health danger to be isolated or quarantined, Quinlisk said. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many states looked into updating those laws to ensure, among other things, that people's civil rights are not violated. Some have clearly misinterpreted those efforts and assigned them insidious intent, she said. No states are considering quarantining people with H1N1. "Quarantine is a public health tool that is primarily used to keep well people who have been potentially exposed to a serious illness away from others who may be susceptible," said Christine Pearson with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's particularly effective when a new disease has not yet been introduced into our country. Given that the virus is already widespread in the United States and worldwide and is presenting the same sort of disease we see with regular seasonal flu, CDC does not intend to issue quarantine or isolation orders for 2009 H1N1 flu at this time." The chain e-mail claims that the Iowa policy "provides for a state round up of Iowa citizens who might be exposed to the swine flu virus." The fact is that there is no mandatory order that all Iowa residents be vaccinated against H1N1, let alone a policy seeking to round up and detain people those refuse. We rule this claim False.

pomt-13986	Says he "helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/09/tim-canova/tim-canova-says-he-helped-draft-part-dodd-frank/	Tim Canova, who is in a Democratic primary battle with U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, says he pushed to crack down on the financial services industry even before the financial collapse. And, he says he played a role in the 2010 financial reform bill. Canova, a law professor and first-time candidate, said in a June 1 Medium post he "helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, one of President Obama’s signature accomplishments." Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., co-author of the reform bill, expressed some skepticism that Canova played a role. "He does seem to be denigrating the financial reform bill, of which I was a co-sponsor, while simultaneously claiming credit for having written it," Frank said at a press conference for Wasserman Schultz in Broward May 31. We decided to fact-check Canova’s role in helping to draft part of Dodd-Frank. Effort to audit the Federal Reserve The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was a sweeping law with multiple components intended to avert another financial meltdown. (Canova has some criticisms of the law which he details in his book, The Bottom-Up Recovery.) The part of the law Canova said he helped draft related to auditing the Federal Reserve, including its emergency lending in the aftermath of the economic collapse. At the time, Canova was a professor of international economic law at Chapman University in California. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, sought for two decades to pass a bill to audit the fed. Bipartisan interest in Paul’s pet project grew after the financial collapse. The House Financial Services Committee passed an amendment 43-26 to audit the Fed on Nov. 19, 2009. U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, whipped Democratic votes. The amendment required government audits of the Federal Reserve including how much the central bank lent to banks. Critics felt it could lead the auditors to interfere with monetary policy. "It was a major legislative achievement, the first time the Federal Reserve was subject to audit, and again over the objections of Barney Frank," Canova told PolitiFact Florida. The concern about monetary policy drew objections from Frank, Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd, the Fed and the Obama administration. So the Senate author, Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, scaled back audit powers to exclude monetary policy but include disclosing information about the emergency loans. The limited audit was included in the final Dodd-Frank bill that was signed by Obama in July 2010. Canova’s role was behind the scenes, serving as a resource to at least a couple of House and Senate staffers at the time. Canova said he was contacted by staffers on Capitol Hill after he published articles on the Federal Reserve. (One of his articles, "Financial Market Failure as a Crisis in the Rule of Law," was published in the Harvard Law Policy and Review in 2009.) He was also quoted in many news articles about the financial crisis. One of those staffers was Matt Stoller, a senior policy adviser to Grayson who worked on the amendment. Canova "was an adviser as we worked on the Federal Reserve emergency lending disclosure provisions of Dodd-Frank," Stoller told PolitiFact Florida. (In 2011, Stoller wrote an op-ed about the Federal Reserve and quoted Canova.) Another staffer was Warren Gunnels, an aide to Sanders. Canova also told Rolling Stone that he worked with some of Sanders' staff on the bill. (Gunnels now works on Sanders’ presidential campaign and did not respond to emails from PolitiFact Florida.) Sanders named Canova to a committee to advise him on Federal Reserve reform in 2011. Sanders backs Canova in his congressional race. Canova forwarded to PolitiFact Florida a few emails he exchanged with Stoller and Gunnels in July 2010 shortly before the Senate passed Dodd-Frank. For example, in an email July 13, 2010, Canova wrote to Gunnels: "I have continued working through the provisions of the Dodd-Frank conference committee bill." Canova suggested that Sanders insert into the record some clarifying language that the audit would apply to financial assistance from the Federal Reserve starting Dec. 1, 2007, through the enactment of the bill. "I am happy to claim a small bit of credit for a supporting role in helping the drafters of one of the very best provisions of the act," Canova told PolitiFact Florida. In an interview, Frank -- who is backing Wasserman Schultz -- told PolitiFact Florida he had never heard of Canova while working on the bill. As for the audit portion of the law, Frank argued Canova shouldn’t get credit because the final version didn’t include auditing monetary policy. Frank said he opposed that portion because he saw it as "political interference." Frank said he didn’t want the members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee "being called before an auditor and asked about votes on interest rates." Our ruling Canova says he "helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill." The Dodd-Frank bill was a sweeping piece of legislation with many components. Canova was involved in one piece of the bill. Canova played a behind-the-scenes role advising a House staff member and a Senate staff member about amendments to allow the government to audit the Federal Reserve. A scaled-back version was included in the final law. Canova didn’t contribute to the drafting of the overall bill, and he wasn't the main driver of the audit portion that stemmed from decades of advocacy by Paul. However, he did play a role.

pomt-00422	"John McCain was pardoned for treason"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/27/blog-posting/sen-mccain-did-not-commit-treason-vietnam/	After Sen. John McCain passed away on Aug. 25, publications nationwide applauded his service, both in the Navy and in the Senate. But news of McCain’s death also dragged up old claims that McCain was not the war hero he claimed to be. A 2017 article posted on Revenge of the Herd claims, "John McCain was pardoned for treason." It alleges that, during his time as a prisoner of war, McCain gave information to the North Vietnamese in exchange for better treatment, and that he would have been executed if President Richard Nixon didn’t pardon him. The story resurfaced after McCain’s death and was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not true. McCain’s time in Vietnam, the case for treason While serving in the Navy in 1967, McCain’s plane was shot down over North Vietnam. His right leg and both of his arms were broken in the crash, and McCain was taken prisoner by North Vietnamese soldiers. He was held captive for the next five and half years, often in solitary confinement. By McCain’s account, he was frequently denied medical attention and beaten in exchange for information. The Revenge of the Herd article focuses on two alleged acts of treason. The first surrounded an allegation that McCain said he would trade information in exchange for medical treatment. In his book, Faith of My Fathers, McCain recounts the grievous wounds he suffered when he was shot down and afterward at the hands of angry Vietnamese. As we have previously written at PolitiFact, McCain was taken to the Maison Centrale, known to POWs as the Hanoi Hilton, where he did lapse in and out of consciousness for four days and refuse his interrogators' demands for information. But then, McCain recounts, he tried a different approach with a prison officer nicknamed "Bug.'' "Desperate, I tried to bargain with him. 'Take me to the hospital and I'll give you the information you want.' I didn't intend to keep my word, reasoning that after my injuries had been treated, I would be strong enough to deal with the consequences of not holding up my end of the bargain,'' McCain wrote. It’s impossible to determine everything McCain told his captors -- interrogations took place one-on-one, in secluded prisons, more than 50 years ago. Based on his personal accounts, though, McCain was used mostly for propaganda: filmmakers would show him in the hospital, being treated by the North Vietnamese. Officials also encouraged him to say that he wanted the war to end, or that he was grateful to his captors and sorry for his participation in the fighting. McCain said he refused to do so. McCain admitted he eventually gave up information about his ship and Navy squadron. "I regret very much having done so,'' he wrote. The second allegation of treason surround McCain’s signing of a confession that he was a war criminal. He did sign such a statement -- after, he says, he was beaten routinely over the course of four days. Upon returning to the United States, McCain wrote, "I reached the lowest point of my 5½ years in North Vietnam. I was at the point of suicide, because I saw that I was reaching the end of my rope." McCain’s first-hand account is corroborated by Robert Timberg, author of John McCain: An American Odyssey. Timburg spoke to other POWs to write his biography of McCain. "I've never known of any occasion in which Sen. McCain provided the North Vietnamese with anything of value," Timberg said. I beg your pardon? Even if you were to somehow buy the argument that McCain committed treason, the Revenge of the Herd article loses all credibility when it says McCain was pardoned. The article says that McCain and 33 other POWs faced a court martial for their crimes. President Richard Nixon issued a blanket pardon to all 34 POWs, including McCain. This part of the story seems to be entirely fabricated. There is no record of any legal proceedings against McCain. His name is also absent from a list of all the pardons granted by Nixon. P.S. Ruckman Jr., who studies presidential pardons and runs the website pardonpower.com, told our colleagues at Snopes there is no evidence McCain received a presidential pardon. "I have developed a researchable data set of every individual grant of clemency from 1789 to present. I have been over the data (30,000 plus cases), dozens of times over the years. John McCain’s name simply does not appear in the data," Ruckman said. Our ruling An article on Revenge of the Herd claims that "John McCain was pardoned for treason." During his time as a prisoner of war, McCain said he would trade information in exchange for medical treatment. He was also forced to sign a confession that he was a war criminal. But there is no evidence of legal proceedings against McCain when he returned to the United States. And records of presidential pardons do not include McCain’s name. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-01897	Says Mark Warner has supported Harry Reid "down the line."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/06/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-warner-supports-majority-leader-rei/	Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie is continuing to attack incumbent Mark Warner as a loyal lieutenant to liberal leaders in Washington. "I would not support the president’s policies down the line and Harry Reid down the line, as Mark Warner has," Gillespie said during a recent interview on Fox News. Gillespie and the state GOP repeatedly have said Warner has voted with President Barack Obama 97 percent of the time. We rated that claim True this spring, but noted that Obama has taken a position on only 28 percent of the measures Warner has voted on. Warner’s key show of solidarity with the president was his 2010 vote to pass Obamacare. With that work behind us, we decided to probe the unexplored part of Gillespie’s claim: That Warner has supported Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev., "down the line." Gillespie’s campaign declined to back up or explain the statement. So we went to the voting records. OpenCongress.org has a tool that compares the voting record of U.S. senators and representatives for the current two-year term of Congress, which started in January 2013. Warner voted the same way as Reid 87 percent of the time through June 24 of this year. That ties as the ninth lowest percentage among 51 Senate Democrats. The lowest correlation is owned by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., at 79 percent; the highest is 93 percent, shared by five senators. The average among all Democratic senators, excluding Reid, is 91 percent. Next, we compiled a record of the roll call votes for the previous four years in which Reid and Warner were both in the Senate. In both the 111th and 112th Congress terms, they also voted the same way 87 percent of the time. Warner and Reid have agreed on these major bills: The stimulus The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare Extending the Patriot Act, allowing increased surveillance of people suspected of terrorist activities A farm bill expanding crop insurance and trimming the food stamp program Extending a period offering lower rates for student loans Increasing debt limits Warner has opposed Reid on several key bills by voting: To overturn Environmental Protection Agency regulations to cut mercury and other emissions from coal-fired electric generation facilities Against delaying the 2013 start of automatic spending cuts in defense and domestic programs that are also known as sequestration For the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement Many of Warner’s voting disagreements with Reid occurred not in the final actions on bills, but in earlier votes on proposed amendments to them. Warner has supported a number of cost-cutting amendments that Reid has opposed. This includes Warner’s votes: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to address long-term fiscal problems To bar earmarks in several budget amendments To eliminate appropriations for security on highway buses on which passengers typically carry luggage Against giving seniors, veterans and the disabled a $250 check to offset the lack of a cost of living adjustment in 2010 benefits For streamlining 15 financial literacy programs in 13 departments For tort reform as part of the health care reform law Warner campaigned for office in 2008 as a "radical centrist" who would seek bipartisan compromise. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman this year, said Gillespie’s efforts to define the senator by vote comparisons "is distorting Senator Warner’s moderate record." Turner sent us links to other vote studies and news articles that praise Warner for his bipartisan work. For example, the National Journal rated Warner the 46th most liberal member of the 100-seat U.S. Senate in 2013, based on an analysis of 117 roll call votes on key economic, foreign and social issues. And Open Congress, found that Warner voted with the majority of his party on 90 percent of all Senate bills last year, ranking him 42nd among the 51 Democratic senators. Turner also noted that Warner and Reid disagreed on some matters that the Senate never voted on. Warner, for example, drew national attention for leading an informal, bipartisan group of six senators seeking tax and spending compromises that would lower the national debt. Reid dismissed the effort as "happy talk." He left Warner off a bipartisan supercommitee that unsuccessfully searched for fiscal compromises to avoid automatic spending cuts -- also known as sequestration -- that went into effect last year. Turner also sent us a recent Politico article that named Warner as one of a group of Democratic senators who has been pushing Reid to ease his control of the Senate by allowing more votes on bills and opening up the amendment process. Our ruling Gillespie accused Warner of supporting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid "down the line." Gillespie’s campaign declined to provide any explanation of the statement. Records show that Warner and Reid have voted in accord 87 percent of the time, including on most of the landmark bills since 2009. That shows substantial agreement, but not the knee-jerk support for Reid that Gillespie suggests. Among the 51 Senate Democrats, Warner has the ninth lowest voting percentage with Reid. Reid and Warner usually agree, but they’re not clones. We rate Gillespie’s exaggerated statement Half True.

pomt-06745	"The United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/26/regina-benjamin/us-surgeon-general-says-less-education-means-highe/	School is back in session. Having trouble persuading Junior to go to class? Tell him that if he doesn’t graduate high school, he’s more likely to die. U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin said as much during an interview on WABE-FM (90.1), as she talked about what she said was the close link between education and health. "The United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education," Benjamin said. PolitiFact Georgia’s team of reporters was skeptical. Doesn’t that sound like something your mom would say to scare you into behaving? Like, "if you keep making that face, it’ll stick that way"? We called up the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Surgeon General’s Office. Their officials replied with a pile of information. Chief among them was a 2007 report from the National Vital Statistics System, a collection of public health data overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It calculated death rates based on 2004 statistics. According to this data, the gap was even worse than Benjamin said. People ages 25 through 64 with 13 or more years of education died at the rate of 208.3 per 100,000. The rate for those with fewer than 12 years of education was 667.2, or 3.2 times higher. University of Colorado at Boulder professor Richard Rogers pointed us to a NVSS report released in 2010 that says Benjamin is closer to the mark. Data from 2007 shows the death rate for those with less than a high school diploma is 529.5, or 2.7 times the rate for those with at least some college, it said. PolitiFact Georgia also consulted with experts and read studies on the subject. They agreed that Benjamin is correct. Since the 1970s, researchers have been aware that education is closely linked to health. In fact, much of the increase in life expectancy has taken place among high-education groups. Life expectancy actually declined for less-educated white women. According to a 2008 study, better-educated black men can expect to live more than eight years longer than their less-educated counterparts. It’s not entirely clear why people with more education tend to live longer lives. Researchers we interviewed said there are likely many reasons. Those with at least some college are less likely to smoke, be obese, live in dangerous places, or have a host of other characteristics that can shorten their lives, studies show. They have healthier behaviors in part because they have more financial and social resources. Recent evidence also suggests that cognitive ability helps people make better health decisions, said Adriana Lleras-Muney, a University of California Los Angeles professor who has worked on the problem for about a decade. So parents, go ahead. Scare your children into going to school. You won’t be lying. Benjamin earns a True.	None	Regina Benjamin	None	None	None	2011-08-26T06:00:00	2011-08-18	['United_States']

pomt-09426	"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week that the Democrats have to pass their terrible health care bill so that the American people can actually find out what's in it."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/15/republican-party-texas/texas-gop-says-speaker-nancy-pelosi-said-people-wi/	The Republican Party of Texas marveled — not in a good way — at an admission of sorts by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the long-stalled health care overhaul before Congress. According to an e-mail the GOP sent Friday, Pelosi said “the Democrats have to pass their terrible health care bill so that the American people can actually find out what's in it.” Talk about a banana-peel moment. Did Pelosi improbably denigrate her party’s promised legislation and say people can find out what’s in it after it passes? GOP spokesman Bryan Preston pointed us to the text of Pelosi’s March 9 speech in Washington to the National Association of Counties. We learned, for starters, that while the Texas GOP thinks the legislation is terrible, Pelosi clearly doesn't. Instead, Pelosi's remarks celebrate aspects such as a ban on denying health coverage because of a pre-existing conditions, “robust support for public health infrastructure,” more spending on community health centers and reductions in uncompensated care by hospitals. Pelosi also says in the speech that the plan won't require anyone to pay a deductible for preventive health care doctor visits. She summarizes: “It’s going to be very, very exciting.” Yet there’s heft to the GOP's claim that Pelosi said the legislation has to pass so people can find out what’s in it. Pelosi adds: “But we have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy.” Pelosi's words stirred critics from the right including Marguerite Higgins, a senior editorial services associate at The Heritage Foundation. In a blog, Higgins named the moment the video of the week and called Pelosi’s statement a “stunning demonstration of political condescension.” Separately, Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly offered this interpretation of Pelosi's comment: "She meant there was so much talk about process (in Congress) that people have lost sight of what’s actually in the bill. Once it’s passed, we can remind them of all the good things that are in it." Capital fusses aside, we wondered if Pelosi spoke accurately; will the plan need to pass before people know what's in it? We called the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has posted side-by-side comparisons online of health care plans approved by the House and Senate. Its spokesman, Craig Palosky, reminded us that Congress posts the entire legislation online. Of course, that's not to say the final deal is settled — or, it stands to reason, open to public view. Palosky declined to comment precisely on Pelosi's forecast, saying her comment seemed more about politics than policy. "It’s not our role to police such comments," he said. "If you want to know what members of Congress are doing, you have to speak to members of Congress.” His nudge led us to call U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, among a handful of physicians in Congress and an opponent to the Democrats' proposal. Burgess told us it's often true that the ins and outs of legislation aren't widely known until after a measure passes into law; that held true, for instance, for the Republican-steered measure providing government aid toward prescription drugs for seniors. Pelosi's "right," Burgess said, though "I don’t think that’s a good strategy (to declare as much). I wouldn’t recommend anyone actually broadcasting that." So how does the GOP's statement shake out? The party's e-mail errs when it makes it sound as if Pelosi thinks the health-care measure is terrible. It's very much the opposite. But it accurately quotes Pelosi as saying people will find out what's in the plan after it passes. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

pomt-02120	There is no "incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing (vehicular) fatalities."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/may/12/matt-caldwell/there-no-incontrovertible-proof-speed-and-itself-i/	As the Florida legislature neared the finish line this spring, some legislators were in a hurry to increase the speed limit on major highways to 75 mph. But there was plenty of debate about whether the state should put on the brakes. SB 392 cleared the Senate, but the House was split during its April 30 debate, with many arguing that the bill was moving too fast. House sponsor Rep. Matt Caldwell, R-Lehigh Acres, waved off opponents, disputing concerns that the higher speed posed a danger. (The legislation eventually passed 58-56.) "I have yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities," he said. We wondered: Is speed alone a factor in higher car crash fatalities? Let’s take this claim for a test drive. Pedal to the metal The first thing to note about the legislation is that it doesn’t decree an increase in the current 70 mph limit. Rather, Caldwell said, it allows the Florida Department of Transportation the ability to raise limits as high as 75 if they deem that advisable under the right conditions. So how do engineers determine the proper speed limit? They use something called the 85th percentile rule, a widely accepted formula that dictates the safest speed is the one at which 85 percent of drivers travel. (You can read more about the 85th percentile rule here.) Caldwell said that considering the speeds at which most Floridians travel, and given normal conditions (sunny, dry roads, etc.), 75 was an acceptable limit. And he argued that raising the speed alone was not going to increase fatalities. "There’s certainly a huge correlation between speed and accidents," he told PolitiFact Florida. "The real question is whether that’s the real cause of accidents." Factoring in more factors We checked with the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration and the Florida Department of Highway Safety, which both referred us to the Florida Highway Patrol, since they’re the ones who would have to deal with future increases in state speed limits. Public affairs officer Steve Gaskins said the FHP had reached out to other states that increased their speed limits and didn’t find a dramatic impact impact on the number of fatal crashes. Gaskins said there were three other factors that caused crashes: -- Impairment (drunken or drugged driving) -- Distraction (texting, talking, putting on makeup, etc.) -- Aggressiveness (swerving, road rage and so on) Russ Rader, the vice president of communications of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said it was wrong to discount the effects of speed on a crash. He pointed specifically to a 2002 study that said 23 states that raised limits to 70 or 75 mph ended up with 35 and 38 percent more deaths per million vehicle miles traveled, respectively. But Rader acknowledged while speed is a problem, it’s not usually the only problem in fatal accidents. "Crashes rarely have a solo cause. But higher speeds exacerbate other factors," he said. "It’s clear from decades of research that when speed limits go up, crash risk goes up, and the crashes that happen are more likely to be deadly." The Council of State Governments in 2013 noted that while lawmakers and researchers can agree higher speeds cause more deadly accidents because of the physics involved, "Intense debate still surrounds the idea that speed-limit hikes alone make roadways more dangerous." The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported last year that the number of speeding-related deaths through 2011 has been dropping steadily, but maintained a steady 31 or 32 percent of total fatal accidents over several years. Michael Knodler, associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst College of Engineering, agreed that blaming speed increases alone is a difficult way to frame a public safety discussion. "This is certainly something up for debate. If you backed me into a corner I could defend either case," he said. Speed variance is a much more pertinent issue in fatal accidents, he said. If the speed limit is 70 and everyone’s going 90, for example, the difference in the speed among cars is the dangerous factor. Knodler did stop short at Caldwell’s use of "incontrovertible," though, saying the concrete physics of increased speed proves that speed does cause more fatalities in accidents. Those two concerns -- differences in speed and the effects of higher speeds on the severity of accidents -- still don’t mean more fatal accidents will happen, University of Kentucky transportation engineering professor Reginald Souleyrette told PolitiFact Florida. Souleyrette worked on a 2005-10 study of Iowa’s move to increase their speed limit to 70. Initial findings showed there was a slight increase in fatal and serious accidents, but in the long run crash rates went down. "If what the representative implies is true, there should be no speed limit at all. … He is correct if he is implying that we should set ‘appropriate’ speed limits. There is no magic safe speed," Souleyrette said. Our ruling Caldwell said he had "yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities." Traffic studies and experts agree that higher speeds can lead to more fatalities in accidents, which makes Caldwell’s use of the word "incontrovertible" suspect. But opinions diverge when discussing whether higher speeds are the cause of those fatal accidents. Speed is no doubt a factor in accidents, but it’s rarely considered the factor leading to fatal crashes. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-06085	"Our income, our GDP per capita, is almost 50 percent higher than (it is for) the average European."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/06/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-income-almost-50-percent-highe/	Recently on the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has used a talking point that favorably compares the United States to Europe. On Dec. 28, 2011, Romney sat down for a a 90-minute conversation with the Quad-City Times editorial board in Iowa. During that session, Romney said that "our income, our GDP per capita, is almost 50 percent higher than (it is for) the average European." Romney said this discrepancy demonstrates the strength of the United States’ system of free enterprise. "I don't want to see a president messing with that," he said, "because it will kill the spirit that makes us the powerhouse we are." (Suggesting that Obama-era America is a danger to free-market capitalism has been a theme for Romney, who has also claimed that "we're inches away from no longer having a free economy" -- a statement we rated Pants on Fire.) A reader asked us to check out the comparison with Europe, so we did. We turned to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that analyzes trends in advanced industrialized countries. One of the statistics the OECD calculates is gross domestic product per capita, measured in constant U.S. dollars and adjusted for the cost of goods in different nations. By this measure, GDP per capita in the U.S. in 2010 was $41,976, compared to $27,533 for the European Union nations. If you compare the two, the U.S. does indeed have a 52 percent higher GDP per capita. So Romney is on solid ground. But there are some caveats worth noting: The European Union vs the Euro Zone. The 27-nation European Union includes a broad range of countries, from wealthy (United Kingdom, France, Sweden) to formerly communist and less-wealthy (Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland and Romania). A tighter group -- and one that includes fewer of the less-wealthy nations, possibly making it a fairer comparison to the U.S. -- consists of the 17 countries that use the Euro. As it happens, the OECD also calculated GDP per capita for the Euro Zone nations and found the average was $29,885. Using this comparison, the U.S. level is just under 44 percent higher. That’s not dramatically different, but it does fall short of 50 percent higher than the European level. Who’s not included. Neither Euro Zone nor the European Union includes two of the richest countries in Europe -- Norway and Switzerland. GDP per capita was $46,908 in Norway -- a level that’s higher than the U.S. -- and $37,775 in Switzerland. If these two countries were added to the calculations, the U.S. advantage would shrink. Holiday and vacation time. By statute, workers in Europe are promised much more vacation and holiday time than workers in the U.S. According to the OECD, workers in 17 European countries work fewer hours than workers in the U.S. Adding holiday and vacation time often means either lower levels of income accumulated from wages, or lower salaries. "If a German gives up some pay to take four more weeks of vacation than an American, he is reported to be poorer, but that may not be the best way to see it," said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that specializes in international economics. GDP per capita vs. median income. This is probably the biggest factor, because a relatively small number of very rich people can skew GDP per capita higher than one would get by comparing median income, which refers to the household that places halfway between the highest- and lowest-income households. Many economists would argue that a fairer measurement of countries would use median income. "If the 300 richest people each see their income rise by an average of $1 billion a year, in per capita terms, this would raise our income by $1,000 a year," said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. "Not many people would feel better as a result of this gain." Data on median incomes is harder to find, but we located some OECD data from the mid 2000s. By our calculation, median income in the United States was only about 33 percent higher than it was for the 22 European OECD members -- $26,990, compared to $20,264. So by this measure, the U.S. is still higher than Europe, but not as dramatically as Romney’s "almost 50 percent" figure would suggest. Our ruling Gross domestic product per capita may not offer the fairest comparison between the U.S. and Europe, mainly because it doesn’t take into account the European trade-off between income and leisure and because it effectively gives heavier weight to a small number of very rich Americans. In addition, there are a number of ways to define "Europe," some of which weaken the accuracy of Romney's statement. Still, as Romney phrased it -- that the United States’ "GDP per capita is almost 50 percent higher than (it is for) the average European" -- his claim has merit. It’s actually slightly over 50 percent by that measure. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-06T16:44:02	2011-12-28	['Europe']
pomt-14573	Says "some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/feb/08/john-obannon/del-john-obannon-says-planned-parenthood-sold-feta/	Appalled by controversial videos about the extraction of fetal organs for research, Del. John O’Bannon, R-Henrico, recently asked his constituents whether Virginia should take action against Planned Parenthood. "Considering the revelation that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit, do you support or oppose a state investigation into the Planned Parenthood chapters in Virginia?" he asked in an 11-question survey that was mailed to constituents and remains on his website. Planned Parenthood has acknowledged that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to medical researchers and that the one in California has been getting reimbursed. Scientists have used fetal tissue since the 1930s; such experimentation was instrumental in developing the polio vaccine. Current studies are using the tissue to research maladies including AIDS, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson’s. Federal law bars organizations performing abortions from profiting from the sale of fetal tissue. The law does, however, allow them to receive "reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue." O’Bannon’s statement that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling parts for profit - a claim made by many abortion opponents - is noteworthy because it accuses the organization of illegal acts. So we asked O’Bannon, a neurologist, for proof. He replied in an email: "Considering the videos revealing the activities of Planned Parenthood officials, I’m surprised you’d ask this question. "I urge you to watch the videos, obtained by the Center for Medical Progress, in their entirety here," O’Bannon wrote, with a hyperlink to the group’s website. The Center for Medical Progress is an anti-abortion group that made national headlines last summer when it released secretly recorded videos that it claimed showed Planned Parenthood officials trying to sell aborted fetus tissue for profit. The director of the center, David Daleiden, posed as a representative of a fake biotech company that was seeking to buy fetal tissue for research. He approached officials from several abortion-providing organizations, including Planned Parenthood. The footage contains graphic descriptions of abortion procedures and the methods for salvaging issue, which may be done only with the mother’s advance permission. Some of the conversations occurred over meals, and Planned Parenthood later apologized for the casual attitude displayed by one official in her discussion with Daleiden, who was undercover. One video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling Daleiden that he "probably" could obtain tissue for fees ranging from $30 to $100 per specimen. The exact cost, she said, could depend on how much staff time is required to extract the tissue and whether shipping costs were involved. Another video shows Daleiden and an unidentified female colleague - both undercover - meeting with Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s Medical Directors’ Council. Gatter, after much prodding, said the fee for a tissue specimen might be $50 to $75, but she wasn’t sure and would have to consult with others. "We’re not in it for the money, and we don’t want to be in the position of being accused of selling tissues and stuff like that," Gatter said. "On the other hand, there are costs involved with this." Federal law doesn’t define in dollars and cents the "reasonable payments" abortion clinics may charge for their costs in extracting fetal tissue. Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, has told PolitiFact National that the $30 to $100 range cited by Planned Parenthood officials does "not appear to be out of the ordinary, but no one knows because there is no registry or compendium of fees charged by organizations (or) institutions supplying fetal tissue." The videos have provided new fuel for the efforts of anti-abortion groups to convince Congress and state governments to defund Planned Parenthood. They have prompted separate investigations of the organization in at least 18 states - but not Virginia - and by congressional Republicans. So far, 12 states have concluded their investigations without finding evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood, according to a Jan. 28 article by National Public Radio.. Perhaps the most significant results came from Washington, one of the two states in which a Planned Parenthood clinic supplied fetal tissue to researchers. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, issued a report in November that concluded the organization did not profit from the activity in his state. Officials in California, the other state where tissue transactions are known to have occurred, have not launched an investigation. Planned Parenthood, seeking to quell the controversy from the videos, announced in October that it no longer would accept reimbursement for fetal tissues. It also should be noted that on Jan. 24, a Texas grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing and indicted Daleiden on a felony charge of tampering with a government record by fashioning a fake California driver’s license. Sandra Merritt, another center employee who accompanied Daleiden on some of the meetings with Planned Parenthood, was indicted on the same charge. Daleiden also was indicted on a misdemeanor charge related to trying to purchase fetal tissue. Our ruling O’Bannon said "some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit." As evidence, he points broadly to a series of secretly recorded videos in which anti-abortion advocates - posing undercover as officials of a fake biotech firm seeking to buy fetal tissue for research - met with Planned Parenthood officials. Planned Parenthood acknowledges that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to researchers but says they comply with federal law barring a financial profit from the transactions. O’Bannon’s statement implicitly accuses Planned Parenthood of breaking the law, so there’s a burden on him to prove the organization profited from sales. He falls short by simply pointing to the videos in which Planned Parenthood officials, under prodding from the undercover activists, say tissues probably could be obtained for $30 to $100 per sample. A medical ethicist tells us those fees seem to be a "reasonable" reimbursement for the cost of supplying the tissue. An investigation by Washington’s attorney general cleared Planned Parenthood of charges it was profiting from the sales in that state. Investigations in 11 other states also have cleared the organization. There’s simply nothing that proves O’Bannon’s claim and much that contradicts it. So we rate his statement False.

pomt-14197	"Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country’s drug laws and its levels of drug use."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/22/kofi-annan/former-un-secretary-general-says-war-drugs-has-fai/	Several Latin American and European countries pressed their case to decriminalize drugs at a special session of the United Nations this week. They came up short. The document that emerged maintained a basic prohibitionist stance. But the advocates for a softer touch did garner some prominent backers, including former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who argued in an op-ed that the war on drugs has failed. "Prohibition has had little impact on the supply of or demand for drugs," Annan wrote. "When law enforcement succeeds in one area, drug production simply moves to another region or country, drug trafficking moves to another route and drug users switch to a different drug. Nor has prohibition significantly reduced use. Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country’s drug laws and its levels of drug use." Measuring the effectiveness of prohibitions can be tricky. For this fact-check, we're looking into the connection between getting tough on drugs and less use. We reached out to the Kofi Annan Foundation and did not hear back, so we don’t know what specific studies he had in mind. We reached out to several experts in the field and generally, they agreed with his statement. Jonathan Caulkins, professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, has worked on some of the broadest examinations of drugs in America. Caulkins was part of the team that wrote the U.S. Office of National Drug Policy’s latest assessment of how much users spend on drugs. "There is some research that finds increased harshness reduces use, but the overall statement is true," Caulkins told PolitiFact. "By and large, expanding toughness beyond a basic prohibition plus the usual amount of enforcement does not drive down use." European countries created a natural laboratory of sorts on the interplay of marijuana laws and marijuana use. Over the decades, different countries have adopted a variety of approaches. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction examined the results in each place. The center’s legal analyst Brendan Hughes told us no clear relationship emerged. The following chart shows why. In Italy, for example, penalties went up but so did use. Denmark also tightened its laws and saw almost no change. On the flip side, the United Kingdom adopted lighter sanctions and the prevalence of marijuana fell. But when Slovakia did the same, usage rose. One approach to gauging the impact of enforcement is to track trends in the price of drugs, after factoring in changes in purity. Based on the basic rules of supply and demand, if the price falls, use is expected to rise, and vice versa. The most recent analysis from the U.S. Office of National Drug Policy dates back to 2008. While the numbers could have changed since then, that report had discouraging news for the zero-tolerance camp. The price of heroin had fallen about 30 percent for all grades or purity in 10 years, cocaine showed a modest but steady decline, and some grades of marijuana saw a 50 percent drop in price. (This predates by many years the decriminalization moves in Colorado and Washington State.) Thomas Kerr, Co-Director of the Urban Health Research Initiative at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, said the federal data provide "compelling evidence" of the limits of a get-tough policy. "As expenditures on drug control increased dramatically, use has not gone down, nor has price, while purity has gone up," Kerr said. Kerr pointed to research in Thailand, where simple possession of heroin can lead to up to 10 years in prison, that found harsh enforcement tactics had no apparent impact on heroin users. We did find one study that concluded that greater incarceration reduced drug use. Economist Steven Levitt at the University of Chicago co-authored a 2001 article that examined cocaine patterns between 1980 and 2000. It was a time, Levitt wrote, when the number of prisoners jailed for drug-related offenses rose 15-fold. "We estimate that cocaine prices are 10 to 15 percent higher today as a consequence of increases in drug punishment since 1985," Levitt wrote. "Based on previous estimates of the price elasticity of demand for cocaine, this implies a reduction in cocaine consumed of as much as 20 percent." However, that conclusion hangs on a rising price of cocaine, and data gathered after that report showed prices falling, not rising. That doesn’t mean that cocaine use rose in response. As a sign of the complicated nature of drug consumption, federal data showed that from 2002 to 2010, the amount of cocaine used in the United States fell by half. An article by Caulkins and his colleague Peter Reuter at the RAND Corporation, a prominent think tank, concluded that enforcement can sometimes help stop a mass market from forming, such as in the case of a new drug coming on the scene. But once a drug takes hold, "there may be little return to intense enforcement. A modest level of enforcement may generate most of the benefits from prohibition." Caulkins emphasized that the policy choice is not between a total ban and no ban at all. "If one goes from the basic enforcement necessary to make a prohibition real to no prohibition at all, then use and abuse would go way up," he warned. Our ruling Annan said that studies consistently fail to find a link between the harshness of a country’s drug laws and its levels of drug use. The experts we reached and the data and reports we found largely backed that up. In some places, tougher penalties led to less use. In others, tougher laws had no effect at all. In the United States, while there are shifting patterns of drug use, there is no simple relationship to the severity of the nation’s drug laws. The caveat is that from the European study, relaxing penalties had equally unpredictable results. Annan’s statement needs that bit of context. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57b76f03-26f4-41a0-8a93-f3bfa84ccb0f	None	Kofi Annan	None	None	None	2016-04-22T11:16:09	2016-04-19	['None']
pomt-11904	"Women in our state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care"	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/oct/21/andrew-cuomo/state-birth-control-rule-doesnt-cover-all-insuranc/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says women in New York state don’t have to worry about new Trump administration rules ending a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. The new rules exempt employers from the Obama-era mandate if they have religious or moral reservations to the coverage. But Cuomo said contraception will still be covered in New York state. "This year, we ensured that whatever happens at the federal level, women in our state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care," Cuomo said in a statement. States can set certain insurance standards beyond what the federal government requires. New York state told insurance companies in January they are required to cover birth control and abortion services. That condition still stands, but is Cuomo right that women in New York state are not affected by Trump’s decision? Limits to state regulation State regulations, like the one from January, do not apply to all plans. The state Department of Financial Services regulates everything sold on the state health exchange, called New York State of Health. That includes plans sold to individuals and companies with 100 or fewer employees. The agency says the state’s birth control mandate covers 1.35 million residents in those plans. Health care offered through companies with more than 100 employees is more complicated. Companies that go the traditional route of buying health coverage through an insurance carrier must adhere to the rules. About 2.5 million people in that category are covered by the state’s birth control mandate. But companies that are self-insured, where the employer assumes a large part of the costs, are not regulated by the state, meaning they need not adhere to the state's birth control mandate. About 60 percent of private sector workers in the U.S. who get their health coverage through an employer were enrolled in a self-insured plan in 2015. That’s up from 46 percent in 1996, according to research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. In New York state, about 54 percent of private sector employees who get health insurance through their employer had a self-insured plan last year, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The option is most popular for companies with at least 1,000 employees. Eighty percent of private sector employees at companies that size in New York state are enrolled in a self-insured plan. What about public health insurance? The federal government sets the baseline for what services are covered under Medicaid. Government workers are covered under state regulation, but Medicaid and Medicare enrollees are not.States can add to that list. The list of services covered by Medicaid in New York state goes well beyond the federal standard. New York is one of multiple states where Medicaid covers birth control and abortion services. About a third of the state’s population alone is on Medicaid. Our ruling Cuomo said women in New York state "will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care" because of an action the state took earlier this year. But not every woman is in an insurance plan regulated by the state. It’s possible a self-insured large employer in New York state could apply for an exemption from the federal birth control mandate. If granted the exemption, the company would not have to provide health coverage for birth control to its employees. Those exemptions are not expected to be widespread, but they are possible. Cuomo’s statement needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2017-10-21T09:23:12	2017-10-06	['None']
pomt-07535	"Since 1990, in inflation-adjusted dollars, per-student funding of the (Florida) state university system from general revenue has dropped by about $4,000."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/05/bob-graham/column-bob-graham-scolds-legislature-university-fu/	Former Democratic governor and U.S. Sen. Bob Graham is taking to the editorial pages of Florida's newspapers to warn against a slow march by the Republican-dominated Legislature against the state's core values. In an opinion column that appeared in the St. Petersburg Times on April 3, 2011, Graham openly questioned whether the Legislature's decision over the past decade to reduce taxes has produced the high-quality jobs the tax cuts promised, and whether the Legislature is backing away from a commitment to preserve the Florida Everglades. He also took on the Legislature when it comes to how the state funds its university system. In doing so, he provided a claim that piqued our interest. He wrote: "Since 1990, in inflation-adjusted dollars, per-student funding of the state university system from general revenue has dropped by about $4,000," Graham wrote. "These savage cuts to education expose a lack of vision for Florida's future." We've heard Graham talk about the Legislature and the state university system before. In 2007, he sued the Legislature, arguing that it did not have the authority to set tuition rates. That power, he said, is left up to the Board of Governors. A circuit court judge last year ruled against Graham, who said he will appeal. In this case, Graham is talking about the money the Legislature sets aside in general revenues -- mostly from sales tax proceeds -- to fund the university system. Graham's numbers actually came from the Board of Governors, the statewide governing body for the university system that was created by the passage of a constitutional amendment in 2002. Kelly Layman, a spokeswoman for the Board of Governors and university system Chancellor Frank Brogan, provided PolitiFact Florida the same spreadsheet it provided Graham when he requested it. The spreadsheet details university funding from the 1990-91 budget -- Republican Bob Martinez's last budget as governor -- to the current 2010-11 budget. The big takeaway? The vast majority of dollar-for-dollar increases into the university system are overwhelming the result of increases to student tuition. In 1990, general tax revenues funded 71 percent of per-student costs while tuition covered 18 percent. In 2010, taxes funded 49 percent of per-student costs. Tuition covered 40 percent. In bottom line numbers, taxes funded $5,131 a student in 1990 compared to $5,682 in the current budget. Using the U.S. Department of Labor's online inflation calculator, $5,131 in 1990 dollars is worth $8,688 today. That's $3,006 less. Short of the "about $4,000" Graham claimed. We reached Graham to ask him about the difference. Graham told us he calculated the figure a slightly different way. He took the 1990 allocation -- $5,131 -- and popped it into a compound interest calculator like this one. He factored in 3 percent annual interest growth, and calculated out for 21 years -- 1990 to 2011. The result? $9,626.45. He then subtracted $5,682 (the current funding) to get an inflation-adjusted spending reduction of $3,944.45. "We should be investing in our students and our universities, and instead we're not," Graham said. It's worth noting that the amount of tax dollars funding the university system didn't fall off a cliff in 1990. In fact, after a decrease in 1991, spending increased. In 1998, tax dollars contributed $6,950 per student ($9,400 in today's dollars when adjusted for inflation). Dollars slowly melted away after that, or if the Legislature approved funding increases, they failed to keep up with the cost of inflation. As late as 2007, the Legislature directed $7,685 in tax dollars to the university system, which translates to about $8,200 when adjusted for inflation. Graham said that "since 1990, in inflation-adjusted dollars, per-student funding of the state university system from general revenue has dropped by about $4,000." He used a compound interest calculator to come to that figure, but that assumes inflation from 1990-2011 averaged 3 percent per year. According to the Department of Labor, the economy did not grow quite at that rate -- hence the disparity between Graham's calculation and ours. That said, he's right that tax dollars are not funding the state university system the way it did two decades ago. So we rate Graham's statement Mostly True.

pomt-13821	"In North Carolina, paid family leave is more popular than college basketball."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/15/moms-rising/paid-family-leave-more-popular-college-basketball-/	Like many in North Carolina, we’re excited for the start of college basketball season four months from now. But in the meantime, we decided to take a break from more serious fact checks about the economy and HB2 to take a look at a political claim talking about – you guessed it – college basketball. The liberal advocacy group MomsRising was talking a big game on Twitter recently, pushing for paid family leave policies. They said the idea that businesses should pay workers when they have to miss work for major family events – the birth of a child, taking care of an ill relative, etc. – is more popular than the unofficial religion of the Tar Heel state. "In North Carolina, paid family leave is more popular than college basketball," the group declared, alongside a photo from a UNC-Duke game. That’s a high bar to clear in a state that has sent a team to five of the last 12 men’s college basketball national championship games. So we wondered if it’s true, or the political equivalent of claiming Christian Laettner is a beloved figure in Kentucky. "There’s nothing more North Carolina than basketball," said Beth Messersmith, the N.C. campaign director for MomsRising who came up with the basketball analogy. "If you can be more popular than basketball in North Carolina, then you know you’re onto something." Support for college basketball First things first. Just how popular is college basketball in North Carolina? Some alumni of UNC, Duke, Wake Forest and N.C. State may be surprised to learn that not all North Carolinians are crazy for college hoops. According to a poll taken just before last season by Public Policy Polling, 52 percent of North Carolinians consider themselves college basketball fans. In another PPP poll commissioned in early July by MomsRising and other groups that mostly focused on paid leave – the same poll their Twitter claim referenced – college basketball received 53 percent support. Yet even just two years prior, in 2013, 59 percent of North Carolina respondents told PPP they were college basketball fans. Other polls have documented the sport’s declining popularity nationwide. Gallup, for instance, found that while the number of fans didn’t drop between 2001 and 2012, the number of people saying they were definitely not fans (as opposed to on the fence) has grown. And according to the Harris Poll, college basketball was perhaps at its height in 1989, when 10 percent of Americans said it was their favorite sport. In 2015, that number was 4 percent. Time Magazine analyzed the sport’s declining popularity last year and attributed it to a number of factors, including low scoring, conference realignment that ended some popular rivalries, and a schedule that forces it to compete for attention with both college and professional football. Support for paid leave Let’s now take a break to watch some of our favorite college basketball moments, then get back to the subject at hand: paid leave policies. According to one United Nations study of 170 countries, only the U.S. and the tiny Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea don’t require paid family leave. PolitiFact has previously checked several people claiming the U.S. is lagging behind the rest of the world in its paid leave policies; it was particularly popular with Bernie Sanders during his run for the Democratic presidential nomination. It could be expensive. PolitiFact’s "Obameter," which tracks promises made by the president, noted that he has failed in his promise to spend $1.5 billion to start paid family and medical leave in the United States. In North Carolina, the poll from Public Policy Polling that MomsRising commissioned found 49 percent of people strongly favor paid family leave and another 19 percent somewhat favor it, for a total of 68 percent support. To jog your memory, college basketball has recently been polling about 15 percentage points lower than that. We don’t know the partisan breakdown of this poll, but in national polls, paid leave typically has bipartisan support – although moreso among liberals – and among politicians, it’s far more popular among Democrats than Republicans. Because of that, it’s worth noting that the poll in question was paid for by a liberal group pushing for more paid leave policies, and that Public Policy Polling is itself a liberal-leaning organization. So take these numbers with a grain of salt. But unfortunately, there has been little to no other statewide polling on the topic. Public Policy Polling – which does polls for private clients as well as for public distribution – has never before asked about paid family leave in a public poll. Similarly, we weren’t able to find any other statewide polling on the subject (although if you know of any, please let us know). But nationally, the polling does mirror what PPP found in North Carolina. In 2015, an AP-GfK poll found two-thirds of Americans supported paid family leave – about the same as the recent North Carolina poll, but lacking the political biases, and an AP-NORC poll two months ago found 75 percent support among people age 40 and older. A New York Times-CBS poll, in 2015, found 80 percent support for paid family leave nationally. Our ruling MomsRising said that "paid family leave is more popular than college basketball" in North Carolina. There is little polling on this topic at the state level, but what there is does line up with national polling. Since data is sparse but does support the claim, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0963b149-97d8-405c-b3e4-2bc010444fab	None	Moms Rising	None	None	None	2016-07-15T10:45:37	2016-07-13	['North_Carolina']
pomt-04176	Wisconsin has created "just under 100,000" jobs since he took office.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-has-created-almost/	Gov. Scott Walker’s top campaign promise was that the state would create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his four-year term. Walker has made the vow in a variety of forums, including speeches, videos, and on his campaign and official websites. But the state’s progress in job creation was last in the nation in 2011 -- and there have been no signs of a significant turnaround in 2012. During the 2012 recall election, Walker touted about 33,000 new jobs. So, where did a figure of nearly 100,000 come from? That’s the number Walker cited Dec. 12, 2012 in response to questions at a workforce development event in Pewaukee, when he said he thought he still could reach 250,000. "We're just under 100,000" jobs, he said. "It's going to be tough, no doubt about it." And he added: "We're going to achieve it." A few hours later at an event in Madison, Walker gave a more precise figure when asked about progress on the 250,000 jobs promise. He said the number of jobs created was just over 86,000: "We're not there yet, but we're moving at a much better pace than most people think." When we asked about the "just under 100,000 figure," Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster said the number was based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, considered the most reliable measure of employment. She said the data showed there were 86,490 jobs created from December 2010 (just before Walker took office) to June 2012 (the most recent quarter available). "There was a question, and the number he gave is based on that QCEW raw data," Webster said. Webster said she had no further explanation for the number other than to say it came from the state Department of Workforce Development. "Part of it was that it was the number that the governor had been told," she said. "That is where it came from." At PolitiFact, we’ve been down this path. And down this math. For our monthly update of Walker’s progress, we wanted to use the most accurate data possible. That would be the census data which comes from a quarterly survey of 95 percent of the state’s employers. There also are monthly numbers from a much smaller sample that are less accurate. The end of the year census data for 2011 showed a net increase of 27,811 jobs. When the first quarter census data came out for 2012, we thought about adding those numbers to the 2011 figure and create a running total. But we were warned against it. By whom? A state Department of Revenue Economist and officials with the governor’s office and the Department of Workforce Development. They said it was inaccurate to view the census data in anything other than one-year blocks. In other words, you can’t combine partial years of census data with full years to create a running total. "Please don’t, as John Koskinen, an economist at DOR would say, compare February temperatures to July," said Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie when we asked about job numbers last summer. When we talked to Koskinen, here’s what he said: "The QCEW data published by DWD, and maintained by the BLS (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), is not seasonally adjusted. The seasonal pattern overwhelms any trend, so a direct comparison between December 2010 and March 2012 is not valid. The only valid comparison between December 2010 and March 2012 would be with data that is seasonally adjusted." Werwie also noted the seasonally adjusted issue, and said if we combined the yearly and quarterly data "you’ll end up misrepresenting the truth." DWD has followed this approach when it has released quarterly jobs data this year. For instance, on Nov. 15, 2012 the department issued a report based on the census data, but limited it to the 12 months between June 2011 and June 2012. That report said the state created 35,379 jobs in that time frame. The department did the same thing Aug. 16, 2012 when it released census data comparing March 2011 with March 2012, showing a gain of 37,464 jobs in that period. To be sure, Walker has maintained a love-hate relationship with the jobs data over the course of his two years in office. Much of that has been directed at the monthly Current Employment Survey data, which is far less accurate and prone to revisions. Early on, Walker celebrated monthly increases with news conferences. And when the monthly numbers have declined, members of his administration have criticized the figures as being sloppy. After talking with state officials, including Koskinen, and other experts, we came up with our own formula for measuring the jobs progress on the Walk-O-Meter. We take the full year of jobs as measured by the census numbers -- 27,811 -- and add to that the running monthly tallies for 2012. It’s an estimate, but, all outside experts agreed, the best available given the limitations of the data. Using this formula, we determined that as of the Nov. 15, 2012 monthly report, which covered October 2012, the state created 25,411 private sector jobs under Walker’s watch. We emailed Koskinen and DWD officials to ask for their take on Walker’s use of the census data. No one got back to us with a response. We later heard again from Webster, who said Walker was simply providing the latest "raw data" as "a snapshot with no assumptions." However, the governor included no such qualifications when he made the remarks. Webster also noted "six quarters of economic activity obviously cannot be used to accurately project two full years of job activity." Our rating Walker said the state has created "just under 100,000" jobs since he took office. He arrived at that number by combining full and partial years of census data. However, several within his own administration, including his primary spokesman, have said that is the wrong way to measure jobs -- you can’t combine partial and full year data sets. As one aide said: It would be "misrepresenting the truth." By his administration’s own yardstick, his statement is false. We think it’s ridiculous to -- after private admonitions -- publicly present it this way. Pants on Fire.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-12-16T09:00:00	2012-12-12	['None']
pomt-07107	"The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/21/newt-gingrich/numbers-back-gingrich-job-growth-claim/	Former Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich made a claim during last week’s CNN debate of Republican presidential candidates that was like red meat to conservatives who complain that government is trying to force employees to join unions. "The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states," said Gingrich, the former U.S. House Speaker who now lives in Virginia. Is that true? We wanted to check. First, let’s explain what is a right-to-work state. In right-to-work states, employees can decide whether or not they want to join or financially support a union. There are 22 states, including Georgia, with right-to-work laws. Most of those states are in the South, the Plains region and parts of the West. The right-to-work issue became a political thunderstorm earlier this year when some Republican leaders in Wisconsin wanted to strip bargaining rights from public-sector union workers and pass legislation to make it a right-to-work state. Many Republican leaders across the country complain it’s more difficult for the economy to flourish in strong union states. Gingrich is part of the right-to-work crowd. A campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, suggested we go back a decade to examine his claim. The "historical trend is overwhelming," Hammond told us in an e-mail. Gingrich’s argument is apparently rooted in data from the National Institute for Labor Relations Research. Between 1999 to 2009, it found job growth rose in right-to-work states by 3.7 percent and fell in "forced-unionism states" by 2.8 percent. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation conducted similar research from 2000 to 2010 in the 22 right-to-work states and found there was a less than 1 percent increase in private-sector job growth and a 5.5 percent decline in the other 28 states. Foundation official Stanley Greer stressed to us that they don’t believe right-to-work guidelines are the sole factor for private-sector job growth, but still are a "very important factor." The Economic Policy Institute, an organization that says its goal is to raise the economic status of low- and middle-income Americans, argues that right-to-work laws "have not succeeded in boosting employment growth in the states that have adopted them," according to a March report. Two researchers there attributed the job growth in many right-to-work states, particularly the South, to factors that include interstate road improvements and more money spent on education. All three organizations used the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics for their research. So did we. PolitiFact Georgia compared the number of private-sector jobs in each state from April 2001 to April 2011, the most recent month available. We found 15 of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. North Dakota, which Gingrich hailed during the CNN debate, had the largest increase during that time span, 19.5 percent. The four states with the greatest decrease were all Rust Belt states that have relied on manufacturing: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. None of those are right-to-work states. Georgia had the fifth lowest private sector job growth rate. We also analyzed private-sector job growth since June 2009, which federal officials said was the end of the recent economic recession. North Dakota, again, was at the head of the class and Texas, another right-to-work state, was second. Thirteen of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. Four of the five states with the lowest private-sector job growth rates were not right-to-work states. Overall, there was a slight increase in the number of private-sector jobs in the 22 right-to-work states during the past decade and post recession. In the 28 other states, there was a small decrease in both time periods. Nine of the nation’s 10 fastest-growing states over the past decade were right-to-work states. Five of those states -- Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Texas and Utah -- had increases in job growth since April 2001. The population growth in those states may be a factor. By our analysis, Gingrich’s statement that job growth is higher in right-to-work states has merit.

pomt-00369	Says Andrew Gillum "wants to abolish ICE and doesn't believe in doing any type of immigration enforcement."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/sep/11/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-claims-andrew-gillum-wants-abolish-ic/	In his quest to become Florida’s next governor, Republican Ron DeSantis has embraced President Donald Trump’s rhetoric against illegal immigration. He’s also labeled his Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum as someone who doesn’t care about enforcing immigration laws. "He wants to abolish ICE and doesn't believe in doing any type of immigration enforcement," DeSantis said of Gillum during a Sept. 2 interview with New York radio host John Catsimatidis. (ICE is the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency in charge of executing immigration laws within the United States.) Gillum has called for abolishing ICE but has also said that ICE needs to be "replaced with a more compassionate and focused agency" focused on immigration issues. DeSantis resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives on Sept. 10 to focus on his campaign. Election Day is Nov. 6. Gillum’s call to abolish ICE Gillum, Tallahassee’s mayor, is among Democrats who have criticized ICE since media reports said newly arriving immigrant families were being separated at the border. This summer, the Trump administration employed a "zero-tolerance" policy to refer for prosecution all immigrants who enter the United States illegally. That resulted in more than 2,000 children being separated from their parents. The government has since reunified most of them due to a court order, but hundreds of children remain without their parents. "It's time to abolish ICE in its current form to be replaced with a more compassionate and focused agency that actually keeps us safer," Gillum posted on Facebook on July 3. "Donald Trump has turned ICE into a police and child separation agency — not a border enforcement agency that treats people humanely and compassionately." Gillum’s claim that Trump turned ICE from being a "border enforcement agency" is flawed, because ICE doesn’t enforce laws at the border. The agency that does that is U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP. What’s ICE’s role? ICE agents pick up people already living in the United States illegally. A division of ICE also investigates and arrests people involved in gangs and human trafficking. ICE also oversees detention facilities that house people waiting a resolution of their immigration case or waiting to be deported. Some Democrats in Congress calling for the abolition of ICE have muddled the distinction between the two agencies. Republicans have done so, too; claiming that getting rid of ICE equals a call for open borders. Overall, there isn’t a unified Democratic message behind the "abolish ICE" movement. For some, it means a restructuring of the agency, a new focus, or shifting responsibilities to other agencies. Others want to see ICE shuttered and a new agency rise in its place. Generally, however, they aren’t calling for end to immigration enforcement. "We want to replace ICE with the Department of Justice, an entity that has not been tarnished in the same way as ICE has," Gillum said during an Aug. 29 CNN interview after winning the Democratic primary. In his July Facebook post, Gillum wrote that "a decision between security or compassionate immigration policy is a false choice," and promised to fight for both as governor. DeSantis’s argument that Gillum doesn't believe in immigration enforcement What’s DeSantis’s evidence that Gillum doesn't believe in any type of immigration enforcement? He cites instances when Gillum spoke in favor of immigrants (including ones here illegally) and against measures that he believes would discriminate or criminalize them. But Gillum hasn’t said no laws should be enforced. Gillum is against requiring that Florida employers use what’s now a voluntary program called E-Verify. That program checks a person’s identity and employment eligibility by electronically matching his or her information to federal databases, including immigration records. Gillum has said that requiring E-Verify "criminalizes people's personhood." (Some employers with federal contracts are required to enroll in E-Verify.) Gillum also opposes "mass deportations" and believes immigration enforcement should remain a federal matter. He criticized Trump for threatening to cut federal funds from cities that limit their cooperation with federal agents. Trump calls those places "sanctuary cities." Gillum told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that as governor he would "promote mutual trust and cooperation between law enforcement and immigrant communities, regardless of immigration status." Our ruling DeSantis said Gillum, "wants to abolish ICE and doesn't believe in doing any type of immigration enforcement." Gillum said "it's time to abolish ICE," joining some Democrats making similar calls after reports of family separations at the border. However, Gillum also said ICE needed to be replaced with a more "focused agency." He hasn’t advocated against the enforcement of all immigration laws.

pomt-05344	"When these [undocumented] students graduate from college, they're still illegal aliens. They cannot get a job."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/13/terry-gorman/immigration-enforcement-advocate-terry-gorman-says/	As a result of a decision last year by the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, students who are in the state illegally who graduate from Rhode Island high schools are eligible for the in-state tuition rate if they decide to go to a state college or university. The ruling sparked a furor among advocates of strict enforcement of immigration laws. Two bills -- one that would reverse the board’s decision and one that would make the policy state law -- were the subject of an April 24, 2012, hearing before the House Committee on Finance. William T. "Terry" Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, argued for reversing the regents’ policy, saying the state would be subsidizing a college education for people who aren't employable because they are in the country illegally. "Please keep in mind that these students, when they're attending high school, they're illegal aliens. When they graduate, they're illegal aliens. When they enter college, they're illegal aliens. Because of that status, they're not allowed to get a job to help pay their way through college. They're not allowed to get a driver's license to drive back and forth to college. And when we've provided them that four years of in-state tuition, they're not allowed to get a job," Gorman said. "They can't get a job at Textron, they can't get a job at CVS, they can't get a job at Gilbane, they can't get a job at Dunkin’ Donuts, and they can't get a job at Burger King because of their status. And we provided them with four years of a college education." He again emphasized that point later in the hearing: "When these students graduate from college, they're still illegal aliens. They cannot get a job. How does that help the economy?" One could argue that it's good to have the state's smartest students -- whether legal or illegal -- move into the Rhode Island work force. But will those undocumented college grads really end up unemployed anyway? We were particularly curious because three of the 12 states that have passed laws to provide in-state tuition for undocumented high school graduates -- California, New Mexico and Texas -- are places where the illegal immigration issue is particularly prominent, thanks to their borders with Mexico. Are those states doing something different, allowing companies to tap the best-educated, motivated undocumented residents? The answer is no, said Laura Vazquez, a legislative analyst for the National Council of La Raza, a Washington, D.C.-based Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. She said the situation is the same throughout the United States. "When they graduate, we don't get the benefit of having this educated group of people who are eager and ready to contribute fully." They do find work. "Some of them are working under the table" under poor conditions. Some work for family. A number of students go to law school or enroll in Ph.D. programs, she said. But companies can't hire them because the government requires that all workers be checked for employment eligibility. Graduates could seek employment overseas, but "a lot of these kids feel American through and through and want to practice their skills here," Vazquez said. And if they were to leave the country to take an overseas job they won't be allowed back in for a long time. Immigration law says, in general, if you've been in the United States illegally for more than one year after reaching age 18, once you leave the country you are banned from reentering for 10 years. In a few cases, undocumented people who have been scheduled for deportation have gotten a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security, which allows them to seek a work permit. But the DHS "is very stingy with it," she said. Other immigration experts told us the same thing: Gorman is essentially correct. "It is true that undocumented college graduates are legally barred from working. The only exception is in rare cases they have been able to obtain contract work provided there is no employer/employee relationship," said Kent Wong, director of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Los Angeles. Gorman sent us a link to a Huffington Post story about Iliana Guadalupe Perez, a mathematician and undocumented immigrant, who has written a free online guide detailing how undocumented college graduates can find work. Her advice was also to seek work as an independent contractor where proof of citizenship isn't required. When we asked Gorman what was going on in the border states, he suggested that graduates may be able to get jobs because enforcement was lax. He said a source in San Diego reported that immigration officials "are not checking on hardly anything regarding illegal aliens here right now, least of all the status of recent college grads applying for jobs. She said the governor just authorized state scholarships for the illegal alien students. "I also spoke with Jim Gilchrist from the Minuteman Project and he echoed basically the same sentiments. He did say there has been more employer audits by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] but not of the type that would be looking for illegal alien college grads," Gorman said in an e-mail. (The Minuteman Project pushes for stronger enforcement of immigration laws.) "I also spoke with the Policy Director of The Center for Immigration Studies and she said she has never heard of any enforcement efforts in Texas or California regarding illegal alien college grads," said Gorman. The center is a research group that opposes illegal immigration and wants less legal immigration into the United States. However, given the strictness of the law, a special effort to focus on college graduates may not be necessary. Michael Olivas, director of the Institute of Higher Education Law & Governance at the University of Houston, said the why-give-them-a-tuition-break-when-they-can't-get-a-job argument is a diversion from the real problem: children brought to the United States, sometimes at a very young age, "are left in this netherworld where they can neither work nor be licensed" once they become adults. And when their inability to find work is used to try to prevent them from being eligible for the same in-state educational opportunities as their peers, "it’s the worst kind of misdirection. It's hiding the larger issue," said Olivas, a proponent of the federal DREAM Act, which would give such students a path to citizenship. Our ruling Terry Gorman, during testimony on the question of whether to let Rhode Island's undocumented high school graduates take advantage of in-state tuition rates, said, "When these students graduate from college, they're still illegal aliens. They cannot get a job." The experts we spoke with said he's generally correct, although they can, in a few cases, be hired as independent contractors. Over all, we rate the claim as True.

pomt-01061	We've seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-deficit-has-decreased-two-thir/	When President Barack Obama reflects on 2014, he brings up a litany of highlights that include drawing down the Afghanistan war and Americans signing up for health insurance thanks to his health care law. Oh, and slicing up the deficit. Obama is super-pumped about that. He made a point to brag about the deficit's drop in his 2015 State of the Union address. "At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits," Obama said. "Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years." Is he right about the deficit dropping by two-thirds? What the White House says As a reminder, don’t get the deficit twisted with the debt. They are only related, not the same. The country’s annual deficit is the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The national debt, which exceeds $18 trillion, is the net of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. To back up his claim, Obama is comparing his first budget year in office -- 2009 -- to 2014. The White House is breaking down the deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and not actual dollars. Economists told us this is a valid way of analyzing the deficit, because it factors in the economy’s change over time. The White House sent us this chart, which relies on data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2009, which started almost four months before Obama's presidency began and ended eight months into it, the deficit was 9.8 percent of GDP. The 2014 shortfall is 2.8 percent of GDP -- a decrease of 71 percent. So that's where the claim comes from. The situation largely tracks if you use real dollars. Using the same comparison with Congressional Budget Office figures, the deficit fell from $1.4 trillion in the 2009 fiscal year to $486 billion in the 2014 fiscal year -- a drop of about 66 percent. Why the drop might not be so exciting Experts told us that while Obama's math may be correct, it's missing some important caveats. First, it's important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 (hence the steady drop). In 2008, the deficit was $458 billion, or 3.1 percent of GDP. Those deficits are smaller than the ones the country is facing today. The 2009 fiscal year represented a huge jump in the deficit, partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy. "This is not to say that that large deficit was his fault, but if one used the 2008 deficit as a frame of reference, the comparison would be quite different," said Alan Auerbach, University of California Berkeley professor of economics and law. Also, some economists we consulted pointed out that the 2009 fiscal year was Obama’s first year in office, and so not necessarily a good starting point since he had little control over the spending in that year. And there's another issue. Princeton University economics professor Harvey Rosen said the more important question is if Obama has put the government on a path that will keep deficits stable. "And the answer is no," Rosen said, because entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, have not had substantial reform. The long-term forecast for the deficit illustrates this point. Absent substantial reform, the Congressional Budget Office expects a few more years of short-term deficit decreases followed by bigger shortfalls in 10 and 20 years. Federal spending is projected to increase through 2039, so much so that by then the federal debt held by the public will reach a point only seen after World War II. The deficit would be equal to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2029 and 6.5 percent of GDP by 2039, a higher deficit than any year between 1947 and 2008. This chart from the Congressional Budget Office shows how the deficit is not expected to continue its downward trend in recent years. A final word on Obama’s point from the experts. The deficit has come down in recent years because of the strengthening economy, which drives tax revenues up, and the draw-down of various economic stimulus programs that were implemented to weather the financial crisis. Additionally, the expiration of 2 percent payroll tax cuts and increases in tax rates for high-income earners played a role, albeit a smaller one. "It’s not clear one would want to view the evolution as relating to fiscal responsibility rather than an improving economy," Auerbach said. Our ruling Obama said since taking office the country has seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds." His claim is accurate if you use 2009, his first year in office with an historically high deficit, as a starting point. The claim ignores a stark reality about the deficits, however. The country’s spending is not expected to continue its downward route, according to federal forecasters, for factors that include increased interest payments on the debt and the lack of substantial policy changes for the country’s biggest programs, like Social Security and Medicare. The deficits have largely come down as a result of the improved economy for which Obama cannot assume full credit. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-04495	Massachusetts schools "are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-massachusetts-schools-are-ranked-/	Republican Mitt Romney declared his love for "great schools" during the first presidential debate. Did he go overboard in calling his home state’s schools the best in all the land? Romney’s comments came in response to a dig from President Barack Obama, who said Romney "doesn’t think we need more teachers" while Obama wants to hire 100,000 for math and science. "Well, first, I love great schools," Romney replied. "Massachusetts, our schools are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own." Many education experts say Romney is right about Massachusetts, which he governed for four years, boasting the nation’s best schools. (We should note that Romney did not say his actions specifically made the state No. 1, so we won't grade him on whether he gets credit or not. ) One prominent Twitter user -- Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat and Obama surrogate -- strongly disagreed with Romney's brag. "Hey, Governor @MittRomney, Maryland schools are #1 and have been for the last four years in a row. #Debates," tweeted O’Malley. Look, no one wants a schoolyard rumble over which state has the best schools. We decided to intervene and analyze Romney’s claim. Bay State students are testing beasts Unfortunately for this check, there’s no clear-cut comparison of school quality by state. Too many states have their own annual assessments, for example, one of many factors making an apples-to-apples comparison pretty unobtainable. Instead, education experts tend to go by one across-the-board measure they can get: the National Assessment of Education Progress, or NAEP, which is an exam administered to a sample of fourth, eighth and twelfth grade students every two years in reading and math. All states and DC have been included since 2003. The NAEP is called "the nation’s report card," and Massachusetts students have long been dominant. That’s not to say Bay State students always outperform their peers on every administration of the exam, said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent, nonpartisan research to inform public education reform in Massachusetts. "But they do score No. 1 on a majority of the assessments," he said, "and taken as a whole, I think it’s fair to say they are among the top performers, if not the top performer." The state’s fourth and eighth graders have scored the highest or tied for first in reading on the NAEP since 2002. Fourth graders have been similarly strong math since 1996, and eighth graders have been the nation’s very best since 2007 after lingering near the top of the pack since 1992. It’s worth pointing out that some groups, such as the National Education Association, do not think "horse race" state rankings based on NAEP scores is a good idea. The group pointed us to a paper by Bert Stoneberg, who directed NAEP at the Idaho Department of Education, that advises against ranking states without factoring in standard error, which would show more ties (our data showed the ties). "This may be one of the reasons that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) specifically does not rank states," NEA spokeswoman Staci Maier said in an email. Other evaluations The state ranks well in other measures, too. Massachusetts placed first in a 2011 analysis of high school students’ performance in physics and calculus. The Daily Beast featured Massachusetts in the top spot in its feature "America’s Smartest Kids," which primarily relied on NAEP scores. And a 2011 Harvard University study determined Massachusetts students perform at levels on par with some of the world’s most educated countries. The state had the country’s highest percentage of students at the advanced level in math (about 15 percent), running with countries like Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands. So Massachusetts students have the highest testing outcomes of the nation. Some experts say it’s debatable whether the school system should get the credit. Massachusetts has a high standard of living, high household incomes and a high-performing university system. Don’t these give their students an inherent advantage over states with more low-income students? It’s unclear. Education experts also link student success with the aggressive education reform law Massachusetts passed in 1993. These reforms established a state accountability system that became the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS. The law also authorized charter schools and provided more money to the poorest school districts. "Massachusetts has a number of factors in place that create a strong foundation for successful schools and high student performance," d'Entremont said. "Over two decades of education reform have taken advantage of that to make sure students are doing well." We should also note that for all of its proficiency in reading and math, Massachusetts has an achievement-gap issue -- one that Romney said narrowed during his single term as governor (Half True). The achievement gap is the disparity in performance between primarily white, middle- and upper-class students, consistently the strongest students, and their black, Latino and low-income peers. While Massachusetts ranks high for low-income and African-American students, its largest minority group -- Latino -- trails other states, most noticeably in eighth grade reading and science. "Despite its high rankings, Massachusetts continues to have achievement gaps that are about as large, and sometimes larger, than the national average," said Blair Mann, a spokeswoman for the Education Trust. "Despite all of its progress, the state still has a long way to go." Another area for improvement: its freshman graduation rate of public high school students. According to the United States Department of Education, seven states beat Massachusetts’ percentage of 83.3 percent in the 2008-2009 academic year. So what about Maryland? So where does all that leave Maryland and their proud governor, Martin O’Malley? Also on top, just by a different measure. Education Week has ranked Maryland as the nation’s overall best state for education for the past four years in Quality Counts, a special annual edition. Massachusetts neared the top In the same four-year period, including a second-place overall finish in 2012. But Maryland had the edge in 2012 in categories such as teaching incentives and allocation, college readiness, early childhood education, and economy and workforce. Massachusetts finished first in more specific categories relating to K-12 achievement and adult outcomes. Our ruling Romney has good reason to say Massachusetts has the nation’s best schools. Although there’s no yardstick comparing the quality of schools by state, by several measures, including test results from a federal standardized test, he is right. His claim would be more airtight if he had said Massachusetts had the best testing outcomes. That said, experts are not unanimous in heralding Massachusetts as the nation’s education leader. Education Week has given the state high marks but given its top distinction to Maryland for the past four years. All considered, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12573	"In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their (gross domestic product) in the form of remittances."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/11/mike-rogers/alabama-lawmaker-makes-half-true-claim-about-remit/	While President Donald Trump maintains that Mexico will pay for a border wall, Republican lawmakers are looking for other ways to help fund the president’s signature campaign promise. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., introduced the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017 to levy a 2 percent fee on money sent by individuals in the United States to recipients in nations "south of the U.S. border," funds known as remittances. "This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall," Rogers said in a March 30 press release. He added some large numbers about remittances to bolster his case. "Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the U.S. to their home countries," Rogers said. "In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances." Remittances serve as a source of income for migrants’ families who generally use the money to pay for housing, food and other living expenses. To an extent, Rogers’ two-fold statement is backed by data. The exception is his point about South America — we could not find any countries on that continent with remittances anywhere near 15 percent of GDP. Money sent to Mexico checks out Rogers’ bill seeks to tax immigrants living in the United States illegally who send money back to their countries, according to a press release from his office. The text of the bill itself does not explicitly address how people here unlawfully could be targeted. Experts have told us that while undocumented immigrants do send remittances, it’s hard to determine how much they send, since U.S. citizens and immigrants living here legally also send money. Mexico receives more money from U.S. residents than does any other nation, by far. Rogers’ statement about remittances sent to Mexico is based on data from the World Bank. The World Bank has for several years estimated the bilateral flow of remittances from its member countries. The latest number is actually higher than what Rogers said. Mexico received more than $25.6 billion in remittances from individuals in the United States in 2015, according to the most recent World Bank estimates. Mexico also topped the list as the country receiving the most remittances from the United States from 2010-15, according to a May 2016 Congressional Research Service report. China came in second and India placed third. Money sent to South and Central American countries Rogers claimed that some South and Central American countries receive more than 15 percent of their gross domestic product, or GDP, in the form of remittances. We asked what countries he had in mind. A spokesperson pointed to Haiti, a poor island in the Caribbean, as well as Honduras and El Salvador in Central America. (The spokesperson added that Rogers' statement was actually based on 2015 data, not 2014.) A country’s GDP is an indicator of the health and size of its economy. Comparing remittances to a country’s GDP can be helpful in understanding the economic effects of foreign labor migration and money sent to residents across countries. In other words, a large remittance total may be less eye-popping when it’s compared to the broader economy — and vice versa. "For example, if I tell you that in 2015, Mexico received $26 billion in remittances and Haiti received $2.2 billion, you might think that remittances are far more important to the Mexican economy than they are to Haiti's," said Roy Germano, a New York University professor who has researched migrants’ remittances. "But the fact is, Mexico's economy is much larger than Haiti's (as is its population)." Remittances to Haiti represent a much greater share of income for the country than they do in Mexico. In 2015, remittances from the United States accounted for more than 15 percent of Haiti’s GDP and about 2.2 percent of Mexico’s GDP. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Small island states or small, impoverished countries are most likely to have shares of remittances at 15 percent or more of GDP, said Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes, professor and chair of the economics department at San Diego State University. Tajikistan, in Central Asia, has depended on remittances since years-long armed conflict in the 1990s claimed more than 100,000 lives, noted the Congressional Research Service’s report. Tajikistan topped a CRS list as the country with the greatest percentage of its 2014 GDP in form of remittances (from all places), at nearly 42 percent. Rogers’ office did not provide any examples of countries from South America with remittances via the United States that amount to more than 15 percent of GDP. We crunched the numbers for South America and found that none came close to 15 percent. Here’s a sample: Percent of Guyana’s GDP in form of remittances? 5.9 percent. Ecuador: 1.02 percent. Colombia: 0.5 percent. Bolivia: 0.4 percent. Brazil: 0.04 percent Venezuela: 0.01 percent (based on 2013 GDP/remittances data) Our ruling Rogers said, "In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances." Based on World Bank estimates, Mexico did receive more than $24 billion in remittances from the United States in 2015 (the year Rogers meant to use). Rogers would have been on safer ground in the second part of his statement had he described nations south of the border more generally. According to the latest data, a couple of countries in Central America — El Salvador and Honduras — received at least 15 percent of their GDP from remittances. Haiti, in the Caribbean, also received at least 15 percent. No country from South America reached that threshold. We rate Rogers' statement Half True.

pomt-05961	"(After the auto bailout) General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/25/barack-obama/Barack-Obama-bailout-GM-number-one/	President Barack Obama used his 2012 State of the Union address to tout the success of the federal auto bailout — not that he called it that. "We got the industry to retool and restructure," he said. "Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker." We wondered: Is an American car manufacturer again ruling the roost? The claim Here's how the president set up his claim: "On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back." The U.S. government did sink billions of dollars into the auto industry through the Troubled Asset Relief Program to keep GM and Chrysler from going under. (Though not Ford, which refused that federal money.) In return, it got an ownership stake in GM, now down to about one-third of the company's common stock. And while the automakers haven't exactly repaid the government in full, as executives claimed this summer, overall, a senior editor at Fortune has calculated that TARP has made taxpayers money. Meanwhile, U.S. automakers' sales, including Ford's, are rising. Who's No. 1 Obama's speech used a statistic reported just days earlier: GM and its partners, by selling 9 million vehicles in 2011, once again became the world's top-selling automaker. (GM automobiles include Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.) The company edged out Toyota, which grabbed the top spot in 2008 as the U.S. economy struggled. Analysts said the turnaround stems from the popularity of its latest vehicles, such as the Chevy Cruze, according to the Washington Post and others. Sales worldwide rose 7.6 percent, an increase of 640,000 more cars and trucks in 2011 from the year before, according to ABC News and the Los Angeles Times. Nearly 4.8 million of the 9 million were sold by Chevrolet. "It is an accomplishment that GM has been able to reverse the tide in the U.S. and Asia, and they are doing very well in emerging markets considering just a few years ago the company was in real challenging straights," said John F. Hoffecker, an auto industry consultant with AlixPartners, told the Los Angeles Times. But there are a few caveats to Obama's claim that the bailout put GM back on top. "Luck is incredibly important — as we've seen for GM these last 12 months," said Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman of auto information site Edmunds.com. "They were really able to benefit from conditions in the marketplace." Consider: • GM's sales number is based on sales by both GM and its joint ventures in China, which aren't wholly owned subsidiaries. That's led Volkswagen, which says it sold 8.2 million vehicles last year, to challenge GM's claim to the top spot. "Rankings are mostly about bragging rights, but there has been a long-running and robust debate over how to account for vehicles sold through affiliates," Reuters reported. "... Some analysts extract those sales from GM's results." • Toyota, which hasn't yet reported results for the full year, had to grapple with an earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand. So GM's main competition saw its production and sales decrease. It predicts its sales are down about 6 percent, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, merely the news that Toyota might experience shortages drove up summer demand for American vehicles, Anwyl said. • GM, in addition to getting TARP funds, also went through bankruptcy in 2009. "Companies typically rebound as they exit bankruptcy," Anwyl said. (Of course, it's important to note that the bankruptcy reorganization was made possible by taxpayer funds.) • Ford, which didn't accept TARP funds, has seen its sales increase 11 percent — without Obama's help to "retool and restructure." (It didn't need the bailout in large part because of good timing — it had raised significant money while money was still easy to get, before the credit crunch created by the economic crisis, Anwyl said.) "I think if we're really being fair about the bailouts ... you almost have to wait another two or three years to see how this plays out," Anwyl said. And it won't be easy next year for GM to hold onto its top spot. Its midsize Cruze, for example, will face competition from recent models from Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota and Volkswagen. "That's a staggering amount of competition," Anwyl said. Our ruling Obama's right that GM's sales, along with sales by its affiliates, were No. 1 in the world in 2011. But getting full credit for those affiliates isn't without controversy. Meanwhile, crediting the bailout with GM's No. 1 spot is a stretch in a year when GM also benefited from challenges faced by its key competition. It's also telling that Ford, which wasn't part of the bailout, also has thriving sales. Obama's claim is partially accurate, but leaves out some important details. We rate it Half True. UPDATE: Thanks to a sharp reader, we've updated this item to reflect that while Ford didn't take any of the $85 billion in TARP money for automakers that went mostly to GM and Chrysler, it did get other federal support, such as $5.9 billion in federal loans in 2009 to retool its vehicles, and a $250 million loan guarantee from the Export-Import Bank of the United States to finance export sales in 2010.

pomt-06497	Says someone earning $50,000 a year will fare better under his "9-9-9" plan than under the current tax system.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/oct/13/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-someone-earning-50000-will-save-u/	The more people learn more about Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain's "9-9-9" plan, the more questions they have. One of the bigger ones is how it would affect poorer Americans. We had the chance to put the question to Cain directly during his recent swing through Florida. "Most people are going to pay less in taxes," Cain, a former pizza chain executive, said Oct. 5, 2011, aboard his campaign bus stopped in St. Petersburg. "Why? Because we're expanding the base." Cain told us he even worked out the math himself. Someone earning $50,000 a year would pay less in taxes under his 9-9-9 than they do under the current system, he said. Under the current system, a person who earns $50,000 a year "pays about $10,000 in taxes," Cain said. "A big part of that is the payroll tax." Cain then walked us through his 9-9-9 plan and said the same person would "still have $2,000 left over." "I can't design a system for people who don't want to pay taxes," Cain added. "I can design a system so they can get a job." Cain made a similar comment Oct. 12, 2011, during an interview with MSNBC's Chuck Todd. "Today under the current system, ($50,000-a-year earners) will pay over $10,000 in taxes, assuming standard deductions and standard exemptions. I've gone through the math. $10,000," Cain said. "Now, with 9-9-9, they're going to pay that ... 9 percent tax on their income, so that's only $4,500. They still have $5,500 left over to apply to the sales tax fees. And if you go and look at what they -- how much of it they would probably spend on sales taxes for new goods -- not used. Used goods, they don't pay a sales tax. They are still going to have money left over." We decided to take Cain's analysis that his plan was better for someone earning $50,000 to a trio of tax accountants. Before we tell you the results of their analysis, here's some background on Cain's plan. 9-9-9, Cain says, is the first step to creating a national flat or "fair" tax. It would replace the current complicated tax system with 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent national sales tax and a 9 percent tax on businesses. Unlike the current system, Cain's plan includes relatively few opportunities for people or businesses to claim deductions or write off expenses. The personal income tax, for example, would include only two potential exemptions -- people could write off donations to charity and tax filers would get a break for living in impoverished inner cities. Cain's national sales tax would be on top of state and local sales taxes. For this fact-check, we'll only be talking about the personal income tax and the sales tax since the business tax directly affects only business owners and corporations. Cain set the parameters for the $50,000 experiment during our interview. For calculating the tax burden under 9-9-9, Cain assumed that the hypothetical tax filer made no charitable deductions and was not eligible for a tax credit by living in an inner city. So Cain's taxpayer paid the full 9 percent income tax on $50,000 -- or $4,500. Cain then assumed every other dollar was spent on something subject to his 9 percent sales tax, meaning his hypothetical taxpayer contributed an additional $4,095 to the federal government. (Cain's 9-9-9 includes no sales tax on used goods.) That's a total tax paid of $8,595 or a tax rate of 17.19 percent. That's the maximum someone would have to contribute under 9-9-9, unless they spent more than they took in on items subject to the sales tax. Presumably they'd pay less if they saved money or spent money on housing, which we assume wouldn't be subject to a sales tax. But again, we're using Cain's figures. To see how that compared to the same earner under the current system, we reached out to three accountants and asked them to run the numbers. For this analysis, we're measuring the income tax and payroll taxes a worker would be asked to contribute. (Payroll taxes vanish under Cain's plan.) Cain's assumption in this scenario, he told us, was that the taxpayer claimed the standard exemption and nothing else. The exercise showed one thing about the current system: It's certainly more complicated than the system Cain is proposing. For a single person, 9-9-9 is a better deal. A single person with no dependents would pay about $10,075 in combined payroll and federal income taxes, $1,480 more than that taxpayer would pay under Cain's 9-9-9. The calculation comes with one caveat: President Barack Obama and Congress temporarily have lowered the payroll tax contribution for employees 2 percentage points, whereas these figures assume the contribution rate is restored to the full 7.65 percent. For someone married with dependents, 9-9-9 is worse. The current tax code treats married couples with children differently -- and better -- than people who are single. With dependents, the family of four will pay about $6,515 in income and payroll taxes and even less, about $4,600, if they qualify for a child income tax credit. So the family of four could end up paying anywhere from about $2,080 to $4,000 more in federal taxes under Cain's 9-9-9. These are broad strokes that can vary based on your personal situation -- as well as other credits workers might be able to claim under the current tax system -- but they're a good rough guide in understanding Cain's plan. The disparity between 9-9-9 and the current tax code grows as a person's income shrinks. A single person who makes $40,000 would still pay about $334 less in federal taxes under 9-9-9. But someone making $30,000 would pay about $212 more under 9-9-9. For families at those income levels, 9-9-9 is even worse, especially when you include potential tax credits and exemptions low-income earners are now getting that they wouldn't under Cain's plan. "It's going to fall very, very heavily on low-income taxpayers to middle-income taxpayers," Andy Hollander, a retired federal tax agent, who studied the 9-9-9 plan for PolitiFact Florida, told us. Yet Jonathan Kraftchick, another accountant who pored over the numbers for us, pointed out that 9-9-9 allows people to control their final tax liability based on their spending. "Households would be much more in control of what their final tax liabilities would be since the sales tax would effectively allow them to increase/decrease their taxes at will," Kraftchick said. None of this addresses another point. Besides what 9-9-9 might mean for you, there's also the question of what it will mean for the federal government -- namely, if it will generate enough revenue to keep the federal government in business. Cain has said the plan is meant to generate the same amount of revenue initially, but he hasn't released enough detailed information for analysts and economists to see if that's correct. That discussion's for another day. Here we're looking at Cain's answer when we asked how his plan would affect poorer Americans. He responded by saying that someone making $50,000 a year, which is about the median income for all U.S. households, would be better off under his plan than the current tax system. We have two major issues with his response. First, we asked about poorer Americans and he picked an income figure of $50,000 a year, which is the median income for U.S. households. There's some cherry-picking there, since the numbers change if you select $40,000 or $30,000. Moreover, while calculating the impacts of 9-9-9 might be simple, comparing them to the current tax system is much more complicated. Cain's assumption holds when you look at single earners, but married couples and people with children making $50,000 a year would likely pay more under 9-9-9 than the current system. We knock the claim down one mark for cherry-picking a figure of $50,000 a year and two more because the claim itself is only half right. To us, that equals a Mostly False.

pomt-10395	Sen. Obama wants to "enact the single largest tax increase since the Second World War."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/11/john-mccain/two-wrongs-dont-make-a-right/	Sen. Barack Obama will be a record-breaking tax hiker, Sen. John McCain alleged on June 10. He was speaking to the National Small Business Summit in Washington, D.C. Both he and Obama would bring change, McCain said. "The question is what kind of change," said the Arizona senator. "Will we go back to the policies of the '60s and '70s that have failed? Or will we go forward? Will we enact the largest single tax increase since the Second World War as my opponent proposes, or will we keep taxes low — low for families and employers?" That echoed a charge he had leveled a couple months earlier against Obama and then-candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton at Carnegie Mellon University. "By allowing many of the current low tax rates to expire, they would impose — overnight — the single largest tax increase since the Second World War," McCain said. This claim is dubious from the get-go. Although tax revenue would go up under Obama's tax plan, one could argue that he's actually proposing a tax cut. Let us explain: President Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 came with what are called "sunsets," or scheduled expiration dates. Bush has asked Congress several times to make the cuts permanent, but Congress has thus far declined to do so. As the law stands today, the cuts will expire by 2011 and taxes will go back up. Obama wants to allow some of the cuts — specifically those on incomes over $250,000 — to expire. But he wants to keep the cuts on lower incomes, and reduce taxes even further on some of the lowest earners. Obama's plan, according to a June 11 analysis by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, would generate $2.7-trillion less over 10 years than the government would collect if it allowed Bush's cuts to expire on schedule. So calling it a tax increase might not be considered fair. There's no disputing that taxes will rise, but the question of who's responsible for that tax increase is another matter entirely. At PolitiFact, we've concluded, as have others, that it's unfair to call Obama's plan a tax increase merely because it doesn't change existing tax law to keep rates low. We think about it this way: The reason taxes will increase is because of tax policy signed into law not by Obama, but by somebody else. Obama's plan doesn't call for raising taxes. "It's not accurate," said Leonard Burman, co-director of the center. "He's actually proposing a tax cut." Still, it's true that tax revenue would go up under Obama's plan. Revenue would be $1.1-trillion more over the next 10 years under Obama's plan than it would be if the government extended Bush's tax cuts. And the effect of Obama's policy on the economy would be that of a tax increase. So let's indulge McCain for a minute, and call it a tax increase. Now — how big an increase would it be? Let's take one particular year, since past tax increases have been measured over one year. And let's pick 2012, since all of Obama's proposed changes to current policy would be phased in by then. The Tax Policy Center — which is a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., that both liberal and conservative economists consider credible — estimated that under Obama's plan tax revenue in 2012 would be $70.2-billion greater than it would be if Bush's tax cuts were extended. That's just an estimate — the Obama campaign hasn't spelled out every detail of its tax plan — but it's the best one available at this point, several experts said. So how does a $70.2-billion increase compare to other tax increases since World War II? The best source for information on the sizes of past tax increases, several economists told us, is a paper by Jerry Tempalski of the U.S. Treasury Department, "Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills," updated in 2006. He said the best way to gauge the size of a tax increase is to compare it to the overall size of the economy, otherwise known as the Gross Domestic Product. The $70.2-billion increase under a President Obama is .40 percent of the projected GDP for 2012 ($17.5-trillion). That would be just the ninth-largest increase since World War II, not the largest. However, there are other ways to measure the size of tax increases. Tempalski said the second-best way is by its size in dollars, adjusted for inflation. He compared the historical increases by putting them in 1992 dollars. Obama's $70.2-billion increase in 2012 would be $40.5-billion in 1992 dollars, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By that measure, it would be the second-largest increase since World War II. The Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968, passed under Lyndon Johnson to reduce a deficit swelled by the Vietnam War, yielded a tax increase of $55.3-billion in 1992 dollars. So based on what is known so far about Obama's plan, it would not be the largest since World War II by either of the two best measures. Moreover, Obama's proposal does not constitute a tax increase in the traditional sense, since taxes would be lower under his plan than they would under current law. We find McCain's statement to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-11T00:00:00	2008-06-10	['Barack_Obama', 'World_War_II']
pomt-02994	40,000 veterans in Texas won’t get health care because Perry rejected Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/17/gilberto-hinojosa/more-veterans-income-qualify-Medicaid-Texas/	Discussing the chances that state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, might run for lieutenant governor, state Democratic chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said she has support among veterans who haven’t been part of his party’s base in the past. "(I)n the state of Texas, especially with Republicans, with Rick Perry refusing to accept the hundred billion dollars in expanded Medicaid, there's 40,000 veterans in the state of Texas that are not going to receive health care as a result of that decision," Hinojosa said in a Sept. 25, 2013, interview on the YNN cable news channel’s "Capital Tonight" show. Gov. Rick Perry told the federal government that Texas would not expand its Medicaid eligibility to cover more low-income residents, a key Obamacare initiative, in a letter July 19, 2012. It’s not clear that federal reimbursements for those new Medicaid enrollees would have reached $100 billion over 10 years; in an April 2013 fact-check, we found a $90 billion estimate wrongly included $11.6 billion that Texas would get whether it expanded Medicaid or not. Since then, Perry has altered his stance: In a Sept. 16, 2013, letter, he directed the state health commission to ask for a lump sum of money (instead of getting federal dollars for each patient) plus the flexibility to use Texas’ own criteria to determine who qualifies. We wondered how Hinojosa concluded that rejecting expansion would deprive 40,000 Texas veterans of health care. Democratic Party spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that Hinojosa’s claim was based on a March 2013 study by the Washington-based Urban Institute that analyzed Census Bureau data to estimate how many U.S. military veterans aged 19 to 64 in the U.S. don’t have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) "According to the analysis," Allison said, "the 48,900 uninsured veterans in Texas whose income is below 138 percent of the federal poverty level could qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies for coverage under the Affordable Care Act if the governor of Texas expands Medicaid." On Aug. 6, 2013, our PolitiFact Georgia colleagues checked a statement based on the same study from the institute, which they said described itself as a nonpartisan research center although its leadership includes several former Clinton administration officials. That PolitiFact story rated as True a claim that by rejecting an expansion of Medicaid under the Obamacare law, Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of health care coverage. Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government, aimed at reimbursing doctors who care for patients in low-income groups such as elderly and disabled people, children and pregnant women. Obamacare included a provision that federal money would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. In Texas, about 1 million adults were on Medicaid in January 2013, according to the website of the state Health and Human Services Commission, which administers Medicaid. Most were eligible because they were pregnant, disabled, older than 65 or raising children on a household income that was below the federal poverty line. If Texas went along with Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion provisions, the state commission’s most recent estimates, from 2012, predict another 341,000 Texas adults would get on Medicaid in 2014 -- reflecting people who earn less than $15,800 a year (for a one-person household) but weren’t already qualified to get Medicaid for another reason. In a May 2012 report, the Urban Institute said 130,000 non-elderly veterans in Texas have no health insurance -- about 8 percent of the state’s veterans and 13.1 percent of its non-elderly veterans. The institute based its estimate on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2009 and 2010 American Community Surveys, adjusted to correct for suspected errors such as high reports of private coverage among low-income families. To describe income groups, the researchers used modified adjusted gross income, the measure that will be used under the Obamacare law. Of those 130,000 non-elderly Texas veterans, the institute’s March 2013 study said, 48,900 earned less than 138 percent of the federal poverty guideline. State health commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman emailed us a lower number: 42,771, based on the 2011 American Community Survey. So it looks like more than 40,000 non-elderly veterans would be eligible, total, if Texas expanded Medicaid to all adults earning less than 138 percent of the poverty guideline. Hinojosa said those veterans "are not going to receive health care." Experts told us, however, that some might already be eligible for Medicaid or for health care through the federal Department of Veterans Affairs. Under Texas’ current Medicaid rules, Goodman said, some of the veterans could be eligible because they are pregnant, have a disability or are raising children on a below-poverty income. "But we don't have a good way to estimate what that number would be," she said. Jennifer Haley, an author of the Urban Institute study, told us by email, "It's definitely the case that some of these veterans are eligible for VA care ... While our data can't tell us which of these uninsured veterans could qualify, many low-income veterans likely would." Nationwide, about 40 percent of veterans get health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its network of VA hospitals, clinics and other facilities, according to a September 2012 report from the Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families at the University of Southern California. According to the VA’s website, its full health care plan is generally available free to veterans who have an injury or condition related to their military combat service, to veterans coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan for the first five years after they return and to veterans below certain income thresholds. Others may qualify for part or all of the services at varying costs. Jessica Jacobsen, a spokeswoman at the VA’s Dallas office, told us that as of August 2013, 665,000 Texas veterans were enrolled in VA care and 440,000 were eligible but unenrolled. Many of those unenrolled, however, could have private or other government coverage, as more than half of veterans nationwide do according to the veterans center report. Among Texas’ low-income veterans, Haley said, "There are a number of factors that could keep these eligible veterans from enrolling" in VA care — lack of information about VA coverage, for example. "It's also possible that some may live too far from VA facilities and they are therefore not convenient options." Our ruling Hinojosa said there are "40,000 veterans in the state of Texas that are not going to receive health care as a result of" the decision to reject expanding Medicaid. Two calculations based on Census data suggest 42,771 or 48,900 uninsured Texas veterans earn less than what would be the poverty threshold for adults qualifying for Medicaid if Texas had embraced that part of the Obamacare law. That’s not the same thing as saying they won’t "receive health care"; in fact, some likely qualify now for Medicaid or VA care, but aren’t signed up.

pomt-04238	Says the initial Portland plastic bag ban represented "only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/20/sam-adams/did-portlands-bag-ban-only-target-modest-portion-s/	Last week, the Portland City Council voted to significantly expand its year-old ban on single-use plastic bags. By October of next year, the ban, which currently targets big-box stores and supermarkets, will affect "all retail establishments and food providers." The initial rule, passed last year, targeted fewer than 200 businesses. The new rule will reach an estimated 5,000 restaurants and retailers, including food carts, farmers markets and corner stores. In a draft ordinance, released by the mayor’s office before the vote, his office outlined some of the council’s findings on the matter. Among them was this interesting bit about the initial ordinance: "Portland City Council adopted Ordinance 184759 as a first step to promote the use of reusable checkout bags. The policy reduced single-use plastic shopping bag consumption, but this initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use." We know, of course, that modest is a somewhat subjective term, but even so, we found its usage odd given that we remember the initial ordinance being touted as a significant victory. We called the mayor’s office and asked: What percentage of single-use plastic bags did the initial ordinance target and what percentage does this new ordinance target? We got this response in an email back from Sam Adams’ spokeswoman Caryn Brooks: So, you’re fact checking the phrase "While Portland’s initial ordinance addresses the large grocery store and pharmacy users of single-use plastic bags, the initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use" that was in our blog post with a focus on the term "modest share." The term "modest share" is referring to the number of outlets required to ban single use bag usage in the original scope, which was 167 outlets. The next two phases will include some 5,000 outlets. Comparatively, we consider 167 outlets modest." Certainly, 167 outlets compared to some 5,000 is modest. But when we read the draft ordinance, we didn’t take this section to be talking about outlets at all -- we read it to be about the share of plastic bags banned. Let’s go back to the statement in the draft ordinance: "(T)his initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use." It’s clearly discussing bag usage -- not the number of outlets. So, we reiterated our interest in any information regarding the way the initial ban affected usage and any projections on how the subsequent ban might. When Brooks got back to us, she said, "It is a number that we do not have access to and was never an element of the policy creation ... "We never set out to reduce a particular percentage, because ultimately even a small percentage is too many. Obviously as you decrease the number of outlets that use plastic bags, the number of bags being used will decrease." When it comes to fact checking for PolitiFact Oregon, the onus is always on the speakers -- in this case, the mayor’s office -- to back up the statements they are making. So, we followed up one last time in a phone call to be absolutely sure the office had no information on the initial reduction in single-use plastic bag usage. Brooks reiterated that we had misread the ordinance -- though she conceded it could have been clearer -- and that it was referring to outlets not usage. She also made the case that the second ordinance was not predicated on how successful the first ordinance was. It was always the intention, she said, to re-evaluate and push the ban further. That is all fine and good, but ultimately we can only work with what is before us. The fact is that in trying to communicate with the public regarding furthering the city’s plastic bag ban, the mayor’s office made it sound as though the initial ban really only took a small chunk of single-use plastic bags out of circulation, even though they have nothing to base such a statement on. (For what it’s worth, we made a call to Joe Gilliam, the president of the Northwest Grocery Association. He didn’t have any hard numbers on the bans either. He said it was probably safe to say that the initial ordinance targeted "a third of the volume --- but again, I caution the numbers.") We understand that the mayor’s office may not have intended to mean plastic bag usage, but it read that way to us -- and likely many others. Words matter. The statement contains an element of truth -- a smaller number of outlets was affected initially -- but the mayor’s office has no facts to back up its assertion that the first ban represented a modest share of bag use. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2012-11-20T16:49:47	2012-11-09	['None']
pomt-01732	Women "own just 1 percent of the world’s land."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/05/oxfam-ireland/do-women-own-1-worlds-land-no/	Women around the world have a hard row to hoe, but do they really own just 1 percent of all the land? That’s the claim in a tweet from Oxfam Ireland. A reader saw Oxfam’s infographic with the stat and asked us to check it. We’ve found similar statements about global poverty to lack a firm grounding in the facts (70 percent of the world’s poor are not women) and that’s the case with this one, too. Sorcha Nic Mhathuna, a spokeswoman for Oxfam Ireland, the national chapter of the worldwide anti-poverty group, said her organization is "reviewing" this factoid. "We are aware that this statistic is the subject of substantive debate," Mhathuna said. Still, Mhathuna could point to some very big organizations that have taken this number as settled fact. In 2012, the World Bank published a report on women, business and the law which said, "UN Women (the United Nations office focused on women’s issues) informs us that "women perform 66 percent of the world’s work, produce 50 percent of the food, but earn 10 percent of the income and own 1 percent of the property." But the source the World Bank cited is a defunct Web page at the United Nations from a UN division that no longer exists. Oxfam Ireland also listed a 2013 joint report from UN Women and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights that said, "it is reported that just 1 percent of the world’s women actually own land." The source for that? A line from a Web page at the International Center for Research on Women, a group based in Washington. That Web page provided no source and when we contacted the center, they directed us to a 2002 brochure from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization that also offered no supporting data. What the (limited) numbers say For all the references back to UN Women, someone forgot to ask the professionals there who know the data. Papa Seck, a statistician in the Research and Data Section at UN Women, said there are no global figures on land ownership. "I can tell you for sure that this is not a valid statistic," Seck said. Agnes Quisumbing, a senior fellow with the International Food Policy and Research Institute, a group focused on pragmatic solutions to hunger and poverty, has pushed back against this stat. In 2013, Quisumbing co-authored an article on gender and land ownership in Africa. Quisumbing and her colleagues noted that measuring land ownership is hardly as simple as it sounds. A woman might have the right to farm a plot of land but not be able to sell it without permission from relatives. Husbands and wives might hold joint title. On top of the need to define what it means to own land, much of the information simply doesn’t exist. Few surveys ask about land ownership at all and those that do often don’t ask about gender. After looking at the best studies they could find, Quisumbing and the others decided that any statement at the global or even regional level would be a "gross oversimplification." That said, using research from eight African countries, they found that women were generally less likely to be landholders, but the range was large. In Mali, women represented about 3 percent, in Ethiopia, about 18 percent and in Cape Verde, 50 percent. The authors underscored a common misinterpretation when looking at gender and ownership: The percentage held by women does not mean that men control the rest. In South Africa’s Natal Province for example, 10 percent of women had their name on an ownership document, but the number for men was 29 percent. The bulk of the land might be owned by the community, the government or some other entity. In March, Cheryl Doss, a development economist at Yale University, used an Oxfam blog to criticize advocates for using the claim that women own a tiny percentage of land. "Women’s land rights are critically important," Doss wrote. "Yet, using unsubstantiated statistics for advocacy is counterproductive. Advocates lose credibility by making claims that are inaccurate and slow down progress towards achieving their goals because without credible data, they also can’t measure changes." Doss offered some statistics that advocates could use. "On average, across 10 countries in Africa, 39 percent of women and 48 percent of men report owning land, including both individual and joint ownership. Only 12 percent of women report owning land individually, while 31 percent of men do so." Broadly speaking, the pattern holds true in Central and South America. Carmen Diana Deere is a professor in the Latin American Studies department at the University of Florida. Looking at who owns which parcel of land, Deere found that in Mexico, women owned about 20 percent of the parcels, men owned 66 percent and 14 percent were held jointly. That was the high water mark for female ownership in Deere’s study. At the other end of the spectrum, in Honduras, women owned 12 percent and men owned about 87 percent, with about 1 percent held jointly. But even in Honduras, the figures refute the Oxfam Ireland claim. Deere said she and others have made this general point since at least 2001. Quisumbing expressed some frustration about Oxfam Ireland’s use of the errant stat. She had brought this up with the American chapter of Oxfam at a meeting in Boston in mid April. "I gave a seminar at Oxfam with a lot of people videoconferenced in and yet these myths prevail," Quisumbing said. The origins of the 1 percent claim As near as anyone can tell, this factoid emerged in 1978. In a 2013 article debunking this myth in The Atlantic, University of Maryland sociologist Philip Cohen, tracked it back to a paper published by the International Labor Organization titled "Women at Work." Cohen reported that the paper’s author said her numbers were "based on some available global data, and others derived by use of fragmentary indicators at the time." Lacking hard data, she made broad assumptions that women earned so much less than men that "it can be assumed that they normally do not have any surplus to invest." In other words, the 1 percent statistic about land was a guess. And it stuck. Our ruling Oxfam Ireland circulated a graphic with the claim that women own 1 percent of the world’s land. The organization cited well-known bodies such as the World Bank and the United Nations, but none of those sources offered hard evidence. In fact, several pointed back to UN Women, and statisticians there reject this figure. The data that do exist suggest that women own much less land than men but the situation varies widely from country to country. Plus, the statistic implies that whatever land women don’t own, men do, and that is hugely incorrect. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03530	"The UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/31/peter-nightingale/university-rhode-island-professor-says-united-king/	The Rhode Island Board of Education voted on May 23, 2013, to authorize its two colleges and the University of Rhode Island to arm their campus police if they so chose. Prior to the vote, as the board and the General Assembly were considering the issue, URI Prof. Peter Nightingale expressed his opposition. In a commentary published May 8 on RIFuture.org, Nightingale wrote that the proposal came out of "little more than violence and fear-enhancing recommendations." He wrote that having armed police can lead, out of fear, to shooting unarmed people. And he drew this comparison: "The UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S." We wanted to know whether he got his facts right. We tried to contact Nightingale, who teaches physics, but he did not return phone messages or e-mails. Anyone who read about the recent knife attack on a British soldier in London, in which the accused assailants were eventually shot by armed police, might immediately question the first part of the statement. So we checked to see what British news accounts, police department information and other documents would show about whether the police in the United Kingdom are unarmed. A BBC News Magazine article, published online in September 2012 and headlined "Why British police don’t have guns," said that "to most inhabitants of the UK -- with the notable exception of Northern Ireland -- it is a normal, unremarkable state of affairs that most front-line officers do not carry guns." Most, the article said. It goes on to say that "each police force has its own firearms unit." Then we found statistics from the Home Office, a government department in the United Kingdom that is responsible for everything from issuing passports, to reducing crime, to dealing with threat of terrorism, indicated that there are "authorized firearms officers" throughout the United Kingdom. In the year ending March 31, 2011, there were 6,653 such officers in England and Wales -- about five percent of the total -- down from 6,979 the previous year. Most but not all the police in Scotland do not regularly carry firearms, according to Police-Information.co.UK, a site for those involved in law enforcement in the United Kingdom. And the number of times armed officers fired their guns in a year in England and Wales, according to the figures reported by the government, can sometimes be counted on one hand. During 2010-2011, police "discharged a conventional firearm in three incidents," a drop from six such incidents in 2009-2010, according to data published by the British Parliament. In the year ending March 31, 2011, the use of armed officers was authorized in 17,209 operations in England and Wales. Of that total, the Metropolitan Police -- known as the Met -- who cover metropolitan London, were authorized to have armed officers in 4,672 operations. The Metropolitan Police, according to its website, has a Specialist Firearm Command, known as SCO19, which "provides firearms-related support to our unarmed colleagues." "When the officers first arrive they will make an immediate assessment. If an armed containment is deemed necessary to isolate an armed suspect from the public, then two of the crew will deploy leaving one to control the incident, calling for further armed support and liaising with the local senior police officer," the Metropolitan Police website states. "All these officers are personally armed with 'Glock' 17 self-loading pistols and two of the officers have access to 'Heckler and Koch' MP5 carbines." And, the Metropolitan Police site adds, the force has specialist firearms officers who "undergo advanced firearms training and are also available 24 hours a day." Next, we looked at the second part: that the United Kingdom firearm fatality rate is 40 times lower per capita than in the United States. Gunpolicy.org, a firearm safety database hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health in Australia and partly co-funded by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, keeps data on gun deaths by nation. In 2011, the rate of gun deaths of all kinds, including suicide, was 10.3 per 100,000 population in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the rate was 0.25 per 100,000. That is indeed 40 times less than the rate in the U.S. So Nightingale’s figure checked out. (The gap is even wider for "gun homicides": in 2011, the United Kingdom’s rate was 0.04 per 100,000 people, 90 times less than the 3.6 per 100,000 in the United States.) Our ruling Peter Nightingale, a University of Rhode Island professor, wrote that "the UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S." It’s true that some police officers in the United Kingdom are armed, but it’s a very small percentage. The vast majority are unarmed. And Nightingale is on target in saying that there are far fewer gun deaths in the United Kingdom than in the United States. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Peter Nightingale	None	None	None	2013-05-31T00:01:00	2013-05-08	['United_States']
pomt-00744	Georgia has had the nation’s busiest Court of Appeals for a decade or more.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/20/charlie-bethel/no-firm-evidence-often-repeated-claim-about-court-/	The 2015 General Assembly session was expected to conclude by midnight April 2, and lawmakers were racing against the clock. Veteran state Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat from Atlanta, was in the well of the chamber, lamenting that lawmakers were being asked on the fly to increase the size of the Georgia Court of Appeals by three judges -- or 25 percent. The one-year cost to taxpayers, with support staff, would be $1.5 million. "I have grave concerns for how we’re doing this business of such great consequences at this late hour. It smacks of packing the court, and it’s not something we should be doing at 11:05 (p.m.) on sine die," he said. Fort was then asked a question that summed up the key point of supporters. "Is it not true that Georgia’s Court of Appeals is the busiest intermediate court of appeals in the country and has been for a decade or more?" Sen. Charlie Bethel, R-Dalton, asked in traditional legislative parlance. The plan to expand the Court of Appeals passed the state Senate late on the 40th and last day of the legislative session, 37-18, as an amendment to a House bill raising judges’ salaries. PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Bethel’s statement for two reasons: Legislators didn’t publicly vet the case for increasing the court from 12 to 15 judges; and the added costs fall to taxpayers. The Georgia Court of Appeals was created in 1906 and has jurisdiction over many types of appeals. Exceptions include murder, divorce, alimony, constitutional questions and election contests, all of which are heard by the state’s highest court, the Georgia Supreme Court. By its own calculations, the Court of Appeals’ caseload increased yearly for 20 years and peaked in 1995. New appeals have been relatively steady in recent years -- 3,260 in 2009, 3,212 in 2010, 3,312 in 2011, 3,464 in 2012, and 3,432 in 2013, the last year for which data is available. So how is it that Georgia is thought to have the nation’s busiest intermediate court of appeals? Arguably the best case for the claim is an apparently unique provision in the Georgia Constitution. It mandates that the state’s two appellate courts -- the Georgia Supreme Court and the Georgia Court of Appeals -- rule on any appeal within two court terms, or in about eight months. Failure to meet that deadline means the prior court ruling in the case stands. Stephen E. Castlen, the clerk of the court of the Court of Appeals, said cases move through the court "in rocket fashion as far as compared to courts of appeals around the country." "It’s intense," Castlen said. "It’s a commonly held belief that we’re the busiest. You hear it talked about at conferences. Every book I’ve read or article will have a line in there somewhere that we’re one of the busiest courts in the country. I can’t imagine it’s not true." William Raftery, an analyst with the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., said he has reviewed the constitutions of all states and, "to my knowledge," concluded that only Georgia places a two-term deadline on its appeals courts. But the center steers clear of labels such as "busiest" court because apples-to-apples comparisons aren’t realistic given that not all state intermediate courts of appeals handle the same types of appeals, have the same volume of cases, have the same number of judges or handle cases in the same way. And even though Georgia is the only state with a constitutional requirement that cases be completed in two terms, other states, such as Maryland, have set case turnaround goals to ensure that appeals move quickly, the center’s data experts said. "The national center would not say X is busier than Y for those reasons," Raftery said. Last year and this year, resolutions were introduced in the state Senate to have a study committee look at the Court of Appeals’ caseload and the possibility of creating three new judgeships. But that proposal became moot when, late last month, Gov. Nathan Deal sent word to House and Senate budget negotiators that there was an extra $45.8 million to spend and 15 items he’d like the money to target. One of those items would allow him to appoint three additional judges to the 12-member Court of Appeals. Judges on the court make about $166,000 a year. Claims about the court’s caseload have persisted since the 1990s. Bethel, an attorney and chairman of the Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor, told PolitiFact he’s been hearing about the Court of Appeals’ caseload and record as the nation’s busiest court since he was in law school in the late 1990s. He emailed us links to newspaper articles, a law review article and an online history of the court, all of which included claims along those lines. For instance, Court of Appeals Judge Herbert E. Phipps was quoted in The Albany Herald in May 2013 saying the court was the nation’s busiest based on caseload per capita. The court’s website doesn’t go quite that far. It says that during the 1990s, the Georgia Court of Appeals was, "on the basis of the number of cases decided by each judge, one of the busiest appellate courts in the country." An analysis, conducted by the state’s Administrative Office of the Courts in 1995, found that the court was the nation’s busiest in 1993 -- based on signed opinions per judge. The Georgia court, which had nine members then, averaged 278 signed opinions per judge that year, and California was second with 137 signed opinions per judge. We found other similar claims even on Wikipedia, but none that said the court is currently the nation’s busiest and has been for a decade or more. Bethel told us he was surprised that there was any question about the court being the busiest. "The judges say it. They don’t say they think it," he said. "They say it definitely." Our ruling. The Georgia Constitution is apparently unique in that it requires the state’s two appellate courts to handle appeals within two terms, or in about eight months. That undoubtedly requires the justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals to work swiftly. And it does a lot to boost the credibility of the often-repeated statement that the court is among the nation’s busiest. But experts say there is no absolute measure out there to compare the court’s workload to that of other courts. That’s a lot of missing context.

pomt-05518	The 2011 Legislature did not cut Texas public school funding.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/apr/12/susan-combs/comptroller-susan-combs-says-state-lawmakers-did-n/	State Comptroller Susan Combs, whose duties include oversight of state finances, delivered a contradictory assessment of how Texas lawmakers treated public schools while writing the state budget in 2011. According to a news story in the Bryan-College Station Eagle, Combs was asked by a local audience member on April 4, 2012, how much the state cut from public education. The story says Combs replied that the state didn't reduce funding, instead adding $2 billion. "It was not less, but it was not as much," Combs said, according to the story, which we learned of from an April 6, 2012, Twitter post by state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin. His accompanying message described Combs’ not less-but not as much statement as the "effort to hide education budget cuts, in 1 sentence." Before gauging Combs’ claim, we tried to pin down what she said. Her spokesman, RJ DeSilva, told us her appearance was not recorded by the comptroller’s office. Separately, when we inquired, Eagle education reporter Cassie Smith sent us her notes from the event, which indicate that Combs said both that school funding was not cut and that there was not as much funding as lawmakers or the state would have spent. According to the notes, an attendee asked: "How much did we actually cut funding from public education?" Combs: "Well, we didn’t actually cut it. I think the number was that we actually put in about $2 billion, if my recollections from what I read, but it was not the amount that they would have spent. So it was not less, but it was not as much. What happened was schools have to take a look at what do we do with staff. What do we do with expenditures? What do we do with various things? I know there’s been a debate about it." Smith’s notes say two local school superintendents then chimed in with how much less they’ll be receiving. Combs: "OK." Then, Smith’s notes say, Combs started talking about community colleges and graduation rates. Confirmed: Combs said that funding to school districts was not cut. And is that correct? DeSilva told us by email that Combs’ claim reflected figures in the Legislative Budget Board’s January 2012 "Fiscal Size-up" report for the current budget period, 2012-13. The report shows lawmakers put about $150 million more in state revenue into public education than was appropriated in 2010-11. Also, DeSilva said, Combs was referring to the decision to defer a $2.3 billion payment otherwise due to school districts in the current budget period to September 2013. DeSilva said Combs’ published comment -- "It was not less, but it was not as much" -- reflected the fact that changes to the state’s school funding formula "meant districts would be entitled to an estimated $4 billion less than they would have been entitled to had school finance formulas remained unchanged... So while" state "funding went up, schools would have received more funding if the formula had not changed," DeSilva said. Our takeaway: Combs says that lawmakers put more state revenue into education, yet changed finance formulas so schools would get $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same and also deferred a regular payment to school districts to the next budget. The latter two points are factually solid, covering territory that we crossed in checking a legislator’s claim about education funding, though the deferred payment strikes us as more indicative of less education aid in the current budget period. However, the $150 million state spending increase relied upon by Combs delivers an incomplete picture of what lawmakers spent. The state’s "general revenue" increase pales in comparison to reductions in other funds appropriated for public education. Notably, $3.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid that legislators used in 2009 to cover some of the state’s tab for basic school aid was not available in 2011. Meanwhile, public education funding from all sources in the 2012-13 state budget decreased $2.8 billion, or 5.6 percent, as the federal stimulus aid went away, according to the 2012 Fiscal Size-up. Results in individual school districts would vary, but an accurate broad answer to the audience member’s question about school funding cuts would be that the schools sustained a legislated reduction in education funding adding up to more than $5 billion through 2012-13, a total that rolls in the $4 billion in reductions of formula-driven aid plus other cuts in targeted programs such as teacher incentive pay, dropout prevention funding and zeroed-out grants to the pre-Kindergarten Early Start program. Our ruling Lawmakers cut public school aid, mainly by changing an established funding formula and reducing aid to targeted programs. To say otherwise is inaccurate, misleading and by a wide margin ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Susan Combs	None	None	None	2012-04-12T11:30:00	2012-04-04	['Texas']

pomt-14038	Only 50 percent of students from Milwaukee public high schools "go on to a two-or four-year college."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/27/vicki-martin/it-true-only-half-milwaukee-public-schools-student/	What is behind the "skills gap" that business and civic leaders often say inhibits economic progress in the Milwaukee metropolitan area? Milwaukee Area Technical College President Vicki Martin points to a low percentage of Milwaukee public high school students going on to college as one factor. Martin spoke May 12, 2016 on a WisPolitics panel about narrowing the skills gap, along with Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce President Tim Sheehy. Kleefisch first described the skills gap saying, "the folks that employers are seeking don’t necessarily represent the skill sets that those job seekers actually have." Then Martin picked up the mic -- and the theme. "So contributing to that gap, or the mismatch as you outlined, is the fact that we have a lot of folks not even going into the college environment," Martin said. "We found out in our community, for example, in Milwaukee high schools only 50 percent were going on to two- or four-year institutions." There are multiple high school options in Milwaukee, when you factor in choice and charter schools. But Martin was focusing on Milwaukee Public Schools, so we will as well. Is it true that half of all those who complete MPS enroll in a two- or four-year college program? We decided to check it out. The numbers When we asked Martin for backup on the claim, her team sent us to the Department of Public Instruction’s WISEdash database. The database matches information on those who complete high school with college-level enrollment figures from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, a nonprofit group that tracks students and provides data to local governments and other entities. The center collects enrollment data from more than 3,300 institutions across the nation that account for 96 percent of all students in two- and four-year college programs. The most recent data is for students who completed high school at the end of the 2013-’14 academic year. In fall of that year, some 37.7 percent of MPS completers -- a category that includes, for instance, those who get a G.E.D. -- enrolled in a two- or four-year program. Another 12.6 percent enrolled at a later date. That puts enrollment in college at just above 50 percent for the group. In comparison, 66.3 percent of high school completers statewide enrolled in a two- or four-year program. Over time, of course, students from each group continue to begin college programs, so the percentage keeps growing. For instance, for students who completed MPS in 2012, the percentage is now 59.6 percent. To be sure, the data has its limits. The National Clearinghouse Research Center only tracks students after completing high school -- so those who don’t finish high school aren’t included. In MPS, about 60 percent of all students complete high school in four years and 70 percent finish in six. That means fewer than half of all students who attended MPS wind up enrolling in an institution of higher learning. Here’s a rough calculation to account for students who did not complete high school. For the 2014 cohort, 60.9 percent finished high school on time from MPS. Of those, just about half have enrolled in additional education. So, of all students in that group, about 30 percent have gone on to higher learning. So, from that perspective, Martin’s statement actually overstates the number. In other words, the challenge of closing the skills gap is even bigger than she presented. Our rating Martin said only 50 percent of students from Milwaukee public high schools "go on to a two- or four-year college." Data backs her claim, though the method used dramatically understates how few students actually pursue higher education given the low graduation rate in MPS. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate Martin’s claim Mostly True.	None	Vicki Martin	None	None	None	2016-05-27T10:30:00	2016-05-12	['Milwaukee']

pomt-01080	"Georgia is now the eighth most populous state in the nation, moving from the number 10 position in just four years."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/16/nathan-deal/little-numbers-right-point/	Size matters. That was the implication in a recent round of news stories, touting Florida surpassing New York as the third most populous state. Overlooked in most coverage was Georgia’s move up, something Gov. Nathan Deal tried to rectify in his State of the State speech on Wednesday. "Georgia is now the eighth most populous state in the nation, moving from the number 10 position in just four years," Deal said. Political junkies know that with more people comes, at the very least, more Congressional seats. Or, as Deal would have it, evidence that a state is creating jobs and drawing top talent from around the nation. But looking at just the data, is Deal right on the numbers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. The question of population falls to the U.S. Census Bureau, which in addition to conducting the decennial count that determines Congressional representation also releases annual population estimates for each state. The latest, pegged to July 1, estimated that 10,097,343 live in Georgia. That’s an increase of 102,584 from 2013, or a little bit larger than the city of Sandy Springs. It’s the first time Georgia reached the milestone of 10 million residents, and it puts the Peach State in 8th place among all states. That means Deal is right on the first part of his statement. But he’s off when comparing to four years ago, and the numbers from the 2010 Census. Way back when Betty White was a mere 88 years old, and "The Walking Dead" first showed what could happen to Georgia in a zombie apocalypse, the state had 9,687,653 people, Census data show. That put Georgia in ninth place in terms of population, just behind Michigan but one slot ahead of neighboring North Carolina. But what about Deal’s bigger point, that our growth is a signal of greater economic development? There, the same data can back him up. The 2014 Census data makes it look as if North Carolina surpassed Michigan in the latest counts. It did – but Georgia surged past Michigan first, said Robert Bernstein, a spokesman with the agency. "You’ll see it occasionally that a state will surpass another," Bernstein said. "What’s significant here is Michigan was leapfrogged twice, by both Georgia and North Carolina." Part of that shift is undoubtedly for jobs. The recent announcement that Mercedes-Benz USA will move its headquarters to metro Atlanta does not take people from Michigan, long the home to the nation’s auto industry. But it is another example of the gradual creation of the Southeast as the industry’s new hub. Chris Carr, the commissioner of Georgia’s Department of Economic Development, said Georgia had earlier lost out to Alabama for Mercedes’ new manufacturing plant. But the state left a good enough impression for the firm to consider it for its new headquarters, in part because Georgia’s growth is good for customers and workers alike, he said. "When companies are looking for a place to go, they need the right business climate but they want to make sure they are taking care of their employees and have a great place to live, too," Carr said. "There is a psychological impact that we are growing, that shows people there is a reason to be here," Carr said. That was the point Deal was trying to make, when he claimed Georgia is now the 8th most populous state and moved up two spots in just four years. The governor was off on the state’s ranking four years ago. We only moved up one spot. But he is right about where the state’s population is now – and how that population can tie to jobs.

pomt-12265	"There are so many data that demonstrate that poor people, surprisingly, are less likely to use drugs than people with means."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/07/gwen-moore/are-poor-people-less-likely-use-drugs/	Attending the People’s Summit, a three-day gathering in Chicago for organizations committed to social, racial and economic justice, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore spoke with the Real News Network, a nonprofit group that says it reports with "ordinary people’s interests in mind." The topic was poverty. Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat and former welfare recipient, blasted Republicans. Then she made a claim about poor people and drug use that we want to check. In the video interview, which went online June 19, 2017, she said: The Republicans have done a very good job of driving poor people into the underground, making people feel ashamed and guilty and feeling that they have some character flaws, based on their poverty. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, is from my state -- as chairman of the Budget Committee; every year he was the chairman of the Budget Committee, I served on that committee. And so when he would roll out his pathways out of poverty initiatives -- this last time, he did it in front of a drug house. What is the equivalent between being poor and being a drug addict? None. There are so many data that demonstrate that poor people, surprisingly, are less likely to use drugs than people with means. I mean, they don't have money. They can’t afford it. Moore’s office did not respond to our call and emails asking for information to back her statement that poor people are less likely to use drugs. But the latest federal survey on the subject indicates the opposite of what she said. The research We posed Moore’s claim to the federal government’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, which cited the government’s latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health, done in 2015. Individuals age 12 and older were asked in in-person interviews in their homes if they had used illicit drugs in the past month. A spokeswoman for the institute told us that staff members used data obtained from the survey and found that a higher proportion of persons living in poverty used illicit drugs compared to persons with incomes at higher levels. Living in poverty Income up to 2 times the federal poverty threshold Income more than 3 times the federal poverty threshold Used any illicit drug in the past month 12.96% 11.4% 8.94% We also posed Moore’s claim to the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Institute for Research on Poverty. A staff member pointed us to studies that looked at employment and education, not income. But the results trended the same way. Among adults aged 18 or older, the rate of illicit drug use in the past month was higher among the unemployed (18.2 percent) than for those who were employed full time (9.1 percent) or part time (13.7 percent). That’s according to the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The same federal survey found that illicit drug use was higher among people who had not graduated from high school (11.8 percent) than high school graduates with no further education (9.9 percent), those with some college education (10.8 percent) and college graduates (6.7 percent). A footnote: Harold Pollack, a social service administration professor at the University of Chicago whose research specialties include poverty, told us about Moore’s claim: "I think that's a nuanced question," he said. "The data are much stronger that rich people are less likely to be punished for whatever drug use they engage in than that rich people use drugs more." Our rating Moore said: "There are so many data that demonstrate that poor people, surprisingly, are less likely to use drugs than people with means." The latest federal survey found that a higher percentage of people in poverty had used illicit drugs in the past month than people at higher income levels. Moore didn’t respond to our requests for information to back her statement. If other evidence available when Moore made her statement surfaces, we will revisit this item. In the meantime, we rate her statement False.	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2017-07-07T05:00:00	2017-06-19	['None']

pomt-11425	Says Democratic obstruction is the reason why "many important positions in government are unfilled."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/16/donald-trump/why-trump-appointments-have-lagged-behind-other-pr/	President Donald Trump has long blamed Democrats for moving his nominees through the Senate confirmation process at a sluggish pace. "Hundreds of good people, including very important ambassadors and judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate," Trump tweeted March 14. "Many important positions in government are unfilled because of this obstruction." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We ran the numbers, and Trump is certainly right on one count: Important government posts are empty. But allocating blame is more complicated than Trump suggests. Democrats bear some responsibility, but so do Senate Republicans and the Trump White House. By the numbers Compared with recent presidents, Trump has had the fewest nominees confirmed to date, according to the White House. Trump has also had the smallest percent of nominees confirmed by the Senate at this point in his presidency, relative to recent predecessors. Only 57 percent of Trump’s nominees have been confirmed, below that of Presidents Barack Obama (67 percent), George W. Bush (78 percent), Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush (each with 81 percent). See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that tracks political appointees, also found that Trump has seen fewer confirmations than recent presidents at this point. At an average rate of 81 days per confirmation, Trump’s nominees have also experienced significantly more lag time than those appointed by recent presidents. Of the roughly 1,200 positions that require Senate confirmation, the Partnership for Public Service has identified 640 "key positions" (excluding judicial and military appointments). Its latest data shows 144 key Trump nominees currently await Senate confirmation. So key government positions are unfilled. But who deserves the blame? Procedural combat Historically, senators routinely confirmed lower-level presidential nominees without much fanfare. But more recently, the Senate confirmation process has become a partisan battleground. In 2013, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed a measure to weaken Republicans’ ability to filibuster Obama’s nominees. Republicans responded with procedural combat. Now Democrats have answered in kind, putting even non-controversial nominees through the procedural gamut. Under the 2013 rule change, the number of votes required to break a filibuster of presidential nominees — through a process called cloture — was lowered from 60 to a simple majority of 51. But minority parties adopted new tactics. For instance, once the majority party breaks a filibuster through cloture, the minority party is allowed 30 additional hours of post-cloture debate — a procedural maneuver Democrats can use to drain the clock and bog down the confirmation process. "Floor time is the most precious commodity in the Senate and majority leaders are loath to lose time on nominations unless they are critical," said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. "The majority party must now triage its nominations by prioritizing which ones are worth spending the time on." According to the White House, Democrats have forced 78 cloture votes on Trump’s nominees. But experts stressed that not all Democratic obstruction should be viewed as simple partisan warfare. Legitimate concerns have surrounded some Trump nominees’ qualifications. They also noted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., could keep the Senate in session for more hours in order to mitigate the Democrats’ use of the cloture process. Democrat, Republican ‘holds’ Another procedural hurdle facing Trump nominees is the Senate "hold." The Senate generally operates on the principle of unanimous consent, so a single senator may seek to hold up an executive nominee by withholding consent. Ultimately, the decision to honor a hold request is up to the majority leader. Senate leaders typically grant these requests because to deny a hold creates alternative avenues for the senator to expend scarce floor time, according to the Congressional Research Service. Not surprisingly, Democrats have made use of this tactic. But Republican senators have also issued a significant number of holds as a way to extract concessions on various policy issues. (It’s difficult to make a systematic tally of which party is behind these delays because senators are not always required to publicly disclose holds.) One analysis found that of the eight published objections in 2017, four came from Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa. More intraparty holds have been placed in recent months, Politico reported in February, with at least 11 Republican senators publicly blocking nominees for the Energy, State and Justice departments, among other agencies. David Lewis, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, pointed to the example of Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who has held up Justice Department nominees over differences with the Trump administration on marijuana policy. "It is certainly true that Democrats have used their institutional prerogatives to slow things down," Lewis said. "That said, Republicans have as well." White House role Ultimately, Trump shares the blame for the slimmed down federal workforce, experts said. As a starting point, it’s fair to ask how committed Trump is to staffing the government. The Partnership for Public Service, which tracks political appointees, notes that more than 200 key positions don’t even have nominees. Trump himself has suggested an understaffed bureaucracy might be more of a feature rather than a defect of his administration. He told Forbes in an October 2017 interview: "I'm generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be — because you don't need them," he says. "I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and it's totally unnecessary. They have hundreds of thousands of people." Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas, said whether Trump wants to fill out his ranks is a central question. "Trump doesn't necessarily believe in government, hence less pressure to fill slots," Loomis said. Yet even Trump’s good faith efforts to make executive appointments have been poorly managed, experts said. "He was slow out of the gate, and his vetting was poor due to poor planning and a poorly run Office of Presidential Personnel," Lewis said. "The president’s missteps early meant that he was always going to play catch up." Trump did nothing to smooth the process by alienating Democrats early on, Ostrander said. "One of Trump’s first acts as president was to ignore Democratic Party input and push through several controversial cabinet nominees as well as (Neil) Gorsuch for the Supreme Court," Ostrander said. "While President Trump broke no rules in doing so, these actions made Democrats in the Senate far less interested in working with the administration on future nominations." Experts noted that some of the delay is the result of legitimate concerns about Trump nominee qualifications and conflicts of interest, which has led to heightened scrutiny. "If the president were nominating persons with impeccable credentials, no conflicts of interest, and broad support, there would be not concerns about delays," Lewis said. "Instead, the president is choosing non-traditional nominees with complex financial holdings and often less expertise than they need." While Trump generally earned poor marks for his approach to bureaucratic nominations, his staffing of federal courts tells another story entirely. In this area, Trump has been energetic. Trump appointed more circuit court judges in his first year than any president in history, and ranked sixth overall in first-year federal judge appointments (trial court, appeals court and Supreme Court combined). Experts attributed this to better coordination between the White House and Senate on judges than executive appointments. Some suggested Republicans have simply made judicial appointments a higher priority. "I believe that Trump and his allies in the Senate have made the (correct) calculation that judicial nominations are simply worth more in the long run," Ostrander said. Our ruling Trump said Democratic obstruction is the reason why "many important positions in government are unfilled." There’s a lot of blame to go around for the federal government’s relatively modest headcount. Senate Democrats, adopting the upper chamber’s new norms, have engaged in procedural combat. Yet Senate Republicans have also held up Trump’s nominees to extract concessions. Finally, the Trump White House earns generally low marks for its approach to executive appointments.

pomt-10145	"John McCain voted against funding the troops because of . . . a timeline in it to draw down American troops."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/06/joe-biden/mccain-opposed-2007-war-funding-bill/	UPDATED: We updated this item on Oct. 6 and changed the ruling to True. See explanation at end. During an exchange with Sarah Palin in the St. Louis vice presidential debate on Oct. 2, 2008, Joe Biden tried to rebut a charge that Barack Obama had failed to "fund the troops" in Iraq by saying John McCain had done the same thing on a different bill. Palin began the exchange by saying that "Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so. And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that. You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that. He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops." Biden replied that Obama had offered a withdrawal plan that would shift responsibility to the Iraqis over the next 16 months and would draw down U.S. combat troops. As for the allegation about failing to fund the troops, Biden said, "John McCain voted the exact same way. John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops. And John said I'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there's a timeline." Republicans candidates have charged that Obama "failed to fund the troops" because of his May 24, 2007, vote against an appropriations bill that included funding for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. (It passed, 80-14.) We addressed that charge in this item and found it was misleading to say Obama did not want to fund the troops. We noted that Obama's primary reason was that the bill lacked a timetable for withdrawal. “We must fund our troops," he said at the time. "But we owe them something more. We owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war. ... We must negotiate a better plan that funds our troops, signals to the Iraqis that it is time for them to act and that begins to bring our brave servicemen and women home safely and responsibly.” Biden's rebuttal in the vice presidential debate seems to be a reference to a war spending bill that first passed the Senate in March 2007. When Biden refers to an "amendment," we believe he was referring to the provision that would require a withdrawal of troops. And Biden is correct that McCain voted against the bill when it included that requirement. The bill, H.R. 1591 , included $97 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and set a goal to withdraw most U.S. troops in Iraq by 2008. It passed 51-47 but was opposed by most Republicans because of its timetable for withdrawal. McCain said he opposed the bill because it had been loaded with political pork and because it required a withdrawal regardless of conditions in Iraq. "Such a mandate would have grave consequences for the future of Iraq, the stability of the Middle East and the security of Americans at home and abroad. For these reasons, I do not support this bill," McCain said at the time. (The bill passed but was vetoed by President Bush.) Biden is right that McCain opposed a war spending bill. We find Biden's statement True. UPDATE: We originally rated Biden's statement Half True because, although McCain had issued a statement opposing the bill, he missed the vote on the bill on April 26, 2007.

pomt-06008	The U.S. military is at risk of losing its "military superiority" because "our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-navy-smallest-1917-air-force-s/	During the Jan. 16, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney took aim at President Barack Obama’s support for the U.S. military. "The most extraordinary thing that's happened with this military authorization is the president is planning on cutting $1 trillion out of military spending," Romney said. "Our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947. We are cutting our number of troops. We are not giving the veterans the care they deserve. We simply cannot continue to cut our Department of Defense budget if we are going to remain the hope of the Earth. And I will fight to make sure America retains military superiority." This comment includes a lot of separate claims, but after a number of readers contacted us, we decided to focus on two of them: "Our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917," and, "Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947." His underlying point: The U.S. military has been seriously weakened compared to what it was 50 and 100 years ago. We’ll look at both the numbers as well as the larger context. But as you'll see below, using the number of military ships and airplanes is an outdated practice that one expert says "doesn't pass 'the giggle test.' " The Navy numbers The Romney campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found their likely sourcing when we contacted the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. In January 2010, Heritage published a report titled, "The State of the U.S. Military." Citing data from the Naval History and Heritage Command, a part of the Defense Department, the report said that "the U.S. Navy’s fleet today contains the smallest number of ships since 1916. The total number of active ships in the Navy declined from 592 to 283 between 1989 and 2009." We looked up the original data, and the Heritage report does reflect the trend line correctly (though Romney said 1917 rather than 1916, something we won’t quibble with). In 1916, the U.S. Navy had 245 active ships, a number that eventually peaked during World War II, then fell, then peaked again more modestly during the Korean War, followed by a slow, consistent decline over the next five decades. In recent years, the number of active ships has fallen low enough to approach its 1916 level. In both 2009 (the most recent year of the Heritage report) and 2011, the number was 285. So Romney has a point. However, even using this metric -- which, as we’ll argue later, is an imperfect one for measuring military strength -- this is not the lowest level since 1916. The same data set shows that during the years 2005 to 2008, the number of active ships was 282, 281, 278 and 282, respectively -- each of which were below the levels of 2009, 2010 and 2011. In other words, each of the final four years under George W. Bush saw lower levels of active ships than any of the three years under Obama. The number of surface warships also bottomed out in 2005 under Bush, later rising by about 10 percent under Obama. Such figures undercut Romney’s use of the statistic as a weapon against Obama. The Air Force numbers How about the Air Force? First, let’s look at the total number of aircraft. We found extensive data in a report titled, "Arsenal of Airpower: USAF Aircraft Inventory, 1950-2009," authored by retired Air Force Col. James C. Ruehrmund Jr. and Christopher J. Bowie and published in November 2010 by the Mitchell Institute, a research and analysis organization founded by the Air Force Association. The figures for 2009 show 5,988 total aircraft (4,460 active, 375 reserve and 1,153 in the Air National Guard). That’s a lower number than any year going back at least to 1950, the earliest year tallied in the report. So while we don’t have data going back to 1947, the specific year Romney cited, his claim about the size of the Air Force seems credible. (Figure 2 on page 5 of the Mitchell Institute report provides a good graphical representation of the numerical patterns over time.) Now, let’s look at the age of the Air Force’s assets. The Heritage report includes a chart titled, "The Oldest Air Force in U.S. History," referencing an October 2005 Government Accountability Office report, "DOD Needs to Identify and Address Gaps and Potential Risks in Program Strategies and Funding Priorities for Selected Equipment." We couldn’t find specific support in the GAO report for the claim that the Air Force of today (or, to be precise, the Air Force of 2005 when Bush was president) was the oldest since 1947. However, the report, combined with the analysis of experts we asked, suggest that it’s a fair conclusion. The GAO looked at 30 pieces of equipment from various branches (not just the Air Force) and found that "reported readiness rates declined between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 for most of these items. The decline in readiness, which occurred more markedly in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, generally resulted from (1) the continued high use of equipment to support current operations and (2) maintenance issues caused by the advancing ages and complexity of the systems." Charles Morrison, a researcher at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the U.S. "bought more aircraft in the early 1950s than in all the years combined from 1956 to 2011, clearly at the cost of an older fleet." So let’s sum up so far. On the number of naval ships, Romney is close, except that he overlooked the four years of lower numbers under Bush. Meanwhile, he’s correct on the number of aircraft and is most likely correct on the age of aircraft. Adding some context But what do those numbers mean? Not much, a variety of experts told us. Counting the number of ships or aircraft is not a good measurement of defense strength because their capabilities have increased dramatically in recent decades. Romney’s comparison "doesn’t pass ‘the giggle test,’ " said William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia. Consider what types of naval ships were used in 1916 and 2011. The types of ships active in both years, such as cruisers and destroyers, are outfitted today with far more advanced technology than what was available during World War I. More importantly, the U.S. Navy has 11 aircraft carriers (plus the jets to launch from them), 31 amphibious ships, 14 submarines capable of launching nuclear ballistic missiles and four specialized submarines for launching Cruise missiles -- all categories of vessels that didn't exist in 1916. As for the Air Force, many U.S. planes may be old, but they "have been modernized with amazing sensors and munitions even when the airframes themselves haven’t been," said Michael O’Hanlon, a scholar at the Brookings Institution. Human factors matter, too. "The vast superiority of the U.S. Air Force has little to do with number of planes, but with vastly superior training, in-flight coordination and control, as well as precision targeting and superior missiles," said Charles Knight, co-director of the Project on Defense Alternatives at the Massachusetts-based Commonwealth Institute. Ruehrmund and Bowie write in their report that "although the overall force level is lower, the capabilities of the current force in almost all respects far exceed that of the huge Air Force of the 1950s. Today’s Air Force can maintain surveillance of the planet with space and air-breathing systems; strike with precision any point on the globe within hours; deploy air power and joint forces with unprecedented speed and agility; and provide high-bandwidth secure communications and navigation assistance to the entire joint force." Increasingly crucial today are pilotless aerial vehicles, some of which are more commonly known as drones. "The Air Force now buys more unmanned than manned aircraft every year, and that trend is not going to change," said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University. "Within our lifetime, I think you’ll see an end to manned combat aircraft, because unmanned planes are more capable and a lot cheaper." For a sense of comparison, in 1947, "it took dozens of planes and literally hundreds of bombs to destroy a single target because they were so inaccurate," said Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "But thanks to smart bombs and stealthy aircraft, today it only takes a single plane and often a single bomb to destroy a target." Or as John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org, puts it: "Would anyone care to trade today's Navy or Air Force for either service at any point in the 20th century?" There’s also another problem with Romney’s claim. He appears to be throwing blame on Obama, which is problematic because military buildups and draw-downs these days take years to run their course. Just look at the long, slow declines in the number of ships and aircraft. These are not turn-on-a-dime events that can be pegged to one president. "Ships are so expensive that they have to be built over long periods of time, and at a pace that accounts for the retirement from service of other ships as well," Janda said. "We also have to space the building out over long periods of time to keep our major shipyards working at a rate that’s sustainable over several decades, because you can’t let them go under and then try to reform them in time of war. So Congress and the president make decisions each year regarding the needs of the Navy that do not come to fruition for decades, making it ridiculous to give blame or praise to the president for the current situation." All this said, there are lots of serious issues facing the military that Obama, or whoever defeats him in 2012, will have to address. One is the age of the Air Force’s assets, which is probably Romney’s strongest point. And despite the technological advantages of today’s military, there are limitations to having a smaller number of ships and aircraft. For instance, both branches, and especially the Navy, have to be able to position enough assets around the world where they are needed. And having a "small but sophisticated military is also risky," said Thomas Bruscino, a professor at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. "If the Navy loses one carrier to enemy action, for any reason, that loss would be catastrophic in a way such a loss would not have been in the past," Bruscino said. "Likewise, the Air Force cannot afford to lose even small numbers of the highly sophisticated airframes of today." Still, most experts we spoke to felt that Romney’s critique was misguided. Knight went so far as to offer this reply: "If Mr. Romney wants a truly stark example of diminished military capability, he should compare today’s horse cavalry to that in 1917, or even 1941 when there were still 15 active horse-cavalry regiments in the Army. Today there has been total disarmament of horse cavalry,’ he might say, ‘leaving our nation defenseless in this regard.’ His chosen comparisons are almost as absurd." Our ruling This is a great example of a politician using more or less accurate statistics to make a meaningless claim. Judging by the numbers alone, Romney was close to accurate. In recent years, the number of Navy and Air Force assets has sunk to levels not seen in decades, although the number of ships has risen slightly under Obama. However, a wide range of experts told us it’s wrong to assume that a decline in the number of ships or aircraft automatically means a weaker military. Quite the contrary: The United States is the world’s unquestioned military leader today, not just because of the number of ships and aircraft in its arsenal but also because each is stocked with top-of-the-line technology and highly trained personnel. Thanks to the development of everything from nuclear weapons to drones, comparing today’s military to that of 60 to 100 years ago presents an egregious comparison of apples and oranges. Today’s military and political leaders face real challenges in determining the right mix of assets to deal with current and future threats, but Romney’s glib suggestion that today’s military posture is in any way similar to that of its predecessors in 1917 or 1947 is preposterous. In addition, Romney appears to be using the statistic as a critique of the current administration, while experts tell us that both draw-downs and buildups of military equipment occur over long periods of time and can't be pegged to one president. Put it all together and you have a statement that, despite being close to accurate in its numbers, uses those numbers in service of a ridiculous point. Pants on Fire.

pomt-00117	A "man surpasses Tesla by inventing an electric car that never needs charging."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/29/blog-posting/zimbabwean-inventor-did-not-create-electric-car-ne/	A false story about a Zimbabwean inventor defying the laws of physics with an electric car that never needs to be recharged is re-circulating on social media. The initial blog post was published in April 2018 on the conspiracy-fueled website Disclose.tv. It popped up again this month on Facebook and has been shared more than 25,000 times, according to CrowdTangle data. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The man who supposedly invented this vehicle, Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso, first appeared in headlines in the corners of the internet in 2015. At the time, his company, Saith Technologies, held an "Open Day" where he debuted his inventions and products, according to Zimbabwean technology news site Techzim. The Zimbabwean news channel SABC Digital News also covered the event. All of the images on Saith’s Facebook and Twitter pages are from that event, as are all of the pictures of the inventions the company claims to have created. Neither account has been active since mid-2015. The Saith Technologies website appears to have been taken down. Chikumbutso claimed that his car runs on "5 normal gel batteries." According to an archived version of the Saith website, a secret substance is exposed to radio wavelengths, which give the car’s "power generator" the "capacity to funnel the power generated into functional electrical energy" and never require a recharge. Following the "Open Day" event, Techzim questioned the legitimacy of Saith Technologies products. It did not report on the company again. Techzim noted that Chikumbutso’s car was outside of the law of conservation of energy because it somehow converted 220 volt-producing gel batteries into a much higher output of 500,000 watts. "We are not sure how this assertion can be dispelled and we hope at some forum scientist [sic] will put the claims to test," the article read. The disclose.tv article says that the U.S. government "recently" relocated Chikumbutso to California to work on his inventions and that it might be to "control this type of invention." There is no evidence that this happened. Our ruling Three years ago, a man at a one-day event touted "inventions," including a car that defies the laws of physics. Since 2015, his story has only found a home on false news blogs and conspiracy sites. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-10-29T09:49:25	2018-04-26	['None']

pomt-00105	Says he didn't cancel a political rally because after Sept. 11, "the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-nyse-opened-day-after-911-it-did/	On the day a gunman killed 11 and wounded six others in a Pittsburgh synagogue, President Donald Trump twice defended his decision to hold a scheduled campaign rally by pointing to a rapid reopening of the New York Stock Exchange after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It did not happen the way he described. Trump first mentioned this rationale in an Oct. 27 address to the Future Farmers of America conference in Indianapolis: "I remember when we had the attack in Manhattan. We opened that stock exchange the next day; people were shocked. A great group of people — the head of the New York Stock Exchange is just a fantastic guy — Dick (Grasso). And he opened it up." Later that day, Trump kept his promise to hold a rally in Murphysboro, Ill. He repeated the anecdote in that address: "With what happened early today, that horrible, horrible attack in Pittsburgh, I was saying maybe I should cancel both this and that (the speech in Indianapolis). And then I said to myself, I remember Dick Grasso, a friend of mine, great guy. He headed up the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 11. And the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day. He said — and what they had to do to open it, you wouldn't believe. We won't even talk to you about it, but he got that exchange open. We can't make these sick, demented, evil people important." Here’s what really happened. The New York Stock Exchange didn’t open on the morning of the attacks, which hit the World Trade Center a few blocks away. The exchange building wasn't directly damaged, the Associated Press reported at the time, but "the surrounding neighborhood was littered with debris." The stock exchange didn’t open again until Sept. 17, 2001. Even a week after the attacks, conditions were hardly normal. At that point "rescue workers continued to search for survivors amid smoldering rubble," the AP reported, and "the smell of smoke still (hung) in the air — even permeating the NYSE trading floor." Trump does accurately remember Grasso’s involvement. As he rang the opening bell on Sept. 17, Grasso said, "Today, America goes back to business. We do it as a signal to those criminals who inflicted this heinous crime on America and all Americans, they have lost." According to the New York Times, "traders took subways instead of limousines, trudged on foot from the Staten Island Ferry, and began lining up at 7:30 outside the exchange to have their bags searched and ID tags checked." The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said he didn't cancel a political rally because after the 9/11 attacks, "the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day." It wasn’t; the exchange didn’t open until a week later, on Sept. 17. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14473	Says "the New York Times can write a story that they know is false" yet "they can't basically be sued."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-ny-times-cant-be-sued-story-the/	Donald Trump has made little effort to hide his distaste for the media. In a typical comment, he said at one of his rallies in South Carolina that the media are "absolutely dishonest. Absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. Totally dishonest people." Now Trump is proposing changes to libel laws. On the Feb. 28, 2016, edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked the Republican presidential candidate to expand upon comments he’d made a few days earlier in Fort Worth, Texas -- that "one of the things I'm going to do if I win ... I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money." Trump replied, "Well, in England, I can tell you, it's very much different and very much easier. I think it's very unfair when the New York Times can write a story that they know is false, that they virtually told me they know it's false, and I say, why don't you pull the story, and they say, we're not going to do that, because they can't basically be sued. And you (Wallace) can't be sued because can you say anything you want, and that's not fair." Trump’s comments that media "basically can’t be sued" if they "write a story that they know as false" struck us as inaccurate, and when we checked with experts in media law, we found that current law already covers the situation Trump describes. (His campaign did not respond to two inquiries for this article.) One immediate problem with Trump’s assertion is that he said a publication can’t be sued for publishing an article known to be false. In reality, there’s no barrier to filing a lawsuit against a media outlet for libel. "It is relatively easy to sue" in a case like this, said Lyrissa Lidsky, a University of Florida law professor who has written about media law. Actually winning that lawsuit is a different matter, she added. Still, while libel lawsuits are typically hard to win under United States law, Trump happened to cite the main type of case in which the media outlet would be at serious risk of losing the case -- that is, when it published something defamatory that it knew to be false. Legal experts referred us to the unanimous 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan, which holds that the First Amendment generally protects even false statements about public officials and public figures -- but does not protect statements made with "actual malice," which means that the publication knew they were false and published the material anyway, or that they were published with reckless disregard to whether the material was true or false. "Under New York Times vs. Sullivan, the type of knowing lie that Mr. Trump describes is not protected by the First Amendment," said Leonard M. Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor and an attorney of counsel to the firm Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP. Roy S. Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, agreed that under Sullivan, "it is possible for a public-figure plaintiff to prove that the false statement was published either with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for its truth." Of course, the plaintiff in Trump’s example would have to do more than just assert their case -- they would have to prove it in court. "A public figure or public official must plead and prove actual malice," said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. "If he or she does, then yes, he or she could prevail, absent some other defense." None of this is easy to do, of course, although someone like Trump would at least have significant resources to pursue such a case if he wished. In the real world, proving actual malice is "not impossible," said David Ardia, who codirects the University of North Carolina’s Center for Media Law and Policy. Ardia added that "if Trump were to win the presidency and attempted to change libel law to make it more favorable for public figures to win, he'd have to deal with the First Amendment, which provides robust protections for speech that is critical of public officials." Our ruling Trump said "the New York Times can write a story that they know is false" yet "they can't basically be sued." United States libel laws for public figures are indeed tilted toward media outlets and against plaintiffs. However, contrary to what Trump said, plaintiffs can always sue if they wish. And they can certainly win in the scenario Trump cited -- if the New York Times knowingly published something false and defamatory. Indeed, the seminal Supreme Court decision on this subject explicitly says that media outlets are not protected from libel suits if they knew something was false but published it anyway. We rate the statement False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-03-01T13:40:03	2016-02-28	['The_New_York_Times']
pomt-07612	Studies have shown that in the absence of federal reproductive health funds, we are going to see the level of abortion in Georgia increase by about 44 percent.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/22/hank-johnson/congressman-says-funding-decision-could-increase-a/	Federal budget wars have morphed into culture wars, and fiscal and social conservatives have set their sights on cutting family planning funds. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted last month to take away $317 million in funds for the Title X program, which provides reproductive health services such as contraception and HIV testing for people who cannot afford it. Now the program’s fate lies with the Democratic-controlled Senate, and Title X defenders are launching a counterattack. In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Lithonia Democrat, unleashed a statistic that could give even a staunch Title X critic pause. "Studies have shown that in the absence of Title X, we are going to see the level of abortion in Georgia increase by about 44 percent," Johnson said. Really? Title X serves at least 144,000 Georgians, of whom 139,000 are women. Federal rules bar those funds from being used for abortion. But anti-abortion advocates believe that revoking them would hurt groups such as Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions at some of its clinics. The House also voted to bar all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Johnson spokesman Andy Phelan sent us statistics from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy group, to back up the congressman’s claim. Guttmacher’s roots lie in the movement to support abortion rights, but advocates on both sides of the abortion debate use its research to back their positions. Johnson’s paraphrase of Guttmacher’s research was right on. The institute’s Title X fact sheet for Georgia says, "In the absence of these services, the level of abortion in Georgia would be 44 percent higher." Methods to determine whether publicly funded family planning services reduce the number of unintended pregnancies have existed for "decades," said Guttmacher’s Jennifer Frost, a senior researcher and lead author of a 2008 paper about the group’s predictions. In the absence of affordable care, women tend to choose birth control methods that are less effective, Frost said. Since researchers cannot conduct actual experiments on what would happen if these services ended, Frost and her colleagues considered five types of behaviors -- ranging from switching contraceptive methods to dropping contraception all together -- that women might choose if funding disappeared. The research team knew from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data how often women who adopt these behaviors had unplanned pregnancies and abortions. It used this information for its projections. Nationally, abortions would rise by about one-third, the team predicted. Because Georgia women use Title X services at greater than the national rate, Guttmacher predicted a 44 percent increase here. In 2008, 39,820 women obtained abortions in Georgia, according to Guttmacher. We were unable to find another study on Georgia similar to Guttmacher’s, but its research does align with studies on the broader topic of how contraceptive use affects abortion rates. When contraception increases, the abortion rate generally declines, said Charles Westoff, a Princeton University professor who has compared data for dozens of countries. "It is obvious to most people that if the prevalence or availability of modern contraceptives is reduced, the unintentional pregnancy rate will rise and thus the abortion rate," Westoff said. Guttmacher may have underestimated the unintended pregnancies Title X averts, said Diana Greene Foster, a reproductive health expert at the University of California, San Francisco. She studied the group’s California numbers and thinks they are 20 percent too low. "I can’t say that their estimate of pregnancies averted for Georgia is too low by 20 percent. But I believe that in general, their methodology produces conservative estimates," Foster told PoltiFact Georgia in an e-mail. University of Alabama professor Michael New, whose research is widely used to support anti-abortion positions, says Guttmacher’s figures are unpersuasive. New cited a 2002 Guttmacher study on women who had abortions. Of those who did not use contraceptives, 12 percent said they could not afford or gain access to them. This low percentage suggests Title X has little effect on abortions, New said. That same study, however, also found that women with lower income and education levels are less likely to use contraception, and those who use no contraception are more likely to have abortions. New also cited a Guttmacher analysis of abortion statistics in 13 countries. Abortions declined in seven of those countries after modern contraception became popular, but they initially rose in the U.S. and five other countries. Still, in the U.S. and at least three other countries where abortions increased, abortion rates eventually declined. Did Johnson get his facts right? Johnson said "studies" show Georgia’s abortion level would increase by 44 percent. In fact, he cited a single study from a widely respected group. While scholars have found that in general, increases in the use of contraceptives lead to decreases in abortion, and one expert said Guttmacher may have underestimated its Georgia figures, we found no other study that confirms or refutes its conclusions about this state. Johnson would have been right if he said that studies show contraception decreases abortion, and that without Title X funds, abortions could rise. But he didn’t.

pomt-08387	Says Gov. Jim Doyle and the DNR have not put hunters first and mismanaged the deer herd; as a result "the deer population has dwindled."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/24/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-dnr-has-mismanaged-states-deer-h/	Scott Walker’s first deer hunting expeditions gave him a taste of the frustration that has been felt by many Wisconsin hunters: He got skunked. Now, in his bid for governor, Walker has waded into the single most contentious state natural resources issue: the size of the state’s deer herd and how the balance is struck between the wishes of hunters, the effects of deer on the environment, the concerns of farmers and the safety of drivers. The annual deer hunt helps drive tourism and, for many, helps define Wisconsin. Walker, a Republican facing Democrat Tom Barrett in the Nov. 2, 2010 election, is a recent hunter, though his story may have a common ring to it. Two years ago, on his first hunt, he saw a buck but couldn’t shoot, because he was in an area where hunters first had to kill a doe before they could shoot a buck. Last year’s hunt was equally unsatisfying: Walker didn’t see a deer. Walker made increasing the number of deer -- and the number of hunters -- a central part of a tourism plan he unveiled Oct. 14, 2010. In the three-page document, Walker says Gov. Jim Doyle and the state Department of Natural Resources have engaged in "political games" and "put bureaucrats in Madison ahead of hunters of the state." The result, he argues, is a smaller herd, fewer deer taken and fewer hunters. In a news release, Walker claimed that the "deer population has dwindled" as a result of "mismanagement" by Doyle and the DNR. That’s the statement we put in our cross hairs. Is it true the deer population has dwindled? And, if so, is the frustration of hunter a result of political games and mismanagement in Madison? We started with Walker, but his campaign said he was unavailable to talk to PolitiFact Wisconsin about the matter. Out hunting votes, no doubt. The campaign referred us to adviser Greg Kazmierski, a member of the Hunters Rights Coalition, a lobbying group and longtime critic of the DNR. Kazmierski, owner of Buck Rub Outfitters Ltd. in the Town of Delafield, believes the DNR’s system of managing the deer herd -- and the hunt -- is out of whack. His list of complaints is long: Deer population estimates, used to establish hunting targets, are "not anywhere close to accurate"; the department itself doesn’t do enough to encourage hunting and is "anti-hunter"; bureaucrats focus too much on other factors, such as car-deer accidents and farmers who have their crops damaged. "We are moving in a direction that people want to give (hunting) up," said Kazmierski, whose business is based on hunting. "There are too many rules and regulations." OK, let’s dig into the claim, starting with the last word: "dwindled." The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines dwindle as "To become steadily less: shrink." That can apply to the deer population in the state -- which is estimated at 1.3 million -- down from about 1.8 million in 2007. But Walker’s statement glosses over two critical factors. First, the population is an estimate -- no one knows exactly how many deer there are. Second, the numbers are down on purpose; the smaller herd is part of a policy compromise that involves many players and in some years a vote by the Legislature. Under state law, the DNR must establish a "post-hunt" deer population goal. Once every three years, that goal is voted on and approved by state lawmakers. It is not a decision for bureaucrats or the governor alone -- as Walker suggests when he blames them for mismanagement. Everything starts with estimates of the overall deer herd -- an inexact science, but one that the state was praised for as a national leader in a 2006 review by out of state experts. The DNR also receives advice from various groups and sportsmen in each county, via members of the Wisconsin Conservation Congress, a statewide network that has existed for 76 years. The prospects for hunters are far from the only consideration that plays into the target deer population. When there are large numbers of deer, farmers complain of damage to their crops. In suburban areas, deer begin to show up, wandering in cul-de-sacs and backyards. And, of course, some become part of car-deer accidents. For instance, as the number of deer has declined, so has the number of car-deer accidents: 16,338 in 2009, down from 17,555 in 2005 and 19,914 in 2001. But after a disappointing 2009 hunt, many hunters blamed the DNR. The post-hunt goal for the fall 2010 hunt was set last spring at about 794,000. That compares with a post-hunt goal of about 706,000 in 2005 and a post-hunt goal of about 704,000 in 2000. So, while Walker argues the overall population is dwindling, the post-hunt goal has actually been increasing. This year, a special committee recommended setting the post-hunt deer population at 745,636. The agency bumped it to 794,172, after taking into account that some members of the committee -- including Kazmierski -- wanted a goal in excess of 1 million. Let’s look at some other numbers, which also relate to Walker’s claim -- that tourism is being harmed because the number of hunters is down. Number of Wisconsin hunters: Licensed resident deer hunters were 800,372 in 2009, according to the DNR. That’s down 1,513 from the year before. But the number is up from 2005, when it was 780,719. Number of out-of-state hunters: Non-resident licenses were 43,998 in 2009, down 1,575 -- about 3.5 percent -- from the year before. Out of state licenses totalled 42,397 in 2005. Total deer harvest: In 2009, the total was 329,103, down 124,377 from the year before and 134,832 less than in 2005. With that drop, it’s no wonder many hunters are frustrated. In 2009, there were 39 deer killed per 100 licensed hunters, compared with 56 deer per 100 hunters in 2005. However, the percentage of successful hunters is actually even lower, because many hunters bag more than one deer. Walker’s plan calls for the governor to appoint "white tail deer trustee" (We think "deer overseer" is a bit more poetic) to advise the state on deer management. What do others say about the issue? -- "The deer herd is down, but it’s not decimated. It’s down, but it’s coming back," said Mark Toso, president of the Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association, a group he says has 1,000 members. Toso said Walker is "trying to feed off of anti-DNR sentiment" and frustration among hunters: "A lot of deer hunters only know what they see in the woods. If they don’t see a deer, it’s the DNR’s fault." -- Ed Harvey, chairman of the Conservation Congress, said the group was formed precisely to "depoliticize" deer management. He noted: "If something’s politicized, it’s a lobbying group." He said the DNR has erred in estimated deer counts in some parts of the state, leading to hunter frustration: "The department has taken some very big strides to correct that. It will take some time." Asked about the deer trustee advisor, Harvey’s response was simple: "That’s what the Congress does." -- "In my professional opinion, the statement that the deer herd has been mismanaged is wrong," said Tim Van Deelen, a University of Wisconsin-Madison biology professor and expert on deer populations. He noted the 2006 audit that found the state’s approach to counting the herd more rigorous than that of other states: "When I consider the totality of the information available, I don't think the deer herd has dwindled -- decreased somewhat, maybe, but not substantially." OK, let’s get out of the woods. Walker points to "political games" by Doyle and the DNR, whom he blames for the state’s "dwindling" deer population. That view is certainly shared by many frustrated hunters. However, Walker’s statement leaves out critical information: The size of the deer herd, itself an estimate, is down by design, not by mistake. The goals are based on a system built on input from across the state and attempt to balance the concerns of hunters against those of farmers and drivers. Indeed, it has been successful in helping reduce the number of car-deer accidents. What’s more, in response to pressure from hunters, the 2010 population goal was increased. We rate Walker’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02285	This is the first time since World War II that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/04/chain-email/were-five-aircraft-carriers-docked-one-place-2014-/	A chain email says that President Barack Obama was irresponsible to order five first-line aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval Base together -- purportedly the first time this had been done since World War II. Readers asked us to look into the email, which raised the specter of Pearl Harbor and implied that there may have been an ulterior motive on Obama’s part. So we decided to check it. (A hat tip to Snopes.com, the urban-legend website, which has also rated this claim.) Accompanied by a photograph of five aircraft carriers docked together, the email begins, "What’s wrong with this picture? The picture is of the five first line U.S. nuclear carriers docked together in one place. Just like Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941. This picture was taken February 2014 in Norfolk, Va. . . Obama ordered five nuclear carriers into harbor for ‘routine’ (?) inspections. Heads of the Navy were flabbergasted by the directive but had to comply as it was a direct order from their commander-in-chief." It continues, "This is the first time since WWII that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together. USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS George H.W. Bush, USS Enterprise, USS Harry S. Truman and USS Abraham Lincoln are all in port at Naval Station in Norfolk, Va., the world’s largest naval station." Let’s start with the picture. The photograph is genuine -- the five carriers were indeed docked at Norfolk Naval Base at the same time -- but the email gets much of the context wrong. The picture was taken in December 2012, not February 2014, as the email claims. The email is also wrong about why the carriers were there. They were not docked for "routine inspections" -- they were brought to shore so that crew members could spend Christmas with their families. Intercepts, a defense news blog, reported in a Dec. 20, 2012, post that the Navy "makes a point" of trying to give its crew a chance to spend Christmas with their families, "and for a few days the percentage of ships underway drops to the lowest point it will be all year." What about this being the first time since World War II that five nuclear carriers were docked together? The quick answer is that December 2012 was not the first time since the war that five nuclear powered aircraft carriers were docked at the same place at the same time. A similar unintentional gathering took place at Norfolk in July 1997. A July 2, 1997, Associated Press article published in the Daily Press of nearby Newport News, Va., reported that "for the first time" all five Norfolk-based nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be "moored at their home port." The Navy spokesman at the time, Mike Maus, addressed this rare grouping. "It just worked out that way," Maus said. "There was no plan to say, ‘Let’s bring all the carriers in for the Fourth of July.’ Between scheduling for normal routine operations and shipyard stuff, that’s how it happened to fall into place." The AP reported in 1997 that the Navy doesn’t consider having all five carriers in port at the same time to be a security risk. "At this particular time," Maus said, "we don’t really have much of a threat from anybody." What about Obama’s role in the carriers’ placement? Dictating the day-to-day locations of aircraft carriers is "not really something the commander-in-chief deals with," said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org. Our ruling A chain email says Obama ordered five aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval Base together in 2014, supposedly the first time this had been done since World War II. But the rendezvous occurred in 2012, a similar grouping happened at the base in 1997, and it was done so that naval personnel could be with their families for the Christmas holiday -- not for nefarious reasons that posed a security risk.

pomt-03813	Says of 80,000 people who were denied a firearm in 2012 due to a failed background check, only 44 were prosecuted.	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/mar/22/kelly-ayotte/most-people-trying-buy-gun-illegally-us-senator-ke/	Before Congress enacts any new gun control laws, the nation’s law enforcement officers and courts should better enforce the regulations they have on the books now, according to U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In a meeting with the Telegraph editorial board, New Hampshire’s junior senator took aim last month at the national background check system, which does not go far enough prosecuting those who illegally try to obtain weapons, she said. "Of approximately 80,000 in 2012 that were denied (a gun) because of a background check … only 44 people were prosecuted for that," Ayotte said during the February 19 meeting. "That surprised me," she said. "I want to look further at what we’re doing in terms of enforcement." If Ayotte’s numbers are right, the nation’s .055 prosecution rate doesn’t make for a very good shooting percentage. So, we decided to run the numbers ourselves. But first, some background. According to federal figures, most applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected because of a prior criminal conviction, restraining order or another past issue. In almost every case, these people can be prosecuted. Here’s why: Firearms dealers, who provide the federal application form, are instructed to immediately turn away applicants if they acknowledge a past conviction or other prior issue, even before they conduct the FBI check. Applications that are submitted to the FBI and later rejected are typically denied because the applicant failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form, which can qualify as a federal crime for providing false information. In rare cases, an applicant might initially succeed in obtaining a firearm, despite a criminal record. But once the background check returns showing their past convictions, they could face charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Now, on to the numbers. Reached for comment, Ayotte’s staff pointed us in the direction of U.S. Attorney Timothy Heaphy. Earlier this winter, Heaphy, who represents the western district of Virginia, presented those numbers to members of the Senate judiciary committee during a Feb. 12 hearing on gun violence. In his testimony, Heaphy cited research published recently by the U.S. Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Regional Justice Information Service, a Missouri-based group that provides research for the justice department, among other public safety and governmental agencies. The information service’s research supports Ayotte, and Heaphy’s numbers, showing 80,191 applications denied, along with 44 active prosecutions. But, these numbers are based on 2010 data, not 2012, as Ayotte and Heaphy claimed, and reflect only a portion of the total national figures, according to Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the information service. . The 80,191 figure, reported in a February study titled "Background Checks for Firearm Transfers, 2010," includes only those applications denied by state and local permitting agencies, Frandsen said. Under the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, gun shop owners and other licensed authorities in many states -- 21 to be exact, including New Hampshire -- conduct at least a portion of the background checks themselves through the FBI’s background check system. Agencies in these states conducted about 4.37 million checks in 2010, leading to the 80,191 denials, according to Frandsen’s report. But, those 29 states that do not conduct the checks themselves defer instead to the FBI to do so. In 2010, the FBI conducted about 6.04 million checks, 72,659 of which were denied, Frandsen noted in the study. That places the total number of denied checks conducted in 2010 at 152,850 -- about 1.5 percent of the checks conducted. Now on to the prosecutions count. A separate report, "Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010," published by Frandsen in August, counts 62 charges filed across the country by U.S. Attorneys in 2010, most for falsifying when buying firearms (22) and possession of firearms by a convicted felon (11). Of those 62 charges, 18 were dropped that year, leaving 44 cases intact, according to Frandsen’s report. That number equals Ayotte’s claim. But, once again, it tells only part of the story. The 44 charges, 13 of which were still pending at the end of 2011, reflect only those cases brought by federal prosecutors and does not consider charges filed by state or local police agencies, Frandsen noted. In his research, Frandsen tracks those local cases reported voluntarily by states. In 2010, four states -- Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- reported 1,520 arrests. That count does not include any arrests made that year in the remaining 17 states that conduct at least some background checks themselves. "You’d have to say (the total number of arrests) would be higher," Frandsen said. "There’s no question." Our ruling: On the numbers, Ayotte is on track. In one year, more than 80,000 background checks were denied at the state and local level and federal authorities pursued 44 charges in court, as the senator claimed. However, the report she cited is based on 2010 numbers, not 2012, but that’s small potatoes. More to the point, Ayotte confuses state and federal numbers in her statement, using state rejections (80,000) and federal prosecutions (44). Looking at state enforcement alone, just four states had more than 1,500 arrests. While those are arrests, not prosecutions, it stands to reason the number of state prosecutions is vastly higher than the figure Ayotte cited. That ratio is not nearly as dramatic as Ayotte suggested, but her larger point remains valid: the majority of failed background checks do not lead to criminal charges or prosecutions. With this in mind, we rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Kelly Ayotte	None	None	None	2013-03-22T14:46:02	2013-02-19	['None']

"Dying 78 year old CIA agent admits to killing Marilyn Monroe" read the headline on Science Vibe, a website that claims to share stories from scientific breakthroughs to the seemingly impossible. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. There are many things wrong with the post. First, the supposed ex-CIA officer Normand Hodges is made up. The photo of "Hodges" is actually a man named Michael Tyrrell taken from a 2013 Guardian article about prisoners in hospitals. The Science Vibe article presents the reasoning behind why Marilyn Monroe became a security threat is because she had supposedly slept with Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro making her susceptible to exposing strategic information to communists. While there are conspiracy theories surrounding the relationships of Monroe and the truth behind her death ruled by police as a probable suicide, there is no evidence that she was murdered in part of a cover-up. When we tried to search for the quotes attributed to Hodges, we found no results or credible sources for them. We also found this story circulated by several other hoax sites.

Cox says New York state’s debt per person is higher than any other state. "We have the highest debt per capita," Cox said at a debate among three Republican candidates for governor. The claim comes among a string of criticisms from state Republicans against the economic record of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Cox recently claimed that unemployment was up in every county in the state outside New York City. We rated that claim Mostly True. State Sen. John DeFrancisco, a GOP candidate for governor, claimed that one-third of New York state’s population is on Medicaid. That’s True. But there’s also evidence the state’s economy has improved since Cuomo took office. The state has more private sector jobs than ever before, and unemployment has dropped statewide. So what about the debt? It is one of the few economic indicators for the state we haven’t looked at. Is Cox’s claim correct? Government debt per capita A spokesperson for Cox said he was talking about debt incurred by state and local governments, not personal debt like credit cards or auto loans. New York state ranked highest in government debt for residents in 2015, the latest data available. The debt per person was $17,528 in New York state, according to the Empire Center. The center is a non-partisan, non-profit think tank based in Albany that calls for policy reforms based on free-market principles, personal responsibility and effective and accountable government. It used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis to calculate the rate for each state. The next highest state was Massachusetts, with government debt at $13,733 per person. Wyoming had the lowest rate, with $3,376 of government debt per person. New York state has ranked highest each year since Cuomo took office in 2011. Government debt was $17,204 per capita in New York state that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning tax policy and finance analysis organization. Our ruling Cox said "We have the highest debt per capita." The latest data proves Cox’s claim. New York state has had the highest state and local government debt per capita since at least 2011.

pomt-11765	"Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: ‘Trump is a serious threat to human rights.’ "	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/01/nova-magazine/prince-harry-never-said-donald-trump-wasnt-welcome/	With the engagement announcement of Prince Harry and Suits star Meghan Markle, several news sites have speculated whether President Donald Trump will be invited to the royal wedding. Nova magazine published an article on Nov. 27 with a clickbait headline that is not just speculation but a false statement. The headline reads: "Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: ‘Trump is a serious threat to human rights.’ " (Later, the headline was changed to read, "Donald Trump Not Welcome At Prince Harry’s Wedding To American Actress: Trump Is A ‘Serious Threat To Human Rights.’ " We’re evaluating the original headline.) Harry and Meghan became engaged earlier in November but announced their engagement on Nov. 27. Very few details have been released about the wedding, other than it will take place in Spring 2018. There is no record of Prince Harry uninviting Trump, nor is it likely that he would. The royal family typically tries to shy away from drama. The royal family has put out two press releases regarding the engagement, and neither mention an invite list. The Obamas were not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding in 2011. The other quote in the title, "Trump is a serious threat to human rights," is from reporting done in an Us Weekly article. Us Weekly said a "close source" told them that Harry "is not a fan" of Trump and thinks he "is a serious threat to human rights." But that source was anonymous and we don’t find it credible. The Nova article said that Markle called Trump "misogynistic" and joked about moving to Canada (where Suits is filmed) if he were elected. Markle did say that, on a panel she participated on for Comedy Central’s Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore on May 4, 2016. It seems unlikely that Trump will be invited to the royal wedding. But Harry never made a statement about it, nor did he say that Trump was a serious threat to human rights. Such a statement would have garnered worldwide headlines.

At the Slice & Pint brewpub in Emory Village, brewmaster Crawford Moran has launched a "government rant" series of beers designed to highlight his gripes. The menu’s fall offering: "Why does the state legislature not want to create jobs by allowing us to do growlers of this IPA?" Alas, growler shops - that sell the glass jugs that hold a half gallon of beer - dot the landscape from Decatur to Alpharetta.

Craft brewers have sought for at least a decade to change the state law that keeps them from making money from those who want to quaff their wares. In this year’s legislative session, Senate Bill 63 originally would have given breweries and brewpubs their wish. But the final version instead gave craft brewers the ability only to sell tours and give away their product – a backdoor way to sell limited amounts of beer to go - and stripped out brewpubs’ ability to do the same. Controversy is brewing over that change, now that the state Department of Revenue has issued a bulletin forbidding brewers from charging different prices for the tours based on the value of the beers offered. And brewpubs? The law makes it clear they must sell only on site or to wholesale dealers – the middleman that direct sales would avoid. "We have had so many people come in, locals, students, parents and they love our beer and want to take some home with them," said Moran, who co-owns the Slice and Pint and two locations of the 5 Seasons brewpub. "But the state legislature said those people can’t buy beer where they want to. It’s hard to take." It’s also hard to pin down. Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, agreed the hard line in SB 63 says brewpubs cannot sell their product to go. But hypothetically, she said, brewpubs could sell a growler of beer that they did not produce on site. That’s because the state license for alcohol sales applies to bars, package stores and brewpubs alike and allows for sales both on and off premise. "As far as the state is concerned, you could walk around Kroger drinking beer," Palmer said. "Of course, Kroger doesn’t allow that. And local governments are the ones who decide if they will allow on- or off-site sales." Decatur, for instance, allows people to buy growlers to go from growler shops – and also sample in the store. But Slice & Pint sits outside the city limits and wouldn’t qualify for that perk because it is both a retail operation, like a growler shop, and a manufacturer, by making beer. Moran’s operation is also unique in that he rejects selling to a wholesaler. The state has just 12 other brewpubs, Palmer said, and all sell to that middleman, who can then make it available to go at package stores and the like. Rules on the Department of Revenue website confirm use of wholesalers, as does the new legislation. A spokesman for the department declined to comment. Our ruling A brewpub owner in DeKalb County has created a series of beers designed to call attention to what his says is the state’s interference between his business and consumers. The IPA in question effectively claims that brewpubs can’t sell their products to go. A new state law is clear that neither brewpubs nor breweries can make those sales. The brewpub does have the option to sell to wholesalers, who can then make the suds available to consumers. But that is not the same thing as getting a growler to go with your pizza. We rate the claim True.	None	Slice & Pint brewpub	None	None	None	2015-10-23T00:00:00	2015-09-24	['None']
pomt-01406	"832,000 people lost their job while (Charlie Crist was) governor."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/10/rick-scott/rick-scott-blames-charle-crist-832000-job-losses/	One issue that Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election campaign has not been afraid to exploit is how many Floridians lost their jobs during Charlie Crist’s term as governor. During the Oct. 10 Telemundo debate in Miramar, Scott noted about a half dozen times that 832,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed while Crist was in office. Scott spent much of the debate blaming Crist for worsening conditions during the new Democrat’s term, but he kept coming back to jobs. "You want to talk about jobs – Charlie, 832,000 people lost their job while you were governor." Jobs numbers have been a major talking point for the current governor as far back as his 2010 campaign, when he first promised to bring 700,000 jobs -- and then up to 1.7 million jobs -- to the state over seven years. Our Scott-O-Meter says that promise is In The Works. Scott also said the state lost 825,000 jobs under Crist, a claim we rated Half True in 2012, because Crist, like any governor caught in the midst of a recession, had little control over job losses. At the debate, Scott offered a slightly larger figure -- 832,000. Is this number accurate? PolitiFact Florida took a closer look. Numbers game If you’ve followed what we’ve written on this question over the years, you’ve no doubt noticed that the numbers change from time to time. Economists regularly revise these numbers based on new information. Further complicating matters, Scott’s campaign website has cited private-sector job losses of 828,800 under Crist, specifically from January 2007, when Crist took office, to December 2010, Crist’s last month in office. Understanding the different time spans being measured, and what exactly they are measuring, helps explain the nuances of this claim. First of all, we’ll note that there’s a difference between private-sector jobs and all jobs; the main difference with the latter is that it includes government jobs. For the same months as Scott’s chart -- January 2007 through December 2010 -- the BLS reports that Florida lost 822,200 private-sector jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis (a process that smooths out month-to-month comparisons). The number for total nonfarm job losses during the same time period, seasonally adjusted, was 836,700. So where is the Scott campaign getting 832,000? They changed the time frame to between December 2006 -- the month before Crist took office -- and December 2010. In that case, the total for seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs was 832,700. The reason the number decreased is because the number jobs went up slightly between December 2006 and January 2007. This means the December calculation starts from a lower baseline than the January calculation. When we measured private-sector jobs -- which, incidentally, is the kind that Scott routinely touts for his own record, perhaps because the numbers look rosier for him -- we came up with a loss of 819,600 over the same period. In the big picture, the magnitude of the difference isn’t all that great. The 832,700 figure is only 1.5 percent bigger than the 819,600 figure. Whichever number you choose, these job losses don’t look good. Where Crist has some cover is that he’s hardly the primary reason for these job losses. Experts have consistently told PolitiFact Florida that it's hard to tell how much influence the governor of any one state has on job losses (or -- sorry, Gov. Scott -- job creation). It may take years to find out whether policies have had any effect on job totals at all. Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics who studies Florida, noted back in 2012 that by the time Crist took office in 2007, "the seeds of destruction" had already been sown. An overheated housing market and dirty dealings in the lending industry had long been entrenched problems. "That had very very little to do with Charlie Crist," Lafakis said. Our ruling Scott said "832,000 people lost their job" while Crist was governor, blaming his opponent for not doing enough while in office to improve Florida’s growing ranks of the unemployed. It’s possible to quibble with the specific number of job losses that occurred under Crist, but the differences are small -- 1.5 percent in one direction or the other. The bigger issue is that it’s a stretch for Scott to ascribe blame for job losses on a governor’s watch, since it’s unclear whether any given governor’s policies have had an effect on employment trends. If Scott is trying to impugn Crist’s record on jobs during a recession -- something that depends heavily on the national and international economic picture -- he’s largely off base, even if his numbers are pretty close. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-10-10T16:37:57	2014-10-10	['Charlie_Crist']
pomt-10078	If Obama's economic plan creates 600,000 new government jobs, "that's about the size of the post office work force."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/05/mitch-mcconnell/postal-service-employs-just-over-600000/	President-elect Barack Obama has used a lot of big numbers when it comes to a major stimulus bill to jolt the economy back to life. The bill has to be big if it's going to work, Obama has said. "Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we don’t act swiftly and boldly, we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double-digit unemployment and the American Dream slipping further and further out of reach," Obama said during a radio address on Jan. 3, 2009. The next day on the Sunday morning show This Week with George Stephanopoulos , Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell sounded a cautionary note, saying that Republicans will carefully vet Obama's plans. "We want to make sure it's not just a trillion-dollar spending bill, but something that actually can reach the goal that he has suggested," McConnell said. Stephanopoulos countered, "So how do you do that?" McConnell: "Well, let me make some suggestions. First of all, the incoming president, has said he would like for 80 percent of the jobs created to be in the private sector. Well, do we really want to create 20 percent of the jobs in the public sector? That would be 600,000 new government jobs. That's about the size of the post office work force. Is that a good idea? That's something that strikes us that we ought to take a look at." Stephanopoulos: "You don't think it is?" McConnell: "Well, it may not be, but I think, at least, hearings, and some kind of bipartisan considerations would be helpful." We wondered two things: whether McConnell was accurately characterizing Obama's plan for public sector jobs, and whether that would result in an additional work force rivaling the size of the U.S. Postal Service. It turns out McConnell was right in his characterization of Obama's plan. Obama said in the radio address from the day before that "the No. 1 goal of my plan" is to "create 3 million new jobs, more than 80 percent of them in the private sector." To us, that seems like 20 percent of the jobs could then be in the public sector. Simple math tells us that 20 percent of 3 million is 600,000. Granted, Obama's words clearly allow some wiggle room. Maybe more than 80 percent would be in the private sector, reducing the number of public sector jobs. Nevertheless, the 80 percent minimum sounds like a benchmark to us. Obama also says that the jobs will be "new," which means they will be additions to the current work force. So when McConnell says that Obama wants to add "600,000 new government jobs," that sounds like a fair reading of Obama's words. Then McConnell added, "That's about the size of the post office work force." The number of U.S. Postal Service employees is in that ballpark. But you can crunch the numbers a few different ways. In its year-end report for 2008, the postal service reported that it employed 663,238 career employees as of Sept. 30, 2008. It also employed an additional 101,850 temporary or part-time workers, which would bring its total to 765,088. The Postal Service says that it’s the second-largest employer in the United States after Wal-Mart, which employs 1.4 million in the United States, though that number includes many part-timers. Getting back to the postal comparison, McConnell is not far off with his comparison if you count only the 663,238 career employees. If you included the temporary workers, the margin of difference becomes more significant. But we suspect Obama wants to create full-time jobs with benefits, not add temporary or part-time workers. So we offer a few minor caveats to McConnell's statement. Obama implied he would create 600,000 new public-sector employees at most, and the postal service is just a little bit bigger than 600,000. But McConnell is largely correct in what he says. We rate his statement Mostly True. UPDATE: Obama offered new job numbers for his stimulus plan during his weekly radio address on Jan. 9, 2009. His economic advisers believe the stimulus plan will create between 3 million and 4 million jobs, with at least 90 percent in the private sector, Obama said. The advisers' report estimates that 3.675 million jobs will be created, and that 244,000 of those will be government jobs — a much lower number than the size of the U.S. Postal Service. But McConnell was correct at the time he made his statements, so our ruling stands.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2009-01-05T17:27:10	2009-01-04	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-04743	Says women care most about jobs and the economy	true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/29/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-women-care-most-about-jobs-and-econ/	Women and Mitt Romney see more eye-to-eye on the issues than the polls and press would have you believe, says Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. As the Republican National Convention convened in Tampa, CNN host Wolf Blitzer asked Bondi if she thought debate over abortion rights played into why Obama leads Romney with women. He pointed out the party’s policy platform, which calls for a "personhood"-style amendment that would define life at the moment of conception. Bondi said "that issue really has not come up" during her travels across the country on Romney’s behalf. "What women care about are jobs, the economy, the unemployment rate," Bondi said on Aug. 27, 2012. "You know, 401,000 women have lost jobs under President Obama’s reign." Later in the interview, she said, "Wolf, when I’m around the country, women care about the same issues as men, and that’s getting jobs, keeping jobs." We’ve heard this retort from Republicans throughout this election cycle as reproductive rights issues have at times dominated the news. We wanted to know if Bondi is right about jobs being the priority for women or if it just sounds nice on TV. We put the question to experts in polling, political science and women’s issues (and to Bondi’s press aides, who did not respond). Women have trended Democratic since the Ronald Reagan-Jimmy Carter 1980 election, but abortion isn’t the driving issue, said Seth McKee, a University of South Florida political science professor. "It’s one of the myths in American politics that people think that’s where the gap comes from," he said of abortion. "There are lots of pro-choice men." Instead, the gender gap is traditionally widened by issues of aggression -- meaning, more aversion from women to war and gun rights -- and government programs. Women are more likely to be in charge of family decisions on education, health and budgets, so they place more value on programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, said Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. "It’s typically the woman who is responsible for all of that," she said. "And in general the Democrats are more supportive of providing those services to women and their families." Where do reproductive issues rank? Not high, no matter the poll. Here’s how the issue of abortion ranked in May 2012 when Washington University’s American Panel Survey asked people what issue they thought is "the most important problem facing the country today." Male Female Total Abortion .3% .9% .6% Economy in general 32.7% 35.6% 34.2% Unemployment 13.5% 10.6% 12% Budget deficit 12.8% 8.1% 10.4% Moral decline 10.6% 7.9% 9.2% Abortion didn’t break a percentage point. Still, Bondi’s statement does not account for a couple factors, said Jeffrey Jones, managing editor of Gallup polls. First, he said, everyone cares most about the economy when it’s bleak. And even in a decent economy, sizing up single issues (abortion, gay marriage, campaign finance) next to as broad a topic as the economy is comparing apples and oranges. In a close presidential race like this one, both sides will pounce on social controversies in hopes of moving the needle. The Obama campaign, for instance, is using the abortion debate -- inflamed anew by Todd Akin’s "legitimate rape" controversy -- to appeal to unmarried women, said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Obama has to be sensitive to women's concerns about the economy and deflecting their concerns to issues such as contraception and abortion could be a good strategy," she said. NARAL Pro-Choice America political director Beth Shipp said polls by the group show abortion rights help Obama among women labeled "Obama defectors," meaning they voted for him in 2008 but are not committed this year. "We don’t need to move 5 percent or 10 percent. We don’t need to move 2 percent," Shipp said. "I can move a .5 percent or 1 percent and affect the outcome of this race." On the other side of the debate, anti-abortion advocates plan to use Obama’s "extreme abortion record" with the same end goal, according to an Aug. 29, 2012, Washington Post story. Some experts argue that reproductive rights and the economy aren’t completely separate issues. If women aren’t worried about issues of contraception and abortion, it’s probably because they think those issues are long settled, says David Johnson, a University of South Florida history professor. "Women in the ‘60s and ‘70s were fighting for reproductive freedom so that they could work," Johnson said in an interview. "If they could not control when they could have children, they could not work." Our ruling It’s worth noting that people on both sides of the issue believe debates on abortion rights can help or hurt a candidate on the margins in a tight race. But Bondi is right that women, like men, place the most importance on economic issues this election cycle. We rate her statement True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.

pomt-10192	Barack Obama got more campaign contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/19/john-mccain/their-employees-have-donated/	During a campaign speech in Green Bay, Wis., John McCain called for reforms on Wall Street oversight and blasted his Democratic opponent Barack Obama. Among his prime targets: the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "While Fannie and Freddie were working to keep Congress away from their house of cards, Senator Obama was taking their money," McCain said. "He got more, in fact, than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them. And while Fannie Mae was betraying the public trust, somehow its former CEO had managed to gain my opponent's trust to the point that Senator Obama actually put him in charge of his vice presidential search." It's true that Obama selected Jim Johnson, the chaiman and CEO of Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998, to advise him on his vice presidential choice. But Johnson resigned the unpaid position on June 11, 2008, months before veep nominee Joe Biden was chosen, amid criticism of compensation and favorable mortgage terms Johnson received. Here we'll look at McCain's statement that Obama received the second-most campaign contributions from Fannie Mae. The source for this data is the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which has compiled a list of which political leaders received the most money from employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Obama's campaign cites this source to back up its claim that John McCain has received more than $2-million from big oil . On the Freddie and Fannie question, it as McCain said: Obama is No. 2 on the list, with $126,349, right after Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who had $165,400. But the list requires a few notes of explanation. Corporations cannot give to candidates, so the center's list adds up contributions from Fannie and Freddie employees and their families. Obama has received a lot of money during his presidential campaign, though, and Fannie and Freddie don't make his list of top 20 companies. (The top three companies with employees donating to Obama are Goldman Sachs, University of California, and Citigroup, according to the center.) The New York Times looked at contributions from Fannie and Freddie's boards of directors and lobbyists, who are technically not employees. That analysis found Fannie and Freddie-related contributors gave $169,000 to John McCain and his related committees, compared with $16,000 to Obama and his related committees. Nevertheless, the center's information does reflect which candidates are getting the most money from Fannie and Freddie employees. There are other ways to parse the campaign finance numbers, but McCain is correct when he says Obama got the second-most money on a list compiled by a respected, nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog. He would have been more accurate if he would have noted that he was talking about Fannie and Freddie employees. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-04777	"We have only one person on the (TVA) board, to my knowledge, who even has any corporate board experience."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/26/bob-corker/sen-bob-corker-says-tva-board-directors-has-only-o/	Back in 2004, Bill Frist, then Senate majority leader, spearheaded congressional passage of legislation that eliminated the Tennessee Valley Authority's three-member, full-time board of directors and replaced it with a panel of nine part-time directors. Sen. Bob Corker, who succeeded Frist in a Tennessee Senate seat, now says the board isn't working out. Corker first questioned TVA's governance structure and the qualifications of board members in an August news release. He elaborated in subsequent interviews, telling the Chattanooga Times-Free Press: "As you look at TVA today as an $11 billion-a-year company with tremendous challenges, it has a board of directors with the qualifications that I think would cause most Tennesseans to be very concerned. . . . We have only one person on the board, to my knowledge, who even has any corporate board experience." We understand that picking TVA board members involves a political process -- they're nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. But has that really left governance of a governmental agency with $11 billion in revenues and almost $30 billion in debt to folks without appropriate corporate management experience? As a starting point, it should be noted that the board, authorized for nine members, currently has just six and two of those have terms that will expire at the end of this year. President Obama nominated Peter Mahurin of Bowling Green, Ky., as a new board member in February, but there has so far been no Senate committee hearing scheduled on his confirmation. It's thus at least possible the TVA board could lack a quorum of five members for meetings by the end of the year. That, setting aside qualification questions, would raise concern for whether the board could even function. The one board member who Corker counts as having corporate board experience is Bill Sansom, the chairman. He is the longtime chairman and CEO of H.T. Hackney Co., a Knoxville firm in the wholesale grocery and furniture manufacturing business. The other five sitting members: -- Marilyn A. Brown of Atlanta, a professor of energy policy at Georgia Technological Institute and a "distinguished visiting scientist" at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. -- William Graves of Memphis, who retired in 2010 as presiding bishop of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church and who served on the board of Memphis Light, Gas and Water. -- Barbara S. Haskew of Chattanooga, an economic professor at Middle Tennessee State University who previously served as dean of the College of Business Administration and worked for eight years as a TVA manager. -- Richard Howorth, founder and owner of Square Books, an independent bookstore with two affiliates operations who is a past chairman of the American Booksellers Association. He served eight years as mayor of Oxford, Miss., and chaired the Oxford Electric Authority. -- Neil McBride, an Oak Ridge lawyer and adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee School of Law who is also general counsel for the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. Brown and Graves are the board members with terms expiring this year. Of this group, it would appear that Howorth might come closest to Sansom in business management background. In a telephone interview, Howorth declined to address Corker's comments directly, but said he does believe his background has provided ample executive experience to oversee TVA's operations. "If I didn't, I wouldn't have agreed to take the job," Howorth said. He spent 11 years on the board of directors of the American Booksellers Association, including two years as president and chairman, Howorth said. The association, a non-profit corporation, had a $40 million budget and the position "required a great deal of engagement," he said. Serving as a city's chief executive officer and as chairman of the electric board could also be viewed as the equivalent of corporate board experience, he suggested. There's also the pending nomination of Mahurin, who is chairman of Hilliard Lyons Financial Services and who serves on five other corporate boards of directors, according to the White House press release announcing his nomination. Hilliard Lyons has 400 financial consultants operating in 12 states, according to the company website. And some might see Graves' service on the board of MGLW, which serves some 430,000 customers, as providing an appropriate boardroom background though the ministry has been his primary profession. A call to Corker's office for elaboration on his comments brought a return call from the senator himself. "This is no way an attempt take shots at anyone," he said. "It's really about the federal process." For presidents of both political parties, he said, appointment of TVA directors is "a hassle and to some degree an annoyance" that at times seems to involve "just crossing "Ts" and dotting ‘Is’ for political considerations." "TVA is not that important overall to the federal government and certainly not to administrations of either ilk," he said. "It is extremely important to Tennessee. A big part of our economic future depends on TVA." Corker said there is a need to "come up with a remedy" that meets needs all people in the TVA valley and indicated he will be engaged in that process, though declining to be specific about what reforms are in order. The senator did not retreat from his contention that the board today is short on the corporate board experience needed for running an enterprise holding a regional monopoly in power production, though he repeatedly emphasized he was not criticizing anyone individually. "Who knows? We may have four of five of the most stellar people on earth put forward to run TVA," he said. "But that hasn't happened before." Corker expressed doubt about whether running a bookstore or even a national booksellers association counts as corporate board experience. As for the pending nomination Mahurin, Corker said "it sounds like he does have some experience" and that he hopes to learn more about the nominee's qualifications and background. Our ruling Corker’s point holds up, though we did find some other board members with experience they believe is equivalent to the corporate board experience the senator wants. Since that context was missing, we rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Bob Corker	None	None	None	2012-08-26T05:00:00	2012-08-18	['None']
pomt-01371	Almost every state has offered an insurance plan on its health exchange that does not cover abortion.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/17/Rhode_Island_Catholic/catholic-paper-says-ri-health-exchange-one-few-us-/	Abortion was pushed to the forefront of the race for the governor’s office after Democrat Gina Raimondo was endorsed by Planned Parenthood’s political action committee. In a short speech at a Sept. 25 news conference, Raimondo argued that women should be able to make health decisions without interference from their employers or the government. The next day, The Providence Journal reported that, in an interview after the news conference, Raimondo said she would oppose efforts to offer an insurance plan on the Rhode Island health exchange that would exclude coverage for abortion or contraception. (Raimondo’s campaign later issued a statement expressing a different position. More on that later.) Opponents seized on Raimondo’s position, saying that she had staked out an "extreme" position on abortion. Thomas Tobin, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, was one of the first and most vocal critics. The Rhode Island Catholic, the diocese’s newspaper, followed up in an Oct. 2 editorial. "[Gina Raimondo] demonstrates an inexplicable disregard for the sincere conscience of thousands of Rhode Islanders who don’t want to participate in insurance programs that pay for abortion," the editorial said. "Almost every other state has provided that option." We wondered if nearly every state really has provided that option. Rick Snizek, editor of The Rhode Island Catholic, told us that the source of the claim was a recent report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The Sept. 15 report was done at the request of Republican leaders in the House of Representatives. It looked at all the health exchanges in the nation that were created under the Affordable Care Act and what coverage options for abortion were provided in each state. Under the law, exchanges are required to offer insurance covering abortions when "the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest, or the life of the pregnant woman would be endangered unless an abortion is performed." The Affordable Care Act does not require states to offer abortion coverage beyond that. In fact, the GAO report found that 17 states have passed laws that explicitly forbid health plans from offering expanded coverage, while another 6 severely restrict coverage. The GAO contacted the 28 remaining states and found that in 8 states, no expanded coverage is offered; in 15 states, at least one plan offers such coverage; and in 5 states, all plans offer full coverage. Rhode Island is in that final group, along with Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey and Vermont. In those five states, there is no option for consumers who want a health plan that does not cover non-excepted abortions. In other words, The Rhode Island Catholic editorial was accurate. The Affordable Care Act recognizes this issue and requires all states to provide an insurance option by 2017 that does not cover abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother’s life is endangered. Questions about abortion coverage were raised before the Rhode Island health exchange was set up. Governor Chafee created the exchange through an executive order in 2011, after an effort to do so through legislation stalled in the General Assembly over abortion language. As recently as last year, the state Senate passed a bill that would have required some plans to allow people who sign up for them to "opt out" of abortion services. But the bill failed to clear the House and HealthSource RI was set up without any state restrictions or provisions regarding abortion. Now back to Raimondo’s position on insurance coverage for abortions. If the federal government will eventually require all health insurance exchanges, including Rhode Island’s, to offer at least one plan that doesn’t cover most abortions, how could Raimondo oppose it? When we posed that question to the Raimondo campaign, Nicole Kayner offered this statement: "Gina is not opposed to HealthSource RI including an insurance plan that excludes reproductive services. In fact, the Affordable Care Act requires that by 2017, the exchange must do that. Individuals should be able to go to HealthSource RI and buy a plan that makes the most sense for them." Our ruling The Rhode Island Catholic newspaper said that Rhode Island is one of the few states that does not offer an insurance option that excludes most abortion coverage. According to a federal report, only Rhode Island and four other states fall into that category. We rule the statement True.

pomt-00067	Says California Republican Young Kim is "a tax cheat" who "illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in," had "multiple tax liens placed on her" as a result and "owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/nov/02/gil-cisneros/spoof-website-goes-too-far-when-calling-california/	Imitation isn’t always a form of flattery, and a website created by California Democrat Gil Cisneros’ congressional campaign shows why. The site has a name, YoungKimforCongress.org, that makes it easily mistaken for the website of Cisneros’ opponent, Young Kim. But the Democrat-created website’s content and slogan -- "Just like Donald Trump" -- are anything but flattering to Kim, a Republican. The site has a lot to chew on, but standing out to PolitiFact was a section on Kim’s personal taxes. It says Kim is "a tax cheat" who "illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in," had "multiple tax liens placed on her" as a result and "owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes." "Cheat" and "illegally" are serious words. To understand them fully here, let’s look at the facts, with a little teaser to get started: The property taxes we’re discussing amounted to $387. The home issue If you own a home, you pay property taxes on it. But many states give a tax break to people who live in their homes. This is called a homeowner’s or homestead exemption, and in California it is relatively small. By claiming it, a California homeowner can reduce the assessed value of his or her home by a maximum of $7,000 -- which saves the homeowner about $70 a year in actual taxes. Kim and her husband, Charles, owned a home in the Orange County community of La Habra, and had a homeowner’s exemption through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. But Kim had moved to a different home in a different community, Fullerton, in late 2012, and in January 2013 changed her voter registration to reflect this. She moved again to a third home, in Fullerton, in 2014. Kim and her husband still owned the home in La Habra -- renting it out as income property -- and still got the homeowner’s exemption. Under California law, homeowners are only supposed to get the exemption if they live in the home. This meant the Kims continued to get a $74 annual benefit she and her husband weren’t entitled to. After Orange County realized this, it filed two liens against the Kims for "unsecured property taxes," one for $197.96 and the other for $189.39, on Oct. 13, 2015. Such liens typically included a penalty and interest, Orange County Assessor Claude Parrish told us. The county lifted the liens on Sept. 30, 2016, after the Kims paid. The total penalty: $387. Mail confusion These basic facts, most of them noted or available through links in the spoof Kim website, were confirmed independently by PolitiFact through Orange County public records, interviews and a financial disclosure form Kim filed after she was elected to the California State Assembly in 2014. But none of these address an important point: Did Kim dupe the county -- was she a "tax cheat" -- so she could save $74 a year? Parrish, the county tax assessor, told us the liens should never have been issued. Parrish said this in 2016 as well, when the matter arose during Kim’s unsuccessful re-election campaign for the State Assembly. Parrish, whose office is nonpartisan but who has served as a Republican in previous offices, issued a statement during that race, saying Kim had notified his predecessor in 2014 "that she was no longer living at the home in question as of December 2012 and thus was not eligible for the homeowner’s exemption." "Unfortunately," his statement continued, "notices from the county in regard to this property were mailed to Ms. Kim at an old address and not forwarded to her, a common problem when people move. Through no fault of her own, a lien was placed on her property for a small amount of taxes due. This happens to innocent taxpayers like Ms. Kim all too often, and is a direct result of the notices not being properly forwarded by the U.S. Postal Service." In a telephone interview, Parrish told us, "This could happen to anybody." Parrish has crusaded on this very issue -- thousands of liens issued for very small amounts, potentially harming the credit of residents -- for several years. He said that 62 percent of his county’s 45,331 liens in 2015 were for $200 or less, many a result of oversight or mistakes. Parrish pushed successfully for a 2017 California bill that authorized counties to stop issuing tax liens if the amount owed is $200 or less. Regardless of the amount, did Kim owe the money? If Kim notified the assessor’s office in 2014 of a move that occurred in late 2012, that suggests at least a year went by before giving the proper notice. The mail issues then complicated matters, as did the fact that, according to Kim’s current campaign, she paid her property taxes through the escrow account on her mortgage. In Kim’s 2016 state Assembly race, her political opponent, Sharon Quirk-Silva, said these were excuses that didn’t exempt Kim from her obligations as a taxpayer. Quirk-Silva’s campaign at the time issued a critical statement from a retired Los Angeles County tax assessor, Kenneth P. Hahn, who said, "The law is clear. Failure to receive notice from the U.S. Postal Service does not absolve an individual from paying their taxes." Kim’s current campaign says this is a bit much. The discussion, after all, is over $74 a year, or $387 after penalties and interest. The income taxes The Cisneros campaign also noted on its faux Kim website that Kim and her husband owe $10,000 to $15,000 to the IRS. This information comes directly from the financial disclosure report Kim filed this year as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. Under creditors, she listed $10,000 to $15,000 owed to the IRS, with the description, "Installment of taxes due for 2009 & 2010." Patrick Mocete, Kim’s campaign manager, told us the debt is a result of taxes due from her husband’s employment as a self-employed consultant, and he set up an installment payment plan with the IRS. That’s perfectly legal. Our ruling The Cisneros campaign says Kim is "a tax cheat" who "illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in," had "multiple tax liens placed on her" as a result and "owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes." The IRS debt is more substantial than the property tax, but there is no information to show it has anything to do with cheating. "Cheat" implies motivation, and news stories have used the word to describe people who purposely violated homestead exemption laws to save on taxes -- typically saving much more than $74 a year. Nic Jordan, the Cisneros campaign spokesman, told us the campaign used the word colloquially. Whether a mistake or not, Kim had two liens and owed $387 to the county as a result of an improperly recorded homeowner’s exemption. The law is the law, as Kim’s last opponent said. But it was a minor civil matter, and one that the current property assessor says never should have resulted in liens. Cisneros focused on the $7,000 annual reduction in the house’s assessment, not mentioning on the spoof website that it made a difference of $74 a year. This makes it sound far worse than it was. With these elements combined, we rate the claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Gil Cisneros	None	None	None	2018-11-02T10:33:05	2018-09-17	['None']

pomt-05178	Says Barack Obama is "trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/14/national-rifle-association/barack-obama-proposes-major-cuts-federal-armed-pil/	The National Rifle Association is out with a Top 10-style list detailing why President Barack Obama is anti-gun. We’re investigating several of the claims on the list. You can see all our fact-checks by clicking back here throughout the week. Today, we tackle the No. 6 reason why President Barack Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment: "Obama is trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks." (For the record, the NRA list doesn’t rank one reason as being worse than another, so the fact that this claim is No. 6 doesn’t mean it's more serious than, say, No. 10, "Obama admits he's coming for our guns ...") The "Armed Pilots Program" is officially called the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It’s pretty much what it sounds like. The federal government has budgeted $25 million a year to deputize and train volunteer commercial pilots to carry firearms on commercial flights. The federal government has not said how many pilots take part. In the FY 2013 budget, Obama proposed to cut the program’s funding roughly in half, to $12 million. Here’s how the administration explained the cut in its budget request: "The Administration proposes to reduce funding for the FFDO program (i.e., deputized, armed pilots) in 2013. As the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses its aviation security activities on programs that mitigate the highest amount of risk at the lowest cost, the Budget has prioritized funding in the same manner. The voluntary FFDO program was created as a ‘last defense’ layer of security at a time when comprehensive aviation screening and other physical security measures were not fully developed or deployed on a system-wide basis. Since 2001, however, there have been a number of enhancements to aviation security. TSA now conducts 100 percent screening of all passengers and their carryon items, has overseen installation of reinforced and locking cockpit doors on aircraft that operate in U.S. airspace, and has increased passenger and flight crew awareness to address security risks. Combined, these improvements have greatly lowered the chances of unauthorized cockpit access and represent a comprehensive and redundant risk-mitigation strategy that begins well before passengers board the aircraft." In short, the Obama administration said that arming pilots isn’t as important as it use to be, given other security improvements. Transportation Security Administrator John Pistole also said that the agency has had trouble coordinating schedules of armed pilots, whose flights are set by the airlines, with those of U.S. air marshals managed by the TSA, according to Bloomberg. "In an ideal world, one without budget constraints, we would fully fund the program. We’re not in that environment, so we are taking reductions," he said. The Republican-led House disagreed. On June 6, 2012, the House voted not only to reverse Obama’s proposed cuts but to increase the program’s budget to $35 million. "9/11 woke us up to the reality that we live in a dangerous world. With varied and ever-emerging threats, every effort should be made to make air travel as safe as possible," said Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minn., who sponsored the amendment. (Cravaack is a former Northwest Airlines pilot who says he was in the Armed Pilots Program.) Lastly we checked with Brian Darling, a senior fellow for government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has been following the issue. Darling noted that the Armed Pilots Program had been funded at the same level since its inception, and that Obama’s decision to cut the program in half seems more like a policy choice than something prompted by budget constraints. Still, the savings are relatively small. The $12 million-$13 million in potential savings comprises about 0.15 percent of the entire TSA $7.6 billion proposed budget. Our ruling The NRA claimed that Obama is "trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks." The Armed Pilots Program was created post-Sept. 11, 2001, to serve as a last-line of defense in a terror attack. And Obama, in his FY 2013 budget proposal, did propose cutting the budget for the program in half. Obama says the program isn’t as critical as it once was. But that doesn’t contradict the NRA’s claim. We rate it True.	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2012-06-14T17:14:11	2012-06-12	['None']

pomt-04159	"[T]he Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/dec/21/zell-miller/stadium-claim-flagged-faulty-numbers/	The Georgia Dome has provided a real pot of gold for this state, says former Gov. Zell Miller. "In total, the Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia. Not bad for an investment of a little more than $200 million," he wrote in an op-ed that appeared in the Marietta Daily Journal. Miller, also a former U.S. senator and a legend in state politics, was writing to make the case that the proposal to demolish the Georgia Dome and spend an estimated $1 billion to build a retractable roof stadium in downtown Atlanta is good for Georgia. The plan calls for the Atlanta Falcons to spend $700 million on construction while the state would commit about $300 million from its hotel/motel tax. Some polls show a majority of Georgians don’t see the need to replace the 20-year-old Georgia Dome. They don’t think the state should spend tax dollars on this project. The hotel/motel tax is typically used to promote tourism, trade shows and conventions. A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw the op-ed and asked us to fact-check Miller’s math. Many studies used to estimate the economic impact of sports venues and/or events are typically off-base or lack context. Miller, 80, has kept a low profile since leaving the Senate in early 2005. We tried him through the international law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge, where he is a consultant and adviser. Eric Tanenblatt, senior managing director for the law firm’s Atlanta office and chief of staff to former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, provided us some numbers used to back up the claim. Tanenblatt has been lobbying on behalf of the Atlanta Falcons for the new stadium, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. Since it opened in August 1992, it seems like every type of ball has been tossed inside the stadium. The Georgia Dome has hosted two Super Bowls, several events associated with the 1996 Summer Olympics, college basketball’s Final Four, Southeastern Conference basketball and football championships, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Wrestlemania and concerts featuring superstars like the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney. It’s even held church services. The Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which owns and operates the Dome, prepares an annual report on revenue, spending and the economic impact of the stadium and its other facilities. The reports were prepared in most years by economists from either Georgia State University or the University of Georgia. In their most recent report, which covers July 2011 to June 2012, the Georgia Dome had an estimated economic impact of $269.2 million. During the past decade, the estimated economic impact ranges between $250 million and $275 million per year, according to reports we reviewed on the GWCC website. In earlier years, the estimate has fluctuated from just below $200 million, as it did for four years, to two years when the estimate was well over $600 million. Atlanta hosted the Super Bowl one of those years (2000). Tanenblatt provided us two spreadsheets that he said came from the GWCC. One had annual economic impact estimates for Atlanta Falcons games. The other had the economic impact for all events held there. Combined, it totaled $10 billion. However, the spreadsheets contained vastly higher estimates for most years than what we saw in the GWCC reports online. For our own edification, we added the estimated economic impacts from each annual report and adjusted the total for inflation, using the federal government’s consumer price index. The total: $7.5 billion. Georgia State University economist Bruce Seaman, who has prepared economic impact studies before, looked at the 2012 report and believes the economic impact is likely between $5 billion and $6 billion. He said the research is difficult and that there are many ways to make errors in these estimates. Seaman said it’s important to have access to internal data when compiling such a study. "If you’re not careful, you’re going to make mistakes," Seaman said. Starting in fiscal year 2011, which covered July 2010 to June 2011, the authority changed its methodology in compiling the report. The changes, according to the 2012 report, reflect the possibility that more out-of-towners who come to the Dome arrive later in Atlanta and leave town earlier. It also reflects that more of them share hotel rooms than believed in previous reports. "Overall, these improved data reduce the direct spending and, thus, the overall economic impact compared to prior studies; however, GWCC believes these results more closely reflect the realities of the Atlanta travel market," Ken Heaghney, the state’s fiscal economist, wrote in the report. Heaghney is recovering from a recent surgery and was unavailable for comment. PolitiFact Georgia shared the spreadsheets Tanenblatt sent us with the GWCC. GWCC communications director Jennifer LeMaster said there was an error in the formula used to create the spreadsheets that they gave Tanenblatt, so the $10 billion estimate in Miller’s column was based on incorrect data. "We regret this error," LeMaster said via email. To sum up, Miller wrote that the economic impact of the Georgia Dome is $10 billion since it opened two decades ago. Miller’s op-ed contained numbers from the GWCC that he and others thought were correct. And Miller has a point that the Georgia Dome has returned billions in economic impact. But not $10 billion as he wrote. The numbers were flawed. And they were broadcast to a sizable audience via an op-ed column. We rate Miller’s claim False.

pomt-10222	"For four days in Denver, the Democrats were afraid to use the words 'Islamic terrorism.'"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/rudy-giuliani/dems-discussed-terrorism-aplenty/	In the public's mind, Republicans have long enjoyed an advantage over Democrats in the area of national security. George W. Bush stressed his homeland security bona fides in 2004 to defeat Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry. This year, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain has based his campaign on the argument that he has the experience and the mettle to defeat terrorist threats to the United States, while Democratic nominee Barack Obama does not. So we can expect to hear a lot more attacks like that delivered by former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., on Sept. 3, 2008. "For four days in Denver, the Democrats were afraid to use the words 'Islamic terrorism,' Giuliani said, referencing the Democratic convention from Aug. 25-28. We won't go so far as to examine the state of the Democrats' emotions — whether they were in fact "afraid" — during their quadrennial conclave, but we have reviewed the 179 speeches delivered there to see how often the Democrats discussed terrorism and it's clear that Giuliani is on shaky ground. Indeed, the word 'Islamic' was never mentioned by the Democrats, perhaps for the reason Giuliani later described in his remarks: fear of offending someone. Muslim-American groups have pleaded with policymakers not to use the term "Islamic" in describing al-Qaida terrorists for fear that it will contribute to discrimination against Muslims in the United States, and because they believe al-Qaida's brand of Islam is a bastardization of their faith. But Democrats did spend plenty of time discussing "terrorism." Some form of the word was mentioned at least 37 times, and by some of the most prominent speakers, including Obama himself, vice presidential nominee Joe Biden, former President Bill Clinton and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. "For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face," Obama said in his Aug. 28 address accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. "When John McCain said we could just 'muddle through' in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of hell but he won't even go to the cave where he lives." To be sure, the Democratic line was more critical of the war in Iraq than McCain has been, disputing Republican arguments that it is a crucial part of the war on terrorism. Obama said he believed U.S. military could be put to better use elsewhere. "I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan," Obama said. In his Aug. 27 speech accepting the vice presidential nomination, Delaware Sen. Joe Biden took much the same line, while also expressing concern about the contribution of religious beliefs to radical anti-Americanism in central Asia. President Bush, with the support of McCain, had ignored "the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism," Biden said. That was a common theme among the Democrats. Pennsylvania Rep. Patrick Murphy said Obama would "finally end the war in Iraq, [and] go after the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and defeat them where they are strongest, in Afghanistan." Nevada delegate Xiomara Rodriguez said that Obama had exercised sound judgment "to oppose the Iraq war from the start and is determined to end the war and bring our troops home and win the fight against the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11." Other Democrats also discussed the terror threat — and the attacks of Sept. 11 specifically. "Think about it: after September 11th, if there was a call from the president to get us off foreign oil to stop funding the very terrorists who had just attacked us, every American would have said, 'how can I do my part?'" said former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner. "This administration failed to believe in what we can achieve as a nation when all of us work together." Giuliani is technically correct that Democrats never used the words 'Islamic terrorism,' but they discussed terrorism plenty. As a result, we find his claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11119	"If you are talking about Canada .. our wine cannot sit on their supermarkets."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/06/kevin-mccarthy/us-wine-barred-canadian-supermarkets/	As tensions rose between two longtime allies over trade, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., took aim at Canadian wine. McCarthy’s interview with CNN’s State of the Union aired as the United States was slapping tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada retaliated with a series of tariffs on U.S. consumer products. "I think what we're finding here is, we are in the middle of a trade discussion," McCarthy said in the June 3 interview. "Nobody wants to be in a trade war. Nobody wins a trade war. But we are standing up for the process of where we're moving forward that we have fair trade. If you are talking about Canada, look what they do when it comes to our dairy products. Look what it — our wine cannot sit on their supermarkets." Does Canada really bar U.S. wine from its supermarkets? Short answer: The whole country doesn’t, but the United States is challenging a rule in one province, British Columbia, at the World Trade Organization. The British Columbia rule McCarthy’s office pointed us to a province-level policy enacted by British Columbia in 2015 that limits sales of wine in grocery stores to products made in British Columbia. The U.S. began challenging this provision under President Barack Obama. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, only British Columbia wine may be sold on grocery store shelves. The only way supermarkets can sell imported wine is in a physically separated area with its own cash registers. British Columbia’s rules "discriminate against U.S. and other imported wine by allowing only B.C. wine to be sold on regular grocery store shelves," the U.S. Trade Representative said in announcing its action. "Such discriminatory measures limit sales opportunities for U.S. wine producers and provide a substantial competitive advantage for BC wine." Other countries that have complained about the rule include Argentina, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand and the European Union, according to the Toronto Globe and Mail. Discriminatory rules also prevail in Ontario and Quebec, according to the Wine Institute, a U.S. trade association. So McCarthy is referring to a real phenomenon, though one limited to a province. U.S. wine still dominant in Canada When we checked in with experts on U.S.-Canada trade, they added some additional context. First, even with the restrictions, the U.S. wine industry leads foreign wine sales in Canada. About 69 percent of Canadian wine sales in 2017 were imports. The United States ranks first among all nations for imported wine sales in Canada, totaling 504 million Canadian dollars in 2016, or roughly $388 million at American exchange rates. The United States accounted for 21 percent of all imported wine sales in Canada that year. And according to the Wine Institute, the United States sells more wine to Canada than to any country other than the European Union. That’s no small feat, said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. "The U.S. exports almost as much wine to Canada as to the E.U., with about a tenth of the population in Canada compared to that of the E.U.," Burkhart said. Second, experts said that government-run liquor stores are probably the predominant source for wine sales, especially for foreign wines that are not discriminated against in such outlets. "U.S. wines sell widely in Canada through the government controlled liquor stores," said Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo. The offerings at such stores as "larger and more comprehensive." Dan Trefler, who teaches at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, noted that in his province, Ontario, there are 8,553 supermarkets, but only 70 currently sell wine. That’s less than 1 percent. In fact, Trefler said, "grocery store wines are typically the cheapest wines and are bought by people who would not likely pay extra for high-quality U.S. wines. If Ontario opened up grocery stores to U.S. wines, it would have virtually no impact on U.S. exports to Canada." As it happens, the ability of U.S. wines to compete aggressively in Canada was made possible by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Prior to the agreement, "government wine stores marked up U.S. wine by 50 percentage points more than Canadian wine," Trefler said. "This was a massive trade restriction. The FTA eliminated that restriction." If NAFTA was terminated, he added, "Canada could consider reinstating the 50 percentage point differential. McCarthy has chosen to emphasize a minor irritant when he could instead emphasize the great job NAFTA has done in knocking down Canadian barriers to U.S. wines. Ending NAFTA will likely hurt U.S. wine producers." Our ruling McCarthy said, "If you are talking about Canada .. our wine cannot sit on their supermarkets." He’s referring to an official U.S. government complaint about a provincial rule affecting how wine is sold in British Columbia supermarkets. However, that rule is not in force across Canada, and it’s worth noting that the United States sells a whole lot of wine in Canada despite the rule, including in government-run stores that do not discriminate against imports.

pomt-12775	"When the House wants to stop Enterprise Florida ... they’re hurting our rural communities."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/feb/22/rick-scott/war-florida-house-about-enterprise-florida-gov-ric/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott and House Speaker Richard Corcoran are at war over the future of state agencies that promote tourism and provide corporate incentives to recruit jobs. In an unusual venting session with reporters in Tallahassee on Feb. 7, Scott attacked House Republicans for proposing a bill that would kill Enterprise Florida and Visit Florida. (Since that time, Corcoran has proposed slashing Visit Florida’s budget but not kill it.) "When the House wants to stop Enterprise Florida, they are hurting our poorest communities. They're hurting our rural communities," said Scott, a Republican. We went in search of evidence to determine if Enterprise Florida helped rural communities. (Scott also mentioned poor communities, but that is more difficult to assess without a definition, so we set that aside for now.) It’s possible that some of the companies offered incentive deals would have created jobs anyway. And experts told us that these job gains cited by Scott’s administration are small, even for counties with lower populations. Enterprise Florida’s hot water, explained There is evidence that deals by Enterprise Florida, a quasi-governmental agency largely funded through tax dollars, don’t always amount to jobs. In January, a joint report by the state Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability and the office of the state’s chief economist criticized many of the programs. They either "underperformed," had been "unable to achieve job goals" or had "inadequate reporting requirements," according to the report. Most of the incentives money was awarded to existing Florida businesses that have over 1,000 employees, according to the report. Chief economist Amy Baker told state legislators in January that nearly 70 percent of state-level incentive and investment programs lost money during the past three years. We wanted to know the picture for rural areas. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, which tracks created jobs, sent us data showing 2,048 jobs had been created in rural counties as a result of Enterprise Florida incentive projects since Scott took office. There are some caveats about this data — including a 12- to 18-month lag for companies to report the number of jobs created and for the state to confirm the numbers. Here are a few examples of incentive projects (some with familiar, big-store names): In Taylor County, an agreement with Buckeye Technologies resulted in 38 jobs and state spending of $7.4 million as of 2013. In Columbia County, an agreement with Target resulted in 257 jobs and the state spending nearly $1.8 million as of 2012. In Gilchrist County, an agreement with Ice River Springs Marianna, a bottled water manufacturer, resulted in 35 jobs and the state spending $69,900 as of 2013. In Jackson County, an agreement with Family Dollar Services, Inc. resulted in 440 jobs and the state spending about $2.3 million as of 2012. The department also sent data showing that private-sector employment in most rural counties increased between 2010 and 2016, with Columbia County leading the way. The growth mirrored the state and national economy as the country recovered from the recession. Unanswered question: Did incentive money create jobs? Even though some jobs in rural counties did materialize, Scott can’t prove that they were created only as a result of Enterprise Florida’s involvement. "It is never valid to point to aggregate economic trends as a way of justifying incentive programs, because incentives are too small and touch too few employers to be a credible cause of broad employment trends," said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a labor-funded resource center that tracks subsidies. We tried to get to get an idea of how many new jobs in rural counties could be the result of government assistance, and Moody’s analyst Kwame Donaldson offered to crunch the numbers. (He defined rural counties as those which don’t include one of the 22 metropolitan areas. That means Donaldson counted 23 counties while the state counted 29.) By Donaldson’s count, there were 48,000 more jobs in rural counties since January 2011, a 25 percent jump. The growth was higher than growth in metro areas, he added. The state claimed responsibility for 2,048 jobs — or around 5 percent of 48,000. That’s not significant compared with the natural growth of rural areas, Donaldson said. "Florida’s rural counties have had an exceptional level of job growth, and if 95 percent of this growth occurred without state intervention, than the rural growth rate would have been exceptional even without the Enterprise Florida projects," he said. Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at business-backed Florida TaxWatch, said he believes the state Department of Economic Opportunity and Enterprise Florida help rural areas. A small economic development project can go a long way for impact in a small county, he said. "But if it is ‘enough’ or if taxpayers are getting a positive return on rural efforts is hard to answer," he said. To the workers and their families who have those jobs, they are significant, said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "Relevant to the size of Florida’s economy overall the number may seem small," he said, "but compared to the size of some of these rural communities they matter much more." However, a state report by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity and Enterprise Florida shows that very few of incentive programs affected rural or poor areas of the state. Of 107 projects with executed agreements in 2015-16, five programs were in distressed areas that include rural and urban communities. "These projects have committed to create 408 new jobs and are expected to invest more than $110 million into these areas," states the report. Note that is a commitment to create those jobs -- they haven’t necessarily materialized. While Scott claims that Enterprise Florida has helped poor and rural communities, Florida’s job growth rate has lagged behind the national average between 2007 and 2015, which overlaps with Scott’s tenure and his predecessor Gov. Charlie Crist, according to an analysis by the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times shortly before the presidential election. (The newspapers are partners behind PolitiFact Florida.) During the same time period, the poverty rate increased in the majority of Florida counties at a greater pace than the nation. The Times/Herald did a comprehensive review of Scott’s overall jobs record in 2013 and found despite promises of millions of tax breaks and incentives, few of the promised jobs materialized. Our ruling Scott said, "When the House wants to stop Enterprise Florida ... they’re hurting our rural communities." There have been some jobs created in rural areas through Enterprise Florida projects. Those jobs certainly help those workers. But Scott’s claim over-hypes the consequences of ending Enterprise Florida’s incentives for rural communities. Job gains through Enterprise Florida projects have been relatively small compared with overall job growth in those counties. Nonpartisan reviews of incentive programs don't prove that rural communities rely on Enterprise Florida for economic stability. Finally, Scott can’t prove that the jobs would not have materialized without the state money. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9f2438cb-cfce-489a-90c5-3537b025eeb5	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2017-02-22T06:00:00	2017-02-07	['None']
pomt-06769	Says Texas schools have had "massive increases" in class sizes with Rick Perry as governor.	false	/texas/statements/2011/aug/19/arne-duncan/arne-duncan-says-class-sizes-texas-have-grown-mass/	The nation’s education secretary says Texas students have struggled on Gov. Rick Perry's watch. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Al Hunt touching on the new Republican presidential candidate, Arne Duncan said: "Far too few of their high school graduates are actually prepared to go on to college. I feel very, very badly for the children there." Duncan, the former chief executive officer of the Chicago public schools, continued: "You have seen massive increases in class size. You’ve seen cutbacks in funding. It doesn’t serve the children well. It doesn’t serve the state well. It doesn’t serve the state’s economy well. And ultimately it hurts the country." The college-readiness of Texas high school graduates is a rich topic. For instance, The Dallas Morning News, citing a report, noted Aug.ust 17, 2011, that a majority of Texas high school graduates who took the ACT college-entrance exam this year lacked the skills to pass introductory college courses in math, reading and science. Too, the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature did not provide billions of dollars in state aid to school districts that the schools would have fielded for enrollment growth under existing funding formulas. We wondered if Duncan was accurate about Texas seeing massive increases in class size. Some background: A 1984 overhaul of Texas education laws capped the size of classes in kindergarten through fourth grade at 22 students per teacher, though districts were permitted to request waivers. According to the Texas Education Agency, 168 of the state’s 1,000-plus school districts were granted a waiver in 2010-11, a total that has not changed much year to year, according to agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe, who told us most waiver requests are sought for one or two campuses in a district. This year, Republican legislators made a push to let districts automatically have some classes exceed the limit; it did not pass into law. After asking the U.S. Department of Education how Duncan reached his conclusion, we checked Texas class sizes for each school year from 2005-06 — about halfway through Perry’s decade-plus as governor — through 2009-10, the latest year of available data recorded by the state on its Academic Excellence Indicator System. The annual reports list average class sizes for every elementary grade, including classes combining students from different grades, plus high school classes in English/language arts, foreign languages, mathematics, science and social studies. We saw little change over those years. For example, kindergarten classes averaged 19.3 students in 2005-06, bumped up to 19.5 students in 2006-07, then dipped to 18.9 students in 2007-08 before averaging 19 students in 2008-09 and 19.3 students in 2009-10. Among the grades affected by the 22-1 class-size mandate, fourth-grade classes were the biggest in 2009-10, at 19.9 students. Over the previous four years, fourth-grade classes ranged in size from 19.3 students in 2005-06 to 20.2 students in 2006-07. Fifth- and sixth-grade classes averaged 21 to 22 students over the five years, while mixed-grade classes averaged up to 25.7 students, in 2005-06. In 2009-10, high school class sizes ranged from an average of 17.8 students in English/language arts to 20.4 students in social studies. Over the four previous years, the size of the classes averaged 19.6 students to 22.5 students. So, there was no massive ballooning, the figures suggest, with early elementary classes remaining smaller than required by law. We wondered if classes were bigger than in 2000-01, the year Perry became governor. That year, according to the state, classes in kindergarten through fourth grade were slightly smaller, on average, than in 2009-10, with the biggest difference in first grade, which averaged 18.1 students then, 19.1 in 2009-10. Classes in all but one higher grade, including each of the high school subjects, were larger in 2000-01 than in 2009-10. Mixed-grade classes averaged 23.2 students then, 24.7 students in 2009-10. By email, Ratcliffe said the state education agency is "perplexed" by Duncan’s claim. We failed to connect with Duncan, though a spokesman for the Houston school district called us, he said, at the nudging of a Duncan aide. Jason Spencer said the Houston district, which serves about 200,000 students, has not experienced massive class-size increases to date, "but heading into this fall, it’s safe to say we will have an increase in at least some class sizes." Houston’s teacher workforce is down 400 from last year, Spencer said, even though student enrollment is expected to stay steady. He said the reduction is due to fallout from the state budget. Perry signed that budget into law this summer. "We are looking at having fewer teachers and a growing student population," Spencer said. "That means a higher student-to-teacher ratio." It makes sense that the size of some classes could grow as districts adjust to teacher cutbacks. But Duncan’s statement says classes have already grown massively, a claim contradicted by state figures indicating elementary school classes might be slightly bigger than they used to be — and some high school classes are smaller than they were in earlier years. We rate the secretary’s claim False.	None	Arne Duncan	None	None	None	2011-08-19T17:02:11	2011-08-18	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-08981	"Illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/16/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-immigration-costs-georgians-more-/	In a recent campaign commercial, candidate for governor Nathan Deal said he's concerned about "you." And for your sake, he worries about illegal immigration. In the ad, the former U.S. congressman walks along a lush meadow hemmed by a wooden fence, promising to get tough on illegal immigrants because they cost you far too much. "Illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year," said Deal, who has long pushed for more restrictions on citizenship and aggressive enforcement of current immigration laws. More than $1 billion? Is that possible? The Deal campaign said the actual cost is even higher: $1.6 billion. They cited a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that shares Deal's ideas on immigration. In its October 2008 report, "The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Georgians," FAIR estimated state and local costs related to the education, health care and incarceration of illegal immigrants. Deal actually understated FAIR's figure. The group put the total cost at more than $1.6 billion. We decided to take a closer look. Illegal immigration is a complex subject, and its fiscal impacts can be especially murky. Researchers have tried to estimate costs for two decades, but it's hard because important data is not available. Few nonpartisan sources issue alternative fiscal estimates that focus on Georgia, in part because it's hard to get enough state-level data to do the subject justice. Another problem is these studies are issued by groups with agendas, said Jeff Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center, which tries to "improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation." It does not take positions on policy issues. "I can tell you what the result is based on who's doing the study," Passel said. There is some consensus on the subject, according to a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office. The agency reviewed 29 studies on the issue and determined some areas where they agree. For instance, if you lump legal and illegal immigrants together, they as a group bring in more in taxes than they use up over the long term, according to the CBO review. Also, the federal government doesn't give state and local governments enough to cover the cost of illegal immigration. FAIR's estimate of $1.6 billion was based on assumptions that are well outside such areas of consensus, PolitiFact Georgia found. And that's a problem. Education was the biggest cost in FAIR's estimate, and one factor in their calculation is especially controversial to advocates on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum: FAIR included the cost of educating U.S.-born children whose parents came here illegally. FAIR argues that it's important to count them. Those kids wouldn't be here if their parents hadn't entered the country, and they would likely leave if their parents did. That's correct, but it's reasonable to ask whether it's right to include the price of educating these children as part of the cost of "illegal aliens," as Deal put it. The Constitution's 14th Amendment says any child born in the U.S. is a citizen. If you exclude these kids, FAIR's estimate plummets by hundreds of millions of dollars. Another criticism concerns how the group adds up the price of educating a child of an illegal immigrant for a year. They said it is $8,450, based on figures from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. This cost is debatable. The price of adding a student or two, legal or otherwise, to an already-existing classroom might be much lower than FAIR's figure, experts said. That's because those students won't necessarily prompt a school district to hire an additional teacher or build a new school. It also might be greater. For instance, a small town dealing with a major influx of children of illegal immigrants might have to build more schools and pay for other things they didn't need before, Passel said. There are other reasonable criticisms of FAIR's approach. FAIR derived a portion of its health care costs from what may be a billion-dollar overestimate. The think tank RAND Corp. estimated that nationally, the government pays about $1.1 billion to give health care to illegal immigrants ages 18 to 64. FAIR assumed the actual cost is closer to $2 billion, nearly double the RAND figure. They reasoned that one of the study's authors publicly acknowledged health care costs could be twice as much. But in a PolitiFact Georgia e-mail exchange, that researcher wrote FAIR got what he said wrong, and the estimate shouldn't be doubled. It's also worthwhile to note how FAIR counted the tax contributions of illegal immigrants. It's standard practice for economists to give individuals credit for paying business taxes, said Matt Gardner, executive director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has progressive or liberal leanings. Every consumer routinely pays business taxes when they make purchases, because businesses boost their sales prices to cover them. FAIR did not include the business taxes paid by illegal immigrants, saying that including them "posits that companies do not exist as economic entities," said Jack Martin, FAIR's special projects director. These are only a few criticisms of FAIR's numbers. But taking even one of them into account can lower or raise the cost by $800 million or more. For instance, FAIR calculated the net fiscal effect of illegal immigration on Georgia as $1.34 billion, taking into account $273 million they said the undocumented pay in taxes. But if you subtract the cost of educating the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, the estimate plummets to about $550 million. And here's another example: Even FAIR thinks its 2008 figures are too low. A report issued last week increased their cost estimate to about $2.4 billion, based on new population figures and changes in how they incorporate criminal justice, health care and infrastructure costs. Whether you think FAIR's estimates are high or low, correct or erroneous, you run up against the same problem. A little more information or context and the estimate swings by a billion dollars, literally. The variation is so wide and the assumptions are so contentious that it's misleading for Deal to flatly state that the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying Georgians is more than $1 billion. It is correct that Georgia foots the bill for illegal immigration. It could be substantial, depending on how you add it up. And while Deal's cost figure is rooted in data, there's an excellent chance that it's much higher than it should be. It's not possible for PolitiFact Georgia to calculate a specific cost. Too little information exists on the subject for that calculation. Deal has a point, but his conclusion leaves out important details, which could lead to a different conclusion. For this reason, Deal's statement earns a Half True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-07-16T06:00:00	2010-07-06	['None']
pomt-09365	"Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch, as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/31/cliff-stearns/cliff-stearns-cuba-china-oil-drilling/	Longtime Ocala U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns, a proponent of increased oil and natural gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, says drilling may be coming near Florida's shores whether we like it or not. "Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch, as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast," Stearns says on his campaign Web site. Stearns' point -- that if Cuba is going to drill anyway, why shouldn't we -- is obvious. But are his facts right? First some background. In 1977, Cuba and the United States negotiated maritime boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico and the waters south of the Florida Keys, called the Florida Straits, according to the U.S. Department of State. The boundaries, called Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), give countries special rights of exploration and marine usage. Mexico, Cuba and the United States all have Exclusive Economic Zones in the Gulf of Mexico, and Cuba and the United States control the Florida Straits. You can see a map of the boundaries here. When it comes to oil, Cuba decides who drills in its EEZ -- and the money and oil that may come from it -- and the United States controls who can drill in its territory. The United States currently bans drilling in much of the eastern Gulf of Mexico (including waters within 234 miles of Tampa Bay, and 300 miles from Naples), and all of its portion of the Florida Straits. But on March 31, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed to open new areas to oil and gas exploration along the eastern seaboard south of New Jersey and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico within 125 miles of Florida's coast. U.S. drilling would still be banned in the Florida Straits under Obama's proposal. Now onto Cuba, the heart of Stearns' claim. Cuba's maritime boundary in the Florida Straits extends to within 45 miles of the Florida Keys, as Stearns suggests. Cuba, unlike the United States, has no drilling moratorium. Its EEZ includes a total of 74,000 square miles, and is broken down by the country into 59 areas. In 2002, Cuba's state-run oil company, Cubapetroleo (often called Cupet), started leasing individual areas to foreign oil companies in both the Florida Straits and the Gulf of Mexico for exploration. So far, Cuba has leased 15 of the 59 areas, said Jorge Pinon, a former oil executive with Shell and Amoco who is an expert on Cuba's energy sector and a former energy fellow with the University of Miami's Center for Hemispheric Policy. The areas leased include the waters just north and to the northwest of Cuba. The waters closest to the United States have not yet been leased. Who holds the rights to the areas? Oil and gas companies based in Spain, Norway, India, Malaysia, Venezuela, Vietnam and Brazil. But not China. China has an onshore, land-based lease in Cuba but not an offshore lease, Pinon said. A February 2008 analysis by the Congressional Research Service backs this up. "While there has been some concern about China's potential involvement in offshore deepwater oil projects," the report read, "to date its involvement in Cuba's oil sector has been focused on onshore oil extraction in Pinar del Rio province through its state-run China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation." However, that could be changing. The China National Petroleum Corporation is negotiating a lease for four areas in the waters northwest of Cuba, Pinon said. The areas under negotiation are among those northwest of Cuba, farther away from the United States. Is there drilling happening, now? "No," Pinon said. Here's why: The decades-old embargo between the United States and Cuba makes oil production much more difficult for Cuba (which now imports about two-thirds of its oil from Venezuela). Under terms of the embargo, Cuba would not be able to send its oil to the United States to be refined into gasoline and other petroleum products. And the companies drilling off Cuba's coast wouldn't be able to rely on American parts and machinery for drilling. "Cuba doesn't have refinery capacity," Pinon said. "That oil should come to the U.S. gulf coast where we have refineries where we can process that crude oil. But the embargo doesn't allow that." Trying to linking China and Cuba when talking U.S. oil policy is nothing new. In 2008, then-Vice President Dick Cheney told the board of directors of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that "oil is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of Florida. But we're not doing it, the Chinese are, in cooperation with the Cuban government. Even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply." Cheney, who said the information came from a column by George Will, later walked back his remarks. So did Will, as part of a correction. Stearns' Congressional office, realizing Cheney's misstatement, noted that Stearns said that "Cuba wants to let China" drill, not that China is drilling. The distinction is important. Spokesman Paul Flusche also said the information on Stearns' campaign Web site hasn't been updated since 2008, so the information could be out of date. On this point, it really isn't. Stearns' statement, when it comes to specifics, is a little sloppy. He said: "Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch, as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast." Cuba is negotiating a lease with China for offshore oil exploration, but it's not in the "very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch." Cuba controls its own offshore, just like the United States. And the Chinese lease wouldn't be 45 miles from the Florida coast. The areas closest to the United States haven't been leased yet. But he's right in suggesting that Cuba could end up drilling closer to U.S. shores than America currently allows in its offshore waters. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-14175	"Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2, are killed before they are born."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2016/apr/26/trent-franks/arizona-congressman-claims-almost-half-all-african/	U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., has been active in the nation’s capital recently, lobbying for legislation he introduced that would ban abortions based on race or gender. Critics say the proposed ban is "stereotyping," as women seek abortions for a multitude of reasons, such as financial constraints. Franks presented a series of abortion statistics at an April 14 House subcommittee hearing on the legislation, called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, or PRENDA. "Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2 are killed before they are born, which is a greater cause of death for African-Americans than heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS and violence combined," Franks said. The congressman’s matter-of-fact claim intrigued us, so we decided to check it out. Limited data Franks’ spokeswoman, Destiny Edwards, referenced multiple reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, for his claim. Because Franks is talking specifically about abortion, we did not account for babies who may die as a result of domestic violence, for example, before birth. Guttmacher notes that African-American women accounted for an estimated 37 percent of the 1.21 million total abortions performed in 2008. That would in theory translate to 447,700 abortions. That same year, according to the CDC, 670,809 African-American babies were born. But Guttmacher’s abortion data is based on surveys with women and abortion providers. It is not a complete picture. Plus, total abortions dropped to about 1.06 million in 2011, but Guttmacher doesn’t have updated demographic breakdowns, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said. The CDC’s data is similarly imperfect. As we’ve noted in a previous abortion claim from PolitiFact Florida, the CDC does not have a complete record of abortions. Most states require hospitals, facilities and physicians to report all abortions to a central health agency. But not every state reports this abortion data to the feds -- and they’re not required to either. The data also leaves out more than 20 states, including Arizona, California and Florida. According to the CDC’s 2012 data, the most recent available, the abortion ratio for non-Hispanic African-American women was 435 abortions per 1,000 African-American live births. But Nikki Mayes, a CDC spokeswoman, said that interpreting the ratio as a percent wouldn't be fair. Live births exclude stillbirths and miscarriages. According to the Mayo Clinic, 10 to 20 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. The second half of Franks’ claim, comparing other causes of death, is even more complicated. CDC data is split among leading causes of death between African-American men and women. For African-American men, the leading causes of death are heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (23.3 percent) and accidents (5.5 percent). Diabetes accounts for 3.9 percent of deaths and HIV, not AIDS, makes up 2.1 percent. For African-American women, it's heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (22.6 percent) and stroke (6.4 percent). Diabetes among African-American women account for 4.6 percent of deaths, while accidents make up 2.8 percent of deaths. Our ruling Franks said, "Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2 are killed before they are born." Data suggests a disparity in the number of abortions performed on African-American women than other races. But saying that "between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies" are aborted goes beyond the limits of the data. Federal data doesn’t account for all 50 states, and fails to factor in pregnancies that end in a miscarriage. Private data is based on surveys and is years out of date. We rate Franks’ claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/495aa314-3469-48b1-9c22-2a846a816891	None	Trent Franks	None	None	None	2016-04-26T18:00:00	2016-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-01931	U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn has avoided taking a stand on Obamacare.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/27/washington-examiner/nunn-cautious-not-mum-obamacare/	Michelle Nunn has kept a mostly low profile during this year's primary election season, correctly gauging that she had the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate sewn up. Her pre-primary television ads were upbeat, talking about her work with former President George H.W. Bush’s Points of Life Foundation and even life lessons she learned from her grandma. That has left GOP operatives and political pundits to pore over her every statement, and they have. They’ve been particularly eager to pin her down on the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which Republicans know is a polarizing issue. The Washington Examiner on June 9 wrote that Nunn has avoided addressing the Affordable Care Act. It’s a strategy that’s also gleaned attention from The Washington Post, The New Republic, The Associated Press and others. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look at whether Nunn can be accused of dodging and weaving on the ACA. Nunn, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, easily defeated three challengers in the May 20 Democratic primary. She has received national funding from Democrats, who hope to win a seat in what is still a mostly conservative state controlled by Republicans. In November, she will face either U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston or businessman David Perdue, who are in the GOP’s July 22 runoff. Our first step was to determine what Nunn has said publicly. Nunn has said multiple times that she doesn’t support repealing the ACA. She's embraced the widely viewed positives of the law: coverage for pre-existing conditions and expansion of parents’ health care coverage to children to age 26. She also has identified specific problems in the law -- namely that premium rates aren't always affordable and that families are sometimes given less choice concerning their insurance plans. Her stance is clear on this point: Georgia and Gov. Nathan Deal should have accepted Medicaid expansion under the ACA. Where the pundits say she’s been evasive is on the question of whether she would have voted for the ACA in 2010. Some would say she has dodged that question like Floyd Mayweather weaving away from a right hook. "At the time the Affordable Health Care Act was passed, I was working for Points of Light. I wish we had more people who had tried to architect a resolution," Nunn said to an MSNBC reporter in May. "I think it’s impossible to look back retrospectively and say, ‘What would you have done when you were there?’ " She was later zinged by MSNBC News Chief Chuck Todd for those comments. "It just doesn’t come across as credible," Todd said of her statement. "Nothing screamed practiced politician like that answer." A quick look at the "Ideas" section of her campaign website shows no mention of health care. Her campaign links to a few news articles that mention the law, but none of her press releases or news links mention it in their headlines. That’s in stark contrast to the other two candidates, who both list "Repeal Obamacare" prominently on their campaign websites. During a primary debate in Cobb County, Perdue called the ACA "the worst thing in American history legislatively." Kingston says the law "has been a failure." Nationally, the ACA has been a political quagmire for candidates. Do they fall with the vocal critics? Or do they stand with the law of the land? And that’s arguably an even tougher call in Georgia, where 50.8 percent of residents still oppose the law and 45.2 percent support it, according to the 2014 Georgia State of the State poll. We asked Kyle Kondick, the managing editor for the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball blog, for his take. "The state, in many ways, determines the messaging," Kondick said. "It’s no surprise to me that she’s dodging that question." The typical strategy for Democrats in red states, such as Georgia, is to depict themselves as middle-of-the-road candidates while painting other candidates as unlikable, Kondick said. That might work for Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat also running for the Senate and facing a similar challenge on whether to support or denounce the controversial law. She faces a Kentucky electorate that is not as diverse as Georgia’s, and her response has been to remain quiet on the issue. But in Georgia, there are still a lot of Democratic and minority voters, which means Nunn can’t stray too far right. "You can’t run exclusively like a Republican because how are people going to come out and vote for you?" Kondick said. "You’re threading the needle." Nunn deflects the hypothetical questions – after all, she wasn’t in Congress to vote for or against passage of the ACA. Instead, she makes generic accusations of dysfunction among legislators. "Folks in Washington need to stop playing political games and come together and fix what's wrong with the law, and preserve the parts that are working," Nunn said in a statement to Healthcare Georgia, forwarded to PolitiFact by her campaign. But has Nunn done "cartwheels" (gone of out her way) to avoid taking a stand on the controversial law? Nunn doesn’t prominently discuss health care on her website or in her stump speeches, despite its wide-ranging implications for the state. She refuses to say how she would have voted when Congress passed the ACA in 2010, but unlike her opponents, she said she would not vote to repeal the law. While she does list some of the problems with the law, she has yet to propose specific solutions on her website or in person. Nunn has been evasive on some aspects of Obamacare but has been very specific on other areas, such as Medicaid expansion. We rate the overall statement as Half True.

pomt-08193	"Seven more people will die each and every day until the Legislature ratifies these (pain clinic) rules that are being approved by the Board of Medicine and the Department of Health."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/24/mike-fasano/mike-fasano-says-seven-people-day-die-using-prescr/	In 2009, Florida lawmakers agreed to regulate many of the "pill mills" that fuel an epidemic of prescription drug abuse. Those regulations were set to take effect Nov. 28, 2010, for most pain clinics. But they were stalled by a new law intended to crack down on expensive state regulations. The law, approved Nov. 16 when the Legislature met in a one-day session to override eight vetoes by Gov. Charlie Crist, requires legislative approval of rules that have a measurable fiscal impact on commerce. The state Department of Health now must determine whether the new rules exceed the threshold and require a legislative sign-off -- if they have a $1 million adverse impact over five years on economic growth, competitiveness, employment, investment, job creation or regulatory costs. For now, the upshot is that the rules are stalled. What will happen in the meantime? "What's going to happen is nothing," said Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey. "And seven more people will die each and every day until the Legislature ratifies these rules that are being approved by the Board of Medicine and the Department of Health." Fasano was a sponsor of the pain clinic legislation that cracked down on facilities freely dispensing medications being used by drug abusers who were doctor-shopping. Fasano also was critical of the Legislature for passing the new rule-making bill, arguing it needed more study. For this item, we wanted to examine the scope of the problem. Is Fasano correct that seven people die each day from prescription drug abuse? Fasano was referring to a 2009 study by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that tracked which drugs were identified in deceased people. The study shows Fasano is correct: 2,488 people died in Florida with at least one prescription drug listed as the cause of death. That works out to an average of 6.8 people per day. The drug that caused the most deaths (1,185) in 2009 was oxycodone, a strong pain killer. That was followed by benzodiazepines, which are used to treat stress, anxiety and seizures (1,099), methadone (720), alcohol (559), cocaine (529) and morphine (302). Compared to previous years, prescription drug abuse is significantly higher. In 2005 -- the earliest report on the FDLE website -- oxycodone was only responsible for 340 deaths. That's nearly a 250 percent increase in four years. Benzodiazepines, the drugs used for stress, were listed as the cause of death for 574 people. One drug that showed a significant drop was cocaine. In 2005, it resulted in 732 deaths, or about 200 more than last year. Prescription drug deaths have exploded so much that FDLE did not list them as a separate category in 2005, though past reports noted the steady increase of oxycodone-related deaths. It's worth noting that the report lists all deaths related to prescription drugs -- not only people who got their drugs from pill mills. "There's no way of telling if they specifically got their meds from a pain clinic," said Capt. Robert Alfonso, head of the Pinellas County Sheriff's narcotics unit. "The only thing we can really quantify is that people are dying from prescription medication." Besides clinics that freely dispense hundreds of pills each day, Alfonso also listed prescription fraud as a major problem. People who write fake prescriptions for pain pills can entirely bypass a clinic and head straight to pharmacies. "There are just so many different aspects of this that are causing problems," he said. Of course, the rise in prescription-related deaths coincides with an explosion in pain clinics. Take two examples from South Florida. The Palm Beach Post reported that 30 new pain clinics opened in Palm Beach County from 2007 to 2009. And in Broward County, clinics swelled from four in 2007 to 115 in 2009. So it's logical -- but not precise -- to link the soaring number of deaths with the growth of pill mills. Fasano, an advocate for cracking down on unscrupulous pain clinics, underscores his argument for more regulation with an attention-grabbing statistic: an average of seven people die each day from prescription drugs. The numbers from Florida's top law enforcement agency bear him out. However, not all of the prescription-related deaths originated at pill mills. Experts say that figure is hard to quantify. We rate Fasano's statement Mostly True.	None	Mike Fasano	None	None	None	2010-11-24T18:21:54	2010-11-23	['None']
pomt-13147	"Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot smart, intelligent men to stay home, too."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton/clinton-exaggerates-trumps-campaign-strategy/	With a little more than a week until Election Day, Hillary Clinton attacked what she called Donald Trump’s strategy to keep groups of people away from the polls come Nov. 8. "Donald Trump's strategy is real simple," Clinton told a crowd Oct. 29 in Daytona Beach, Fla. "They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too." Has Trump’s campaign really said that? It turns out Clinton is referring to news articles that quote anonymous Trump advisers who say the campaign's strategy is to keep Clinton supporters home on Election Day by ratcheting up her negatives. Suppression? More like voter depression Clinton’s campaign pointed to news reports that quote anonymous Trump officials. The first example is a Bloomberg Businessweek article from Oct. 27 that takes readers behind the scenes of Trump’s marketing operations. The article quotes a senior Trump campaign official saying that the campaign has "three major voter suppression operations under way." The article doesn’t offer any more details about the source other than the fact the person was a "senior official." According to the Bloomberg story, the suppression operations are targeting white liberals, young women and African Americans through radio spots, social media and targeting specific neighborhoods. What specifically is Trump telling those groups? Clinton’s 1996 remark where she suggests some African-American males are "super predators" is being used in social media posts aimed at discouraging African-Americans from voting. The group of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and degraded by Hillary Clinton are meant to dismantle young women’s positive views of Clinton and so on. This isn’t the only article that quotes an unidentified Trump adviser making a similar claim. Trump’s "advisers" told the Wall Street Journal the campaign is trying to "depress Democratic voter turnout." After news broke of Trump’s 2005 lewd comments about sexual assault and women, the Trump campaign implemented a "scorched earth strategy" to keep voters home on Nov. 8, the Wall Street Journal reported. Just like what was reported in the Bloomberg article, Trump advisers told the Wall Street Journal that Trump was looking to use the attacks over Clinton’s email server and allegations about her husband to keep Clinton supporters home on election day. There’s also a Yahoo News article with a similar story from another unidentified source. Caveats There are caveats that come with Clinton’s claim. First, we can’t independently verify if Trump officials said these things. Trump, himself, has said not to trust articles that don’t name specific sources. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Also, publicly, Trump has gone to great lengths to court women and African-American voters. He has called for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and tax credits for child care. And he has tried to attract African-Americans by touting his business plan, saying the Clinton and Democrats have failed. "What the hell do you have to lose?" said Trump, asking for black voters' support. Further, experts say what the media reports are describing are not all that shocking or atypical. In some ways, Clinton is describing modern-day politics warts and all. Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University, who has worked as a political media consultant for presidential campaigns, said it’s likely that Trump’s campaign is trying to curb Clinton voters with negative campaigning. He said this is not unusual because modern politics based in negativity is an inherent part of campaigns, adding that negative campaigning "discourages the hell out of all voters." If you look at Trump’s strategy as negative campaigning, then it seems that Trump is not trying to suppress voters, but depress them. Our ruling Clinton said, "Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too." That’s leaving a lot of details out. Trump never literally told women, young people, people of color and "intelligent men," to stay home on Nov. 8. Clinton’s remark refers to news articles that quote anonymous sources from the campaign saying the strategy is to reduce turnout for Clinton by targeting specific groups of people, including young people, women and people of color. Yet Trump himself has tried to woo women and African-Americans on the campaign trail and said anonymous-sourced stories from his campaign should not be trusted. Lastly, experts say what Clinton is describing is a fairly typical type of negative campaigning. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08066	Four out of 10 homicides are committed by gun in this city.	true	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/23/sam-adams/portland-mayor-sam-adams-says-four-out-10-homicide/	Portland Mayor Sam Adams has thrown out a number of statistics in pitching his five-point plan to reduce gun and youth violence in the city. But this number stuck out: He said at a council session that "four out of 10 homicides in this city are committed by gun." PolitiFact Oregon would think the number higher. We checked with Roy Kaufmann, the mayor’s spokesman, who responded with a 39-slide PowerPoint presentation by the Portland Police Bureau. Slide 4 shows that from 2007 to 2010 there were 101 homicides in the city. Of those, 42 involved firearms. On-the-job officer-related shootings are not included. Here’s the breakdown by year, according to police: 2007: 29 homicides, 13 involved firearms. 2008: 27 homicides, nine involved firearms. 2009: 21 homicides, nine involved firearms. 2010: 24 homicides, 11 involved firearms. Because we were curious to know how others died in those years, we decided to check The Oregonian’s in-house library for our own list of homicides. And we came up with this rendering, again, excluding officer-related shootings: 2007: 29 homicides, with 13 involving firearms, four were stabbed, three died of head injuries. 2008: 27 homicides, nine involved firearms, a dozen were stabbed. 2009: 21 homicides, nine involved firearms, six were stabbed, and the remaining six died of strangulation, drowning, head trauma, bludgeoning, vehicular homicide and a stopped heart. Finally, we checked the Portland Police Bureau’s news releases to track this year’s homicides so far. 2010: 25 homicides to date, 11 involved firearms, seven people were stabbed and two were strangled. The deaths reported in our review adds up to 102 homicides, of which 42 involved firearms, or a ratio of 4.1 out of 10. All figures back up the mayor’s claim. About four of 10 homicides in the city involve guns. Knives and other cutters come in second, with nearly three of 10 homicides. Here’s the takeaway point: Portland is different from the rest of the country. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, firearms accounted for 67 percent of 13,636 homicides in 2009. Knives and other sharp cutting instruments accounted for 13 percent. We also asked Jeff Bock, the Oregon Uniform Crime Reporting manager with the Oregon State Police, to check homicide causes in other cities in the state. Again, firearms led the way, with knives and other sharp tools trailing behind. Of 373 homicides 2006-2009 in Portland, Gresham, Beaverton, Hillsboro, Eugene and Salem, nearly half involved firearms and 25 percent involved knives or other sharp-edged instruments. We find the statement made by Adams to be True. Comment on this item.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2010-12-23T06:00:00	2010-12-01	['None']
pomt-07785	A 2005 gay pride vote "had nothing to do with discrimination."	false	/florida/statements/2011/feb/21/tom-scott/tom-scott-says-2005-vote-against-gay-pride-events-/	With two seemingly divergent votes on gay rights, Tampa mayoral candidate Tom Scott is facing heat from both liberals and conservatives. Gay rights groups lambaste Scott for his 2005 vote as a Hillsborough County commissioner to ban the county from acknowledging or promoting gay pride events. Conservative groups condemn the city councilman for voting in 2009 to add transgender protection to Tampa’s human rights ordinance. Asked about the apparent contradiction during the St. Petersburg Times-Bay News 9 debate on Feb. 8, 2011, Scott said the 2005 vote "had nothing to do with discrimination. I oppose any kind of discrimination in any form." We asked him again on Feb. 11 about the vote. "The issue was spending public dollars to advocate or advertise gay pride," he said. Scott is trying to make a distinction between issues like housing or employment discrimination and support for gay pride events. He highlights his recent vote and says he wants to be a mayor who represents everyone. We wanted to dig deeper into Hillborough's policy. Does it have anything to do with discrimination? It began in 2005 when then-County Commissioner Ronda Storms saw a display at a county library promoting Gay Pride month. Storms, who is now a state senator, worried about passing the display with her kids and having to explain it to them. On June 15, 2005, Storms made the following motion at a county commission meeting: "I move that we adopt a policy that Hillsborough County government abstain from acknowledging, promoting or participating in gay pride recognition and events, little g, little p." Scott seconded the motion. It passed 5-1. Storms followed up with a second proposal that the policy can only be rescinded with a super-majority vote and a public hearing. The lone 'no' vote came from Kathy Castor, now a Democratic congresswoman. During the brief discussion of the proposal, she said, "I think it's inappropriate for government to promote discrimination." We asked Nadine Smith, director of the gay rights group Equality Florida, if she thought the policy has anything to do with discrimination. "The vote in 2005 was simple, mean-spirited bigotry," she said. "It was indefensible." She added: "Were he to ask for my advice, I would tell him you should just apologize for what they did. Say, 'What we did was wrong. We singled out one class of citizens to be treated differently.'" County Attorney Renee Lee interprets the policy as banning county funds from going to gay pride events. Participation as a board is also prohibited, though individual commissioners can do as they like. The policy also means the board cannot acknowledge a gay pride event with a resolution or proclamation. "We have not had any recent instances where the board has had to invoke the use of that policy," Lee said. Lee deferred to Scott when asked if the policy was discriminatory. Hillsborough's refusal to support gay pride events is not legal discrimination. Federal and state laws prohibit unfair treatment in housing, employment and public accommodations based on a person's race, national origin, religion, gender, disability, age or martial status. Neither federal nor Florida anti-discrimination laws include a sexual orientation provision. The gay pride policy was challenged in federal court by strip club owner Joe Redner. The two sides settled in 2007, agreeing to update the policy so it shall not "be construed to prevent citizens from exercising their First Amendment rights in an appropriate forum." So the policy is unquestionably legal. But does it involve discrimination? Let's check out a few definitions: The Florida Commission on Human Relations: "The unfair treatment of a person or group on the basis of prejudice and without regard to individual merit." Webster's New World Dictionary: "A showing of partiality or prejudice in treatment; specifically action or policies directed against the welfare of minority groups." The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says discrimination involves treating someone "unfavorably" because they are a member of a protected class of people. (Once again, federal law doesn't include gay people as a protected class.) Basically, it's differential treatment of a person or group — not based on merit but because the person belongs to that group. Hillsborough County issues scores of resolutions each year lauding groups and community leaders. It also supports several so-called "pride" events each year. A 2006 county newsletter reads in part, "Every year, Hillsborough County helps recognize Hispanic Heritage month…" The county is also listed as the top partner of the upcoming Asia Fest 2011. The county in 2007 issued a proclamation honoring the bicentennial birthday of Confederate commander Robert E. Lee. But the 2005 policy precludes the county from issuing a similar commendation of a gay pride event. "The difference would be you're talking about a race or culture versus a sexual orientation," Scott said. He noted the county doesn't promote heterosexual pride events. Added Tampa family values activist David Caton: "Being Hispanic is not a changeable position. There are, however, people who have left the homosexual lifestyle. There’s a huge difference in recognizing a group of people based upon their lifestyle." Whether homosexuality is a lifestyle choice is, itself, also a topic of continuing debate. In an online fact sheet, the American Psychological Association says, "no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation." We understand gay rights is a tough political issue. It touches on religious and cultural beliefs that run the gamut from liberal to conservative to somewhere in between. Reasonable people have legitimate disagreements on the topic. Regarding the 2005 vote, many parents were uncomfortable with a gay-themed book display in a public library. Many people think the vote is good public policy. According to federal and state laws, the policy is not discrimination. But Scott is wrong in casting the 2005 issue as being just about "spending public dollars" and "had nothing to do with discrimination." The county won't even recognize gay pride with a resolution or proclamation as it does for other groups. The policy does involve discrimination. A group of people is treated differently. They aren't treated differently because of individual merit. They're treated differently because they belong to that group. We rate Scott's statement False.

pomt-12758	"The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/25/donald-trump/why-donald-trumps-tweet-about-decline-national-deb/	In an early morning tweet Saturday, President Donald Trump echoed a post on a fringe website claiming that the national debt has decreased by $12 billion since Trump took office. "The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.," Trump posted on Twitter Feb. 25, 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet mirrors an article posted on the Gateway Pundit website a few days earlier. It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trump’s tweet. "On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion," the Gateway Pundit website reads. "On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office!" The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury. But, experts say, people shouldn’t read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne. "Considering that Trump hasn’t enacted any fiscal legislation, it’s a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels," Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us. "Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns," he said. The White House did not respond to our query for this fact-check. Looking at the debt numbers Trump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is "debts held by the public," which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else. On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion. On Feb. 23, the debt held by the public figure dropped to $14.38 trillion. Here’s a chart that shows debt figures on selected days since Trump took office.

But experts say it’s likely to shoot back up any day. "I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about," said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel. "This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future?" Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, "both matters that he has not affected one iota." Added Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor and author of The Debt Ceiling Disasters: "No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all. There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number." Donald Marron, Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute, speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obama’s administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently. On Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, the federal government had a cash operating balance of $382 billion, according to the Treasury Department. By Feb. 22, the cash balance had dropped to $228 billion. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion." Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is "down" after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise. This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11995	"If you pass the so-called Dream Act, it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/26/tom-cotton/sen-tom-cotton-misleads-claim-about-dream-act-amne/	Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., claimed a current immigration bill directed at young immigrants in the country illegally could become the biggest amnesty ever granted in the United States. NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Cotton about President Donald Trump’s discussions with Democrats to help nearly 800,000 so-called "Dreamers," beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Trump is phasing out. What’s needed is a "targeted and incremental deal" that solves the Dreamers’ problem but also mitigates negative side effects, said Cotton, who introduced his own bill to reduce chain migration and prioritize American workers. Legislation proposed by his colleagues would have a different outcome, he said. "If you pass the so-called Dream Act, it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty, which Ronald Reagan said was his biggest mistake in office," Cotton said Sept. 17. Immigration scholars do consider this 1986 law to be the biggest yet allowing immigrants to legalize their status. But is Cotton right that the Dream Act would overtake it as the biggest "amnesty" program ever? Cotton’s claim is not just based on how many people would directly benefit from the bill, but also includes an assumption of how many additional family members could indirectly benefit. In addition, the comparison to the 1986 law is skewed, experts said. 2017 Dream Act Legislation intended to help immigrants who came to the United States as children and live here illegally has been brought up in Congress several times but never enacted. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (Dream Act) was first introduced in the Senate in 2001, seeking to help young immigrants who met certain criteria attain higher education and lawful permanent residence. The term "Dreamers" is commonly used for potential beneficiaries of the Dream Act or similar measures, including DACA. Cotton’s office told us his comment was in reference to a 2017 Dream Act bill introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill. The nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute estimated the effort could lead to 1.5 million immigrants receiving lawful permanent residence. The Graham-Durbin bill would grant immigrants without criminal records and who meet specific criteria a conditional status for eight years. Immigrants who meet additional requirements (such as certain levels of educational attainment, military service and employment) would become eligible for lawful permanent residence. Potential beneficiaries must have arrived in the United States before they were 18 years old and lived here four years or more. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that about 3.3 million people meet the criteria for age at arrival and length of U.S. residence. It breaks down that figure, calculating that about 1.8 million are immediately eligible for conditional status and 1.5 million eligible for legal permanent residence. Cotton’s office said the problem is that recipients will then be able to sponsor relatives. "The 2017 Dream Act is not limited to DACA recipients … Those who receive green cards will then be able to sponsor their illegal-immigrant parents (who came illegally with the children) for (a green card)," said Caroline Rabbitt, Cotton’s communications director. Lawful permanent residents cannot sponsor a parent for a green card — only U.S. citizens can do that. But lawful permanent residents can eventually apply to become naturalized citizens. If each of the 1.5 million immigrants sponsors one parent, then total amnesty would be over 3 million people, said Rabbitt, adding that this is a probably a low estimate because "statistical studies have found that immigrants eventually sponsor between 1.11 and 3.46 family members on average." 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act What constitutes amnesty is hotly debated, but Cotton said he defined amnesty as "giving legal status to people who came here illegally." Cotton’s estimate is that at least 3 million people could go from living illegally to legally as a result of the Graham-Durbin bill. Based on those calculations, is that greater than the number of people who benefitted from the 1986 law? Not exactly. Republican President Ronald Reagan signed into law the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. The law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards — including people who had been in the United States since 1982 and special agricultural workers. "While those 2.7 million went on to sponsor family members as well, the ones they sponsored would not have been illegal beforehand, as would be the parents of DREAM Act beneficiaries," Rabbitt said. That’s not accurate, several immigration experts told us. "There was no prohibition in the 1986 law against sponsoring family members who were in the United States illegally," said Ann Lin, associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Since immigration categories did not distinguish between family applicants of IRCA and other family members of other eligible green-card holders and citizens, there are no estimates of the number of derivative sponsorships by IRCA principals, Lin said. The claim from Cotton’s office is "completely implausible," said Elizabeth F. Cohen, an immigration expert and associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. "Not only did plenty of people eligible for IRCA have relatives living in the United States without documentation, but at that time the unlawful presence bars had not yet been passed (those came in 1996) so they could have been sponsored by IRCA recipients if they left the country," Cohen said. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act placed three- and 10-year bars on legal re-entry for individuals who initially came to the United States illegally. Immigrants who entered the United States illegally cannot adjust their status within the country; they must go through a consular process in their home countries. A policy under Reagan and George H. W. Bush after the 1986 law also led to legal status for family members of IRCA beneficiaries, said Audrey Singer, an immigration expert and senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Back in 2013, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, argued that the 1986 law gave amnesty to 3 million people and that through family reunification policies, an additional 15 million were able to gain legal status. King’s overarching claim was that the 1986 law led to 15 million votes for Barack Obama in 2012. We rated that False. "The 2.7 million people who gained legal status through IRCA did so as ‘principals’ — that is, they were the applicants. The appropriate comparable number for DACA is roughly 1.5 million," Lin said. Counting family applicants of Dreamers, but not the family members of IRCA recipients inflates Dream Act totals and underestimates IRCA totals, she said. Experts also cautioned against assuming that every single person eligible for the Dream Act will end up applying. Pew Research Center estimated that about 78 percent of the DACA-eligible population applied for the program. Some people choose not to apply for programs, and some get weeded out at different stages of the application process, so it’s not realistic to assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between eligibility and the number of green card holders the bill would produce, said Lina Newton, associate professor of political science at Hunter College, CUNY. "In light of past policy experience and current immigration laws it is very unlikely that the Dream Act — at least in its present form — would produce a legalized population of 3 million," Newton said. Our ruling Cotton said, "If you pass the so-called Dream Act, it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty." A 1986 law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards. Immigration experts regard this law as the biggest yet to provide legalization for people who were in the country illegally. A 2017 Dream Act bill in the Senate is estimated to allow about 1.5 million people to become eligible for green cards. Cotton calculated that if each of the 1.5 million people eligible for a green card through the Dream Act were to sponsor a parent who’s in the country illegally, then the total number of people legalizing their status would be at least 3 million. But 1986 law beneficiaries also were able to sponsor family members who had been in the country illegally, though it’s difficult to determine how many exactly, experts said.

pomt-14503	"So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/feb/23/gavin-newsom/mass-shooting-claims-newsom-pan-rated-mostly-false/	Editor's Note: We’ve received questions about our Mostly False rating on this fact check, with some saying we relied on a definition of mass shooting that’s too limited. As we stated in the fact check, there is no legal definition for this act of violence. We agree there’s room for interpretation about how many deaths or injuries should constitute a mass shooting. And we’ve added the perspective of gun control advocates to this fact check to convey that sentiment. We maintain, however, that the statements we fact checked used the most overly broad definition of this type of crime, a definition that goes beyond what the average person would consider a mass shooting. What is a mass shooting? There’s no legal definition. But a key congressional report defines it as a shooting that kills four or more people. Think Columbine. Virginia Tech. San Bernardino. From 1999 through 2013, there were about 21 mass shootings each year in the United States, according to a congressional analysis of FBI data. Roughly four took place annually in public settings, like at schools, restaurants or workplaces. Another 17, on average, took place in private homes or other locations. More recent FBI data was not available. But recent claims by California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan say hundreds of mass shootings took place — in 2015 alone. "So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days," Newsom said in a Dec. 5, 2015 email promoting a gun control initiative he’s introduced. Newsom references the San Bernardino mass shooting in his email. That attack killed 14 people, injured 22 others and took place on Dec. 2, 2015. Pan added in a press release on Jan. 19, 2016 that "there were more mass shootings in America where four or more people were killed, than there were days in the year in 2015." We wondered: Did mass shootings in America somehow skyrocket from about 20 annually to more than 300 overnight? Or were Newsom and Pan using a definition of this kind of crime that reflects a different view of reality? Newsom is running for California governor in 2018. He has introduced a gun control initiative for the November ballot that would require most Californians to pass background checks to purchase ammunition. Pan, who represents the Sacramento region, recently proposed legislation that would require the state to track gun deaths. Both are Democrats. Newsom’s claim Let’s dive into the lieutenant governor’s statement first. He made the claim that there had been more mass shootings than days in 2015 on Dec. 5, or day 339 that year. Representatives for Newsom and the Courage Campaign said the politician, in making his claim, relied on news reports that cited gun violence tracking websites, including what was until recently known as ‘Mass Shooting Tracker.’ That website, now known as ‘Gun Violence Archive,’ used crowd-sourced information and a much broader definition of mass shooting than the congressional report. It counted mass shootings as any incident, anywhere, in which at least four people were shot, but not necessarily killed. By early December 2015, Mass Shooting Tracker reported there had been 353 mass shootings in America so far that year. Criminologists told us the website’s broad definition lumps in more shooting categories, such as gang-related crimes or robberies, than typically associated with mass shootings. Several said this is purposely done to inflate the statistics. David Kopel is a professor at Denver University’s Sturm College of Law. He has written several books from a gun rights perspective. "The problem with the way Gavin Newsom is using this pseudo data is it’s out of context and is done in a way which is calculated to cause confusion," Kopel said. "When people hear the term mass shootings, I think what they think of are things like the San Bernardino attacks or the Newtown crime. … By that definition, the number is far, far smaller." Gun control advocates say there’s no good reason to require that four people die before calling a crime a mass shooting. Using that threshold, they point out, would mean a February shooting in Kansas in which three people were killed and 14 were injured would not be considered a mass shooting. "It is arbitrary to distinguish between a death and an injury," said Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. "We shouldn’t have to be waiting outside a hospital room to see if the victim is going cling to life to call it a mass shooting." Freilich said the definition for a mass shooting should be an incident in which a dangerous person is able to shoot four or more other people, regardless of whether anyone is killed. State Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, left, talks with fellow lawmakers at the Capitol. Associated Press file photo. Pan’s claim State Sen. Richard Pan's claim was "there were more mass shootings in America where four or more people were killed, than there were days in the year in 2015." When contacted by PolitiFact California, a spokeswoman for Pan said the press release from the senator’s office mistakenly omitted the full definition used by the shooting tracker website. She then issued a new press release with Pan quoted as saying a mass shooting is defined as four or more people "shot or killed." Pan relied on news reports that cited the shooting tracker website to back up his claim, the senator’s spokeswoman said. Again, the experts told us, that website tracked far more than what would be considered mass shootings. "Once you drill down through the data, you find that there are very different particular reasons for those shootings, or for those injuries," said Ryan Getty, a professor of criminal justice at Sacramento State University. Getty said the data might be derived from a family shot "trying to defend their home against home invaders." But, instead, "people just assume that it’s events like what happened in San Bernardino." As PolitiFact Florida reported, "Politicians or others who want to make a point about guns choose a set of data and a definition that reinforces the point they want to make. People who want more gun control tend to choose more expansive definitions." "Those who want to create a sense of crisis over the violence will tend to use lower cutoffs, while those who want to minimize the problem will use higher cutoffs," Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, told PolitiFact Florida, which evaluated a similar mass shooting statement. William Krouse of the Congressional Research Service authored the report "Mass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013." That’s the report that shows about 21 mass shootings took place per year, using the stricter definition of at least four people killed. Krouse said federal data for the past two years is not widely available. But, he added, USA Today’s tracking of this type of crime is the best available. It shows 18 mass shootings took place in 2014 and 25 last year. Our ruling Following the shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people and injured 22, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan claimed that hundreds of mass shootings took place in 2015. They used an extremely broad definition of mass shooting — one that includes incidents in which people are shot but no one is necessarily killed. A key congressional report defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are killed. Criminologists say this definition is more in line with events like the shootings at Columbine, Virginia Tech or in San Bernardino. As we said at the beginning, there is no legal definition for a mass shooting. The California politicians chose a broad definition by using a crowd-sourced website that better fits their gun control goals. We rate their claims Mostly False.

pomt-09149	While in Congress, Nathan Deal was a leader when it came to protecting our borders.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/11/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-hes-leader-immigration/	During his campaign for governor, Nathan Deal has repeatedly cited his work on immigration issues as a U.S. congressman as evidence he has leadership skills. He brought it up in May during a gubernatorial debate in Gwinnett County. Fox Business TV host Neil Cavuto said Deal "led the fight against illegal immigration in the House" during an April 29 interview. And when fellow Republican Karen Handel challenged him to prove he was a leader on the issue during his 17-year tenure, he reiterated the point in a news release. “While Karen Handel was busy preparing her resume to run for Secretary of State or Governor, Nathan Deal was leading in Congress to protect our borders." The release outlined five of his accomplishments as proof. We will analyze these points one at a time. Deal "led the fight" to require citizenship verification for recipients of Medicaid services under the health care overhaul signed into law this year. He led the fight, but he didn't win it. Deal was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce in July 2009 when he offered an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 that would have required citizenship verification for people applying for and renewing their Medicaid benefits. The proposal was narrowly defeated, 29-28. Deal was "lead sponsor" of legislation to prevent automatic citizenship for babies born in the United States to illegal immigrants. Yes he was, again and again. We found four instances in which Deal sponsored bills that would end this path to U.S. citizenship: the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009; the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2007; the Citizenship Reform Act of 2005; and the Citizenship Reform Act of 2003. Even before Deal began sponsoring these birthright bills, he supported similar congressional efforts. He was a regular co-sponsor of such resolutions starting when he took office in 1993. He did so for 10 years before he began to sponsor the bills himself. None of the bills passed. Deal "authored and passed" a law that requires that the citizenship of Medicaid applicants be verified. Deal and the late U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood of Augusta share credit for this successful measure, which attracted widespread media coverage in 2005 and 2006. They introduced this provision as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, a massive budget bill that trimmed funding for entitlement programs. It required that Medicaid recipients show proof of citizenship when they apply for benefits or renew them. Deal was a "longtime leader" in the U.S. House of Representatives' Immigration Reform Caucus. The Immigration Reform Caucus is a group of more than 90 U.S. congressmen, almost all Republicans, that advocates for placing more restrictions on illegal immigrants and immigration, as well as taking a more aggressive approach to enforcing existing laws. Deal was a member of the caucus and was mentioned in a March 2007 Roll Call article as leading its team on birthright citizenship, a cause he has supported since 1993. We have found articles mentioning his membership in the group dating to 2001. The group was founded in May 1999. Deal worked "hand-in-hand" with Norwood on the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act, which proposed to allow local law enforcement to assist federal authorities in enforcing immigration laws. This bill "became the origin" of the 287(g) program of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which delegates some immigration law enforcement power to certain state and local law enforcement agencies. Yes. And no. Deal did work closely with Norwood on the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act, according to Greg Louer, who served as Norwood's policy director, and James R. Edwards Jr., a fellow for the conservative Center for Immigration Studies who consulted Norwood on the bill while he was with the conservative think tank the Hudson Institute. They fought for it for years. It was introduced four times, starting in 2003. While the bill never passed, it became influential, Louer said. Portions of its language appeared in as many as 20 similar bills. Deal's campaign argues CLEAR "became the origin" of the 287(g) program, and that it in turn opened the door for the March arrest of Kennesaw State student Jessica Colotl. Colotl entered the country illegally when she was 10 and was taken into custody and cited with immigration violations after she was unable to produce identification during a March traffic stop. Her case has since become a flash point for immigration policy debate. But CLEAR did not originate the 287(g) program. It was named after a section in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 -- seven years before the first CLEAR bill was even introduced. State and local law enforcement agencies began participation in 2002, one year before Norwood submitted the first CLEAR bill to Congress. Yet while CLEAR never made it into law, its popularity among conservative lawmakers did pressure ICE to beef up the 287(g) program, Louer and Edwards said. The program received additional funding. More law enforcement agencies signed up to take on immigration enforcement roles. Plus one of the legislation's major goals -- to improve information sharing on immigration violations between the federal government and local law enforcement -- was adopted administratively by ICE during the later years of the Bush administration. So was Deal a leader on immigration reform while he was in Congress? He certainly was consistent. His approach on illegal immigration stretches back to his first year in Congress. He was also persistent. He was willing to press issues such as birthright citizenship repeatedly. Deal is also recognized by a nationally known immigration watchdog group as taking a lead on the issue. "He certainly was one of the leaders," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. And while his success changing actual U.S. immigration law is limited and his campaign's portrayal of the CLEAR bill's influence over the 287(g) program is incorrect, Deal did play a notable behind-the-scenes role beefing up immigration enforcement. We rate this claim to be Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-06-11T06:00:00	2010-04-30	['Nathan_Deal', 'United_States_Congress']

pomt-08694	"By the year 2015 (Medicaid will) take up half our budget."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/08/pam-bondi/bondi-says-medicaid-will-eat-half-state-budget-201/	Medicaid is a massive chunk of the state's budget, and Florida's next chief legal officer will play an important role in fighting Medicaid fraud. Pam Bondi, the Republican candidate for attorney general, said in a July 31, 2010, Bay News 9 debate that "by the year 2015 (Medicaid will) take up half our budget." We wanted to check: Is it really going to eat up half the state's budget in just five years? But first, some background on Medicaid we pulled from a March 23, 2010, Truth-O-Meter item on Bill McCollum, Florida's attorney general who has since lost the Republican primary for governor. McCollum claimed that the cost for the Medicaid expansion under the new health care reform would be a $1.6 billion a year increase for Florida, which PolitiFact ruled Half True. Here is what PolitiFact said then: "Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) To get into Medicaid, you have to be not only poor, but also disabled, elderly, pregnant or a child. The new law changes that, opening up Medicaid to all of the poor, setting the limit at people who make less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Currently, that means a single person who makes $14,404 or less, and a family of four that has income of less than $29,327. "Medicaid is actually a voluntary program, so states do not have to participate. But all states do, because the federal government puts up much of the money for the program." Now here's where it gets tricky: Under federal health care reform, the numbers on the Medicaid rolls are expected to rise dramatically. The federal government will pick up the tab for expanding Medicaid for the first few years for the additional poor but the feds aren't picking up the total tab to add those who are currently eligible but not enrolled, said Shelisha Durden and Tiffany Vause, spokeswomen for the state Agency on Health Care Administration. That group of eligible-yet-not-enrolled equals an estimated nearly 200,000 who will be added in the state's 2014-15 fiscal year, according to an Aug. 18 report from AHCA. That addition will cost about $878 million -- of which about $373 million, about 42 percent, will be paid for by the state. Overall by 2014-15, the state predicts adding about 1.2 million people to the rolls. But Bondi hopes to stop the federal health care reform by continuing Attorney General McCollum's lawsuit seeking to block the mandates. "Pam believes the federal health care law is unconstitutional and is committed to continuing Florida's legal challenge," wrote Bondi's campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley. If AGs in Florida and elsewhere are successful, that could put a damper on Medicaid growth -- throwing a wrench into Bondi's claim. But for now, there's no question that the Medicaid rolls are growing -- the only question is by how much. So, back to Bondi's claim that Medicaid will be half the state's budget by 2015. The July 31 debate is no longer online, but Bay 9 News Director Mike Gautreau pulled up Bondi's quote for us: "Medicaid makes up 26 percent of our budget. By the year 2015 it’ll take up half our budget. And we have to do everything we can to fight that in South Florida, in north Florida, everywhere it’s prevalent and I have the experience of fighting fraud and taking up for businesses and consumers, for 20 years." We reached out to state agencies with expertise on Florida's budget -- including Medicaid. First, let's discuss what we received from AHCA. The agency provided the details on the current fiscal year 2010-2011, showing Medicaid expenditures are about $20.2 billion in a state budget of about $70.4 billion. That means for this year, Medicaid represents 28.69 percent of the state budget. The state's chief economist, Amy Baker, sent us to a report about Florida's financial outlook between 2011 and 2014 that also cites the 28 percent figure and states: "Medicaid is the second largest single program in the state budget behind public education, representing 28 percent of the total state budget, and is the largest source of federal funding for the state." The report from Baker has a chart on page 78 that shows the anticipated growth in caseload: from the 2.7 million average monthly caseload for 2009-10 to 3.3 million in 2013-14 due to federal health care reform. Alan Levine, an expert on Medicaid and a former head of Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, said that chart doesn't tell the full story because the addition to the Medicaid rolls happens in January 2014 -- half way through the state's fiscal year -- so the full impact won't be seen until the following year. As for cost, the $20.2 billion for fiscal year 2010-11 is now projected to climb to $25.08 billion in 2013-14 -- about $2 billion of that is due to the federal health care reform. Baker said she did not have a figure for Medicaid total cost in 2014-15 and cautioned against trying to project such an amount beyond three years. We also asked the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research -- the folks who create economic forecasts for Florida -- for overall state budget projections through 2015. Since it's Baker's business to project budgets, we asked her advice for the best method to project the proportion of the state budget that Medicaid would eat up by 2013-14. Baker suggested two methods: First she said we could assume a no-growth rate in the total state budget, which is $70.4 billion for this year. So Baker divided $25.08 billion -- the anticipated Medicaid budget for 2013-14 -- by $70.4 billion -- the total state budget. The result: Medicaid would eat up about 35.6 percent of the state's budget under a no-growth scenario in the state budget. But Baker said we know the state budget probably will grow based on the recent past. She said taking into account the past 10 years -- which included both boom and bust years -- the state's average growth rate in the overall budget would be 3.3 percent. So if we project 3.3 percent increases in the $70.4 billion budget for three years, we'd have a state budget for about $77.6 billion in 2013-14. Then if we divided $25.08 billion -- the anticipated Medicaid budget for 2013-14 -- by the $77.6 billion figure, we get 32.3 percent. So under either a no-growth or average-growth scenario in the state budget, Medicaid would equal about one-third of the budget by 2013-14. "When you are trying to look at a budget, it gets pretty speculative when you get out more than three years,'' Baker said. "The three year plan -- the long-range financial outlook is what we think is a reasonable window for making good projections. " Now let's examine what Bondi's campaign sent us. -- Kirtley sent us the "Florida Medicaid Modernization Proposal" from January 2005. It projected the Medicaid cost at 35 percent of the budget in 2009 and 59 percent in 2015. But that was wrong. Even in 2010, Medicaid is still only 28.6 percent of the budget. -- The campaign sent us the link to the Oct. 7, 2009, House/Senate joint Medicaid estimating conference. That one projected Medicaid spending at about $18.2 billion in 2010-11. That was off also; Medicaid is $20.2 in 2010-11. Kirtley then sent us to Select Policy Council on Strategic and Economic Planning documents from January 2010. We found three reports in January, but none showed Medicaid eating up half of the state budget by 2015: -- A document from Jan. 11 stated that the Medicaid budget for 2009-10 was about $17.9 billion and was expected to exceed $19 billion in 2012-13. But it also states that $19 billion figure doesn't take into account Medicaid reform so it's not particularly useful. -- A document from Jan. 14 didn't contain the word "Medicaid" -- it was about energy exploration. -- A document from Jan. 21 included a chart showing Florida Medicaid within the context of all state appropriations -- 26 percent for 2009-10 and rising to 31 percent in 2014-15. Bondi's campaign also sent us to Levine, who pushed for Medicaid reform in Florida. He recently stepped down after serving as Louisiana's Secretary of the Department of Health and Hospitals and senior health policy adviser to Gov. Bobby Jindal where he did an analysis of Medicaid projections in that state under federal reform. Levine has since taken a job with Health Management Associates in Naples, a company that operates hospitals, as senior vice president of health development operations and government relations. He formerly served as the head of Broward Health, one of the public hospital districts in South Florida. Most of the hospitals serve Medicaid patients, Levine said. Levine said he gave money to Holly Benson, one of Bondi's Republican opponents, in the primary but recently met with Bondi for five hours to discuss health care issues (that was weeks after she made her 50 percent claim.) Levine said his only role in Bondi's campaign is to provide policy input at her request. His bottom-line point is that Medicaid costs are growing, so the percentage could rise quickly. Levine says "it could mean the 50 percent number is even low." But while Levine cites several factors that could cause the cost of Medicaid to skyrocket -- everything from the additional enrollees to the potential of soaring rates for doctors and hospitals to a lawsuit by a pediatric society suing Medicaid arguing they don't get paid enough -- that doesn't prove it will equal 50 percent of the budget. He says Florida should study the impact of such factors and the growth in the rolls on cost in future years. So, back to Bondi's claim that by 2015, Medicaid will be half the state's budget. It's clear that in Florida, Medicaid expenditures are on the rise, and the federal health care reform will bring additional costs. Bondi's campaign cites a projection from January 2005 but that report is outdated and written long before the economic crash in Florida or federal health care reform. And while Levine mentions several variables that could cause Medicaid costs to skyrocket, many of those are predictions and what-if scenarios. Meanwhile, the state's chief economist cautions against predictions beyond a three-year window. The only reasonable projection is that Medicaid expenditures will be around one-third of the state's budget in three years if it keeps growing within the 10-year average. The burden of proof is on Bondi's campaign to back up the 50 percent claim, and the campaign has not done that with current data. All the experts agree it will grow, but there is no current, definitive support for the 50 percent figure. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00604	"America has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/02/ann-coulter/no-us-has-not-taken-14-mexicos-population/	Ann Coulter’s new book Adios America argues that immigration is undermining the country, and she was delighted to give a full-throated defense of her stance in an interview with Univision and Fusion TV journalist Jorge Ramos. The two agreed on virtually nothing, including the most basic statistics. Ramos opened the segment of his show America with Jorge Ramos by telling Coulter that her facts on the number of undocumented immigrants were wrong. In her book, she claimed there are 30 million. The consensus figure is about 11 million. Coulter was unfased. "You’re wrong," Coulter told Ramos. "The number we keep hearing is 11 million, 11 million, 11 million. That’s so weird. It’s been 11 million for a decade. But as I explain in the book, they are all using the Census figures. If the Census figures are wrong, then everybody’s numbers are wrong." Coulter said there is "absolutely no question" that the number is at least 30 million. She said the work of two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and a 2006 analysis by two Bear Stearns financial analysts supported her belief. We’ll touch on those items in a bit. But arguably Coulter’s biggest numerical claim was that "America has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population." She said it during her interview with Ramos and included it as a bullet point on her website. Several readers asked us to dig into that claim. We tried to reach Coulter through her publisher and other channels and did not hear back. However, she gives the source of her figure in her new book. Coulter’s math Coulter zeros in on Mexico to undercut the argument that immigration promotes diversity. "Diversity in immigration ought to mean every country on earth sends the same percentage of immigrants," she writes. In contrast, Mexico provides about a third of all immigrants, and that became her target. In a sub-section titled "Doesn’t Mexico want any Mexicans?" Coulter grounds her statement about America taking in one-quarter of Mexico’s population on a Pew Research Center analysis of census data. The top line number in that study finds that about 33.5 million people of Mexican origin lived in the United States in 2011. Coulter argues that since Mexico has about 120 million people, and one-quarter of that is 30 million, therefore, America has "taken in" one-quarter of the total. Misreading the data In reality, the immigration data from Pew is not nearly as neat and tidy as Coulter concludes. The Pew report attempted to count the number of people who trace their roots back to Mexico, not people who came directly from that country. Why does that make such a difference? Well, about two-thirds of Americans with Mexican ancestry were born in the United States. By definition, they were never part of Mexico’s population. If they weren’t Mexican, they could not be "taken in." The Pew definition is important, and if the numbers about Mexico don’t make it clear, let’s look at another country. We picked Ireland. In 2014, the Census Bureau said there were 34.1 million Americans with Irish roots. That’s nearly seven times Ireland’s current population. One could argue that if the parents hadn’t moved to the United States, the children wouldn’t have been born here. But Coulter offers no analysis and no data on that front. In her framework, a person whose family came from Mexico 70 years ago is just as much a Mexican as someone who arrived yesterday. According to the Census Bureau, about 10.5 million people of Mexican heritage come from families in which both parents were born in the United States. This group is at least second-generation American born. The Pew report found that about 11.6 million people of the 33.5 million total had been born in Mexico, including both authorized and unauthorized immigrants. Estimating the undocumented Tangentially related to this fact-check is Coulter’s suggestion that groups are severely undercounting the number of unauthorized illegal immigrants based on census data. Coulter’s starting point is a 2005 article from two Bear Stearns financial advisors. They set census data aside and looked at things like the rise in money sent back to Mexico and housing permits in three New Jersey communities with growing immigrant populations. The article said the increases were much larger than the official rise in population. The authors did not show how they reached their estimate of 20 million illegal immigrants, but they, and Coulter, emphasized that "the assumption that illegal people will fill out a census form is the most ridiculous concept I have ever heard of." The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration much as Coulter does, disagrees with that last point. In a recent report, the center wrote "It is well established that illegal aliens do respond to government surveys such as the decennial census and the Current Population Survey." "For illegals, we estimate 11 to 12 million with 50 to 60 percent from Mexico," said Steven Camarota, the center’s director of research. Jennifer Van Hook, who directs the Population Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University, said she believes the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants living in the United States is 6.3 million-8.3 million. No matter how you slice it, Coulter’s claim doesn’t get any closer to true, she said. "There is no way it is as high as 30 million," Van Hook said. The Migration Policy Institute estimates the total unauthorized population at 11 million. Director of research for American programs Randy Capps said figures produced by the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey are just the starting point in determining that figure (the Census Bureau itself doesn't create a count). The final estimate reflects a hike of "20 to 25 percent to address the undercount of unauthorized immigrants in the ACS." Capps emphasized that his group, the Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Research Center and the Center for Immigration Studies generally reach the same results because they all tweak the census data. "All four of these sources incorporate an undercount of unauthorized immigrants ranging from 10 to 25 percent," Capps said. Capp’s counterpart at the Pew Research Center, Jeffrey Passel, rejected Coulter’s claim on both methodological and common sense grounds. "It is simply not possible for there to be in excess of 30 million Mexican immigrants in the United States," Passel said. "There are not enough houses available in the country for the 20 or so million more additional Mexicans. Moreover, the Mexican censuses, and surveys are completely inconsistent with such figures." Our ruling Coulter said that America has taken in one-quarter of the entire population of Mexico. Coulter based this on a study that counted all people of Mexican origin in the United States. But Coulter ignored that 65 percent of those were born in America and about a third came from families in which both parents were born in America. Their immigrant status lay at least two-generations in the past, and America couldn’t "take them in" because they were already here. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Note: This claim was fact-checked as one of the donor-benefits tied to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.

pomt-06722	Congressional Budget Office "says 8 (percent) unemployment till 2014!"	true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/31/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-congressional-budget-office-says-/	In an Aug. 24, 2011, Twitter post, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said of the Congressional Budget Office: "CBO says 8 (percent) unemployment till 2014!" We’ll assume the Texas Republican doesn’t consider this fabulous news, though the predicted rate would be about a percentage point lower than the July 2011 national jobless rate of 9.1 percent, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A reminder: The unemployment rate is a measure of the number of jobless people who are available for work and are actively seeking jobs, expressed as a percentage of the labor force. Did Cornyn recap accurately? The nonpartisan CBO’s summary of its latest economic projections says that with "modest economic growth expected for the next few years," the office expects the jobless rate to fall to 8.9 percent the fourth quarter of this year and to 8.5 percent the fourth quarter of 2012. And indeed, the report says, the rate will "remain above 8 percent until 2014." The nation’s gross domestic product grew 1 percent the second quarter of this year after growing .4 percent in the year’s first three months, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in August. According to the CBO forecast, the economy will grow slowly in coming years as the federal deficit shrinks, though the prediction about the deficit assumes, among other things, that Congress will not extend all the tax cuts launched under President George W. Bush and temporarily extended under President Barack Obama. In its full report, the CBO projects the annual unemployment rate to average 8.7 percent in 2012 and 2013, which would be an improvement on the 2010 and 2009 averages of 9.6 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, but would be worse than the 2008 average of 5.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. CBO forecasts the unemployment rate falling to an average of 5.4 percent in 2016 and 5.2 percent in 2017 through 2021, which would be the lowest rate since 2007, when the average was 4.6 percent. The report says the projected 5.2 percent rate in those years would match its expected "natural" unemployment rate for the period. Economists talk about a natural unemployment rate because even in a strong, healthy economy there is always some degree of employee turnover as businesses adopt new technologies and make other staff changes, and as a certain percentage of workers, for various professional and personal reasons, look for new jobs. Things are unsettled now, the CBO report says, with weakness in the demand for goods and services being the "principal restraint on hiring, but structural impediments in the labor market — such as a mismatch between the requirements of existing job openings and the characteristics of job seekers (including their skills and geographic location) — appear to be hindering hiring as well." "Other measures also show a great deal of weakness in the labor market," the report says. "The number of unemployed workers per job opening averaged about 4½ throughout the first half of 2011, down from an average of slightly over 6 in 2009 but still much higher than it was before the recession. In addition, the number of people who are employed part time but want full-time work averaged about 8.5 million in the first half of 2011, slightly below the number in the previous two years but still nearly double the pre-recession figure." The report continues: "Likewise, the share of unemployed people who have been out of work for a long time is unusually high. On average, 44 percent of workers who were unemployed in the first half of 2011 had been jobless for more than six months. Moreover, in mid-2011, 31 percent of unemployed workers had been jobless for at least a year. Those rates of long-term unemployment are unprecedented in the post-World War II era." We’re not judging here who’s responsible for the nation’s unemployment troubles, but how accurately Cornyn echoed the CBO’s projection. His statement rates True.

pomt-00760	"U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/15/addicting-information/liberal-blog-us-cops-killed-more-people-one-month-/	As the country learned about the shooting death of Walter Scott in North Charleston, S.C., a comparison between police in the United States and the United Kingdom began to spread across the Internet. The liberal website Addicting Info put up a graphic under the headline "U.S. Police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century." Other groups made similar claims -- including RT, the English language cable channel financed by the Russian government. According to Addicting Info: U.S. police killed 111 people in March 2015 U.K. police killed 69 people from 1900-present. A reader asked us to check it out. Tracing the source of the data Addicting Information used this eye-catching graphic to tell its story. You won’t find this image on the Addicting Information website any longer. Elisabeth Parker, the author of the piece, explained to us where she got her information. She started with a post that made a similar but not identical claim on Daily Kos, a liberal website. The post’s count of American deaths in March tracked back to a website called Killed by Police. Killed by Police has a singular task. Each time a television station or newspaper reports that a person has died at the hands of the police, the people behind Killed by Police (we don’t know who they are) add a link to the news story in a spreadsheet. When we saw the list for deaths in March, it had 115 entries. We read each news report and found that just about every death, 98 of them, involved a police shooting. There were 16 cases when a person died from other causes, most frequently when police used a taser. One time an officer accidentally hit and killed a person with his car. In a category by itself, an officer in Hawaii got into an argument with a neighbor and killed him, thus becoming a common murderer completely apart from his role in law enforcement. The warning here is the warning with all fact-checks and analysis of police-related deaths. There is no singular, verified U.S. database of police shootings. So all we have are estimates. In this case, University of Missouri-St.Louis criminologist David Klinger said the Killed by Police numbers -- whether you settle on 98, 111 or some other figure -- "wouldn’t be unexpected." Deaths in the United Kingdom So, yes, the U.S. figure for March is plausible. But this claim really hinges on the stat encompassing more than 100 years in the United Kingdom. The fact is, that relies on a Wikipedia list of killings by law enforcement officers in the United Kingdom. "I pored over the Wikipedia entry and realized that some incidents included multiple shootings and adjusted (the) figure to 69 police shootings," Parker said. The problem with that is that Parker had to make two big assumptions: That the list was accurate, and more critically, that it was complete. With Wikipedia, those are assumptions people should not make. In fact, the Wikipedia entry warns at the top that "This list is incomplete." So what’s the real number? Over such a long time horizon -- and in a country whose borders changed (Ireland was part of the United Kingdom until the 1920s) -- it’s really impossible to say. The British advocacy group Inquest has looked at police incidents in England and Wales going back to 1990. By its count, there were 55 police shooting deaths between 1990 and the present. The group reports another 1,453 deaths that had some connection to contact with police. However, the causes range from someone dying of a drug overdose while at a police station, to car thieves killing themselves in a wreck, to suicide while in custody, to excessive use of force by officers. There simply is no way to tease out the details. Comparing police shootings to the American data is the only reliable approach. The only other country in the United Kingdom for which we found hard numbers was Northern Ireland. Between April 2008 and September 2014, roughly a six-year period, members of the Police Force of Northern Ireland discharged their weapons nine times. However, there is no data on whether any deaths resulted. During the times of "The Troubles" from 1968 to about 2000 when separatists, generally Catholics, and unionists, generally Protestants, battled over whether Northern Ireland should break away or remain part of the United Kingdom, there were over 3,000 deaths. Some of those were at the hands of the police. Aogan Mulcahy, a researcher in the School of Sociology at the University College Dublin, walked us through the numbers. The Royal Ulster Constabulary was the police force in Northern Ireland until 2001. Based on an online database, Mulcahy told us that the RUC "was responsible for 55 deaths over the period 1969-2001." We found no information for Scotland. We should note that only the Northern Ireland police regularly carry firearms. In Scotland, Wales and England, the typical officer relies on less lethal equipment such as nightsticks, pepper spray and tasers. In sum, we know Wikipedia’s count is far low, but we don’t know how low. When we alerted Parker to the information we were finding, she retracted her original article and wrote another. Parker wrote that "U.S. police killed more people in one month than the U.K.’s did in an entire year." While the underlying numbers this time are still incomplete, that’s more accurate. Our ruling Addicting Information said that "U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century." This comparison was based on an incomplete Wikipedia list. While hard figures for the number of police-related deaths in the United Kingdom over more than a century are impossible to come by, our research shows the comparison is inaccurate. It’s certainly unproven. That makes it deeply flawed, which means it’s False.	None	Addicting Information	None	None	None	2015-04-15T13:53:14	2015-04-04	['United_States', 'United_Kingdom']

pomt-01072	President Barack Obama’s policies "have resulted in gas prices being reduced from $3.07 per gallon when he was sworn in in 2009 to $2.30 today."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/18/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-low-gas-prices-are-result-obama-polici/	One of the first actions by the U.S. House of Representatives this year was to pass a bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline. House Republicans, who boosted their majority in fall elections, have long said that oil pipeline would fortify the nation’s energy supply and help keep a lid on gas prices. The nearly 1,200-mile pipeline would send up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would be piped to Gulf Coast refineries. But Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, doesn’t buy that argument. He voted against the measure, which President Barack Obama vows to veto if it clears the Senate. In a Jan. 9 news release, Scott noted gas prices are already at their lowest levels in years and added this observation: "Instead of exempting foreign corporations from federal permitting requirements, Congress should be working on policies that diversify our nation’s energy portfolio, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and support the president’s policies that have resulted in gas prices being reduced from $3.07 per gallon when he was sworn in in 2009 to $2.30 today," Scott said. We looked into Scott’s claim that Obama’s policies has resulted in a 77-cent per gallon drop in gas prices since the president’s first inauguration. The numbers We quickly learned that Scott’s figures are wrong. The price of gas increased by about 36-cents a gallon from the start of Obama’s presidency to the time Scott made his statement. On Jan. 19, 2009, the day before Obama was inaugurated, the average national price of regular gas was $1.85 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In December 2008 and January 2009, it remained below $2 a gallon -- the low watermark over the past 10 years. The U.S. was in the teeth of the Great Recession then and analysts largely attributed the low prices to a drop in gas demand. So the price of gas when Obama took office was $1.22 a gallon cheaper than the $3.07 average Scott cited. David Dailey, a spokesman for Scott, told us the congressman’s office made an "honest mistake" by starting the comparison on the drop in gas prices figures on Jan. 21, 2008 -- when records show gas averaged $3.02 per gallon. When Scott made his statement on Jan. 9, the price of gas was $2.21 per gallon. And it’s fallen further since. At this writing, the average price is $2.14 a gallon, the lowest level since May 2009. That’s a steep drop from the highwater mark of $3.94 a gallon in April 2012. Obama’s role Scott’s office reissued the news release on Jan. 12, taking out the numbers but continuing to say the president’s policies "have resulted in gas prices being reduced to lows not seen in years." To back Scott’s contention, Dailey pointed to EIA reports showing that during Obama’s administration, domestic production of crude oil has risen from 5.4 million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2009 to 9.1 million barrels daily in the last three months of 2014. Dailey also cited figures showing that net imports of liquid fuels have dropped during Obama’s term. Dailey said the White House’s insistence on tougher standards for greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency have helped lead to a drop in gas consumption. He pointed to a March 2014 report from the nonpartisan General Accounting Office which says those initiatives "have contributed to reductions in the consumption of petroleum fuels, but the extent is unclear." But Scott’s statements go beyond saying the president’s policies have merely contributed to today’s low gas prices. The congressman said the policies "have resulted in gas prices being reduced to lows not seen in years." That gives all credit to Obama. We spoke to two oil analysts and they both took issue with Scott’s claim. "I would challenge any politician who is saying the recent six-month downturn in gas prices has anything to do with a politician (Obama) who has been in office for several years, who has witnessed a sustained period of high prices," said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, which tracks U.S. gas prices. Government actions typically have little impact on the fluctuation of gas prices, he said. DeHaan credits the increased domestic oil production to decisions by oil companies to invest profits banked just before Obama took office in tapping shale oil deposits in North Dakota and elsewhere. The main factor in the recent price drop, DeHaan said, is a decision by OPEC countries not to cut production to drive up oil demand. OPEC believes the declining prices, left unabated, will make the production of shale oil unprofitable. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told us neither Obama nor any elected official is responsible for the oil shale boom, which he attributes to other factors such as technological advances in tapping oil deposits. "The oil shale boom took place while President Obama was in office, but the production increases had little to do with government policy (other than low interest rates from Fed governors)," Kloza wrote in an email. Kloza, however, does give Obama credit for supporting tough fuel economy standards that he said has contributed to lower prices. "Almost all of what has happened (up and down) for oil within the 2009-to-present period has occurred through capitalism," wrote Kloza. "The president can neither be blamed nor praised for most of the fluctuations." We also point out that beyond rising U.S. production and OPEC’s decision against cutting production, other factors have been cited for lowered gas prices, including economic stagnation in Europe. Our ruling Scott says Obama’s policies have resulted in a 77-cent per gallon drop in the price of gas since the president took office. Scott’s office acknowledges its numbers were wrong. At this writing, gas has actually increased by 36-cents a gallon since Obama entered the White House. That’s because at the time of his inauguration, volatile gas prices had dipped to the lowest levels in the last 10 years. Experts say presidents have little control over the cost of filling your car. Gas prices rise and fall in response to worldwide economic conditions, production decisions made by oil-producing nations, and the investment decisions of oil companies. Obama didn’t cause the roller coaster rise is gas prices that began shortly after his first inauguration, nor did he cause the sharp fall that now thrills drivers. So we rate Scott’s statement False.

pomt-11788	"Pope Francis at Mass: ‘Jesus is Metaphorical, Not Literal."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/22/yournewswirecom/no-proof-pope-francis-said-jesus-metaphorical/	Did you hear what Pope Francis said now? Multiple Vatican cardinals have declared Pope Francis a false prophet after he made yet another controversial statement, according to an article making the rounds on Facebook. "Pope Francis at Mass: ‘Jesus is Metaphorical, Not Literal," says the Nov. 18 headline in Yournewswire.com, a fake news website that says it delivers "news truth unfiltered" and highlights conspiracy theories. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. YourNewsWire.com has made up other stories about famous people, including that Vladimir Putin had said Pope Francis was "not a man of God." The article said that the statement made by Pope Francis "is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements." The article includes various other alleged controversial statements by the Pope and stated he has been "spreading Satanic doctrine." We searched for information about the alleged statement by Pope Francis and found no proof and only other websites repeating the same story. We emailed the contact persons listed on the yournewswire.com website and called the listed phone number, but received no reply. We also attempted to track down a spokesperson for the Holy See and did not hear back. While the Yournewswire.com headline is fictional, in real life Pope Francis has made several controversial statements documented by major news outlets. "He has radically transformed the tone of his office, making a number eye-raising gestures and pronouncements that have liberals cheering and conservatives shaking their heads," the Washington Post stated in 2015. His statements that have drawn debate include the topics of atheism, sexuality, abortion, climate change and divorce. "If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?" he said in 2013. But in this case, we could find no evidence that he uttered the words in the headline, "Jesus is Metaphorical, Not Literal." We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-02957	"The IRS has been specifically forbidden ... from ever actually pursuing either civil or criminal remedies" for people who don’t purchase health insurance.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/25/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-irs-cannot-pursue-either-ci/	With the federal government’s online insurance marketplace floundering in its first month, some political pundits are calling for a delay of the hot-button provision requiring most people to pay a tax penalty if they don’t have health insurance. MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell is not one of them. Ever since the law passed, he has told his viewers to not fear the individual mandate. He said it again on The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell on Oct. 21, 2013 while scolding a White House correspondent. "No one ever really has to pay the fine in the individual mandate," O’Donnell said, "because the IRS has been specifically forbidden, in writing, in law, in the Affordable Care Act, from ever actually pursuing either civil or criminal remedies to collect those fines from anyone. The individual mandate is the only provision in the tax code that was written deliberately to be essentially unenforceable." Don’t believe him? On air, O’Donnell pointed to page 131 of the law, which more or less states exactly what he said about IRS enforcement, or lack thereof, of the mandate. (He actually read the key sections aloud.) In 2014, uninsured taxpayers will pay a pro-rated fine of either 1 percent of annual income or $95, whichever is greater. It goes up each year, and there are more costs for uninsured dependents. There are some exemptions for religious beliefs, prisoners, Indian tribes, certain low incomes and undocumented immigrants. The final bill President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010 included two requirements that essentially yanked out the agency’s teeth in enforcing the mandate penalty. The IRS cannot pursue criminal charges against someone who does not pay the penalty and is supposed to. The agency also cannot file a notice of lien or seize property. "The argument was we don't want the IRS harassing taxpayers to collect the penalty," said Roberton Williams, the Sol Price fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The health care law did not take away the agency’s ability to file a lawsuit against a delinquent taxpayer, though the amount of the penalty is so small that it would not be worth the trouble, said Bryan Camp, Texas Tech University School of Law professor who worked as an IRS lawyer from 1993-2001. The unpaid penalty could conceivably be part of broader legal action against a taxpayer owing a lot more in income taxes, he said, though filing lawsuits is hard enough for the agency because it has to go through the Department of Justice, which has other priorities, he said. The agency does have one way to collect the individual mandate penalty. It's through your tax refund. The IRS will send a notice to taxpayers who are required to pay the penalty but don’t. If the penalty is not paid, the IRS can take it out of a tax refund. Most people received a tax refund between $2,000 and $3,000 this year because their employer withheld too much from their paychecks, Williams said. That can only happen if a taxpayer is getting a refund. If they’re not getting a refund, there’s not much the IRS can do to make people pay the penalty beyond sending a letter. Taxpayers who don’t want to pay the penalty could tinker with the amount withheld from their paychecks so they don’t overpay the IRS, denying the agency the ability to hold back or minimize a refund. But experts said most taxpayers won’t go to the trouble. "It’s a mandate that operates through inconvenience," said Jordan Barry, a University of San Diego School of Law professor who co-wrote an essay with Camp examining whether the mandate is really mandatory. "It’s basically right that you could avoid this if you wanted to." The penalty will still be in IRS records, but not paying it won’t hurt your credit report because there will be no notice of lien on file, said Jaime Vasquez, a tax attorney at the Houston law firm Chamberlain Hrdlicka. "There’s interest that will grow on it, and if you’re getting any future refunds, those refunds will go toward offsetting that penalty plus any interest that has accrued in the meantime," he said. It will take time and possibly legal action to resolve some of the more complicated issues surrounding how the IRS can enforce the penalty, including an Obamacare tax "rollover," said Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. We asked the IRS to fill us in on any regulations the agency adopted to enforce the mandate, but the agency did not get back to us by deadline. Our ruling Experts said O’Donnell’s point is pretty accurate: The IRS cannot use its most effective collection weapons -- the threat of jail time or seizing of property -- for the individual mandate penalty. But the law did not take away its power to pursue lawsuits against delinquent taxpayers, though experts say it isn’t likely given the small size of the penalty and current difficulty of filing suit outside of tax court. Plus, for taxpayers who overpay their income taxes and don’t pay the fine, the IRS could extract the penalty from a taxpayer’s refund. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11890	"The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen."	false	/texas/statements/2017/oct/25/travis-forward/travis-forward-pac-inaccurately-says-proposed-coun/	Proponents of Travis County transportation and parks bond proposals on the November 2017 ballot made an enticing pitch to older homeowners in a mailer, telling them that their taxes are frozen and they won’t pay more if the bonds pass. Travis Forward, a pro-bonds PAC, said in an October 2017 mailer: "The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen." Readers asked us to check if the propositions won’t raise their taxes and also whether property taxes are frozen for homeowners 65 or older. We put the mailer’s claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. The "freeze" claim is inaccurate, Travis County officials quickly said to our inquiries, and it’s inaccurate to say the propositions won’t cost taxpayers anything extra. Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, who voted with colleagues to place the two bond propositions on the ballot before helping to kick off the privately funded Travis Forward campaign, speculated that consultants behind the mailer assumed the county, like the Austin school district, provides tax freezes to homesteading homeowners 65 or older. "No doubt, this is inaccurate," Eckhardt said by phone. "To the extent I am responsible, I fall on my sword." By phone to our inquiry, Marya Crigler, chief appraiser of the Travis Central Appraisal District, noted that by state law, every Texas school district must set a ceiling on how much homeowners 65 or older pay. Counties and other governmental jurisdictions have the local option of setting such ceilings, Crigler advised. See TCAD’s breakdown of exemptions and tax ceilings offered by Travis County jurisdictions here. Eckhardt helped us reach Mykle Tomlinson, Travis Forward’s campaign manager, who said by phone the errors occurred in mailers targeting older residents because consultants whom he did not identify misunderstood the difference between a homestead tax exemption and a tax freeze. After our inquiry, Tomlinson said the group would follow up by sending postcards within a day or so to the 12,295 households that received the mailer, which went out about the day the early-voting period began Oct. 23, 2017. At our request, Tomlinson emailed us a copy of the follow-up postcard which says on its front: "We were wrong and we’re sorry!" The back of the postcard is headlined: "Setting the record straight." Next comes text saying: "The mailer we sent to your home last week wrongly claimed that, like school district taxes, senior homeowners’ county taxes are frozen under state law." The back also says: "State law does not require a county tax freeze for seniors. The mailer we sent to your home last week was inaccurate, and we’re sorry. Please help us set the record straight by sharing this with your friends and neighbors." Bruce Elfant, Travis County’s tax assessor-collector, told us by phone that if the county propositions win approval, older homeowners will pay more in county taxes. According to the county, the owner of a home at the 2017 average taxable property value of $305,000 can expect to pay no more than $24 a year for 20 years should voters approve Proposition A, to spend $93.4 million on road, sidewalk, bike and other transportation-related projects, and Proposition B, devoting nearly $91.5 million to parks and land conservation projects. A county web page enables anyone to input any taxable property value--for homeowners, meaning the value, less exemptions including the county’s 20 percent homestead exemption--and see what the county estimates as the proposed bonds’ future annual costs to the property owner. Although the county has no tax freeze for older residents, it does give them an additional homestead exemption up to $80,000 on the assessed value of their home. That is, county taxes accrue on the property’s taxable assessed value above $80,000 for those 65 and older. Our ruling Travis Forward said in a mailer: "The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen." Neither claim holds up, we found, in that the propositions pose future tax costs for property owners with specific projected amounts driven by the assessed value of properties and the county doesn’t freeze taxes for homeowners 65 or older. Rather, such a resident qualifies to exempt $80,000 of the taxable assessed value of their home from county taxes. We rate this two-part to-be-retracted claim False.

pomt-07543	"In three years we could find close to 50 million gallons per day through a toilet replacement program."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/04/sally-bethea/water-advocate-says-toilets-could-save-nearly-50-m/	Despite decades of legal squabbles over the Southeast’s precious water resources, the problem still looms large over Georgia. But take heart. And look down. Some of the solutions can be found in your toilet, the head of a water conservation group said recently. "In three years we could find close to 50 million gallons per day through a toilet replacement program," Sally Bethea, founding director of Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, said in a recent article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Can better commodes really flush away that much of the area’s water problem? Georgia has been battling for years with Florida and Alabama over how to divvy up the region’s water supply. In 2009, a federal judge ruled that if the states fail to reach a water-sharing agreement by mid-July 2012, metro Atlanta can take only the same amount of water it received in the mid-1970s -- when the population was less than a third of what it is today. Georgia appealed the ruling in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, and the state has a good shot at victory. Even if Georgia wins this battle, the available water supply might not meet the region’s long-term needs. So Bethea has targeted the potty, the modern household’s thirstiest water hog. Nationally and locally, governments have created programs to replace old-fashioned commodes that can use more than 3.5 gallons per flush with low-flow toilets that use as little as 1.28 gallons. This is how Riverkeeper came up with its number: Atlanta is part of the 15-county Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, which includes counties as far north as Hall and as far south as Coweta. She said the planning district estimates that 850,000 homes have old-fashioned plumbing. The district already has programs in which residents receive rebates if they install low-flow toilets. But Bethea said she envisions a more dramatic change. In the mid-1990s, New York City ran a successful program that changed out the city’s old toilets with low-flow ones. Over three years, that effort switched about 1.3 million toilets and saved an estimated 70 million to 80 million gallons per day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under the privately managed program, which was heavily promoted to apartment building owners and plumbers, property owners received up to $240 per toilet to have them replaced by a licensed professional. Experts we interviewed think that New York City-style programs can be more effective than a typical rebate program. They are especially helpful for properties with low- or fixed-income residents who often live in older housing with outdated plumbing. Using EPA figures, Riverkeeper calculated that 8,120 gallons can be saved per person per year if a resident installs one new high-efficiency toilet, faucet and shower head in his home. If there are 2.5 people in the household, the savings totals 47.3 million gallons per day across the region, the group calculated. Bethea described her estimate as "very conservative" because many homes have more than one toilet or 2.5 residents. It doesn’t include savings when the upgraded plumbing fixes leaks, either. We found that Riverkeeper numbers are optimistic. The group’s figure for households with old-fashioned plumbing is out of date, according to data from the Water Planning District. Last year, it was about 615,000, or 27 percent less. And Bethea’s estimate for the amount of water saved per toilet is high. Her group assumed those toilets would date from the 1980s or earlier. The older the toilet, the more water it uses. But Atlanta’s housing stock is relatively new. Under an existing rebate program that will last until 2025, the Water Planning District expects the region to save 14 million gallons per day if 57 percent of homeowners use the program. District figures do not include savings from installing more efficient faucets and shower heads. But since those fixtures combined use thousands of gallons per year less than toilets, we think it’s reasonable to expect that they would not increase the amount of water saved to nearly 50 million gallons per day. In addition, the Atlanta region has characteristics that could weaken the impact of a New York City-style program. The Big Apple has far more apartments, which meant persuading a single apartment building owner to change made a dramatic difference. Plus property owners had a big incentive to switch toilets quickly because of changes in how the city billed for water. To Bethea’s credit, she used careful language. She said the region "could" save 50 million gallons per day, not that it "would." And while saving nearly 50 million gallons of water per day appears unlikely in light of water district numbers, it isn’t impossible. The region could have a higher-than-expected participation rate or proportion of very old toilets. The amount of water saved because the new plumbing fixes leaks could boost the total, and changing toilets over three years rather than 14 (under the rebate) does save more water, total. Therefore Bethea’s fundamental point rings true. A New York-style program "could" save 50 million gallons per day. The amount could easily be much lower, but even more conservative estimates place the savings in the range of tens of millions of gallons per day. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-11232	"Kirsten Gillibrand has put forward 331 bills since she's been in Congress. Do you know how many of them have been passed into law? Zero!"	half-true	/new-york/statements/2018/may/04/chele-farley/gillibrands-opponent-claims-she-hasnt-passed-any-b/	A New York Republican running for U.S. Senate says Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has served 11 years in Congress without passing a single bill into law. Chele Farley, a partner at a private equity firm in New York City, said Gillibrand’s political career has borne no legislative fruit. "Kirsten Gillibrand has put forward 331 bills since she's been in Congress. Do you know how many of them have been passed into law? Zero!" Farley said in an interview. Farley is staging a long shot bid to unseat Gillibrand in a state that hasn’t been represented by a Republican in the Senate for two decades. She believes Gillibrand hasn’t delivered on promises she made to improve the lives of New York state residents. Is it true that none of her bills has become law? Gillibrand’s bills Farley’s campaign supported the claim using information from the congressional bill tracking website. A search for Gillibrand’s legislation turned up 295 bills and 36 resolutions during her time in the House and Senate, according to a query on the website. Seven of those bills passed the chamber she was in at the time but none became law. Gillibrand was appointed to replace Hillary Clinton in the Senate in 2009, when Clinton became secretary of state. Gillibrand served in the House from 2007 until succeding Clinton in the Senate. She also co-sponsored 1,998 bills. That means she signed on to a bill introduced by another member of the chamber. Seventy-seven of those bills have become law. Some of them were from Gillibrand’s colleagues in New York state. She co-sponsored a bill with lower Hudson Valley Rep. Nita Lowey to promote breast cancer research, for example. Gillibrand has also offered 153 amendments to bills sponsored by other members. Twenty-one of those amendments were approved, with 11 were attached to bills that ultimately became law. The remaining 36 items Farley referred to are resolutions Gillibrand introduced. Resolutions are one-house actions that usually celebrate an occasion or change the chamber’s internal rules. They do not have to be agreed to in the other chamber. Gillibrand has introduced 36 resolutions in Congress and 23 of them passed. Gillibrand’s record In other ways, Gllibrand has driven new laws. She wrote part of the STOCK Act, a law designed to prevent insider trading by members of Congress. Her legislation was combined with another member’s bill and sponsored by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Sen. Joe Lieberman before it became law. Democrats have been the minority in the Senate since 2015. Minority members have a much harder time getting legislation passed because majority members decide which bills make it to the floor for a vote. Gillibrand has had more success adding amendments to other members’ bills and co-sponsoring legislation. Consider the Zadroga Act, legislation Gillibrand sponsored in 2015 to guarantee health care to 9/11 first responders and survivors. Instead of passing as its own bill, Republican lawmakers included Gillibrand’s legislation in an omnibus spending bill that became law that year. There have also been times when Gillibrand wrote legislation with a Republican, but was not the main sponsor. Even the White House gave her credit for a bill she worked on with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley last year. "Later this afternoon, the President is going to be signing two bills that were both passed with bipartisan support that help protect those who protect us," then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at a press briefing in 2017. "First, the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017, which was co-sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York." Past PolitiFact ratings PolitiFact has rated similar statements anywhere from Mostly True to Mostly False depending on how the claim was phrased. The Republican Party of Florida recently claimed that out of 860 bills Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, had introduced in Congress, only 10 passed. That claim was rated Mostly False because more than 10 of Nelson’s bills and resolutions were passed in at least one chamber. Farley’s statement goes beyond that claim by saying none of Gillibrand’s bills have become law. Experts have also agreed in past rulings that measuring a lawmaker’s success by the number of sponsored bills that become law can be misleading. There are other actions a lawmaker can take to be effective. One example: Gillibrand convinced members of the Senate to hold hearings on allowing gay and lesbian people in the military during her first year in the chamber. The policy was changed two years later. Our ruling Farley said Gillibrand has not sponsored a bill that has become law during her time in Congress. Farley’s right that Gillibrand has not been the sole sponsor on a bill that became law. But some of her legislative proposals have been included in larger bills sponsored by other members. And Farley's count includes resolutions, 23 of which passed in the Senate. Farley paints Gillibrand as a lawmaker without any legislative victories. That’s not true. Her statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-03385	Women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/09/jimmy-carter/carter-trips-over-details-gender-wage-gap/	PolitiFact Georgia checked two previous claims former President Jimmy Carter made in a Time magazine interview before his "Mobilizing Faith for Women" conference last month at the Carter Center. Once the three-day conference began, various media outlets and bloggers reported some of the goings on. The Huffington Post, for example, wrote about one session in which Carter discussed mistreatment of women across the world and laid the blame, at least some of it, at the feet of religious leaders. One familiar statement about the pay disparity between men and women stuck out to us: Carter said women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. Can that really be true? Our national and state affiliate PolitiFact colleagues have completed several fact checks of similar wage-disparity claims made by a variety of politicos including President Barack Obama. We dug a little deeper to determine where Carter’s claim ranked on the Truth-O-Meter. We tracked down the full statement in a 20-minute video of the former president and former Georgia governor’s comments on the Carter Center’s website. Carter’s comments on this subject begin around the 7:30 mark as he reads articles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 23, he reads, says everyone, without any discrimination, has a right to equal pay for equal work. "And the employers of America looking at their religious ordination that women are not equal don't feel constrained to pay women equally for the same work that a man does," Carter continues. "In our country, women get an average of 70 percent as much pay for doing exactly the same work as men." The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948 after World War II as a road map to guarantee the rights of every individual everywhere, according to the UDHR’s website. Carter’s overall theme of an existing gender wage gap is correct. But his figure and characterization of that amount is a very different matter. We contacted Carter’s camp about his source for the claim. It noted the U.N. 2012 report, "Progress of the World’s Women: In Pursuit of Justice." But that report cites an international pay gap of 10 percent to 30 percent for 83 countries polled, and it doesn’t provide a percentage for the United States. The report does say that the wage gaps reflect the fact that women doing the same or comparable jobs are paid less than men for the same work. The report is based on a 2008 International Labour Organization data. Nationally, the 70 percent figure seems to track back to a 2011 census report that found that in 2010, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers over age 15 was 0.77; meaning that women earned 77 cents for every dollar a man earned. That statistic has been used repeatedly as an argument for equal pay and gender non-discrimination legislation. But the statistic has also been widely misused by speakers oversimplifying the data. The report does not say the 77-cent figure is for the same work. And the full-time definition for different jobs can vary widely. Also, the pay gap does not take into account other factors that could influence the figure, including occupation, time on the job and education level. The census report showed the widest gap. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as, data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller gaps. The 70 percent figure, also taken from census data, is the wage disparity between men and African-American women. Again, the figure was based on full-time, year-round workers in general, and it did not compare similar occupations. The wage gap increased to 64 percent (or 64 cents to every dollar) between black women and white, non-Hispanic men. So, does Carter’s claim earn an honest day’s pay? During a conference on women, Carter said that women in this country earn just 70 percent of what men earn for "doing exactly the same work as men." His main source document provides information on an international, not a national wage gap. And for this country, the figure Carter uses is actually the wage gap between all men and black women. It has nothing to do with men and women who do the same work, contrary to what he stated. Even if we assume Carter misspoke and meant 77 percent -- the most widely used wage gap figure from a recent census report -- his claim would still leave out important details about the census data that would give an entirely different impression had they been included. The former president and Nobel Prize winner does get some credit for his overall theme that a general pay gap persists between men and women, a fact that has been proved by various sets of national data. We rated Carter’s claim Mostly False.	None	Jimmy Carter	None	None	None	2013-07-09T00:00:00	2013-06-28	['United_States']

pomt-06219	President Barack Obama "has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/06/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-barack-obama-has-killed-jobs-en/	During a Dec. 5, 2011, news conference, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich took aim at President Barack Obama’s record on jobs. "I think the president has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing, he kills jobs in virtually every part of American life. I mean, notice -- the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created." We’re going to check this statement in two parts. In this item, we’ll check the claim that President Barack Obama "has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing." In a separate item, we’ll check the claim that "the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created." For this item, we're focusing on Gingrich’s claim’s about energy and manufacturing jobs. We used data showing net changes in jobs -- that is, jobs created minus jobs lost -- rather than just jobs lost (or "killed"). We are also interpreting Gingrich’s comment to mean that Obama is the cause for killing existing jobs, not that Obama has prevented theoretical future jobs from materializing. Now, to the numbers, which are collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We looked at two time periods -- one between January 2009 and November 2011, which represents the entirety of Obama’s time in office, and the other between January 2010 and November 2011, which covers the period starting one year into his presidency, a point at which one would assume that Obama’s policies have begun to have some impact. Energy jobs For energy, we found two relevant categories in the BLS data, oil and gas extraction and mining. During the entire Obama presidency, employment in the oil and gas extraction sector grew by 18,800 jobs, or an increase of 11 percent. Over the same period, jobs in mining declined by 9,200, or 4 percent. Combining the two categories, energy jobs grew by 9,600 jobs, or 2 percent. Beginning one year into Obama’s presidency, oil and gas extraction jobs increased by 27,500, a rise of 18 percent. Mining jobs grew by 14,900, or 8 percent. Combined, the two sectors increased by 42,400 jobs, or 12 percent. So over both periods, the energy sector grew in absolute terms -- and if you measure beginning in January 2010, the increase has been quite healthy at 12 percent over two years. Manufacturing jobs During the entire Obama presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined by 795,000, or 6 percent. Since January 2010, though, the number of manufacturing jobs has increased by 299,000, a rise of 2.6 percent over two years. The increase since January 2010 is modest -- a bit over 1 percent per year -- and it hasn’t come close to bringing manufacturing employment back up to the level it was when Obama was inaugurated in the midst of a severe recession. Yet the rise in Obama’s second and third year becomes more robust once it’s put into historical context. In general, manufacturing employment has declined more or less steadily since the mid-1970s. The last time manufacturing jobs saw such a large and sustained numerical increase was in the early 1990s. So while the increase in years two and three of the Obama presidency is relatively small, it is the best in about two decades. One way to illustrate the long-term decline of manufacturing jobs is to look at how the numbers have moved during the past few presidencies. In the list below, we began counting from one year into each president’s tenure through to the end of their term. Using that methodology, here are the numbers of manufacturing jobs gained or lost per year: Barack Obama: Increase of 157,368 manufacturing jobs per year in office George W. Bush: Decrease of 434,143 manufacturing jobs per year in office Bill Clinton: Increase of 37,143 manufacturing jobs per year in office George H.W. Bush: Decrease of 336,000 manufacturing jobs per year in office Ronald Reagan: Increase of 1,429 manufacturing jobs per year in office Jimmy Carter: Increase of 15,333 manufacturing jobs per year in office So by this measure, manufacturing jobs have actually increased by more under Obama than under any of his recent predecessors. A final note: It’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims less than True on our Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling Gingrich is free to argue that environmental regulations, tax policies and the like have prevented the energy and manufacturing sectors from creating as many jobs as they otherwise might. But in this case, Ginrgich said that Obama "has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing." That’s a different standard, one which means that Obama’s policies have destroyed existing jobs on a net basis. Right off the bat, we need to downgrade Gingrich’s statement due to its allocation of blame. The job market is subject to many factors, not just Obama’s policies, so it’s unfair to lay all of the blame on the president. But even on the numbers, the claim’s accuracy is mixed at best. Combined, energy extraction jobs have increased in absolute numbers since Obama took office and have risen quite rapidly over the past two years. Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs are down over the course of Obama’s presidency, but they are up during the past two years at the fastest pace in two decades. On balance, we rate Gingrich’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/050fd79e-a562-4189-902e-5f16a84d8b04	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-06T16:08:26	2011-12-05	['None']

pomt-13558	"Hillary [Clinton] wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/25/mike-pence/pa-pence-repeats-half-true-claim-clinton-would-rai/	During a campaign stop in Bucks County this week, Indiana Gov. and Donald Trump’s running mate Mike Pence made an ear-catching claim about Hillary Clinton’s tax plan. "Hillary," he said, "wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars." That claim was also made in April by New Day for America, a super PAC that was working to elect Ohio Gov. John Kasich as the Republican nominee for president. PolitiFact rated the claim Half-True. Here's why: To put that $1 trillion number in perspective, the national debt has reached nearly $19.2 trillion, or more than $60,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. PolitiFact has looked at the presidential candidates' tax plans and, for the Clinton proposal, we relied on a March 3, 2016, analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. The center says that Clinton's proposal would indeed increase tax revenue by $1 trillion — $1.1 trillion in fact. But that money would be raised over 10 years. Clinton, even if she were elected in November and reelected in 2020, wouldn't be in office that long. Reagan's message on behalf of New Day misses another point that may make the increase less onerous to most voters: "Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes," according to the report. For example, filers with an adjusted gross income higher than $1 million would have to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Any money earned above $5 million per year would be assessed an extra 4 percent surcharge. (The surcharge would kick in at $2.5 million for married couples filing separately.) Clinton's plan also aims to discourage multinational corporations from using various schemes to lower or eliminate the taxes they have to pay in the United States. However, according to the report, her proposal would make the tax code more complex and the higher tax rates for the people who earn the most money would reduce "incentives to work, save and invest." When we heard back from New Day for America, spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp directed us to Clinton's interview with the New York Daily News and an analysis by the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, both of which make it clear that the $1 trillion would be raised over 10 years, a distinction made by neither New Day nor Reagan. "Liberals may think increasing taxes by $1 trillion is a good idea, but we very strongly disagree," Wehrkamp said in an email. Our Ruling New Day spokesman Michael Reagan said, "Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion." Pence repeated a similar claim in Pennsylvania during a campaign stop this week, saying "Hillary wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars." Her plan does, in fact, call for raising a trillion dollars, but it would do so over 10 years — longer than she could serve as president, even if she were re-elected. So if she brought in roughly $100 billion per year, even a two-term Clinton administration couldn't fulfill a promise to bring the total to $1 trillion. Also, the statement ignores another key bit of data — that the money would be raised by tax changes targeted to the richest Americans, a group that has seen its top tax rate drop dramatically since the 1950s and early 1960s, when the marginal tax rate was over 90 percent. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-03570	Says Fulton County government hasn’t raised its millage rate since 1991.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/20/john-eaves/fulton-leader-uses-tax-rate-make-case-state-battle/	The year was 1991. U.S. military forces ousted Saddam Hussein’s troops from Kuwait in what was called Operation Desert Storm. The Atlanta Braves thrilled the city with an improbable World Series appearance. "The Silence of the Lambs" won the Oscar for Best Picture. Basketball legend Michael Jordan won his first pro championship. And Fulton County commissioners raised the millage rate, causing property taxes -- and anger -- to rise in Georgia’s highest-populated county. Now, Fulton officials are upset with state lawmakers, who passed a series of bills this year that the lawmakers believe will improve county operations. County Chairman John Eaves made the argument that Fulton is a well-run county in a recent television interview. "The facts are Fulton County has not increased its millage rate since 1991," Eaves told Channel 2 Action News’ Lori Geary. "So why fix something that’s not broken?" PolitiFact Georgia was curious whether Eaves was indeed correct about his claim that county commissioners haven’t raised the millage rate in more than two decades. For several years, Republican state lawmakers from north Fulton have battled with the Democratic-led County Commission over the direction of the county government. Many of the lawmakers and their constituents say they’re not getting their money’s worth in services for the taxes they pay. There’s been talk, and unsuccessful legislation at the state level, to split Fulton into two counties. Fulton has 920,583 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census. The tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.281 mills, which equates to about $720 on a $250,000 home with a homestead exemption. But total property taxes in Fulton vary, depending on what part of the county the property is located. Cities add their own millage rates, increasing the overall rate. Then, there are other charges for bond payments, the county’s school system and other services. Fulton’s school board sets its own property tax rate. In 1991, county commissioners voted 4-3 to raise property taxes. Then Chairman Michael Lomax said the increase was necessary to help fund Grady Memorial Hospital. Some residents unsuccessfully tried to recall Lomax. Eaves was first elected as chairman in 2006. Since 1991, the county government’s millage and bond rate has gradually declined. In 2011, though, it rose from 10.28 mills to 10.55 mills to help fund a library construction program. Fulton voters passed the proposed $275 million library program in 2008. Fulton public affairs manager Jessica Corbitt told us the increase of 0.27 mills was to the bond millage rate, not the general fund millage rate. It was listed on Fulton tax bills as a separate millage rate. The county chairman’s comments, though, do not reflect some property tax changes in a portion of Fulton. The county has a Special Services District for a portion of its south Fulton residents. The Georgia Legislature created the district in 2006 after the cities of Chattahoochee Hills, Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs were all created. South Fulton leaders pushed for the district to ensure funding for services in that portion of the county as those cities, most of them in the north, were being created. The millage rate for the South Fulton Special Services District was 5.73 mills in 2006, county financial records show. It declined slightly to 5.66 mills in 2007 and 2008. The rate rose sharply in 2009 to 8.16 mills, the records show. It went up in 2011 to 8.97 mills and again in 2012 to 10.47 mills. The county said in its 2012 budget book that the most recent increase was primarily due to lower assessments on property values and that the county needed the additional money to maintain the same level of service to residents there. The increases are a direct result of the defections of Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs, as well as plummeting property values brought on by the Great Recession, county officials have said. Corbitt confirmed the accuracy of the financial records. She defended Eaves’ statement in the television interview. "While it is true that the millage rate has increased for the special services district, which serves approximately 10 percent of the county’s population, the discussions related to the Fulton County legislation have primarily focused on the Countywide General Fund. With regard to the General Fund, the Chairman’s statement is completely accurate," Corbitt said via email. To sum up, Eaves said the county has not increased its millage rate since 1991. But the millage rate in the South Fulton Special Services Fund, which affects about 90,000 people, has increased several times in recent years. Corbitt said the south Fulton millage rate increases are not relevant to the ongoing debate. Still, Eaves would have been more precise if he had specified the difference. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	John Eaves	None	None	None	2013-05-20T06:00:00	2013-05-03	['None']

pomt-07875	"I didn't raise taxes once."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/07/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-he-didnt-raise-taxes/	In an interview on Super Bowl Sunday, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked President Barack Obama to react to a Wall Street Journal editorial that accused Obama of being "a determined man of the left whose goal is to redistribute much larger levels of income across society." "Do you deny that you are a man who wants to redistribute wealth?" O'Reilly asked. Obama first noted the conservatism of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, then denied the charge "absolutely." "I didn't raise taxes once. I lowered taxes over the last two years," Obama said. We wanted to fact-check that statement, and we'll begin by saying Obama boils down an awful lot of complexity about federal tax policy into a short sound bite. Looking at the whole statement, he's both right and wrong. For clarity's sake, we're going to take Obama's statement in two parts. Here, we'll look at his statement, "I didn't raise taxes once." In a separate report, we'll look at his statement, "I lowered taxes over the last two years." The idea that Obama did not raise taxes is just plain wrong. He signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office; that money goes to pay for children's health insurance programs. The law went into effect in 2009. He also signed the health care law, which includes taxes on indoor tanning that went into effect last year. (Regular PolitiFact readers will remember our fact-check of reality TV star Snooki and her complaint about the new tax last year.) The new health care law also includes a tax on people who decide not to have health insurance, as an incentive for them to get coverage. The tax phases in gradually, starting in 2014. By 2016, the tax would be $695 per uninsured person up to a maximum of three times that amount, or $2,085. The law includes exemptions for people who can't find affordable insurance, and a few other special circumstances. More significantly, the health care law includes new taxes on the wealthy, starting in 2013. Individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples that make more than $250,000 will see additional Medicare taxes of 0.9 percent. They will also, for the first time, have to pay Medicare taxes on their investment income at a 3.8 percent rate. (Current law is that all workers and employers split a 2.9 percent Medicare tax; the self-employed pay all of it.) The small percentages may not sound like a lot, but those taxes are expected to generate $210 billion over 10 years, or just over half of all the new revenues the health care law authorizes. Other provisions include new fees on health insurance companies and prescription drug manufacturers, and a new tax on high-cost "Cadillac" health insurance plans. Before we rule on this item, though, we should note that Obama has not raised income taxes. Thanks to a compromise he brokered with Republicans at the end of 2010, income tax rates are staying the same for people of all incomes. Obama had favored raising taxes on high earners, but he gave up on that as part of the tax deal. In exchange, he gained a a 2 percent reduction in payroll taxes for all workers. When you combine that with small tax cuts that were part of the economic stimulus, most taxpayers have seen reduced rates under Obama's administration. Obama said, "I didn't raise taxes once." But we've documented numerous instances when he has. He's has signed off on small tax cuts for most taxpayers, but that doesn't change the fact that he's also approved several tax increases. So we rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-02-07T15:00:53	2011-02-06	['None']

pomt-09216	"Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/19/national-republican-congressional-committee/walt-minnick-attacked-abortion-issues-tied-obamaca/	During the heat of the federal health care debate earlier this year, abortion foes warned they would make legislators' votes on abortion provisions well known in future campaigns. Well that didn't take long. In a heated Idaho congressional race, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has launched a TV ad targeting incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Walt Minnick for several votes it claims supported taxpayer-funded abortions. Minnick is facing a challenge from two Republican contenders, Raul Labrador and Vaughn Ward. The ad uses one of those baseball pitch-trackers as the visual. Here's the voiceover: "Is Walt Minnick voting your values? Minnick voted to allow direct taxpayer funding of abortion-on-demand in Washington. Strike One. Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare. Strike two. Then, Minnick voted to keep in place the extreme abortion provisions of Obamacare. Strike three. When it comes to representing our values, Walt Minnick's striking out. Call Minnick. And tell him to stop voting for taxpayer funded abortion." We're betting we're going to see a lot of ads like this in the next six months. And so we're focusing on the most universal aspect of the ad, the claim that "Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare." Minnick is an abortion rights advocate, but the ad goes one step further, saying he voted repeatedly for taxpayer funding for abortions. First, a little bit about what those three votes were (and were not). 1) "Minnick voted to allow direct taxpayer funding of abortion-on-demand in Washington." This was a vote related specifically to the District of Columbia on July 16, 2009. A spending bill proposed removing special restrictions which had prohibited the District of Columbia city government from using local tax funds to pay for abortions for the poor (as all the 50 states are permitted to do). Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., offered an amendment to keep the restriction. The amendment was blocked by a narrow 219-208 vote; and Minnick was among those who voted against allowing the amendment to move forward. The bill did not direct federal tax dollars to cover abortions. It gave city legislators the power to decide if they want to steer local tax dollars toward abortion services. 2) "Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare." This relates to the much-publicized Stupak Amendment offered to the House version of the massive health care reform bill in the fall of 2009. Championed by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., the amendment took a hard line on abortion, barring anyone who accepted federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment would have let people choose a plan with abortion coverage if they paid for it without using federal subsidies. Minnick voted against the Stupak amendment, but it passed and was part of the health care bill that originally passed in the House. 3) "Minnick voted to keep in place the extreme abortion provisions of Obamacare." The Senate version of the health care reform package took a different tack on abortion. The Senate language, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., allowed companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But the provision included detailed measures to ensure federal tax dollars would not be used to fund abortion services. When the Senate version of the bill came back to the House for consideration, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., sought to have the bill changed to reflect the earlier Stupak language. That effort failed, and Minnick was among those who killed it. But Minnick ultimately voted against the health care bill. He's a member of the House Blue Dog coalition. His vote against the health care bill, along with his vote against the economic stimulus package, goes a long way toward explaining why he was the lone Democrat endorsed by the Tea Party Express, a national group that organized a tour this spring featuring Sarah Palin, Joe the Plumber Wurzelbacher and others. Minnick is also a consistent abortion rights supporter. In 2009, NARAL Pro-Choice America gave him a 100 percent rating. But the charge in the ad is not just that Minnick supports abortion rights, it's that he voted to "let the government fund abortion under Obamacare" -- Strike Two in the ad. On Nov. 7, 2009, Minnick issued a press release explaining his vote against the Stupak Amendment: "I believe abortion should be safe, legal and rare, and that a decision on the issue can be made only by a woman, her family, her doctor and her pastor. "I do not want a federal judge overruling that decision. I do not want a government bureaucrat denying a medical procedure ordered by a woman’s physician. I do not want this Congress to give an anonymous insurance executive an excuse to gut coverage for women's health. "One of the reasons I oppose the House health care bill is that I do not believe the federal government should be making health care decisions for Americans. It is also why I oppose this amendment." The assumption made in the ad is that a vote against the Stupak Amendment was a vote to let the government fund abortion. We explored that issue in depth during the health care debate and concluded similar claims were inaccurate. The alternative in play prior to the Stupak Amendment was to make abortion coverage available in private plans participating in the exchange, but requiring that such services be paid through patient premiums, not federal tax dollars. The version of the bill that passed the Senate also allowed companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill required that anyone who selected a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. Before signing off on that abortion language, Stupak convinced President Barack Obama to issue an executive order providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. And Stupak, who up until that point had been the champion of the abortion foes' position, declared "There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation." That's where things stood when the third vote mentioned in the ad came up. So let's review: The first vote mentioned in the ad was not exactly a vote for taxpayer-funded abortion, though that may be its result. The bill allowed District of Columbia city government to steer local tax dollars toward abortion services for the poor. But that would be the call of local officials in D.C., and it wouldn't result in federal tax dollars going to abortion. The other two votes relate to "Obamacare." Again, Minnick cast the votes cited in the ad, but ultimately voted against the health care bill. Moreover, we think it's inaccurate to claim that Minnick's vote against the Stupak Amendment was a vote to "let the government fund abortion under Obamacare." The Stupak Amendment certainly took a harder line on the abortion issue, barring those who accepted federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage. It's fair to say the Stupak amendment would have kept federal tax dollars from subsidizing abortions. But that doesn't mean that, conversely, a vote against it therefore allowed it. The alternative was to make abortion services available in health care exchanges, but paid entirely with patient premiums, not tax dollars. And so we rule the claim in the NRCC ad False.

pomt-03516	"We cut taxes 24 times."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jun/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-claims-24-tax-cuts-florida-2011/	How many times did Gov. Rick Scott cut taxes? You better believe the unpopular Republican running for a second term is counting the ways. "Twenty-four times," Scott said last month after signing the state’s $71.1 billion budget. The claim certainly got our attention at PolitiFact Florida. Could Scott and the Legislature have enacted two dozen different tax cuts in just three budget years, two of which were hamstrung by billion-dollar budget shortfalls? We turned to the Truth-O-Meter to sort it out. What Scott counts Defining a "tax cut" can be difficult. To Scott, it means anything that reduced government revenue by $3 million in any given year. So, for instance, a three-day sales tax holiday is a tax cut in Scott’s mind. And because it’s been in the budget the past three years, it’s counted as three tax cuts. (Actually, Scott says it’s four. More on that later.) Other "tax cuts" are really reductions in automatic fee increases or tax credits, and several are temporary. We’ll discuss whether they can be considered tax cuts in a moment. First, let’s go through Scott’s list. (His office actually provided 25, not 24.) 1, 2.) Unemployment compensation taxes:Lawmakers spared businesses from paying higher taxes in 2011 by reducing the number of weeks and payout for unemployment compensation. It saved businesses $124.5 million. The next year, the Legislature rolled back a tax increase businesses were supposed to pay. The change meant businesses still paid more than in previous years, but not as much as originally anticipated. The savings -- on paper -- to businesses: $830 million for tax years 2012 through 2014. 3, 4.) Manufacturing equipment: Scott signed an expansion of a sales tax exemption on machinery purchases in 2012, worth $56 million. In 2013, lawmakers eliminated the sales tax entirely, at least temporarily. The tax will be eliminated for three years starting in April 2014. Removing the sales tax, which faces constitutional questions, would cost the state $370 million and local governments $83 million through 2017. 5.) Property taxes: In 2011, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections by about 30 percent, leading to about $210 million in savings for property owners. This resulted in modest property tax savings for most Floridians, except those in northwest Florida, whose district did not have to reduce its tax rate, according to a bill analysis. 6, 7, 8, 9.) Sales tax holiday: Scott counts the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday four different times. It applies to shoes and clothing (up to $75/item) and school supply purchases (up to $15). The state has offered the holiday every year since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. The price tag is about $30 million to the state. The 2013 tax holiday (Aug. 2-4) counts twice, according to Scott, because it also exempts sales taxes on electronic equipment, such as E-readers, laptops and tablets, up to $750. State economists expect Floridians to save $4.7 million. 10, 11.) Corporate Income Tax exemptions: Per Scott’s wishes, the Legislature expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and again in 2012 to $50,000. The hit to the state budget for both is about $60 million a year, sparing thousands of businesses from paying the tax. (Scott wanted to eliminate this tax outright when he took office, but he has scaled back his approach to placate the Legislature.) 12.) Tax credit scholarships: This expands a program that gives businesses a tax credit if they purchase tuition vouchers for low-income families to go to private schools. The trade-off results in a loss of $25 million in state revenue. 13, 14, 15.) Energy breaks: One 2013 law implements part of a 2008 constitutional amendment that says a property appraiser may not base an increase in a property’s just value on the installation of a "renewable energy source device," including windmills, solar panels and roof pools. The law may lead to local revenue losses of $12.6 million by 2017, according to state analysts. It will not go into effect until tax year 2014. Two other credits are in a 2012 bill, HB 7117, aimed at inspiring more renewable energy production in our natural gas-dependent state. These credits, which could help agribusiness and renewable energy production facilities, are set to expire in 2016. Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature. The department has received five applications for the renewable energy production tax credit, but none has yet been issued. 16, 17, 18, 19.) Various business tax incentives: Since 2011, the Legislature and Scott have done the following: Expanded tax credits available to businesses under a federal/state "new markets" program, allowing businesses to take it against their corporate income tax bill or insurance premium tax bill. ($12.9 million loss/year) Allowed certain companies, which spent at least $250 million on capital costs from 2011-13, to write-down a portion of their Florida business taxes. ($7.5 million loss/year) Temporarily waived a requirement that a new facility creating at least 100 jobs be in certain technology fields in order to qualify for the Capital Investment Tax Credit, though only if they are located in certain Panhandle counties. The exemption lasts through June 30, 2014. ($4.4 million loss/year) Created an annual corporate income tax credit for certain research and development expenses of up to $9 million a year. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.) Targeted breaks: Lawmakers eliminated sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds, worth $12.3 million. The same bill tweaked requirements for a tax credit for businesses in an urban high-crime area ($3.5 million/year). They blocked an automatic inflation adjustment factored in registration for hunting and fishing license fees every five years. Eliminating the increase, which would have taken effect July 2013, cost the state $4.4 million for 2012-13. They tinkered with a formula for the tax owed by Floridians who sever phosphate rock to sell. To put it very simply, a wide-ranging 2012 law eliminates the annual adjustment and surcharge for severing phosphate for an annual cost of $12.6 million. A person licensed as a real estate salesperson or broker associate does not have to apply for an exemption from a local business tax when he or she is an employee of someone else under a 2012 law. ($3.8 million hit to local government/year.) 25.) Communications dealers: HB 809 in 2012 spared communications dealers, in certain situations, from being liable for penalties if they assign a customer to the wrong local tax jurisdiction (local governments can add hikes to this tax on top of the state rate). The change will result in annual savings of about $4.7 million for the communications industry. True tax cuts? That’s the evidence. What to make of it? After speaking with experts and considering the evidence, we found numerous caveats -- some more noteworthy than others. Some cuts are temporary and others are very narrowly targeted. The three-day sales tax holiday counts four times on Scott’s list (Nos. 6-9). "Does it really count as a tax cut if you’ve been providing it since 1998?" said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Other cuts are not really cuts but credits, which mean you have to spend somewhere to save somewhere else. The energy legislation (No. 13) prevents property appraisers from raising someone’s property taxes for making energy-efficient home improvements. That’s not a cut in the literal sense. The break for communications dealers (No. 25) is not so much a tax cut as it is the removal of a penalty. And while changes in unemployment compensation rules save businesses money (No. 1), they also take money away from out-of-work Floridians. "It’s a tax cut for employers, but who’s really paying for it? Unemployed workers," said Karen Woodall, director of the left-leaning Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, pointing to a committee analysis. The elimination of the scheduled increase in license and registration fees for hunting and fishing (No. 22) is not a tax cut in the truest sense because it applies only to people using a certain service. "Americans don’t like the word ‘tax’," said Scott Drenkard, Tax Foundation economist at the Center for State Tax Policy. "It’s a holdover from the Revolutionary War. The word ‘fee’ is a little bit more generous." Readers may hear Scott’s statement and rush toward to their tax bills, eager to see all the ways it is reduced. But the truth is that most of the breaks are for business. "There is very little in that that provides some benefit to the average working person," said state Rep. Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach. Besides the caveats, there’s also another thing to consider: Are there places Floridians are being asked to pay more? Scott considers raising tuition a tax increase, which is why he vetoed a 3 percent increase in the 2013-14 budget. However, he signed an 8 percent tuition increase into law in 2011 and a 5 percent tuition increase for colleges in 2012. Another 2013 law will require state and local government to contribute $900 million in 2013-14 to the state retirement system. Local officials have already said they may have to increase taxes to cope with the new cost. In other cases of lost revenue to local government, it’s unclear if local officials made up the difference by cutting services or raising taxes. Our ruling Scott said, "We cut taxes 24 times." The evidence backs him up, to a point. Lawmakers and Scott have done several things to reduce the financial burden on groups of Floridians, but the benefits have been aimed mostly at business owners -- not average working people. If you don't own a business, you haven't seen most of these cuts. Using such a specific number is also troublesome. Backing up that specific claim requires overlooking all sorts of caveats, including counting the same effort multiple times. Scott’s tax claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-06-03T17:13:49	2013-05-21	['None']
pomt-01376	Under my platform, "I will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/16/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-says-he-wouldnt-back-changes-those-medi/	During a debate in the hotly contested Arkansas Senate race, Republican Tom Cotton and Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor squared off over the question of Medicare and how it would be affected by the Affordable Care Act, the health care law sometimes called Obamacare. A moderator kicked off the exchange by noting that TV ads in the race had made several claims about possible changes to Medicare and where the candidates stood on those changes. Pryor was asked, "What specifically would you change about the current system, if anything?" Pryor answered by parrying a charge that he had voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare by voting for Obamacare. (We have rated Cotton’s earlier claim that Pryor "cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare" by $700 billion Half True.) In fact, Pryor said that Cotton "has voted for that very same $700 billion (cut) he loves to criticize me for." (We rated a close variation of that claim True.) When given an opportunity to respond, Cotton took the questioner’s claim head-on. Cotton said, "The answer to your question is: I will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement." We wondered if that was what his platform really shows. The answer hinges on two separate questions. First, Does Cotton support repeal of Obamacare? And second, if Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare either for current retirees or people approaching retirement? The short answers are yes and yes. Here are the more detailed explanations. Does Cotton support the repeal of Obamacare? Cotton’s staff didn’t return an inquiry from PolitiFact, but we found lots of examples of Cotton arguing that Obamacare should be repealed. • "I will fight to repeal and replace Obamacare with free-market reforms that empower patients and doctors to make health-care decisions. … Obamacare must be repealed entirely." -- Cotton’s House of Representatives office website, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. • I "will fight to repeal Obamacare." -- Cotton’s Facebook page, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. • "What we have to do is repeal Obamacare, start over, and get it right." -- Cotton at a press conference with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Aug 21, 2014. • "We would repeal Obamacare and replace it entirely with many reforms for our health care program." -- Cotton at a press conference, April 13, 2014 • And most clearly, a pledge Cotton signed that says, "I pledge to vote for all bills which seek to REPEAL the health care bill, HR 3590, signed into law on March 23, 2010. To that end, I do now and will in the next Congress endorse and vote for all measures, including discharge petitions, leading to its defunding, deauthorization, and repeal. I shall do so whether those measures are taken for the whole of the bill or those component parts that impose mandates, restrict patient and doctor choice and access, violate individual freedom and privacy, reduce healthy competition, increase costs, or raise taxes." It’s worth noting that, at times, Cotton has expressed a desire to "replace" the newly repealed law with something else. However, we’ve failed to uncover an instance in which Cotton provided a detailed description of the Medicare policies that would be reinstated after a repeal. Cotton has also expressed an openness to more limited efforts, such as defunding the law, if a repeal can’t be achieved. Still, it’s clear from these comments that repeal is his first choice. Bottom line: Yes, Cotton has said consistently that he wants to repeal the law. If Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare for current beneficiaries? It would. The highest-profile element of the law that would disappear in the event of a full repeal is the closing of the "doughnut hole." The law made strides to ease the previous, longstanding gap in coverage for beneficiaries in which they weren’t able to get government subsidies for prescription drug purchases under Medicare Part D. However, this isn’t the only example of a benefit included in the Affordable Care Act that would disappear for those currently on Medicare if the law is repealed and replacement provisions aren’t specifically enacted. Here are others, gleaned from the Kaiser Family Foundation’s summary of the health care law: • Elimination of cost-sharing for Medicare-covered preventive services. • Authorization of Medicare coverage of "personalized prevention plan services," including an annual, comprehensive health-risk assessment. • Incentives to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to complete behavior-modification programs, such as smoking cessation. • Reduction in the out-of-pocket amount that qualifies an enrollee for catastrophic coverage for prescriptions. • Expansion of Medicare coverage to individuals who have been exposed to environmental health hazards from living in an area subject to an emergency declaration made as of June 17, 2009, and have developed certain health conditions as a result. • Prohibition of Medicare Advantage plans from imposing higher cost-sharing requirements for some Medicare-covered benefits than is required under the traditional fee-for-service program. In other words, current Medicare beneficiaries would feel a significant impact if a replacement law is not forthcoming after a repeal. We see no evidence that Cotton has pledged to protect any of these specific provisions in the wake of a repeal. Our ruling Cotton said that under his platform, he "will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement." Cotton has consistently supported repeal of Obamacare, and while he has sometimes noted that something needs to be enacted to "replace" the law, we couldn’t find any examples in which he specifically pledged to protect the Medicare policies that would be eliminated if the law was repealed, such as the closing of the doughnut hole and free preventive health-care services. We rate his claim False.	None	Tom Cotton	None	None	None	2014-10-16T10:29:17	2014-10-14	['None']

pomt-02401	Under a bill before the legislature, "you’d have to go to court to fire an employee."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/10/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-under-bill-ri-legislature-youd-have/	In his campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Kenneth Block has been arguing that a big reason why Rhode Island’s economy is stagnant is that the state has too many laws, rules and regulations that increase costs and impede the ability of businesses to rapidly respond to changing conditions. In a March 2 appearance on WJAR-10’s "News Conference" Block cited as an example a bill introduced in the General Assembly this session that he said would interfere with an employer’s ability to dismiss employees. "We had a legislator put in a bill to remove the ability of an employer to fire an employee, it’d end up in court, you’d have to go to court to fire an employee," he said. We wanted to see if Block had just cause to make that claim. We called Block’s campaign and they promptly identified the proposed legislation, House Bill 7055, introduced in January by state Rep. K. Joseph Shekarchi, D-Warwick. The bill would add language to the state law on employee rights stating that no employee in the state can be fired if the dismissal is against "an explicit, well established public policy of the state" or if the employee "has an implied contractual right to employment." Those phrases are significant because, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Rhode Island is one of only three states (Florida and Georgia are the other two) that are known as "at-will" employment states. "‘At will’ means an employee can be discharged at any time, for good reason, bad reason or no reason at all," said Michael J. Yelnosky, dean of the Roger Williams University Law School and an employment law specialist. He said the only limit on ability to fire is if the reason is explicitly against the law, such a racial discrimination. He said Shekarchi’s bill wouldn’t prevent an employer from firing an employee. What it would do, he said, is give a dismissed employee two possible arguments that could be used in a subsequent lawsuit to overturn the firing. An employee might claim he was fired because he refused to do something that was against the law. Or, he might argue there was an implied contract, if, for example, the employer had repeatedly promised the employee he’d always have a job, Yelnosky said. In other words, the bill would make it easier for a fired employee to file a lawsuit to try to get his job back. We contacted Block’s campaign and they referred us to a Jan. 16 news release Block issued on Shekarchi’s bill. In that statement, Block said if the bill passed "it would give every terminated employee the opportunity to claim that he or she had an implied contractual right to keep the job." Block campaign policy director Matthew Schweich said the March 2 "News Conference" statement was "a simplified version of the original statement." Not exactly. On "News Conference," Block said an employer would have to go to court to fire an employee. And that’s just not true. Nothing in the bill prevents a firing or requires an employer to get preliminary judicial approval. If Block had stuck to his better-worded news release, he’d have been right. We rule Block’s statement False. (Correction: Matthew Schweich is the policy director for the Block campaign. The initial version of this item incorrectly identified him as the campaign manager.)

pomt-13130	"Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/02/donald-trump/trump-says-twitter-google-facebook-buried-clinton-/	Have you heard the news that the FBI is looking into new emails related to Hillary Clinton? If you haven’t, Donald Trump says it may be because social media companies are suppressing the news. "Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!" the Republican presidential candidate tweeted Oct. 30. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress Oct. 28 that said the FBI may have found new emails relevant to its probe into the private email server that Clinton used while secretary of state. The FBI plans to review these new emails to see if they contain classified information. There’s no evidence to support Trump’s claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook buried this story in the first couple days after it broke. We reached out to the Trump campaign for its evidence and received no response. Sure, the FBI story come out on a Friday, so it competed on social media with users’ upcoming Halloween plans, the World Series and other events. But the topic was certainly popular. Twitter Twitter doesn’t have an algorithm to highlight or suppress stories, said Jen Golbeck, a University of Maryland professor and social networks expert. In their feeds, users see everything posted by the people they follow. If Trump was referring to Twitter’s "moments" feature, the FBI story appears on an accessible archived screenshot of the "moments" homepage the evening before he tweeted his claim. The website Mashable took a screenshot of Twitter’s featured tweets, which Twitter displays when a logged-out user visits Twitter.com, around the time Trump tweeted. One of the top three featured tweets was about the FBI story. According to the Twitter trend-tracking website Hashtagify, #ClintonEmails, #Comey, and #FBI surged in popularity over the past week, especially since the story broke. Google Google can intentionally suppress topics by tweaking its algorithm, but the company denies that it does this in relation to the election. "It would have to be an intentional choice, and that's a big deal," Golbeck said. In any case, it does not appear Google is doing that in this case. For example, over the weekend of Oct. 28-30, the FBI was the top trending Google search topic. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com And CNN’s Brian Stelter took a screenshot of Google News in the minutes after Trump tweeted his claim, and the FBI story was at the top of the list. Facebook Facebook is a bit harder to pin down. It does have the ability to suppress or highlight stories by altering its algorithm, though no one has produced evidence that this is something Facebook did with the FBI story. Further, Facebook tailors its trending topics based on the particular user’s interests. So the FBI story may not have appeared in one person’s trending topics bar, while appearing in another’s. While these companies probably don’t suppress certain stories, it’s hard to disprove a claim like Trump’s beyond a shadow of a doubt because there are so many ways social media sites could manipulate content visibility, said Kjerstin Thorson, a communications professor at Michigan State University. "Did it appear on people’s trending box space on Facebook? How long was it there? Was it trending only for some people and not for others? Was the story made visible in people’s Facebook news feeds or Twitter streams or in Google search results, via each platform’s display algorithm?" Thorson said. "Outside of internal company data, there is no source I know of who could check that." Our ruling Trump said, "Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!" Trump has not produced any evidence whatsoever to back up his claim, nor has anyone else. We found nothing to support the idea that the three tech and social media companies reduced the visibility of the latest developments in the Clinton email controversy. The burden is on Trump to produce information to support his statement. He’s offered none. Meanwhile, we’ve found plenty of evidence to contradict Trump’s claim.

pomt-00095	"Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-democrats-oppose-any-e/	As President Donald Trump campaigned in Wisconsin for Republicans seeking election in November, he turned to a repeated line of attack against Democrats on immigration. "Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border," Trump said Oct. 24 in Mosinee, Wis., prompting boos from rally-goers. Trump went on to claim that construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall was underway: "We started the wall, $1.6 billion, another $1.6 billion, and we have another, but we want to build it very quickly all at one time, and we'll get it done." It’s Mostly False that his promised border wall is under construction — what’s in the works is replacement fencing. His claim that Democrats oppose any effort to secure the border is also untrue. Democrats generally oppose the border wall, saying it would be too expensive and not in line with Trump’s promise that Mexico would pay for it. But they favor other security measures, including more Border Patrol agents and technology surveillance. They’ve introduced and co-sponsored legislation toward those goals. And the $1.6 billion Trump claims is financing the border wall came from a $1.3 trillion spending package passed in the House and Senate with support from Democrats. The White House did not provide supporting evidence for Trump’s claim nor comment on the record. Border fencing plan received Democratic support Trump in March reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, setting aside his threats to veto it because it did not include all the money he wanted for a border wall. The bill included $1.6 billion explicitly designated for new and replacement fencing along the southwest border. That amount also covered $38 million for border barrier planning and design, and $196 million for acquisition and deployment of border security technology. Although the appropriations bill said the money was for fencing, Trump has touted it as being money for the wall he promised. In his claims, he’s left out that some Democrats supported the measure. The spending package passed in the Senate, 65-32, with 39 Democrats voting in its favor. In the House, it passed 256-167, with 111 Democrats supporting it. Border security legislation Democrats have criticized a full-length version of Trump’s proposed border wall as a waste of money. Instead most have pushed for other ways to secure the border. They also opposed a June immigration bill introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., (which Trump initially supported). Aside from border wall funding, Goodlatte’s bill included cuts to legal immigration and allowed so-called Dreamers to stay in the United States on a renewable nonimmigrant status. Democrats and moderate Republicans said the bill did not offer a permanent solution for Dreamers. Over the years, Democrats have sponsored and supported proposals to help secure the border and voted in favor of appropriation bills funding U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency in charge of enforcing immigration laws at the border. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York in 2013 sponsored a bill directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. The Senate passed the bill but it was not taken up in the House. More recently, 30 Democrats co-sponsored a House bill introduced in January by Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas. The bill intended to protect Dreamers from deportation. It also called for the deployment of "the most practical and effective technology" to achieve operational control of the border. Within a year of the bill’s enactment, it directed the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a comprehensive southern border strategy that included details on physical barriers, levees, technologies, tools, and other devices to secure the border. Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware and the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona in February sponsored legislation similar to Hurd’s House version. That proposal also authorized $110 million per year for five years for collaboration between local law enforcement and CBP. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., in January said that while the border wall was "a monumental waste of taxpayers’ money," he would be in favor of it if that’s what it took to help Dreamers. Our ruling Trump said, "Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border." Trump’s broad swipe fails to capture other actions under border security that Democrats have supported. Democrats have sponsored and backed legislation for border security, including surveillance technology. Trump also claims that the border wall is under construction and that he got $1.6 billion from Congress for it, but leaves out that Democrats also voted in favor of that appropriation. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-10-30T17:32:24	2018-10-24	['None']

pomt-06148	Says Freddie Mac, electric co-ops and credit unions are all "government sponsored" enterprises.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/19/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-freddie-mac-electric-coo-ops-an/	Newt Gingrich’s relationship with Freddie Mac -- the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association -- has become a political briar patch for the former House speaker and Republican presidential candidate. His opponents, including Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry, cast him as a lobbyist in everything but name who landed over $1.6 million in fees from the one of the biggest players in the home mortgage industry. Gingrich states flatly he never lobbied on behalf of Freddie Mac, but in the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, Gingrich had to explain another wrinkle in his past dealings with Freddie. One of the panelists asked him about his words from 2007 "I like the GSE, or government sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac, model." Gingrich took the broad view to defend his position, saying "when you look for example at electric membership co-ops, and you look at credit unions, there are a lot of government sponsored enterprises that are awfully important and do an awfully good job." So we ask, was that a fair comparison? Are electric co-ops and credit unions the same as government sponsored enterprises, GSE’s, like Freddie Mac? There is one similarity between a GSE and a credit union or an electric co-op. Neither pays federal or state income taxes. But Patrick Lavigne, spokesman for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), said GSE "is not a term that I’ve heard applied to electric coops before." Nor, as we learned, would he be likely to. The term GSE applies to just a handful of very particular institutions. It takes a specific act of congress to create one, usually to ease the flow of money to a certain industry, like housing or agriculture. Glossaries like Investopedia define GSE’s as "(p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy." When the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSE’s, and the list isn’t long. There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And that’s it. No electric co-ops.No credit unions. The 2012 White House budget explains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate "the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers." A credit union or an electric co-op is born completely differently. They come into being only when a group of local investors pool their money.The country’s very first credit union was started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to the factory workers in the textile mills. Washington played no role at all. Later, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local groups need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entity. By the way, that’s another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by their members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930’s when "farmers would each throw $5 dollars into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines." Back then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate but a GSE such as Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit into the federal Treasury -- upwards of $2 billion. "They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself," said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered the GSE’s for over two decades. The deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says "the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... That’s what allowed it to grow." We asked the Gingrich campaign to send us any source that describes a credit union or a electric co-op as a GSE. We did not hear back. John Berlau, a policy director with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank that supports limited government and free markets, says he knows of no such description. In an email, he wrote "credit union officials I have talked to are fearful that Gingrich's false claim that they are a type of GSE may unjustly harm their image among the public and legislators." Our Ruling: Gingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs. Congress created Freddie Mac, as it does every GSE, by passing a specific law to bring it into being. Freddie Mac has stockholders and a direct line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The term, Government Sponsored Enterprise, applies only to a handful of financial entities listed in the federal budget. None of those characteristics apply to credit unions and electric cooperatives. Gingrich was paid by Freddie Mac to provide strategic advice, so he should be familiar with government sponsored entities and know what is and isn’t a GSE. But Gingrich got it wrong twice during the debate in Iowa. We rule his claim Pants on Fire.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-19T16:19:06	2011-12-15	['None']
pomt-02664	"Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-minimum-wage-jobs-are-overwhelmi/	Gov. Scott Walker opposes increasing the federal minimum wage, fearing it would prompt employers to do less hiring. In making his case, Walker paints a picture of low-wage workers as people working the counter at fast-food restaurants. "I started out, just like Paul Ryan did down the road from me, working at McDonald's," Walker told Chuck Todd on MSNBC’s "The Daily Rundown" on Jan. 6, 2013. He added: "Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce. The last thing you want to do is have fewer young people (working) at a time when unemployment rates are still way too high for teenagers going into their 20s." Walker’s characterization of the low-wage population touches on a critical element of the debate over raising the national wage, which stands at $7.25 an hour. Just who is making the minimum wage? Neither side can seem to agree on the makeup of those on the bottom end of the earning scale. Is Walker right that "jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce"? His statement is in the context of calls for a higher national minimum wage, so we’ll focus primarily on the national view rather than on individual states, 21 of which have higher minimums than the federal standard. Nationally, 4.7 percent of hourly workers toil for $7.25 an hour or less (It can be less due to various exemptions in labor law, such as for employees who receive tips and others. Plus, many people making the minimum round it down to $7 when responding to the survey). That’s about 3.6 million people 16 or older, based on conservative estimates drawn from the monthly Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Labor market researchers frequently cite the survey. Of that total, 1.6 million report being right at the federal minimum wage -- 2.1% of the hourly workforce. The BLS includes both groups -- those at the wage mark, and those below it -- in its statistical reports on minimum wage workers. Tips, commissions and overtime pay are not included in the pay data. Salaried workers are not part of the mix. Women, residents of the south, never-married workers, part-timers and service employees are more likely than their counterparts to work for $7.25 or less. Restaurant and other food service workers make up the biggest group. Teenagers overall are more likely than other age groups to work for the minimum, but even in that group nearly 80 percent of the teens earned more than $7.25. Here are the labor bureau’s findings on age: -- "Minimum wage workers tend to be young," the labor bureau said in a February 2013 report that looked at numbers for 2012. "Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less." --Teenagers (16 to 19) make up about one-quarter (24.1 percent) of hourly paid workers making $7.25 or less, or 31 percent of those right at the minimum wage. Age range of worker Breakdown of workers at minimum or less Breakdown of workers at exactly minimum wage 16 to 19 years old 24.1 percent 30.9 percent 20 to 24 26.5 24.1 25 to 34 20.3 15.5 35 to 44 10.9 9.8 45 to 54 10.4 10.5 55 to 64 5.4 6.4 65 to 69 1.4 1.6 70 and over 1.1 1.2 So how do the facts square with Walker’s comment that "jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce." He refers generally to "young people" and then later refines that to "teenagers" new to the workforce. So let’s look at both. Teenagers, as noted in the chart, make up 24 percent to 31 percent of the low-wage set, depending the measure. That group appears to best fit Walker’s description of "people starting out in the workforce." But some college-age youths are new to the workforce as well, and the labor bureau calls the 16 to 24 group "young" people in its analysis. That 16 to 24 set makes up more than half of hourly federal minimum wage workers -- 51 to 55 percent, again depending on whether you look at those exactly at the wage, or include those below it as well. Walker said the low-wage group is "overwhelmingly" young people, and mentioned teenagers. That strikes us as overstated given that workers older than 24 make up 45 percent to 49 percent of federal minimum wage workers. Teenagers are less than one-third of the overall low-wage group. But there’s no strict numerical definition of "overwhelming", so we asked two experts for their opinion. Mark Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us that Walker has a numerical point, though describes it incorrectly. "Overwhelming" implies more than a majority, he said. "Disproportionately" was a more apt description, given that such a large share of those low-wage jobs are held by young people who make up a small share of the hourly worker pool, said Calabria, a former senior staffer on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson made the disproportionality argument to back up the governor’s statement. Among other numbers, he highlighted the fact that those 16-24 hold an estimated 55 percent share of jobs right at the federal minimum wage. David Cooper, an economic analyst and minimum wage researcher at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, didn’t dispute the numbers, but said "overwhelmingly" was off the mark. Cooper also argued that the focus on the national minimum wage provided a misleading demographic profile of low-wage workers. Many work for more than $7.25, and therefore are not counted as minimum-wage workers by the labor bureau, but earn the minimums set by their state, he noted. The average age of minimum wage workers goes up under this broader view, said Cooper. EPI supports increasing the national minimum wage. Some Democrats and President Barack Obama are pushing for a $10.10 minimum. Our rating On cable TV’s MSNBC, Walker said "Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce." The best estimates are that 24 percent to 55 percent of such jobs are held by teenagers and young adults. That’s a lot, and from a relatively small component of the overall hourly-wage workforce, but his use of "overwhelming" strong suggests that a very large majority of those jobs are held by young people. They are not. We rate his claim False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-01-13T05:00:00	2014-01-06	['None']

pomt-08071	"You can go to Georgia and make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher."	true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/21/martin-kiar/state-rep-kiar-says-teachers-georgia-earn-6000-mor/	No public school teachers in Florida expect to get rich when they start their careers, but could they earn a bigger paycheck if they moved to Georgia? That's what Florida state Rep. Marty Kiar suggested in a Dec. 14, 2010, meeting between South Florida state legislators and Republican Gov.-elect Rick Scott -- a meeting attended by this PolitiFact Florida reporter. Kiar, a Democrat who represents part of South Florida, serves on the PreK-12 appropriations subcommittee. So he should know his facts and figures on public school education. During the meeting where legislators expressed their hopes and concerns for the upcoming year, many talked about public schools. Kiar made a plea to support public schools -- throwing in his criticism of last year's Senate Bill 6, which would have dramatically changed the teacher pay and tenure system and was vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist. During the campaign, Scott said he favored eliminating tenure for new teachers and expanding school options such as private schools, virtual schools and home schooling. Kiar made a plea to not focus on "punishing teachers," to keep the arts and physical education, and then made a comment about teacher pay: "You can go to Georgia and make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher." That sounds like a hefty chunk of change when talking about a public school teacher's salary. We wanted to know -- is the pay difference that large? And was Kiar talking about starting pay? Average pay? Or perhaps some other measurement? When we spoke to Kiar legislative assistant Scott Barrocas on Dec. 20, 2010, he said that Kiar was on a cruise. Since we could not reach Kiar directly by e-mail or cell phone, we decided the most fair measure of teacher pay and best comparison among states would be statewide average pay. That would reflect salaries for a range of teachers in terms of where they live in the state, experience, degrees held and subject matter. A word of warning: Comparing teacher pay isn't a simple task. Even within the state, there are differences in pay and cost of living among school districts, and paychecks vary widely from small towns to urban centers to affluent beachfront communities. Also benefits vary between states, which makes a difference in take-home pay. And Florida doesn't have a state income tax while many other states -- including Georgia -- do. But Kiar's claim was about salaries, so we are limiting this Truth-O-Meter item to examining that measure. The National Education Association, which describes itself as the nation's largest teachers union, showed that the average teacher pay in Florida was $46,912 compared to $54,274 in Georgia -- or a $7,362 difference during the 2009-10 school year. The chart showed an asterisk next to Georgia because the state's Department of Education did not supply the information in time for the report, said Ed Hurley, who works in research at the National Education Association. The NEA came up with an estimate based on pay in previous years and inflation, Hurley said. Since it's difficult to obtain salary information from DOEs for the current year, Hurley suggested we look back at the NEA's chart for the 2008-09 year on Page 92. That chart showed average teacher pay for Florida was $46,921 and $52,879 for Georgia -- or about $5,958 more for Georgia. We contacted Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Education, to ask if he had average teacher pay data for Georgia. Cardoza responded in an e-mail that the average overall teacher salary is $53,138.40 for 2008-09 -- the most recent year of data available for Georgia. We checked the Florida Department of Education for data about average teacher pay across the state. The DOE's Education Information and Accountability Services Data Report on Table 8 showed that the statewide average teacher salary for 2008-09 was $46,938. (Florida's statewide average for 2009-10 decreased slightly to $46,696 but Georgia could not supply that year's data yet and we wanted to compare for the same year.) If we use the data from the Florida and Georgia DOEs, it shows teachers in Georgia earning about $6,200.40 more than in Florida in 2008-09. Note that for the 2008-09 school year the NEA has slightly different figures than the states gave us -- about a $17 difference for Florida and about a $259 difference for Georgia. But the NEA shows nearly $6,000 higher pay in Georgia for 2008-09. The NEA shows more than a $7,000 difference for 2009-10, but the NEA used an estimate for Georgia for that year so it's not as valid of a comparison. Let's summarize all those numbers, with the difference showing how much higher the pay is in Georgia: FL GA Diff NEA 2008-09: $46,921 $52,879 $5,958 NEA 2009-10: $46,912 $54,274* $7,362 DOE 2008-09: $46,938 $53,138.40 $6,200.40 DOE 2009-10: $46,696 N/A N/A * Estimate Still we wondered: Is a straight salary comparison meaningful if we don't compare other factors such as tax policies, health care plans or other criteria? "It's just one factor in the total compensation package," Hurley said. "It is meaningful, but it doesn't tell the whole story on being compensated for their work." Katie Betta, spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon, said in an e-mail that the "bare numbers are not accurate in apples-to-apples comparisons. For example, GA has an income tax, FL does not. FL has class size requirements, meaning many new teachers have been hired, which is not the case in GA. To accurately compare teacher salaries, you must compare among teachers who have been teaching for the same period of time and disaggregate for taxes, health insurance, retirement benefits, etc." She suggested we try the Southern Regional Education Board which sent us a chart of average teacher salaries (click on the "averages for all" tab in the spreadsheet to see the numbers). The most recent year of the chart -- 2008-09 -- showed $46,921 for Florida and $52,879 for Georgia -- the same figures as NEA. The chart states that the sources are NEA and state education agencies. SREB also sent us a 2001 report comparing other benefits such as pensions and health care, but those figures are about a decade old. So are teachers raking in $6,000 more a year in Georgia than Florida? We are using average teacher pay in both states because we found that the best single figure for comparison. By looking at the 2008-09 data from the states' education departments, we find that teachers in Georgia earn about $6,200 more than in Florida. If we look at the most dependable NEA data published, for 2008-09, we find a difference just shy of $6,000. Kiar said "about $6,000," so we rate this claim True.

pomt-07049	Says the 2012-13 state budget "leaves $6 billion in a rainy day fund."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-lawmakers-balanced-budget-an/	In a recent New Orleans appearance, Texas Gov. Rick Perry recapped legislative action back home balancing the 2012-13 state budget while, he crowed, leaving billions in reserve. Perry told the Republican Leadership Conference on June 18: "To preserve our job-friendly climate, the Texas Legislature didn’t raises taxes this last legislative session while balancing their budget and maintaining essential services. And I might add, that new budget leaves $6 billion in a rainy day fund." Some of what Perry celebrated isn’t at issue. Lawmakers must balance each budget; it’s a state constitutional requirement. Also, the GOP-steered 2011 Legislature never considered a tax increase. Whether the resulting plan maintains essential services is subject to debate; time should tell. For this article, we wondered if Perry’s correct that the budget will ultimately leave $6 billion in the state’s so-called rainy day fund, which has a current balance of $5 billion, according to the state comptroller’s office. The fund is fed by state oil and gas oil production taxes. Some background: In January, state Comptroller Susan Combs predicted the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, would have a balance of $9.7 billion by the end of August 2013. That figure was later whittled to $6.4 billion after legislators used $3.2 billion to cover a deficit in the current budget that runs through August. But there’s a catch, potentially a biggun. Republican leaders acknowledge the budget signed into law by Perry under-funds the state’s projected share of Medicaid costs by an estimated $4.4 billion. A summary portion of the budget says that’s the amount the state expects the program to need in supplemental state aid in 2013. Also, the new budget includes a kind of IOU by deferring a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts from the end of the 2013 fiscal year to fiscal 2014. In separate interviews, the chairmen of the Senate Finance Committee and House Appropriations Committee agreed that $6.4 billion should accumulate in the fund over the next two years. But, they said, lawmakers will have designs on those dollars when they meet to start writing the next budget in January 2013. "There’s going to be a demand on the" fund, said Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan. "I decided to use it as a backstop." Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, said the $6 billion-plus "is reserved for future spending" because of the estimated Medicaid shortfall and the possibility lawmakers will restore school district payments to their usual schedule. "We kicked the ball down the road," Pitts said. From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, Ogden said, "I feel good.... From a truth-in-budgeting standpoint, we should have gone ahead and committed" money from the fund. Caveat: Pitts and Ogden noted that fiscal expectations could change considerably before legislators confront the next budget. The state’s economy could grow faster than the comptroller projects, Medicaid demands could fall short of the state’s latest forecasts, Congress could even change what it expects states to fund. Of course, the reverse could also happen, ratcheting up the state’s fiscal obligations. So, as Perry says, lawmakers left $6 billion in the fund. However, if projections hold, that money looks likely to be sucked up in 2013 to make up for this year’s legislative decisions to under-fund Medicaid costs and postpone a payment to school districts. Broadly, Perry’s statement leaves the misimpression that Texas state government is sailing along without financial frets. We rate this blue-sky claim Half True.

pomt-04702	Says Mitt Romney’s tax plans would "give an additional $250,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires" while raising taxes on the middle class.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/05/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-claims-romney-would-cut-millionaire/	Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who serves as a national co-chairman of President Obama's re-election campaign, recently made a three-day bus tour of Ohio to deliver the message that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are "wrong for the middle class." Criticizing the economic plans of the Republican ticket, Strickland told a crowd in Kent that Romney's tax plans would "give an additional $250,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires" while raising taxes on the middle class, according to an account in the Record-Courier of Portage County. Obama made a similar claim in Columbus in May, asserting that Romney wanted "a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country." On the Truth-O-Meter, that claim rated True. PolitiFact Ohio asked the Obama campaign how Strickland's wider claim is supported. In an email, the campaign noted that Strickland also talked about the Ryan budget plan -- the House budget resolution for fiscal 2013 that Ryan proposed -- and said he "was referencing the Romney-Ryan plan, not just Romney." It cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which suggests the plan likely would result in tax cuts for the wealthy, with modest or no benefits for low-income working households. While some Democrats like to refer to Ryan’s plan as the "Romney-Ryan plan," because Romney has endorsed parts of the Ryan budget, there is no hybrid. Romney does have his own tax plan, "and that's the budget plan that we're going to run on," he said on "60 Minutes." According to his campaign website, the plans include permanently extending the 2001-03 tax cuts, further cutting individual income tax rates by 20 percent, broadening the tax base by reducing tax preferences, eliminating taxation of investment income of most individual taxpayers, reducing the corporate income tax, eliminating the estate tax, and repealing the alternative minimum tax and the taxes enacted in 2010’s health reform legislation. Romney’s campaign website states that lowering both individual and corporate tax rates will stimulate economic growth. For an independent assessment of Romney’s plan, we also turned to the Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution, a think tank that, among other things, evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. While judging tax proposals is subject to some degree of interpretation, the Tax Policy Center has a significant degree of respect in tax circles. The group ran two sets of numbers for Romney's plan. One version, known as "current policy," assumes that the tax cuts initially enacted under President George W. Bush and the alternative minimum tax cuts will be extended, with or without Romney. This method only counts the taxpayer savings from the new proposals in Romney’s tax plan. The Tax Policy Center found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. The other version, known as "current law," essentially gives Romney credit for extending the Bush tax cuts and for an annual adjustment in the alternative minimum tax. Under this calculation, taxpayers’ savings from these two extensions are added to the total tax cuts from Romney’s tax proposal itself. By this method, the average tax cut for someone with cash income north of $1 million a year would be $390,876, according to the Tax Policy Center. Even using the more restrictive of the Tax Policy Center’s two calculations, Strickland's statement about millionaires, like Obama's, is correct. But taxes would not increase on the middle class under the plan, said Bob Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Taxes would decrease for most taxpayers, although they would increase on the bottom quintile, or the poorest 20 percent of the country. Romney has promised that low- and middle-income households will pay no larger shares of federal taxes than they do now. He also said his plan would be revenue neutral, meaning the revenue loss caused by lowering tax rates would be recouped by stimulated economic growth and by reducing or eliminating certain tax deductions and write-offs. But Romney has not specified what tax preferences he would cut to make up lost revenue. The Tax Policy Center looked at some of the possibilities in a second study it published Aug. 1 that analyzed the tradeoffs among the goals stated in Romney's plan, including lowering marginal tax rates, maintaining tax revenues and maintaining progressivity. One of its authors, William Gale, vice president of Brookings and director of its economic studies program, served on President George H.W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. Another, Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings who has a doctorate from Harvard University, served on Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2009 and 2010. To try and keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs -- starting with the deductions for top earners first -- until they came up with enough revenue to offset the $360 billion in tax cuts that are part of Romney's plan. They also added in the effects of tax changes on economic growth. using a model developed by one of Romney's economic advisers, Harvard professor Greg Mankiw. They determined that people who earn $1 million or more in taxable income would see an average net tax decrease of $87,117. They’d save $175,961 from Romney's tax cut, but lose $88,444 in deductions. People who earn between $500,000 and $1 million would see a cut of about $17,000, and taxes for people with income between $200,000 and $500,000 would decrease by about $1,800, the study found. But to make Romney's plan revenue neutral, deductions would also have to be removed for people with income below $200,000, and the effects of that would be significant, the study found. Eliminating the deductions would mean outright tax increases for everyone with income below $200,000. People with taxable income between $50,000 and $75,000, for example, would see an average net tax increase of $641. They’d save $984 from Romney's rate cut, but lose $2,672 in write-offs. The authors specifically noted that taxpayers with children whose income is below $200,000 would see their taxes go up by an average of $2,041. The reason for the increase is that the most popular tax breaks heavily benefit middle- and lower-income families -- the 95 percent of the population who earn less than $200,000 and, for example, carry mortgage debt and use employer-provided health insurance. Though Romney has suggested he would focus on taking the deductions away from the wealthy, the study concluded that focusing on the top alone would not make up for the revenue sacrificed when rates are slashed. Unlike John McCain and Obama, whose detailed tax plans were analyzed by the Tax Policy Center in 2008, Romney has presented a "not well defined" plan that is "very explicit about some things and non-specific about others," Williams said. "Given what he has said, it is difficult if not impossible to see a way it would not raise taxes on the middle class." Strickland’s claim was that Romney's plan would "give an additional $250,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires" while raising taxes to the middle class. He is partially accurate. A study by the Tax Policy Center about Romney's stated plans found that millionaires would get a $250,000 tax cut. But it also found those plans would cut taxes for the middle class, too, though they would raise them on the lowest-income households. A second Tax Policy Center study, which used what Romney has said about his tax plan and attempted to calculate outcomes for different groups of taxpayers, found that making the plan revenue neutral would result in smaller tax cuts for millionaires and families with income above $200,000, but would require raising taxes on other households, including the middle class. As long as the details of the Romney plan remain unknown, the conclusions can't be definite. But the part of Strickland's statement about millionaires represents tax cuts they would get without accounting for tax deductions and write-offs that could be reduced or eliminated. His statement about the middle class -- who stand to lose more from changes to those deductions than they'd gain by the tax cuts -- includes them. Those are important details that put the claim in proper context. On the Truth-O-Meter, Strickland’s claim rates Half True.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2012-09-05T06:00:00	2012-08-27	['None']

pomt-11918	Says she debated her opponent "multiple times."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/oct/18/nancy-mcfarlane/raleigh-mayor-says-she-debated-opponent-multiple-t/	Charles Francis wants to stand on stage with Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane and debate the best ways to address the city’s issues. Francis on Sunday called for a runoff against McFarlane after the mayor, in municipal elections on Oct. 10, fell about 2 percentage points short of reaching the 50 percent required to secure the win. Francis, who trailed with 36 percent of the vote, says the two candidates have yet to debate. McFarlane, reacting to Francis’ announcement, on Monday challenged the idea that they haven’t debated. "We debated multiple times," McFarlane said. "I’m not sure why he keeps bringing up this narrative that we’ve never debated. We had multiple forums. There were maybe five." How can one candidate say he’s still waiting to debate while another says they’ve debated "multiple times?" Because they appear to have different definitions of the word "debate." Francis, an attorney, says McFarlane has declined his offer to stand on stage with him in a televised event where they argue the issues one-on-one. "Debates are important so that voters can better see the clear alternative that they have in this race," he said in a statement. "Mayor McFarlane has now tentatively agreed to a televised debate during the runoff election. I believe that this debate will point out the clear differences for voters to make an informed decision." McFarlane, a longtime pharmaceutical business owner, considers it a debate if the two candidates are in the same location at the same time explaining their political positions to voters. Her campaign notes that Francis has twice referred to events they attended as debates: in closing comments during the Aug. 15 Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum; and on his Facebook page when he referred to a Sept. 28 forum as a debate. That may be true. But that doesn’t necessarily mean either candidate’s definition of "debate" is accurate. Defining debate Merriam-Webster defines "debate" as "a regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides" and Dictionary.com says it’s "a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints." By those definitions, McFarlane certainly has a case. Both candidates have been in the same location at the same time answering the same questions. The Commission on Presidential Debates is a nonprofit group that has organized debates for presidential and vice presidential candidates in every general election since 1988. The commission doesn’t offer a definition for a "debate" or list requirements to hold one. Instead, it offers a wide range of formats that can be used in debates and suggests that political debates should be structured and allow for rebuttals. The aforementioned descriptions are so vague that they don’t necessarily help us in this situation. So we asked experts on political science, communication and forensics (which means debate) what they consider to be a true political debate. Key components They all suggested political debates include three elements: a stage, a large audience, and a format that allows for two candidates – and preferably no more – to engage each other in a way that allows for claims and rebuttals. The experts cast doubt on McFarlane’s claim that forums qualify as debates. Forums where candidates answer the same questions could qualify as debates if the candidates are given time to engage each other, said David McLennan, professor of political science at Meredith College in Raleigh. But typically, they don’t. "Unless they’re addressing one another in the same venue, it wouldn’t be a political debate," McLennan said. Allan Louden, chair of the communications department at Wake Forest University, researches argumentation theory, political communication and presidential rhetoric. Louden referred to forums not as debates but as "joint appearances." He says debates are supposed to inform the public about key policy differences between candidates and that, by allowing candidates to challenge each other, face-to-face arguments are the best way to do that. He noted that the size of the audience matters. Debates "are not much good if you don’t have an audience." Robert Imbody, director of forensics at the University of Alabama, said he doesn’t think any of the events qualify as a traditional political debate. He echoed McLennan and Louden in saying there’s got to be "crossfire." "When we talk about what is a debate, we’re talking about an organized clash," Imbody said. "‘If there’s no clash or discord, then there’s nothing to debate. You’re just giving speeches." So let’s look at the events McFarlane and Francis attended together. McFarlane’s campaign says she and Francis attended seven events together between Aug. 15 and Sept. 28. Three stood out to PolitiFact. Raleigh events On Aug. 15, McFarlane and Francis both attended the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum at Martin Street Baptist Church. James Sonneman, a spokesman for McFarlane’s campaign, said the mayoral candidates were interviewed separately from council candidates. "During the mayoral portion, only Francis and Nancy participated and were given ample room to engage in a discussion regarding questions posed by community members," Sonneman said. The event was not televised or streamed online. A recording provided by Sonneman includes audio of McFarlane and Francis answering the same questions, one at a time, and occasionally asking the moderator for a chance to respond to the other candidate. In closing comments, Francis said, "I want to thank you all for your attention in the debate tonight." On Sept. 18, Sonneman says they attended a similar event: the Wake County Voter Education Coalition Forum at Garner Rd. Community Center. "As I understand, it had a very similar agenda to the RWCA forum in that Mayoral and Council candidates went separately and that an engaging discussion between Nancy and Francis was fostered," he said. On Sept. 28, Francis and McFarlane attended a forum hosted by the League of Women Voters and WakeUP Wake County Forum at Avent Ferry United Methodist Church. The event, where mayoral and City Council candidates were asked the same questions, was streamed online at wral.com. The video shows McFarlane and Francis often taking turns answering the same question. In Monday’s press conference, McFarlane pointed to the WakeUP event as a debate. Karen Rindge, executive director of WakeUP, said the format allowed for the candidates to engage each other. "They could have raised a point about their opponent if they chose," Rindge said. "However, I would not describe our candidate forum as a structured debate." Our ruling McFarlane said she has debated Francis "multiple times." The candidates were indeed in the same place and exchanged ideas back-to-back. And Francis referred to a couple forums as debates. But political experts say most of the events she’s referring to didn’t include the key elements often needed for a fair, informative political debate. So we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13904	"Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correct-analysts-have-called-donal/	Hillary Clinton, riding a bump in the polls, kept the heat on Donald Trump during a speech in Cincinnati that marked the first time she had campaigned alongside Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the progressive wing of her party. "Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism," Clinton said during the speech on June 27, 2016. We don’t take a position on whether Trump actually is one of the top threats facing the global economy. But we thought we’d check to see whether Clinton has solid evidence that professional risk analysts have made that argument. So is Clinton right about how analysts have rated Trump? Basically, yes. When we asked the Clinton campaign what she was referring to, they pointed us to the periodic rankings of global risk published by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Economist Intelligence Unit -- an affiliate of The Economist, the London-based newsweekly -- is a research and analysis firm that supplies clients, including businesses, with information about opportunities and risks around the world. The firm made headlines in March 2016 when it listed the possibility of a Trump presidency as one of the biggest threats to "companies’ capacity to operate at target profitability." The rankings are based on "qualitative" judgments of a how powerfully an event could affect the world and how likely it is to happen, the firm says. In its March ratings, the firm rated the risks from a Trump presidency as 12 on a 25-point scale. That ranked Trump sixth among the 10-item list of biggest threats, tied with "the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy." But the Trump threat level increased in the July 2016 rankings. A Trump presidency now ranks as the third-biggest global threat, with an increased score of 16 on the 25-point scale. In the meantime, the risk from jihadi terrorism has remained constant with a score of 12. In the July ratings, the only higher scores were 20 for "China experiences a hard landing" and, in a tie with Trump, a 16 for "currency volatility and persistent commodity prices weakness." Specifically, the firm wrote that "although we do not expect Mr. Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil or a sudden economic downturn." The writeup cited his "hostility" to free trade, his hard line on Muslims, his "militaristic tendencies," his skepticism toward NATO, and his "indifference" to nuclear proliferation in Asia. The firm had never rated a pending candidacy to be a geopolitical risk to the United States and the world, an official told Politico. We checked with Robert Powell, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s New York-based global risk briefing manager, to see whether he thought Clinton’s phrasing was accurate, and he said it was. "Her quote does accurately describe our global risk scenarios," Powell told PolitiFact. "Despite the high likelihood of more terrorist attacks, the impact on the global economy tends to be relatively slight -- indeed, most global stock markets rose on the day of the Brussels attacks, for instance. However, given that the U.S. economy is the biggest in the world, we believe a Trump presidency would have a major impact on the entire global economy." Clinton said "risk analysts" -- plural -- had determined Trump to be a threat, but we were unable to find any equivalent of the Economist Intelligence Unit report. (Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said that "analysts" was intended to refer to the multiple analysts within the Economist Intelligence Unit who came up with the ratings.) But we did find another major economic report that painted a grim picture of what could happen to the economy if Trump wins. On June 17, Moody’s Analytics, an economic research and data-services firm, published its projections of what could happen to the economy under Trump-backed policies on taxes, government spending, immigration and international trade. (We fact-checked the political background of one of the Moody's authors in another report.) "Four basic conclusions regarding the impact of Mr. Trump’s economic proposals can be reached," the Moody’s team wrote. "One, they will result in a less global U.S. economy; two, they will lead to larger government deficits and more debt; three, they will largely benefit very high-income households; and four, they will result in a weaker U.S. economy, with fewer jobs and higher unemployment." Our ruling Clinton said, "Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism." The analysts at one firm, the Economist Intelligence Unit, have declared the possibility of Trump’s election to be the third-greatest global risk in its current rankings, a risk level that has only grown since the firm began including Trump in its rankings in March. And Clinton has accurately noted that the risk factor given to a Trump presidency is higher than the rating for Islamic terrorism on the firm’s list.

pomt-02481	Chris Christie "helped funnel $6 million in federal Hurricane Sandy money to a senior center in Belleville, N.J., a place that suffered no damage."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/19/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-chris-christie-steered-6-mi/	MSNBC anchors continued their exhaustive coverage of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s no-good 2014 recently with a look at how he went to bat for new senior housing in a small town. What’s so bad about that? O'Donnell suggested that Christie wasted Superstorm Standy relief money to help fund the project. On his Feb. 11 show, O’Donnell opened with clips of Christie speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, where Christie said he fought for Superstorm Sandy relief money "because every dollar that we’ve been shorted will have an impact on the lives of the people of my state. And as governor, your job is to fight for those people as hard as you can." That’s when O’Donnell chimed in: "Now, of course, Christie knows that he’s talking to an audience that knows nothing about what he’s talking about. That is his specialty as a public speaker. ... He was talking to an audience that did not know that he helped funnel $6 million in federal Hurricane Sandy money to a senior center in Belleville, N.J., a place that suffered no damage." PunditFact wanted to dig deeper into O’Donnell’s assertion. Where did O’Donnell come up with that? The claim is grounded, for the most part, in a Jan. 28 investigation by The Star-Ledger newspaper of Newark, N.J. The crux of the report: Christie personally pushed for hurricane relief money to build a senior housing project that had been in the works long before Superstorm Sandy in Belleville, a town in Essex County. Belleville was "not particularly hard hit," the newspaper reported, with some flooding, downed trees and some week-long power outages. But Essex County was one of nine counties deemed most impacted by the storm by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. As part of $1.8 billion in various federal disaster relief grants, Christie directed $6 million to the senior housing project. Christie played a prominent role during a May 2013 groundbreaking ceremony for the new housing complex, which will cost $18 million overall (the day after he famously traversed the Jersey Shore with President Barack Obama). Town mayor Raymond Kimble praised Christie for committing to the facility’s construction, saying it will help seniors stay in their hometown instead of spending their final years somewhere new. (Here’s a video.) Christie echoed those remarks as he described how he kept in constant contact with various state and local officials about the project (video): "This project was so worthy, and to be honest, so overdue that I felt like there was no time to wait. We needed to do this and do it quickly," Christie said. Two weeks later, Kimble, a Democrat, endorsed Christie as the governor faced re-election. The coverage from that day, and the speeches, included little mention of a connection to Superstorm Sandy, or that the housing was needed as part of the storm response. What was the damage? It’s too far to say Belleville suffered "no damage." Most if not all of New Jersey felt something, even if it wasn’t as severely pummeled as the Jersey Shore. All 21 counties were declared major disaster areas. A Rutgers University study found that Belleville ranked 255th out of 553 municipalities in what researchers called the Sandy Community Hardship Index. The index measures the residential, commercial and municipal damage to each New Jersey town -- with No. 1 being the hardest hit. Kimble, Belleville’s mayor, told the Star-Ledger he did not know of any residents who were displaced by the storm, and experts told us there are no good numbers for displaced residents for the state overall. About 3 percent of Belleville’s households, or 43, had major or severe damage from the storm, whereas anywhere from 10 to 113 percent of households in various parts of Toms River, N.J., suffered major or severe damage, according to New Jersey’s action plan for a Community Development Block Grant for disaster relief. The Star-Ledger more recently published another investigation into Sandy spending, this time finding nearly one-third of the $160 million pot designated for new affordable housing projects after the storm went to Essex and Middlesex counties, which were not as affected as coastal communities. There’s more to the story, says Team Christie Let’s review the facts that aren’t up for disagreement: The senior facility is slated for $6 million in Sandy relief funds, and Christie made sure the senior center got the money. There is also little debate that Belleview did not suffer the brunt of the storm, though describing it as "no damage" as O’Donnell did is an overstatement. What Christie’s team disputes is the suggestion that the Belleview senior housing project is not connected to Superstorm Sandy. Christie’s press office, both in the Star-Ledger story and in an email to PunditFact, said the 137-unit housing project served a need for affordable rental housing for people displaced by the storm. A group of about 35 housing projects approved for disaster grant funding, including the Belleville facility, "were awarded objectively and helped expand affordable housing in Sandy-affected counties to give impacted renters permanent housing options as close to their homes as possible," said spokesman Colin Reed. Put more simply, Reed said the project will serve a need of people in Essex County and elsewhere who were affected by the storm. An executive at the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency has told reporters the goal was to choose "shovel-ready projects." But neither Christie nor other local officeholders at the groundbreaking mentioned that purpose (though a county press release did include a passing mention about housing essentially being available to Sandy survivors). Instead, the officials talked about how the project will allow Belleville seniors to stay in Belleville. "Seniors shouldn’t have to leave the place where they raised their family to find affordable housing," Christie said. Adam Gordon, a staff attorney for the New Jersey-based Fair Share Housing Center, said the idea that residents from harder-hit areas would uproot their lives and move into a Belleville senior housing complex about an hour away from coastal communities is not really credible. "You shouldn’t be able to use ‘shovel ready’ as an excuse for things that are not located in, or really near, the areas that are hit the hardest," Goodman said, "or places that are basically saying ‘we’re marketing this to seniors in our town.’ " We could not reach a spokesman for O’Donnell’s show. Our ruling O’Donnell said Chris Christie "helped funnel $6 million in federal Hurricane Sandy money to a senior center in Belleville, N.J., a place that suffered no damage." O’Donnell is right that Christie helped steer $6 million in Sandy money to a senior center. And he’s right that Belleville fared much better than other places in New Jersey, though to say "no damage" is an exaggeration. Because of that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02746	"By the word religion in the First Amendment, the founders meant Christianity."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/16/bryan-fischer/fundamentalist-when-founders-said-religion-they-me/	Correction: Thomas Jefferson wrote about religious tolerance in the context of a proposed Virigina law. An earlier version offered a different context. This item was updated at 4:40 p.m. Dec. 16, 2013, to reflect that change. There’s nothing like the holidays to bring out the fault lines at the intersection of religion and the state. The New York-based Satanic Temple stirred things up in Oklahoma when it announced that it was submitting plans for a statehouse monument that speaks to its beliefs. This comes several years after Oklahoma lawmakers granted permission for a private group to put up a 10 commandments monument on the capitol lawn. The Satanists say if lawmakers are okay with the 10 commandments, they have to accept all religious representations. Christian fundamentalist talk show host Bryan Fischer said Satanism enjoys no such protection. "By the word religion in the First Amendment, the founders meant Christianity," Fischer said on an American Family Radio broadcast. We thought we’d go to the historic record to see if that claim hews closely to the facts. Fischer said in the second half of the 18th century, the overwhelming majority of the people were Christians. Jews accounted for less than 1 percent, Fischer estimated. The founders, he said, lived in a particular religion environment. "They weren’t providing any cover or shelter for the free exercise of Islam or even Judaism or even atheism," he said. "They weren’t prohibiting that. They were just saying, that is not what we are talking about here." Fischer told PunditFact that he relied on the 1833 writings of U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Joseph Story. President James Madison nominated Story to the court in 1811. Story had a narrow view of the First Amendment. "The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity," Story wrote, "but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects." At least some of the actual founders voiced contrary views. Thomas Kidd, professor of history at Baylor University and the author of God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution, said "the founders were certainly aware of other religions besides Christianity, and discussed them at length in their writings." Kidd pointed us to a 1818 letter from John Adams: "This country has done much. I wish it would do more; and annul every narrow idea in religion, government and commerce," Adams wrote. "It has pleased the providence of the first cause, the universal cause, that Abraham should give religion not only to Hebrews, but to Christians and Mohomitans, the greatest part of the modern civilized world." Benjamin Franklin also weighed in on the subject. Jan Ellen Lewis, professor of history at Rutgers University, cited Franklin’s autobiography, when he praised a new meeting house built in Philadephia. "The design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general," Franklin wrote. "So that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service." In his autobiography, Thomas Jefferson spoke directly to the debate over the crafting of a Virginia statute for religious freedom. Jefferson describes a proposal to add the phrase "the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion." "The insertion was rejected by a great majority," Jefferson wrote, "In proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and Infidel of every denomination." John Ragosta, the Robert C. Vaughan Fellow at the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, pointed us to that excerpt. Ragosta did not dispute that the great majority of people in America were Christians, but he said that makes the vision of the founders that much more impressive. "They were looking to the future," Ragosta said. "They knew that other people would come to America … and that the rights that they were discussing were universal." The historians we reached acknowledged that not every founder shared these beliefs. Still, those contrary views did not carry the day. Fischer also stated that the First Amendment did not apply to the states. Our experts agreed that originally, the states enjoyed the power to foster a particular religion. "Massachusetts retained their state church until 1833," Kidd said. "Various states banned non-Christians from holding state office." But over time Ragosta said, many states themselves overturned such laws, before the Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional in 1961. Our ruling Fischer said that when the founders used the word "religion" in the First Amendment, they meant Christianity. Fischer cites one Supreme Court justice who expressed that view in 1833. On the other side, we have the writings of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and the opinions of scholars. We were unable to find much merit to this claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-13621	Says Donald Trump "has been talking about the option of using a nuclear weapon against our Western European allies."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton/has-donald-trump-talked-about-using-nukes-against-/	Donald Trump is "too dangerous" to have access to the nuclear codes, Hillary Clinton emphasizes in a new ad. The ad features soundbites from pundits voicing concern about whether Trump is ready for the responsibilities of the presidency. Speakers include Michael Hayden, former CIA director under George W. Bush; Max Boot, a conservative foreign policy analyst; and Charles Krauthammer, a conservative columnist. (All have criticized Trump on some occasions.) One clip features Gillian Turner, who worked at the White House National Security Council under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, talking on Fox News. Trump "has been talking about the option of using a nuclear weapon against our Western European allies," the ad shows Turner saying. We wanted to fact-check whether the Clinton campaign accurately portrayed Trump’s comments about nuclear weapons and western Europe. In our view, even though Turner made the statement, it was the Clinton campaign’s decision to pull the clip and advance its "unfit" argument. Is Clinton’s campaign correct in saying Trump has considered using nuclear weapons against America’s western European allies? Not exactly. What Trump has said The comment in question stems from an MSNBC town hall interview in March. Trump was asked by host Chris Matthews if he might use nuclear weapons. Trump: "I’d be the last one to use the nuclear weapons, because that’s sort of like the end of the ballgame." Matthews: "So, can you take it off the table now? Can you tell the Middle East we are not using the nuclear weapon on anybody?" Trump: "I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table." Matthews: "How about Europe? We won’t use it in Europe." Trump: "I’m not going to take it off the table for anybody." Matthews: "You might use it in Europe?" Trump: "No. I don’t think so, but — I am not taking cards off the table. I’m not going to use nukes, but I’m not taking cards off the table." In the same breath, Trump said he would not use nuclear weapons, but he went on to say he wouldn't take it off the table for "anybody," include Europe. He stuck by this phrasing in another interview on The O’Reilly Factor when Eric Bolling asked the same question. "Europe’s a big place," he said. "I’m not going to take cards off the the table. We have nuclear capability. Now, our capability is going down rapidly because of what we're doing. It's in bad shape. The equipment is not properly maintained. There are all lot of talk about that. And that's a bad thing, not a good thing.The last person to use nuclear would be Donald Trump. That’s the way I feel. I think it’s a horrible thing. The thought of it is horrible, but I don’t want to take anything off the table." In these two interviews, each held within a day of one another, Trump’s position on nuclear weapons overall and in Europe is convoluted. Yes, he hates the idea, but he doesn’t want to take the option off the table. Experts weigh in Experts we spoke to said Trump’s comments were a departure from previous rhetoric because they’re imprecise, but they noted his refusal to "take options off the table" is vaguely in line with U.S. policy. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referred to the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report, which focuses on preventing nuclear proliferation, "Indeed, as long as nuclear weapons exist, the United States will sustain safe, secure, and effective nuclear forces," reads the report. "These nuclear forces will continue to play an essential role in deterring potential adversaries and reassuring allies and partners around the world." Point being, there are some instances where the United States does not rule out using nuclear weapons, he said, which is why Trump’s "cards on the table" policy is somewhat in line with U.S. policy. Jim Walsh, an international security and research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he’s "seen nothing" suggesting Trump would use nuclear weapons against America’s European allies. "What Trump may be trying to say is actually consistent with traditional U.S. doctrine, that is, we are prepared to use (nuclear weapons) to counter a Russian/Soviet invasion of Western Europe with conventional forces," Walsh, who is not a fan of Trump, said. "That's a NATO commitment." The usual rhetoric -- that America would use nuclear weapons against Soviets to protect our allies -- is in line with what previous presidents have said, said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. It should be noted that Nephew said he is "repelled by Trump and his rhetoric, including around nuclear weapons." "Previous presidents have spoken about the use of nuclear weapons to threaten the Soviets and others that might attack our allies," Nephew said. "They have talked about battlefield uses only in an extreme crisis and rarely spoken about tactical nuclear weapons at all (which would be what a normal president would be referring to: using nuclear weapons to attack enemy forces invading our Allies)." After speaking to experts, we can conclude that Trump’s comments are vague, but do not translate directly into using weapons against our European allies. We reached out to Gillian Turner to hear how she feels about being used in the ad, but we didn’t hear back from her. Our ruling A Clinton campaign ad claims Trump has talked about the option of using nuclear weapons against America’s western European allies. Experts said his comments on nuclear weapons are imprecise, but they interpreted his comments as vaguely aligned with U.S. policy, at least in the sense that America does not rule out using weapons to protect allies. Trump never explicitly talked about using nuclear weapons against America’s allies in Europe -- but that he he is just leaving the option open. The claim has an element of truth but is misleading, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6046bf15-c408-418b-a780-1b5220f04bca	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-12T09:53:28	2016-08-02	['None']
pomt-12934	Of Sen. Jeff Sessions, "you've objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in our armed forces, saying, 'In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?'"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/10/richard-durbin/durbin-says-sessions-objected-immigrants-armed-for/	Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., challenged fellow senator and nominee for U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, over his lack of support for bills that would’ve helped immigrants in the country illegally during Sessions’ first confirmation hearing. "Sen. Sessions, since joining the Senate in 1997, you've voted against every immigration bill that included a path to citizenship for the undocumented," Durbin said during the hearing Jan. 10. "You described the DREAM Act, which I introduced 15 years ago to spare children who are undocumented through no fault of their own, as 'a reckless proposal for mass amnesty.' You opposed the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill, which passed the Senate four years ago." Durbin then spotlighted Sessions’ comments about immigrants in the military. "You've objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in our armed forces, saying, 'In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?'," Durbin said. We wanted to know if that was Sessions’ position. Durbin was referring to a 2014 radio interview on the Lars Larson Show, a conservative talk radio program. Durbin quoted Sessions accurately, but it’s not clear from the quote he plucked that the discussion was about immigrants in the country illegally, not all immigrants. The Lars Larson Show On the show, Sessions raised concerns about "immigration-type language" being added to a defense authorization bill. Host Larson asked him about that language: "Sen. Sessions, the essence of the idea is, we would say, if you are here in the United States illegally, if you go join the military and do some service, then we will give you permanent resident status to stay in the United States." Sessions agreed on that assessment, but he said, "The real issue would be to open it up to adding additional language." The Alabama senator told Larson he had heard talks of reducing the Army by 100,000 or more soldiers, and that he didn’t think it was the right thing to do. Sessions brought up a news story about a "native of Kenya" who had been accused of demanding $50,000 from a local family to protect them from a hitman. The man was serving in the Navy and Sessions questioned how he had been able to get in. (The Kenyan man was found not guilty of the extortion charge in 2015.) "So, I’m wondering could you get a good test score from his high school, could you get good grade point average from Kenya or wherever," Sessions said. "I just think in terms of who’s going to be the most likely to be a spy: somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?" Sessions added: "We’re going in the wrong direction in a lot of ways. Our head isn’t thinking clearly. At a time when this country needs a good military, the last thing we need to be doing is turning out of our military of people who served and then bringing in people who are illegally in the country." Sessions is initially asked about legislation that would allow "Dreamers" to serve, said Durbin spokesman Ben Marter, "but then speaks at length about immigrants serving in the military and when he says this, he does not distinguish between legal and undocumented immigrants." In the Senate confirmation hearing, Sessions didn’t directly address Durbin’s claim about him objecting to immigrants volunteering to serve in the armed forces. A spokeswoman for Sessions said the Republican senator "has no problem" with eligible immigrants serving in the military "and as attorney general he will enforce and defend such laws as well." "Generally speaking, illegal aliens are not eligible to serve in the military. But regardless, the decision of whether to allow illegal aliens to serve in the military is up to Congress and not something that the attorney general controls," said spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. The secretary of defense has authorized immigrants approved for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to be considered for enlistment in the armed forces. Our ruling During Sessions’ Senate confirmation for attorney general, Durbin told him, "You've objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in our armed forces, saying, 'In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?'" In a 2014 radio interview, Sessions discusses immigrants in the military and raises concerns about a man from Kenya serving in the military, after allegations of the man trying to extort a local family. Sessions does question who’s more likely to be a spy -- somebody from Alabama or Kenya. The radio conversation includes comments about a subset of immigrants, people in the country illegally. With military reductions on the table, Sessions said "the last thing we need" is to get rid of people who have served in the military and bring in "people who are illegally in the country." Durbin’s statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-11190	Says Gwen Graham "voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/may/17/collective-super-pac/did-gwen-graham-vote-against-president-obama-52-pe/	A progressive super PAC slammed the congressional record of Democrat Gwen Graham as too conservative for Florida’s next governor. The Collective super PAC paid for the 30-second spot. The group supports black, progressive candidates and is backing Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the Florida Democratic primary. The ad portrays Graham, who served one term in the House representing North Florida’s District 2, as a contrarian to former President Barack Obama. "Gwen Graham says she is the progressive candidate for governor," the voiceover says, "but while in Congress she voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time." We wanted to know if about half of Graham’s votes really went against what the Obama White House wanted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We found the claim slightly overstates Graham’s votes against Obama by focusing only on part of her time in Congress, rather than both years of her term. Graham’s breaks with the White House were on issues of national security, foreign policy and energy. Sometimes, she was one of just a handful of Democrats to do so. Graham voted more reliably liberal on health care and abortion. Still, according to VoteView.com’s analysis of every roll call vote, Graham was "more conservative than 91 percent of Democrats in the House at the time." Understanding the division The breakdown comes from an analysis by Congressional Quarterly, which tracked how members of Congress voted when the president took a clear position. That includes statements of administration policy provided in advance of the vote, as well as statements by the president or his designated spokespersons. CQ offered a percentage for votes in both 2015 and 2016. In 2015, CQ counted 89 House votes where the White House had a stated preference. According to CQ, Graham supported the president on 49 percent of those votes in 2015. In other words, she voted against Obama 51 percent of the time. One of the most controversial pieces of legislation that Graham voted for in 2015 was a Republican bill that authorized the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline (HR 3). Twenty-eight Democrats including Graham voted in favor of authorizing the pipeline’s construction, which also passed the Senate. But Obama vetoed the bill. More examples: • Graham voted for the Republican-backed North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act (HR 8), which supporters said would have helped modernize infrastructure and federal policies. But the Obama White House threatened to veto the bill because "it would undermine already successful initiatives designed to modernize the nation's energy infrastructure and increase our energy efficiency." It did not make it to a vote in the Senate, however. • Graham voted in favor of legislation (HR 37) that would have amended the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Obama had signed Dodd-Frank into law in 2010. The bill did not pass the Senate. In 2016, however, the percentage of Graham’s votes with Obama increased. Of 54 votes, CQ found Graham voted in line with the White House 65 percent of the time. Or, she broke with Obama on 35 percent of those votes. Some examples: • Graham was one of only three Democrats to vote for the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, which would have increased congressional oversight of sanctions against Iran. It passed the House but did not come to a vote in the Senate, but Obama had threatened to veto the bill. • Graham joined 11 Democrats in voting for a GOP-backed bill that would have prohibited the transfer of a Guantanamo Bay detainee to a facility in the United States. • Graham also voted for the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, which would have placed significant hurdles on the processing of some refugees, likely resulting in at least a pause in admissions. The Obama White House said the bill would in effect prevent Syrian immigrants from coming to the United States by adding significant new certification requirements. Graham camp objects Graham spokesman Matt Harringer said the claim doesn’t tell the whole story. "Gwen disagreed from time to time with President Obama, like on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but she is proud of her progressive record and overwhelmingly voting to support President Obama's agenda — including voting eight times to save the Affordable Care Act, to defend the Clean Power Plan and to protect the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau," he said. Graham voted multiple times against Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while in Congress. The White House only weighed in on half of those votes, despite the fact that Obama would have likely opposed the measures. Harringer pointed to CQ’s party-unity scores, which are included on the same study as the presidential positions. Graham’s average party-unity score was 84 percent after two years in Congress. He also pushed back on VoteView.com’s characterization of her as a "conservative" Democrat. "You could just as easily say she was the most bipartisan Democrat in the Florida delegation at the time," Harringer said. Our ruling The Collective super PAC said Graham "voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time." In her two years in the House, Graham stood out as a Democrat who did not always vote the party line, siding with conservatives on some significant measures about foreign policy and defense. But the group’s ad overstates the percentage in which Graham voted against what Obama wanted by only looking at part of her time in Congress. Graham voted against Obama’s stated policy preference around half the time in 2015, but only 35 percent of the time in 2016. On average for those 143 votes, she broke with Obama 45 percent over two years. Because the claim is partially accurate but missing some details, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02124	"Explosive growth in Medicare" is the reason federal deficit spending is predicted to top $1 trillion again after falling to $600 billion annually.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/11/sean-duffy/sean-duffy-says-explosive-growth-medicare-will-cau/	At the state Republican Party’s convention, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy’s mind was on Medicare. The Republican from northern Wisconsin said unchecked spending on the federal health insurance program for seniors and disabled Americans could reverse progress on taming federal budget deficits and debt. "The debt, it has come down," Duffy said in an interview at the convention with Wisconsin Eye reporter Steve Walters. "We topped out at $1.5 trillion in deficit spending … and we’re down to a bit over $600 billion (deficit). If you look out two years it actually launches again. Then we’re over $1 trillion in just a few more years. So this is not over." Duffy added: "The reason is you have an explosive growth with Medicare. Because our baby boomers are retiring, and -- it’s a great thing with modern medicine -- we live longer as people, and health care costs are going up. All that is putting pressure on Medicare." The congressman’s remarks were made to bolster his case for reforms -- opposed by Democrats -- that he says could save Medicare from insolvency. We’re aware that Duffy backed U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s 2015 budget, which endorsed changes in Medicare for the next generation of recipients. But we wondered whether "explosive growth in Medicare" is the biggest reason projections show the federal deficit topping $1 trillion again after falling to $600 billion annually. By the numbers Duffy’s office offered no backup for his claim, but the numbers are readily available. The annual budget deficit for the 2013 fiscal year was $680 billion, according to an April 2014 report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan scorekeeper. That’s down from $1.41 trillion in 2009, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget’s website. But projections are that after dipping to $469 billion in 2015, yearly deficits will rise steadily to $998 billion by 2022 and slightly over $1 trillion the next two years. (As a percentage of U.S. Gross Domestic Product, the deficit rises from 2.8 percent to 3.7 percent from 2014 to 2024). Why the roller coaster ride? There’s no disagreement that Medicare costs, though growing more slowly than historical rates, will rise substantially in the coming decade as growing numbers of baby boomers become eligible for benefits at age 65. "Under current law, spending for Medicare is expected to grow by an average of 6 percent per year over the next 10 years," a CBO report in February said. "That growth can be attributed in roughly equal parts to increasing caseloads and rising costs per beneficiary." But is Medicare growth "explosive?" And how big a driver will it be in future deficits? For more than a decade, policy analysts have warned of the long-term consequences of rising health care spending. But it’s been widely reported that recent growth in Medicare’s per-beneficiary costs has slowed as overall health-care cost inflation has slowed. In fact, the CBO noted that, over most of the next 10 years, spending for Social Security and Medicare remains "fairly stable" as a share of GDP, before rising in the final few years of the 10-year projection period. Still, Medicare costs are projected to rise faster than GDP growth in the future, said Melinda Buntin, chair of the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. And the government’s crystal ball reveals some eye-popping numbers on Medicare’s future. In 2013, Medicare had about 51 million beneficiaries; that number is expected to climb to 71 million in 2024, the February CBO report said. But other major forces not cited by Duffy will drive deficits. Rising interest rates and increasing federal debt are expected to raise net interest payments from $227 billion in 2014 to $876 billion in 2024. Another player in "healthcare costs" is Medicaid, the federal health program for low-income people. It will account for 2.1 percent of the economy in 2024, up from 1.7 percent in 2014, as some states expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And Social Security is rising fast as well, Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us. The CBO summed up the landscape by saying the substantial rise in the deficit will be mainly because of the aging population, rising healthcare costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance (in the Affordable Care Act), and growing interest payments on federal debt. So, bottom line, what is the main driver in the deficit projections? For help, we turned to the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that educates the public about the consequences of federal budget decisions. Concord’s policy director, Joshua Gordon, said that, on a percentage growth basis, Medicare and Social Security are in a virtual tie between now and the $1 trillion projected deficit in 2022. Their predicted growth rates in that period are within a percentage point. Still, Social Security, the largest federal entitlement, contributes more to the deficit in actual dollar terms. Social Security is projected to grow by nearly $500 billion over 10 years compared with about $310 billion for net Medicare outlays (after factoring in premiums paid and other offsets). Net interest on federal debt easily tops both of those -- though Joseph Antos, a health care scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, notes that "net interest is the result of decades of deficit spending and is not something one can reduce directly." Cutting Social Security involves directly reducing benefits. That leaves Medicare. Congress and the White House have enacted several Medicare savings items, but have been unable to reach a long-term deal to tame Medicare and Social Security growth. They have concentrated spending cuts on discretionary programs, things such as defense, law enforcement, transportation, the national park system, disaster relief, and foreign aid. As a consequence, both defense and nondefense discretionary outlays are projected to fall by more than 20 percent relative to the size of the economy over the next 10 years, CBO said. PolitiFact Florida in November 2013 checked Senator Marco Rubio’s claim that "what is driving our long-term debt are Medicare and Social Security programs that are structured in unsustainable ways." Rubio’s claim was rated Mostly True. Medicare and Social Security are projected to grow as a percentage of GDP, while defense is projected to shrink by the same measurement -- but defense is a factor in our debt, the item said. Our rating Duffy says "explosive growth in Medicare" is the reason that federal deficit spending is predicted to top $1 trillion again after falling to $600 billion annually. The congressman’s deficit figures are on target and there’s no doubt that Medicare is a major driver of predicted deficits. But Duffy leaves out Social Security from the equation. There’s a spot on the Truth-O-Meter for a partially accurate statement that leaves out important details. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-00816	Says Barack Obama voted for the "very same language" of Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act when he was in the Illinois state Senate. Sexual orientation "doesn't have anything to do with this law."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/29/mike-pence/did-barack-obama-vote-religious-freedom-restoratio/	Indiana Gov. Mike Pence decried an "avalanche of intolerance" directed at his state Sunday after he signed a law that he says protects the religious freedom of Hoosiers. Critics, however, say it is Pence and Republican lawmakers who are promoting intolerance, with civil rights advocates and business leaders of Apple and Indiana-based organizations such as the NCAA and Angie’s List wary of the state’s new Religious Freedom Restoration Act opening the door for discrimination against gays and lesbians based on religious belief. That fear is overblown, Pence said on ABC This Week on March 29, 2015, pointing to support for similar legislation from two of the country’s highest-profile Democrats as evidence: President Bill Clinton, who signed the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993, and President Barack Obama. Sexual orientation "doesn’t have anything to do with" the law, Pence said. "Then state-Sen. Barack Obama voted for (the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) when he was in the state senate of Illinois," Pence said. "The very same language." While Pence would not answer if Indiana businesses could refuse to serve gay couples, he repeated his point about Obama a few times. So we wanted to fact-check it. The bottom line: As an Illinois state senator, Obama did vote for a version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It passed the Illinois Senate 56-0 and became law on July 1, 1998. However, the language isn’t the "very same," and the claim is not as simple as lining up one vote next to the other and declaring them equal, experts told us. Then and now The 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act was signed by Clinton with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill passed the House unanimously and 97-3 in the Senate. The intent of the bill was to protect religious practices from government interference, such as whether a Muslim prison guard could wear a beard, or if a Jehovah’s Witness needed special coverage for medical procedures because he or she is against blood transfusions, or Native American religious practices. States started passing their own laws when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1997 that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed did not apply to the states. Since then, 19 states have passed their own laws. Many, like Illinois, did so in the initial wave. Fast-forward to the current climate. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans. Meanwhile, same-sex marriage bans in states like Indiana have been struck down by lower courts, dramatically changing the concept of legal marriage at breakneck speed. Conservatives in Indiana and elsewhere see the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2015, lawmakers in 16 states have introduced legislation that proposes or changes laws protecting religious liberty. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a similar but more widely opposed law in 2014. When Pence signed SB 101 in a private ceremony, three people who work for groups that supported the same-sex marriage ban and want to limit civil rights for gays and lesbians were in attendance. One of the lobbyists, Eric Miller of Advance America, heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty "for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples." This is a direct reference to high-profile cases of Christian wedding vendors refusing to provide services for gay couples in other states. In his ABC interview, Pence said Indiana’s law followed the Hobby Lobby case before the Supreme Court last year, in which the court ruled 5-4 that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects family owned corporations from being forced to offer insurance that covers contraception under the health care law. In one sense, there isn’t all that much difference between the bill that got Obama’s vote in Illinois 17 years ago and the bill that Pence signed into law last week. But how people want the law applied, on top of other legislative changes, has changed the landscape dramatically, said Steve Sanders, Indiana University Maurer School of Law professor of family and constitutional law. "What has completely changed are the politics around the issue, the symbolism of what voting for one of these laws means," Sanders said. In other words, it’s how some conservatives want Indiana’s law to work that fosters fear among civil rights advocates for how it might. Still, constitutional law professors say both sides are misinterpreting the point of these laws. The courts have not approved exemptions to discriminate against gays under religious freedom laws, and likely would not because the government has a compelling interest in protecting civil rights. The two sides are essentially yelling past one another about a non-issue when they should be working on enacting protections based on sexual orientation in Indiana, said Robin Fretwell Wilson, professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois College of Law. "If there’s a license to discriminate in Indiana, it’s the fact there’s an absence of a statewide law that makes a promise to the LGBT community," she said. "RFRA is about minoritarian religion against government, by and large." LGBT protections Indiana and Illinois are neighbors in geography but strangers in their approach to gay rights. This difference adds another layer of context to consider with Pence’s claim. In 2004, Illinois lawmakers passed anti-discrimination laws based on sexual orientation for housing, employment, public accommodation, credit and other measures. Nine years later, the state passed a same-sex marriage law. These protections did not exist in the state when Obama cast his vote, but same-sex marriage was not part of the discussion as it is now, as it was not yet legalized, Wilson said. Pressed by Stephanopoulos, Pence said he would not seek protections based on sexual orientation in Indiana and would not say whether Hoosiers could refuse services to gays or lesbians. "To say, ‘We did what Illinois did,’ without acknowledging the fact that Illinois gave protections, really misses the real debate," Wilson said. An Indianapolis Star exploration of what the law means for the state suggested LGBT rights may succeed in RFRA challenges in the few cities that have passed nondiscrimination ordinances. But whether the state as a whole has a "compelling interest" in protecting LGBT rights over religious beliefs remains to be seen, the report said. Lambda Legal, a nonprofit that fights for gay rights, said Indiana’s lack of protections for gays and lesbians is important because people who do not want to take business from gays and lesbians "may claim that lack of a statewide law barring sexual orientation and gender identity discriminating means that there is no compelling state interest in enforcing local ordinances providing such protections." Sanders of Indiana University said the problem is that people in Indiana might think they can discriminate against gays and lesbians now even if a court does not eventually side with them. "The fine print is that if someone wants to discriminate, they have to be able to argue in court for that right, and the court will eventually decide," Sanders said. Difference in wording The wording of each state’s law is similar in that neither mentions sexual orientation or discrimination. But the Human Rights Campaign, which opposes Indiana’s law, says the law is fundamentally different than the federal version and Illinois’ over its definition of "person." Under Indiana’s post-Hobby Lobby law, a "person" is extended to mean "a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association" or another entity driven by religious belief that can sue and be sued. To the Human Rights Campaign, this nullifies Pence’s claim that his law is nothing new from the Illinois law. "That means a corporation in Indiana has a cause of action to sue the government claiming religious personhood for the purposes of this law," said HRC spokesman Adam Talbot. To Wilson, the inclusion of a corporation is not surprising. It was not typical to define "person" in religious freedom legislation, she said, which gets to the heart of the Hobby Lobby case. The Supreme Court decided laws could be applied to "closely held" companies operating on religious belief. Further, all three laws contain the "same critical language" that if someone feels substantially burdened by a regulation or law, the government has to justify a "compelling government interest" for it to the court, said Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia constitutional law professor (Laycock and Wilson co-signed a letter to Indiana Senate Republicans in support of SB 101 not because its effects will be "radical" but but because it offered "more transparent and more secure" protections of religious liberty.) The Illinois law does not address the "person" question because it mirrors the federal law, which was interpreted to apply to corporations because the U.S. Code includes "corporations" as a person, Laycock said. "As a practical matter, there are almost no cases involving corporations because very few are running on religious lines," Laycock said. The American Civil Liberties Union, meanwhile, is concerned about another difference in the wording of the two laws. Indiana’s law includes language that allows people to claim a religious freedom exemption "regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding." That language is absent from the Illinois law. "The Illinois law was written and designed to allow someone to change the government’s burdens on people’s religious beliefs," said Eunice Rho, American Civil Liberties Union advocacy and policy counsel. "The Indiana law specifically says you can use the law in a lawsuit even if the government isn’t a party." Ultimately, judges will have to interpret the intent of the Indiana law’s language. But that doesn’t change that there are differences between it and the counterpart in Illinois. Our ruling Pence played defense Sunday, saying, that sexual orientation "doesn’t have anything to do with" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act," adding that "then state-Sen Barack Obama voted for (the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) when he was in the state Senate of Illinois. The very same language." A spokeswoman for Pence did not respond. The vote is clear enough, as is the name of the bill, but Pence’s explanation is an oversimplification of the purpose of the law then and the motivation of some pushing the law now. Proponents of this law are pushing the measure as a way that businesses can seek protection "for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage." Whether that argument will win in the courts is up for debate. That was far from an intent of Illinois’ law, or the others passed more than 15 years ago. As for the language itself, Pence is incorrect to say the language is the same. Some pro-LGBT rights groups say the outright inclusion of a corporation or company as a "person" is overly broad, though the true impact will likely only really be settled when matters are sent to a court. Overall, Pence’s claim is partially accurate but misses important context.

pomt-07674	Says iPads and iPhones "are built in the United States of America."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/09/john-mccain/john-mccain-errs-saying-ipads-iphones-are-made-us/	On the March 6, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the host asked Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., about the report she had just aired about American competitiveness. "Well, I think it's obviously a recognition of the reality and the trends, that cheaper, lower-cost labor products will usually prevail over the products made in higher wage and income countries," McCain said. "But I would also point out that, if you'd emptied (a house shown in the earlier segment) -- if you'd left a computer there or an iPad or an iPhone, those are built in the United States of America. And as the president said, continuously, and I agree with him, innovation is the key to us being able to restore our economy." Critics immediately jumped on McCain’s statement that the devices "are built in the United States of America." The answer is inscribed on the back of every iPhone: "Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China." When we contacted McCain’s office, spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan confirmed that the senator had been in error and had corrected himself in interviews later on Sunday. "Sen. McCain is aware the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple products were designed in the United States but manufactured elsewhere," said Buchanan. In fact, one of Apple’s key manufacturing contractors in China, Foxconn, has attracted attention over the years for allegations of worker abuse. (Apple did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) It’s true that Apple, a U.S.-based company, has thrived in the global market against foreign-based competitors. But McCain was wrong to suggest that iPads and iPhones "are built in the United States of America." They aren’t. So we rate his comment False.

pomt-10998	"Shocking Video Emerges of Obama Mocking God and the Bible."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/blog-posting/old-obama-video-misrepresents-his-views-christiani/	Throughout Barack Obama’s presidency, critics questioned his Christian beliefs. The suspicion among some conservative Facebook groups has continued a year and a half after his exit from the White House. One group, called Yes I’m Right, shared a link to an article titled "Shocking Video Emerges of Obama Mocking God and the Bible." Hundreds of users reacted and shared the link, which led to a Conservative Post write-up and video. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook’s News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked at the video. It has been around since 2006 and is clipped from a larger 40-minute speech about separating religious beliefs from policymaking. Strategic editing The Conservative Post article is just a few sentences long, accusing Obama of an "open universalist attitude toward faith" and say that his faith is "100% phony." According to his biographies, Obama became a practicing Christian in early adulthood when he began working with religious community groups in Chicago. According to reports during his time in office, he prayed daily and would regularly consult with pastors for spiritual guidance. In the attached 3-and-a-half minute video, Obama does not denigrate Christianity. He is shown arguing for political compromise across religions. "We are no longer a Christian nation, or at least not just," he says, "We are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, and a Buddhist nation, and a Hindu nation, and a nation of non-believers." Because of this, Obama argues, making political policy based solely on religious beliefs is unsustainable. He gives the example of a Christian who objects to abortion on religious grounds: Though they may feel strongly that is wrong because of their religion, he says, they cannot use the Bible as their evidence. Obama also notes that, if the government was led by religion, many books of the Bible would not be applicable for making policy. As the audience laughs, he says that Leviticus, which condones slavery but forbids shellfish, or Deuteronomy, which allows for the stoning of wayward children, would not be suitable for modern laws. This might be interpreted as disrespect or mocking by some viewers. However, the video is cut from a much larger speech: Obama’s keynote at the "Building a Covenant for a New America" conference in 2006. The conference was sponsored by Sojourners, a progressive Christian magazine. In Obama’s 40-minute address, he urges Democrats to embrace religion, rather than shy away from it or decry it. Even if religious arguments are not sufficient for making policy, the moral lessons that religions teach can be essential for guiding decisions and reaching out to others. So when viewed as a whole, the point of the speech is not to mock Christianity. Unlikely sources Here’s where things get interesting: the video wasn’t edited together by conservative groups seeking to discredit Obama’s religious views. It was edited and posted originally by an online spiritual group in favor of Obama. Founded in the mid 1990s, Yoism is an "open-source religion" in which participants can continually propose new tenets and beliefs. The group votes on the proposals, and then adds them to the Book of Yo. Though the book has not been updated since 2004, it appears the website remained active and politically vocal throughout the Obama presidency, frequently defending his policies. The Yoism site attached the video underneath a Doonesbury cartoon about Christmas decorations and short article praising Obama for his commitment to the separation of church and state. Using the same video that was shared by Conservative Post, the Yoans applauded Obama’s Christian values. Our ruling Obama gave a speech in 2006 that encouraged Christians to take a compromising approach to their religious values when creating policy. He spoke extensively about his own experience as a Christian and encouraged the crowd of Democrats to use their religion to guide them on moral issues. He does emphasize the extremity of many of the Bible stories, perhaps in a way that some Christians would feel is disrespectful. However, the few snippets of Obama’s longer speech do not accurately reflect his views on Christianity overall, and it is an overstatement to say that he is mocking God. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01318	Says Sen. Rand Paul’s 2011 budget "included a big cut in the CDC."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/27/doug-muder/blog-sen-paul-wanted-big-cut-cdc-2011/	We don’t know yet if the Ebola scare will help either party or be an afterthought in the midterm elections, but liberal blogger Doug Muder argued that confronting Ebola shows that it makes sense to vote Democratic. For Muder, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul is the poster child for a distinct partisan contrast. "Ebola points out why we need a fully funded government," Muder wrote. "When there’s no immediate threat of disease, government agencies like the CDC look like bureaucratic waste. When Rand Paul put out a ‘Tea Party budget’ in 2011, it included a big cut in the CDC, and virtually no explanation as to how this would affect its mission." In this fact-check, we look at whether Paul proposed a "big cut" in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Muder had blogged about Paul’s budget in 2011. Back then, Muder asked how the CDC would be able to fulfill its mission if, as Paul wanted, its budget was cut by $1.165 billion. We went back to Paul’s original budget documents. One posted January 2011 called for the $1.165 billion reduction that Muder mentioned. Paul then assembled a more complete budget plan in May 2011. It would cut the CDC budget by 20 percent from its Fiscal Year 2008 levels. Depending on whether you include special funds to evaluate federal health programs, Congress appropriated between $6.049 billion and $6.375 billion for the CDC in FY 2008. So Rand’s 20 percent reduction amounts to either $1.209 billion or $1.275 billion in cuts. That’s slightly more than Muder described. Paul wrote in his plan, "The center is often mentioned in media reports highlighting their lavish accommodations. For example, in 2005, the CDC built a conference center for $106 million, complete with large-screen plasma TVs. They also spent tens of millions of dollars on state-of-the-art anti-gravity seating for employees, as well as luxury furniture. Taxpayers can no longer afford the luxury working atmosphere of the CDC." That budget plan remains posted on the website randpaul2016.com, Paul's Senate re-election website. Brian Darling, a Paul spokesman, agreed that the senator has proposed these cuts in the past, but said that funding and the ability to fight Ebola don’t inevitably go hand-in-hand. "If you look closely at the CDC budget, there are funds that have been wasted on projects that have nothing to do with disease prevention," Darling said. Darling then noted that Congress has been at least as supportive of the CDC as the Obama administration. Darling said that in an omnibus spending bill, Congress appropriated $6.9 billion for the CDC, about $240 million more than the administration requested. Darling highlighted another $88 million for Ebola in a continuing resolution bill approved in September. However, neither action undercuts Muder’s point, and Paul voted against both measures. It’s important to remember that those bills doled out money across many government agencies, not specifically for the CDC alone. Sometimes reasonable people can quibble over whether a cut is "big" or not. In this case, Paul himself called his cuts "serious" in a 2011 op-ed he penned for the Wall Street Journal. "My proposal, not surprisingly, has been greeted skeptically in Washington, where serious spending cuts are a rarity," Paul wrote. "But it is a modest proposal when measured against the size of our mounting debt." Our ruling Muder said that in 2011 Sen. Paul proposed cutting the CDC budget by $1.165 billion. Budget documents confirm that. In fact, Paul’s most detailed budget that year would have trimmed CDC spending by slightly more, about $1.2 billion. While the Senate approved two broad spending measures to fund the CDC in 2014, Paul voted against both. We rate the claim True.	None	Doug Muder	None	None	None	2014-10-27T15:42:23	2014-10-20	['None']
pomt-10897	"We have the most educated … workforce in the entire nation."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/aug/05/jb-pritzker/pritzker-called-illinois-workforce-nations-most-ed/	In a typical race for governor, the incumbent would be the one talking up his state’s strengths while the challenger might lament shortcomings. But nothing is typical about the battle between incumbent Republican Bruce Rauner and Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker. Defying convention, Rauner has spent a good portion of his term stressing the negative. He has said Illinois is in a "death spiral" and complained that Indiana is "kicking our tails." A few weeks ago, Rauner had to do damage control after publicly dissing the workforce in Downstate Champaign-Urbana, home of the main campus of the University of Illinois. With the incumbent routinely calling into question the state’s ability to attract business, Pritzker recently tried the opposite tack in a video tweeted out by his campaign. "We have the most educated, dedicated workforce in the entire nation and that is why businesses want to come here," Pritzker says in the clip, which features footage of the candidate visiting offices, farms and classrooms. Tops in the nation is a high bar to meet when it comes to assessing the educational achievement of Illinois workers. So we thought Pritzker’s claim worth checking out. Cum laude, yes—but certainly not summa "Dedicated" is an unknowable state of mind, so it’s impossible to assess the second beat of Pritzker’s statement. Educational achievement, however, is a widely measured concept. A report ranking states from most to least educated produced by the financial information site WalletHub, for instance, received considerable coverage this year. And U.S. News & World Report also routinely releases lists of the states with the highest education levels. Neither ranks Illinois as number one among states—or even in the top ten. We asked Pritzker’s campaign to explain Illinois’ absence from the top of those rankings, and spokesman Jason Rubin didn’t attempt to back up his boss with facts. Instead, Rubin reframed Pritzker’s statement as opinion. "Unlike Bruce Rauner, J.B. Pritzker believes Illinois has the most dedicated, educated workforce in the country," Rubin wrote in an email. The gold standard for ranking education achievement among the states is the U.S. Census, which also provides estimates for the share of each state’s workforce that holds degrees. That is a metric more closely in line with Pritzker’s claim. On that count, Illinois fares slightly better than it did in the broader assessments from WalletHub and U.S. News. According to the Census, nearly 40 percent of Illinois’ labor force had attained at least a Bachelor’s degree as of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That puts Illinois’ workforce in 10th place nationally. Tops on the list was Massachusetts. By a slightly different measure, Minnesota leads the states when it comes to the share of the labor force with at least some college credit or a community college Associate’s degree. Illinois was 13th. Illinois does, however, have an edge over its immediate neighboring states when it comes to its share of college-educated workers, census data show. That is a factor that could bear importance for white-collar businesses looking to relocate to the region. Chicago-based demographer Rob Paral said that’s not surprising given that Chicago, which is home to roughly one-fifth of Illinois’ population, boasts the highest percentage of college graduates among the nation’s seven largest cities. Our ruling Pritzker said Illinois has "the most educated workforce … in the entire nation." But census figures show the state ranks tenth for the share of its workforce that holds a Bachelor's degree or higher. When pressed, Pritzker’s campaign made no attempt to back up his claim, restating it as a matter of opinion rather than fact. Pritzker’s praise for the educational prowess of Illinois’ workforce is not entirely out of left field, but it falls well short of the numbers. We rate it False.

pomt-14580	"Owen in MA vs. Owen in RI … Advantage:Rhode Island."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2016/feb/07/gina-raimondo/advantage-ri-aimed-ge-not-owen/	As she tried to bring General Electric to Rhode Island, one of Gov. Gina Raimondo’s more interesting sales pitches involved "Owen." A character in various General Electric television ads, Owen is a young man thrilled about the prospect of working as a programmer for the old-line industrial and financial services company looking to become a Silicon-Valley-style data giant. Page 14 of Rhode Island’s PowerPoint presentation to GE portrays "Bay State Owen," who earns a $109,000 salary, and "Ocean State Owen," who makes $93,000. The governor’s Massachusetts Owen pays $2,300 per month for rent while Rhode Island Owen only pays $1,500. The headline is "Owen in MA vs. Owen in RI" and the sub-headline proclaims: "Advantage: Rhode Island." Initially, we thought Raimondo was saying Owen does better if he works in Rhode Island. We weren’t the only ones judging from the comments online. When we did the math, we concluded it was definitely not financially advantageous for Owen to work in Rhode Island. Even after paying $800 more for rent in Massachusetts, the bespectacled software developer still earns $500 more per month, according to numbers in the brochure that Raimondo says she shared with GE. Subtracting rent, Owen would make $81,400 per year in Massachusetts versus $75,000 in Rhode Island. Raimondo’s claim became a lightning rod for some commenters posting on providencejournal.com. Taking Owen’s side, one commenter on providencejournal.com: "This page actually shows MA being better than RI." That wasn’t the only one. But Raimondo wasn’t making a pitch to prospective employees. She was trying to court Owen’s employer. Raimondo’s point was that GE can pay Owen $16,000 less if the company sets up its headquarters in Rhode Island. The "Rhode Island advantage" isn’t for Owen. It’s for GE. Raimondo’s spokeswoman, Marie Aberger, confirmed this and provided source information for the numbers on salary and rent: The numbers check out. The mean yearly wage for software programmers in Massachusetts is about $109,000 per year and about $93,000 in Rhode Island, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rent data came from Zillow. Our ruling There are lots of factors, beyond salaries and rental costs, that govern which state is best for GE or best for Owen. But when looking only at Owen’s prospective salary and rental costs, it’s clear Rhode Island is more advantageous for GE, which was the target of Raimondo’s presentation. The ruling is True. The question that can’t be answered, of course, is how much Owen might value living in Boston’s Seaport district as opposed to, say, Providence’s West End.

pomt-02855	"The (health care) law does not demand that all of these cancellations go out."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/17/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-health-care-law-doesnt-require-insurance-co/	President Barack Obama’s apology and administrative pivot to stop a wave of insurance plan cancellations has hardly quieted accusations that he misled millions of Americans when he said "If you like your plan, you can keep it." Facing these criticisms, the Democratic leadership has rallied around the president. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said he actually took more blame for what happened than he might deserve. "The law does not demand that all of these cancellations go out," Pelosi said on NBC’s Meet the Press. We have looked at variations of this claim before, most recently when former Obama adviser Ezekiel Emanuel said, "The insurance companies are making that choice (to cancel or change policies), not the president." Our conclusions remain the same. While there’s an element of truth to the statement, it ignores the ways that the Affordable Care Act pushes insurance companies to change the plans they offer. The Affordable Care Act sets certain standards for the services pretty much every plan must cover. There are 10 "essential health benefits" and the list includes emergency services, maternity care and mental health care. If policyholders bought plans before Obama signed his reform into law on March 23, 2010, they’re considered "grandfathered." They can keep their plans, so long as those plans don’t change much. We don’t have good information on how many cancellation notices are for plans that could continue if the insurance company wanted. But we do know two things. First, it doesn’t take much for a plan to lose its grandfathered status. A hike in a co-pay of $5 plus the rate of medical inflation could tip a plan over the edge. Second, once a plan is poised to lose its grandfathered status, it’s on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policyholders 90 days notice as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering. That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders have been getting in the mail these days. Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, told PolitiFact that insurance companies have options. "Except for these ‘grandfathered plans’ health insurers in the individual market have to adopt new consumer protections," Hammill said. "In some instances, insurers are doing this by cancelling current plans rather than simply upgrading them. Nothing in the law requires the cancellation of plans as the leader said today." Some health policy experts told us that yes, in a technical sense, insurers are pulling the plug on these old, grandfathered policies. Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor, said that "if a grandfathered plan is being terminated, it is the insurer’s decision -- nothing in the law requires it." But other experts said that while this is technically true, it gives a distorted view of what’s going on. The law places grandfathered plans in such a straitjacket -- unable to attract new individual policyholders and unable to adjust terms to market conditions -- that it’s only a matter of time before companies are driven to pull the plug. To ignore the government’s role in establishing the parameters for this highly regulated and highly competitive industry, they say, is substantially misleading. "Insurance companies cannot continue to sell individual policies that don’t meet the requirements of the essential benefit package, either to individuals or to small businesses, as of Jan. 1," said Gail Wilensky, the head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "But since the insurance companies are not allowed to continue to sell these plans that the person previously had bought and may have liked, they are effectively being forced to change their plan." By all accounts, even the employers who are offering grandfathered plans to their employees are dwindling over time. The annual study of health insurance by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust found that the percentage of workers enrolled in grandfathered plans has decreased from 56 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2013. Another study, by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, found that of the one-quarter of organizations that still have a grandfathered plan, less than half expect to keep their grandfathered status beyond the next two years. In other words, the grandfathered plan is slowly but steadily becoming a dinosaur. Our ruling Pelosi said the Affordable Care Act doesn’t require insurance companies to send out the cancellation notices that people have been getting. While there’s some element of truth to this statement, one of the major thrusts of the law is it sets minimum standards. The law intentionally makes it difficult for companies to avoid these minimums and the industry has responded by moving away from sub-par plans. Pelosi’s statement ignores the factors in the law that push companies in a certain direction. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2013-11-17T13:58:32	2013-11-17	['None']
pomt-01916	On a balanced budget amendment.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/30/mark-warner/warner-has-changed-position-balanced-budget-amendm/	U.S. Republican senate candidate Ed Gillespie is accusing Democratic incumbent Mark Warner of switching positions on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. A web video released by Gillespie’s campaign shows a montage of two contrasting statements Warner has made over the years as evidence the Democrat has "promised Virginians one thing on the campaign trail and changed his position in Washington." The video starts with footage from Warner’s unsuccessful a 1996 campaign to unseat incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. John Warner. During a debate that summer, Mark Warner was asked to name issues on which he disagreed with his party and then-President Bill Clinton. "I also believe we need a constitutional amendment balancing the budget," Warner said. "For too long Congress, even though politician after politician makes promises that we’ll balance the budget soon, year after year the deficit goes up. I think we need constitutional amendment to balance that budget, and we need it now." The video contrasts that statement, which Warner echoed throughout that campaign, to comments he made during a April 2011 interview with CNN. The Democrat had been elected to the Senate in 2008 and, a month prior to the interview, voted against a Republican bill for a balanced budget amendment. "Listen, I was a governor. We had to balance our budgets," Warner told CNN. "I don’t think a federal balanced budget amendment gets us where we need to be." Supporters of the balanced budget amendment have long maintained that the provision would mandate spending discipline by Congress. Opponents say a balanced budget can’t be achieved without painful tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts, including to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman, acknowledged that the senator’s position on the amendment has changed, but said it’s old news. The turning point, he said, came shortly after Warner became governor in 2002 and took charge of a state government that had its own balanced budget requirement. Despite that constitutional amendment, the state was emerging from recession and faced massive budget shortfalls because of low revenues and a car tax cut ushered in by the previous administration. Warner and the General Assembly balanced the budgets through spending cuts and tax increases and, when the economy improved later in his term, the state budget ended up in surplus. Warner told CNN in 2011 that he is convinced that when it comes to managing federal finances, long-term bipartisan planning is a superior way to lowering debt than a balanced budget amendment. Warner, during his first term, has led a group of senators seeking a bipartisan agreement to lowering deficits through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. We couldn’t find any record of Warner weighing in on a balanced budget amendment between 1996 and 2011. The issue did not come up in two debates viewed from his 2008 Senate campaign or in any of news stories we accessed from that election. There’s no evidence Warner promised voters he’d support the amendment during the 2008 campaign that put him in the Senate and recanted after he took office. Our ruling The purpose of our Flip-O-Meter is to gauge how much a politician’s position on an issue has changed. We don’t take a position on whether the change is good or bad. There’s no doubt Warner has reversed course on a balanced budget amendment over the years. So we rate it a Full Flop.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2014-06-30T00:00:00	2011-04-03	['None']
pomt-08792	A New York imam wants to "have a mosque at Ground Zero.''	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/19/rick-lazio/ground-zero-mosque-ground-zero/	In all of the debate over the so-called Ground Zero Mosque, we thought it made sense to start with the most basic fact-check -- whether it was accurate to even call it the Ground Zero Mosque or a mosque at or on Ground Zero? For the sake of discussion, we picked a statement from gubernatorial candidate Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who said in a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity on Aug. 17, 2010: "If you take ... this imam at face value who says that this is about healing divisions, why would you want to have a mosque at Ground Zero when you know it's opening the wounds of the families of the victims of 9/11 that are still feeling this pain as if it was yesterday?" The phrase "Ground Zero Mosque" has become a bit of media shorthand for the heated political issue, and has been used by a number of political figures discussing the propriety of the mosque's proposed location. For example, in a campaign ad, Rick Scott, a Republican candidate for Florida governor stated, "Mr. President, Ground Zero is the wrong place for a mosque." The proposed mosque is not at or on Ground Zero. It does not directly abut it or overlook it. But it is near Ground Zero. How near? Just over two blocks. The Washington Post has an interactive map of the location in relation to the World Trade Center site, including actual panoramic views. The addresses of the buildings in question are 45-51 and 49-51 Park Place, between West Broadway and Church Street. That's two blocks north of the northern edge of the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan. Two long blocks, in fact. The Washington Post noted that the location is "roughly half a dozen normal lower Manhattan blocks from the site of the North Tower, the nearer of the two destroyed in the attacks." According to Sharif El-Gamal, owner of the building and developer of the Park51 project, the site is as close to City Hall as it is to Ground Zero. "You can’t see Ground Zero from our current building and on completion of our planned building some years from now, there won’t be any views of the Ground Zero memorial from the building," Gamal said in a July 24, 2010, interview with altmuslim.com, an Islamic news site. So it's not at Ground Zero, but the proposed location for the mosque is close enough to have symbolic value -- as was acknowledged by those trying to build it. The Washington Post noted that the top of the 5-story building --formerly a Burlington Coat Factory -- was damaged by landing gear from one of the planes used in the attacks. In an Aug. 8, 2010, story in Newsweek, Daisy Khan, wife of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, who would lead the mosque, said the location had symbolic import. "We want to provide a counter momentum against extremism. We want peace, and we want it where it matters most. This is where it matters most." The plan for the center includes a September 11th memorial, Gamal said in his interview with altmuslim.com, "and quiet reflection space where people of different faith traditions and beliefs, sacred and secular, can find quiet time and solace." While we're considering the term "Ground Zero Mosque," we also wondered whether it was proper to call the project a mosque. A mosque is, in fact, planned there, but it's part of a plan for a much larger, $100 million cultural center. According to the project web site , plans include a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios and childcare services. Organizers say the center would be open to all New Yorkers, regardless of faith, and would promote cultural diversity. The center would be overseen by a 23-member Board of Directors and they say membership will not be limited to Muslims. But the center would be geared toward "engaging New York’s many and diverse Muslim communities and promoting empowerment and compassion for all." A mosque is also planned, though according to the site it would be run separately from the rest of the facilities. According to Gamal, the mosque would not tolerate "any kind of illegal or unAmerican activity and rhetoric." Imam Rauf has been leading prayer services in one of the buildings since 2009. Again, we realize many politicians and media figures are using the phrase the "Ground Zero Mosque" -- or as Lazio did, "a mosque at Ground Zero" -- as shorthand to describe the controversial project. It's nearby -- close enough to carry symbolic value to those who oppose it, and even to those proposing the project. But we think those characterizations often give the misimpression that the project is either on the old World Trade Center site or immediately next to it. And that's not right. And so we rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10125	"I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke [in March 2007], and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/13/barack-obama/2007-was-too-late-to-head-off-the-crisis/	The country's economic woes were a somber topic at the presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008, with both candidates explaining their thoughts on the root of the crisis. "I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it." It's undisputed that Obama wrote the two officials a letter on March 22, 2007. "There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures," Obama wrote. "Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge." ( Read the full text here .) But Obama brought up this letter in the context of explaining the current economic crisis. There's nothing to suggest in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008. His letter is concerned with people losing their homes, not a systemic threat to the economic system. (See our story and other statements on potential causes of the economic crisis here.) We also checked news clips to look at Bernanke and Paulson's public statements around the time after Obama sent his letter. • On March 28, 2007, Bernanke testified before Congress, saying, "Although the turmoil in the subprime mortgage market has created financial problems for many individuals and families, the implications of these developments for the housing market as a whole are less clear." • On May 15, 2007, Bernanke gave a speech in which he discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. " We should always keep in view the enormous economic benefits that flow from a healthy and innovative financial sector," Bernanke said. • On May 17, 2007, Bernanke said the Federal Reserve was considering taking steps to rein in subprime lending, but would be cautious not to overregulate. "We do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system," Bernanke said. • On June 20, 2007, Paulson said, "We have had a major housing correction in this country. ... I do believe we are at or near the bottom." So it sounds like Obama's letter didn't make much of a splash. Certainly Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells. We asked two economists, one with a right-leaning group and one with a left-leaning group, if a warning issued in 2007 could have made a difference to the problems of October 2008. Both of them said it was too late by then, because the questionable loans and securities had been issued by that point. "The horse was already out of the barn," said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "Everyone with a brain who was paying attention knew that there were big problems associated with outstanding subprime risk," said Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But, he added, "There was little that the Fed could have done after March 2007 to prevent the crisis from happening." So Obama is right that he wrote the letter. Saying Bernanke and Paulson didn't do anything about it sounds harsh, but it is a rough approximation of what happened. But Obama's letter was largely confined to the problems of low-income homeowners who were losing their homes. It was not an early warning on the economic collapse of '08. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-13T00:00:00	2008-10-07	['Ben_Bernanke', 'Henry_Paulson']

pomt-05015	Says Mitt Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/16/barack-obama/mitt-romney-had-millions-swiss-bank-account-barack/	President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign is using hard-edged irony to attack Mitt Romney in a new ad that pairs Romney singing "America the Beautiful" with a series of claims about Bain Capital and his use of offshore accounts in his personal finances. In this item, we’ll look at the claim that Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account." Romney has released tax returns for 2010 and an estimated tax return for 2011, in addition to a number of financial disclosure forms. Each of these forms is lengthy and, unless you're an accountant, difficult to decipher. However, the question of whether the Obama campaign is correct to say that Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account" is not in doubt, since the trustee for the Romney family’s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- acknowledged it in an on-the-record call with journalists on Jan. 24, 2012. Malt said on the call, "Yeah, it occurs to me that one other question that came up. … Why is there a Swiss bank account listed on the Romney's tax return? It is listed because I set that account up for diversification in 2003, when I became trustee of the blind trusts. It is a bank account. Nothing more, nothing less. An ordinary bank account. It earns some income, which is fully reported on the Form 1040 in the (2010) tax return. You'll see approximately $1,700 of interest earned by this account, which is reported. The tax is fully paid just as if this were a U.S. bank account, nothing more complicated than that." Malt added, "By the way, I did close this account in early 2010. It no longer exists." Reporters on the call offered two follow-up questions about the Swiss bank account. One asked, "Why was that Swiss bank account closed in 2010?" Malt responded, "I previously said that I regularly review Gov. Romney's investments and just in connection with one of my periodic reviews, I decided that this account wasn't serving any particular purpose. It might or might not be consistent with Gov. Romney's political views. You know, again, taxes were all fully paid, etc., but it just wasn't worth it, and I closed the account." The second question asked the Romney camp to "elaborate on which institution held the Swiss account, how much the account held and whether the account also worked with any trusts or foundations." Malt responded that "the Swiss bank account was in the Ann Romney blind trust. It held approximately $3 million. It was just an investment of the trust -- the bank account of the trust -- which, as I mentioned, I have subsequently closed. The bank was, sorry, Union Bank Switzerland -- UBS." Malt’s comments confirm that Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account" because the couple filed their returns jointly, and the campaign has disclosed tax returns for Ann Romney’s trusts and family trusts, not just Romney’s funds. Meanwhile, the Romney campaign also retroactively disclosed that the couple had a Swiss account in his 2006 presidential financial disclosure form, apparently the same one that was closed in 2010. In the 2006 disclosure form, the UBS money market account was listed as being worth between $1 million and $5 million. We should note that there’s no indication that Romney did anything improper by having some of his assets in a Swiss bank account -- assets, we’ll reiterate, that were placed in the account by Malt, not by Romney. The purpose of a blind trust is to have a money manager make investment decisions so that a public official is protected from the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Romney campaign said the account was legal and disclosed to the IRS and the U.S. Treasury. Income from the account was included in the Romney’s tax returns and all U.S. taxes due were paid during the period, the campaign said. Our ruling The trustee who managed Romney’s holdings has publicly confirmed that Mitt and Ann Romney had "approximately $3 million" in assets in a Swiss bank account between 2003 and 2010, and the Romney campaign did not object to that characterization when we contacted them for this story. Swiss bank accounts may make good fodder for campaign commercials and Jason Bourne movies, but there's nothing to indicate Romney did anything illegal or improper with the account. While it is now closed, the claim in Obama’s ad was stated in the past tense -- that Romney "had millions in a Swiss bank account." That’s correct, so we rate Obama’s claim True.

pomt-06879	"This is the first time in the history that we've had the raising of a debt limit also with spending cuts."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/29/allen-west/allen-west-says-spending-cuts-are-part-debt-ceilin/	U.S. Rep. Allen West supports Speaker John Boehner's plan for cutting spending and raising the debt ceiling, even though some of his fellow tea party supporters have been skeptical. On July 27, 2011, he appeared on CNN to defend the plan. "We can sit around and try to come up with the 100 percent plan, and this plan definitely is not it," said West, R-Plantation. I'll give it about a 70 to 75 percent rating. But it is a plan that I can take and I can execute to 100 percent. I think the most important thing when I look at this, it still does fit within the framework that I'll support of cut, cap and balance," he said. "So I'm very pleased that I can stand to support this because we don't have the tax hikes that I don't want to see happen, and we don't have the complete blank check that's going to be given to the president of $2.4 trillion. This is the first time in the history that we've had the raising of a debt limit also with spending cuts," he added. We should point out that raising the debt limit does not give the president "a blank check." Congress still retains its usual power to approve or deny spending. We looked at a similar statement from Eric Cantor, the Republican House majority leader, and rated it False. Here, we were interested in West's point that this was the first time a debt ceiling vote had ever been paired with spending cuts. Was this year's debt proposal that historic? In a word, no. We spent a long time mulling the details of federal legislation over the past 30 or so years. We found a few different examples that contradict West's statement. The most recent example of legislation to raise the debt ceiling that also included spending cuts was the 1997 agreement between President Bill Clinton and House Republicans led by Speaker Newt Gingrich. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included net reductions in direct spending of $122 billion over five years and increased the debt limit to $5.95 trillion, from $5.5 trillion, according to a 2005 analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The deal included spending cuts, tax cuts and new spending on social programs supported by Clinton. At the time, the agreement was expected to lead to a balanced budget by 2002. In fact, the budget went into surplus in 1998. (Keep in mind that there was still substantial public debt at this point, but at least the government wasn't spending more than it took in during a given year.) News coverage from the 1997 deal depicted it as a great victory for the Republicans, though one with bipartisan support. Here's how USA Today's story began on July 31, 1997: The Republican-led House of Representatives, savoring the afterglow of a successful engagement with a Democratic president, voted overwhelmingly Thursday for a spending plan that should balance the federal budget by 2002. The measure sailed through the House by a lopsided 346-85 vote on a wave of bipartisan self-congratulation, standing ovations and paeans to the promise of protecting generations to come. Speaker Newt Gingrich, who in past years has conceded being outmaneuvered by President Clinton on the budget, triumphantly announced the vote. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, strode onto the House floor clapping his hands in anticipation of leading the Senate debate to a similar conclusion today. After the debt ceiling was raised in 1997, it wasn't raised again until the George W. Bush administration in 2002. The debt ceiling was raised seven times during the Bush administration, and it's been raised three times already during the Obama administration. We found two other examples of budget agreements that included automatic mechanisms to cut spending. The 1990 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act set caps to cut discretionary spending along with new pay-you-go rules, and that too included a debt ceiling increase. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 set strict deficit targets and automatic spending cuts if the yearly deficit targets were breached. Lawmakers knew that the automatic spending cuts were virtually certain to take effect, and they did. "The debt ceiling has been used numerous times in the past to enact both budget enforcement procedures and actual spending cuts, often to make debt ceiling increases more politically palatable," said Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. As we finished our research, we wondered if West meant whether it was the first time the spending cuts had equaled the increase in the debt ceiling. The 1997 agreement would not meet that criteria. Even if that's what he meant, that's not how West phrased his statement on CNN. West said, "This is the first time in the history that we've had the raising of a debt limit also with spending cuts." We found that the 1997 budget agreement raised the debt ceiling and also included spending cuts. So we rate his statement False.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2011-07-29T14:55:56	2011-07-27	['None']

pomt-04237	A precinct in the Allen West-Patrick Murphy recount has "7 registered voters in Guatemalan community and the tally showed 900 voted!!!!!"	false	/florida/statements/2012/nov/20/facebook-posts/viral-post-claims-precinct-allen-west-race-had-900/	Election night found U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens, in unfamiliar territory: He hadn’t won, but he wasn’t convinced that he had lost either. West clearly lost his first bid for Congress against U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, in 2008. And two years later, he clearly thumped Klein. But on the night of Nov. 6, 2012, state results showed Democrat Patrick Murphy narrowly ahead but outside of recount territory in one of the most expensive and high-profile U.S. House contests in the country. (West beat Klein in Congressional District 22 but then moved due to redistricting. You can read our full West fact-check file here.) By the morning, West demanded a closer look at results in Congressional District 18, which spans parts of Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Martin counties. Most of the controversy centered on St. Lucie, which had trouble counting ballots. That led to a whirlwind two weeks of court hearings, partial recounts, a visit by state election officials to monitor the mayhem, scrutiny of St. Lucie County election supervisor Gertrude Walker and around-the-clock news coverage. Every morsel was put under the microscope, including Murphy’s false claim that West had never shaken his hand, prompting the West campaign to point to a photo of the two candidates shaking hands at a debate. A Nov. 18 article in the Palm Beach Post paraphrased West campaign manager Tim Edson raising questions about St. Lucie’s ballot counting. "Among them: Preliminary totals showed 900 voters cast ballots in Precinct 93, where only seven voters are registered, Edson said." The claim that about 900 voters casting ballots in a precinct with only 7 voters went viral and was repeated on a CBS news website and on a West fan page on Facebook. "#AllenWestRecount - A Pct had - 7 registered voters in Guatemalan community and the tally showed 900 voted!!!!! - THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL YET - The commissioner has NOT announced ANYONE the winner or the numbers yet. They are STILL behind closed doors." On Nov. 20, West conceded, though he continued to raise questions about St. Lucie County results. On the same day, a PolitiFact reader asked us about a claim he found on Facebook about Precinct 93. He asked us "Is this true and newsworthy? Or is it just conservatives whining that they lost?" So we went in search of what went down in Precinct 93 -- otherwise known as Golden Ponds Recreation Center in St. Lucie County. St. Lucie County and the ‘bungled’ count First, some more background on the West-Murphy postelection battle in St. Lucie County, which started election night when the county had trouble reading ballots on tabulation machines. You can read blow-by-blow accounts from the Palm Beach Post or the Associated Press. As the door on West’s chances appeared to be closing, the Palm Beach Post wrote Nov. 18: "The St. Lucie County Canvassing Board missed a noon Nov. 18th deadline to file results to the state Division of Elections so that left previously submitted certified unofficial results standing: Murphy was ahead of West by about .58 percent." The root of the confusion about Precinct 93 Part of the West campaign claim isn’t in dispute. The St. Lucie County Supervisor of Elections website shows seven active voters in Precinct 93 -- three Democrats, three Republicans and one "other," as of September 2012. Unofficial results dated Nov. 11 on the supervisor’s website showed that in Precinct 93, three ballots were cast for West and three for Murphy. We spoke to Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, a volunteer attorney for the West campaign, on Nov. 20. He said that volunteers watching the recount during the Nov. 18th weekend saw a ballot-counting machine with a yellow Precinct 93 sign on it and the tabulation tape showed 1,552 ballots. That equaled about 776 votes because there are two different ballot cards per voter. Voters were watching the recount behind cones and tape as sheriff’s deputies were nearby. The machine with the Precinct 93 sign was on the corner of the boundary, so it was one of the few machines where observers could see the tabulation tape, Shapiro said. . "There were a lot of volunteers who saw it and reported it to us," Shapiro said. The West campaign asked St. Lucie County canvassing board member Tod Mowery -- a county commissioner -- about the machine. "They told us Sunday that they used the Precinct 93 machine to run half of the ballots from Precinct 85 because it was such a large precinct," Shapiro said. "It still had the Precinct 93 sign on it. ... Because they didn’t change the sign it confused a lot of people." Mowery "took us over to the machine to show the tabulation tape. It did say Precinct 85 on it. It was Sunday at about 3 o’clock. I was standing right there and I was talking to him." Edson gave us this account in an email: "There was a machine that was mislabeled at the recount. When we looked at the tape for what we were told was Precinct 93, there were over 900 votes cast. It turned out that another precinct that had been counted on the same machine as 93. The matter was cleared up." We also interviewed Mowery, a registered Republican. Precinct 93 only had one early vote cast in this race, Mowery said. That’s why during the retabulation on Sunday, elections officials used the Precinct 93 machine to count a chunk of the ballots from Precinct 85, a much larger precinct. Mowery said that after a news conference on Nov. 18, the West campaign asked him about Precinct 93. Mowery said he printed out the long form from the machine, which showed that the machine was counting results from Precinct 85. "I took them over to the machine," Mowery said. "I showed them the actual receipt for the Precinct 85 tabulation data. They all agreed that was in fact the case." Mowery said he asked the West campaign if they had additional questions about the Precinct 93 machine and they didn’t. Before we give our ruling on this claim, we will wax nostalgic about our Allen West fact-checks. He claimed that about 80 of House Democrats are Communists and that he had higher security clearance than the president which we rated Pants on Fire. He also got a True rating for a claim about the number of people on Social Security Disability and a Mostly True for a claim about the cost of a missile. For those who follow West on PolitiFact, there could be more to come. The Georgia GOP is ready to welcome their native son with open arms, which could mean our sister site PolitiFact Georgia could land some West fact-checks. Our ruling A Palm Beach Post article paraphrased West campaign manager Tim Edson saying that, "Preliminary totals showed 900 voters cast ballots in Precinct 93, where only seven voters are registered." The same claim was picked up by people on Facebook. It's not true. A machine that had the label of Precinct 93 was actually counting votes from another precinct. In the end, only six people voted in Precinct 93, which has seven total voters. We rate this claim False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2012-11-20T17:44:32	2012-11-20	['None']

pomt-02018	U.S. Reps. Eric Cantor and Luis Gutierrez were "touring the country last year … joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/06/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-says-reps-eric-cantor-and-luis-guti/	Dave Brat recently brought some right-wing firepower to his campaign to unseat U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor in the 7th District Republican primary on Tuesday. Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio talk show host, headlined a June 3 rally for Brat at Henrico County’s Dominion Club and quickly brought up immigration. She noted that Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., held a May 28 rally in Richmond and urged Cantor to allow the House to vote on immigration reforms. Cantor, the House majority leader, has blocked votes on a comprehensive immigration bill and an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would allow children of illegal immigrants to join the military and receive legal status once they’ve served. Cantor has signaled, however, that he might support a narrowly drawn bill establishing a path to citizenship for children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. That’s spurred Brat to label Cantor weak on immigration and claim the majority leader is quietly working on a deal with Gutierrez to pass reforms. Brat said Gutierrez’s appearance in Virginia was designed to bolster Cantor’s credentials as tough on immigration prior to the GOP primary. Ingraham picked up that note, saying the immigration rally was "beautifully choreographed." She likened Cantor and Gutierrez to a touring "Simon and Garfunkel in the 70s." Ingraham said of the two politicians, "They’re touring the country last year talking ‘How to Make Life Work’ -- some ridiculous, meaningless titled tour -- joined at the hip, working together, in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform." The Cantor-Gutierrez national immigration tour was news to us. So we looked into Ingraham’s claim. Julia Hahn, Ingraham’s executive producer, said the radio personality was referring to a widely publicized "Becoming America Pilgrimage" held July 25-27, 2013. The event, organized by the non-profit Institute for Faith & Politics, took lawmakers to Ellis Island, the Museum of Jewish Heritage and other sites around New York City. A delegation of about 100 people, including House members, academics and faith leaders, traveled from Washington for the event. An article in Politico previewing the New York event said it wasn’t "meant to hash out the nitty-gritty of legislation or debate the politics of specific immigration policies. But lawmakers hope it will be small step forward in Congress’s effort to enact immigration reform." Gutierrez and Cantor attended parts of the three-day event. Cantor spoke at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights in Queens about the "special struggles that Jewish people had arriving in a country that often did not understand or welcome people of his faith and culture," according to a synopsis of his speech by the Faith & Politics Institute. Hahn pointed to a video of part of Cantor’s address on the conservative Breitbart.com website. It shows Cantor acknowledging Gutierrez in the audience and saying, "Luis, thank you for the leadership you’re providing through thick and thin right now as we try and navigate these very tough political times and choppy waters. My hat is off to you." Ray Allen Jr., a Cantor political adviser, said the majority leader’s recognition of Gutierrez was a simple courtesy. Allen was dismissive of Ingraham’s remarks. "No, Congressman Cantor did not tour the country with Congressman Gutierrez," Allen emailed. "No, they had no meetings on immigration and no, they never talked prior to Mr. Gutierrez coming to Richmond to attack Eric Cantor for stopping the Senate’s comprehensive immigration plan. And yes, despite what the Left says, we believe it is an amnesty plan." Douglas Rivlin, a spokesman for Gutierrez, said while the Illinois congressman sat in on Cantor’s speech in New York, Gutierrez only attended about 12 hours of the three-day immigration pilgrimage. Rivlin also said his office checked the congressman’s schedule and found Gutierrez "has never once had a meeting with Majority Leader Eric Cantor on any issue, including immigration." Rivlin also said that beyond the "Becoming America Pilgrimage," he’s not aware of any other immigration-related events that Gutierrez and Cantor both attended. We asked Ingraham’s executive producer if, beyond the New York event, she could name other immigration functions Cantor and Gutierrez attended. She came up empty. Our ruling Ingraham said Cantor and Gutierrez were "touring the country last year … joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform." Cantor and Gutierrez were among 100 leaders who attended a pilgrimage to the New York City area last July that focused on immigration issues. Aides say that’s the only immigration event Cantor and Gutierrez both happened to attend and that the two lawmakers have never met to discuss immigration. One event in New York does not make a national tour. Ingraham can’t point to another immigration gig Cantor and Gutierrez both attended. Her likening the two politicians to Simon and Garfunkel "joined at the hip" on a tour to promote immigration reform is not only false, it’s ridiculous. We rate Ingraham’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-06507	"These 15 political appointees (on the IPAB) will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/12/michele-bachmann/ipab-board-15-bureaucrats-who-will-decide-nation-s/	At a debate in New Hampshire, Michele Bachmann was asked how to make sure that Medicare doesn’t waste money. "No one wants the government to come between a doctor and a patient. But do you think that Americans are getting the most for their money in Medicare spending?" asked Washington Post reporter Karen Tumulty, one of the debate’s moderators. "And how can we make sure that the money that is being spent is being spent on the treatments and the preventive treatments that do the most?" Rather than answering the question directly, Bachmann pivoted to attacking President Barack Obama’s health care law. "I think that senior citizens across the country have no idea that President Obama plans for Medicare to collapse, and instead everyone will be pushed into Obamacare," Bachmann said. "And just like Newt Gingrich said, the way that Obamacare runs, there's a board called IPAB. It's made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans. I don't want 15 political appointees to make a health care decision for a beautiful, fragile 85- year-old woman who should be making her own decision." We’re not sure what she means by when she says people will be pushed out of Medicare and into Obamacare. If what she means by "Obamacare" is the health care law, then the law assumes that Medicare will continue. In fact, the law made a number of changes to Medicare intended to make it operate more efficiently and provide better care. One of those changes was the creation of a board called the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. Here, we’ll fact-check Bachmann’s claim that IPAB is "made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." We’ve looked at the board in some detail in a previous fact-check by PolitiFact Georgia. Lawmakers created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare, the federal program that provides health care for seniors. Under the health care reform bill, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time, it will be automatically implemented. IPAB has many critics. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule the board’s recommendations or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, some members of Congress have attempted to repeal it. Getting back to Bachmann’s statement, she’s right that there are 15 members of the IPAB and that they are political appointees. But that leaves out a lot of detail of the law’s requirements. The law states that the members "shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and economics, actuarial science, health facility management, health plans and integrated delivery systems, reimbursement of health facilities, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and other providers of health services, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation and a balance between urban and rural representatives." It also says the board "shall also include representatives of consumers and the elderly." And, it says individuals who are directly involved in providing or managing health care "shall not" constitute a majority of the board’s members. The president appoints 12 of the 15 members, who undergo confirmation by the Senate. Once appointed to the board, the members become full-time government employees and are not allowed to hold other full-time employment. The IPAB is forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care," as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing. Bachmann said the IPAB "will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." It is possible that private health insurance companies might look at the IPAB’s recommendations for cost-savings and efficiency and try those ideas for their own customers. But legally, the IPAB only has the power to suggest changes to Medicare, which includes 47 million beneficiaries. Bachmann’s comments also give the impression that the IPAB makes decisions on individual cases. It does not. We looked at the claim that the board decides "whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy," and rated it False. Our ruling Bachmann said, "There's a board called IPAB. It's made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." There is a board with 15 members, and most are appointed through a political process, though they must have expertise in health care. But the board is intended to recommend cost savings for the Medicare program. It would not "make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." We rate her statement False.

pomt-13573	Under Hillary Clinton’s plan "illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/aug/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wants-let-crimin/	Donald Trump’s first TV ad of the general election depicts Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan as dangerous for America. "In Hillary Clinton’s America, the system stays rigged against Americans. Syrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay," states the ad. "Collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open. It’s more of the same, but worse. Donald Trump’s America is secure. Terrorists and dangerous criminals: kept out. The border: secured. Our families: safe. Change that makes America safe again." The narration is accompanied by sinister music and footage of men being apprehended by border agents while other shadowy men walk freely on public streets. We have previously fact-checked Trump’s claim that Clinton wants "totally open borders" and ruled that False. He is correct that she wants to allow more Syrian refugees in the United States. This fact-check will focus on whether Clinton supports allowing illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the country. There is some truth to his claim, but Trump’s scary ad omits an important part of the story. Clinton’s immigration plan: Deport violent criminals Clinton has not vowed to deport every undocumented immigrant convicted of a crime. But the ad creates a misleading impression that she will let every criminal stay, regardless of the crime. Clinton has repeatedly called for focusing deportations on violent criminals. Clinton campaign spokesman Joshua Schwerin pointed to Clinton’s comments about her deportation priorities in a March debate in Miami, the National Immigrant Integration Conference and on her website. When pressed to explain her position during the debate, Clinton said she wants to limit deportations to "violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety." Clinton has proposed being more lenient than Obama: "So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority." She said violent criminals and those who plan terrorist attacks or threaten us are "a relatively small universe." We asked for more details about the types of crimes that would be included on her deportation list and did not get a reply from the campaign. But it’s fair to read into her statements that some criminals who committed lower-level crimes would be allowed to stay. That approach is similar to the current policy under the Obama administration. In 2014, a memo from the Homeland Security Department stated that the government would focus first on threats to national security, border security and public safety, including those involved or suspected of terrorism or felons. The second level of priority was for undocumented immigrants convicted of three or more misdemeanors (not including minor traffic offenses). That policy means that an estimated 87 percent of the undocumented population is not a priority for enforcement, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that examines immigration trends. "We do not know enough details about Mrs. Clinton’s plans to characterize who would get to stay or would be a priority for removal," said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the institute. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s clear that Clinton favors legalization for many undocumented immigrants but not for violent offenders. "Looking at Hillary’s statements, it’s clear that Trump’s ad is misleading," he said. "Many, but not all, unlawful immigrants committed criminal offenses, but they are usually not violent or property crimes. Instead those were crimes in the immigration statutes." The Trump campaign provided PolitiFact with information related to additional positions Clinton has taken that relate to undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes: 2013 immigration bill: Clinton supported the immigration bill that passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House. The bill said that undocumented immigrants could apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, which allowed them to stay in the country if they met certain criteria including that they had not been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors. This fits in with Clinton’s plan to focus on violent criminals. Sanctuary cities: These policies generally refer to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. During her first race for president, Clinton said she would not crack down on sanctuary cities and argued that without such policies, people will hide from police and not report crimes. But Clinton doesn’t appear to want sanctuary cities to protect suspected murderers. In 2015, Clinton criticized the city of San Francisco for releasing a man from jail who later was charged with murdering a woman and had previously been deported many times. However, her campaign reiterated Clinton’s view that she believes sanctuary cities can help further public safety. Trump’s campaign also noted that thousands of undocumented immigrants who have been ordered removed and have criminal convictions remain in the country under Obama. We don’t know how the pace of criminal removals would differ under Clinton if she were elected. But the fact that Clinton has criticized the Obama administration for deportation has raised concerns among those who want to see stricter enforcement. "She has promised to expand upon Obama’s immigration policies," said David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which promotes more restrictive immigration laws. Our ruling Trump says "In Hillary Clinton’s America ... illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay." The tone of the ad is to scare voters into thinking that Clinton would welcome convicted criminals to remain in the country illegally, and that’s an exaggeration. Clinton has said that she will deport "violent criminals" as well as anyone who threatens our safety. She hasn’t been more specific about the types of crimes that would or would not lead to deportation.

"Mueller will be forced to resign over Pelosi affair," stated a Jan. 18 headline by The Patriot Report. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story has no evidence and is fake news. The story attributes the information to Ladies of Liberty, a website that describes itself as satire. Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department as special counsel to investigate connections between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. In May, Pelosi supported Mueller’s appointment as a "first step" but in October called for an "outside, fully independent investigation." The Patriot Report said that Pelosi and Mueller had a 13-year affair that will force Mueller to resign, but Pelosi will hold her California congressional seat until she dies. The story said that Pelosi said her husband was aware of the affair and that her "husband was afforded the same freedom to explore 'pleasures of the flesh.' " Pelosi has never made any such comment. Fictional affairs are common fodder on fake news websites. We previously debunked fake articles claiming that U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, had an affair with former FBI Director James Comey, and that U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had an affair with a cheerleader. We rated both of those claims Pants on Fire. We sent a message to The Patriot Report on Facebook and did not get a reply. A headline said that "Mueller will be forced to resign over Pelosi affair." There is no evidence that such an affair occurred. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-00675	"We had the biggest drop of the rate of unemployment (in) all but 4 states."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/may/10/lincoln-chafee/lincoln-chafee-says-ri-governor-only-four-states-h/	Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee went on CNN April 12 after announcing that he was thinking about running for president. CNN’s Dana Bash was ready for him. After some discussion about issues such as the second war in Iraq and the shrinking middle class, Bash noted that Chafee had left office after only one term with an approval rating of just 25 percent. Then she asked: "If you have that kind of low standing in your own state, how are you going to get support around the country?" Chafee talked about the "tough times" that Rhode Island faced when he took office. And he said "every little thing was difficult" as he attempted to turn Rhode Island around by, in part, doing unpopular things like raising taxes and hiking beach fees. "But, at the end, and that’s why I’m running, Rhode Island is better off," he said. "We had the biggest drop of unemployment, the rate of unemployment, of all but four states. That’s a great record of accomplishment." We wondered if Rhode Island had experienced the "biggest drop of unemployment ... of all but four states" during Chafee's tenure. But first we had to pin down the time period he was referring to. Chafee’s spokeswoman, Debbie Rich, told us that the time period was from January 2011, when Chafee took office, through February 2015, covering the most recent unemployment report at the time of the CNN interview. And she pointed us to the unemployment rates for those months. Rhode Island’s unemployment rate for January 2011 was 11.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate for February 2015, a preliminary number subject to change, was 6.3 percent when Chafee spoke. So the difference between the higher rate and the lower one – the way Rich indicated that Chafee chose to figure the change – is 4.9 percentage points. (He could have, and maybe should have, measured the improvement as a percentage, but we’ll get to that later.) So how did that drop of 4.9 percentage points compare with other states? Only three other states, not four, had a bigger percentage point drop during the same time period, according to the numbers on file at the bureau as of April 20. Two other states also had declines of 4.9 percentage points. So with that timeframe, Chafee would have been correct to say: "We had the biggest drop of unemployment, the rate of unemployment, of all but three states." Ok, so Chafee was off a bit. But there's more than one way to gauge the drop in unemployment. Instead of looking at the percentage point drop, you can calculate and compare the change as a percentage. We asked URI economist Leonard Lardaro, a leading expert on the condition of the Rhode Island economy, which method was better. Lardaro says it is more legitimate to calculate and compare Rhode Island’s improvement as a percentage. That’s because Rhode Island had one of the highest unemployment rates to begin with, and therefore, improvements in percentage points are easier to come by. As a percentage, Rhode Island’s drop from 11.2 percent to 6.3 percent is an improvement of 44 percent. That's pretty good. But 12 other states did better. By that measure, Chafee was way off. During his appearance on CNN, Chafee didn't specify how he was calculating his statistic, leaving his statement open for interpretation. Calculated in percentage points, Rhode Island’s ranking was better than he said. Calculated as a percentage, it was worse. Because his statement contains some element of truth, if looked at one way, but falls apart if viewed in a different way, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04949	"I ended up my time as governor with a general fund budget that was smaller than the one I started with."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jul/27/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-general-fund-budget-shrank-when-he-/	During a recent debate with Republican George Allen, Democrat Tim Kaine maintained that he is the true spending hawk in Virginia’s U.S. senate race. As proof, Kaine cited budget cuts he made as Virginia’s governor. "I ended up my time as governor with a general fund budget that was smaller than the one I started with," he said during a July 21 debate in Hot Springs. We decided to examine Kaine’s claim. The general fund supports public education, health programs and public safety. Most of its money comes from state incomes and sales taxes. When Kaine became governor in January 2006, he inherited a $15.1 billion general fund budget for the 2005-06 fiscal year that started the previous July 1. The economy was healthy at the start of Kaine’s term, and the fund stood at $17 billion during each of the next two budget years. Then Virginia, like the rest of the country, slid into recession and tax revenues plummeted. The general fund dropped to $16.2 billion during the budget year that started in July 2008. At the end of his term in January 2010, the general fund shrank to $14.8 billion. Before leaving office, Kaine proposed a farewell budget that kept the general fund at $14.8 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010. So the general fund decreased by $300 million -- or 2 percent -- from the start to the end of Kaine’s administration. Despite the reduction, the state was spending more money on general fund programs at the end of Kaine’s term than at the beginning. That’s because the state used federal stimulus money to support some general fund programs during the recession. Virginia did not count the one-time stimulus money as part of the general fund. Virginia propped up general fund programs with $1.5 billion of stimulus money during fiscal 2009-10, and $1 billion of stimulus in 2010-11, according to a study by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit Review Committee. If those stimulus funds are combined with the budget figures, the state spent $16.3 billion on general fund programs during the 2009-10 budget that was in effect at the end of Kaine’s term. That translates to a 7.9 percent increase in general fund spending from the start to the end of Kaine’s term. Adjusted for inflation, total spending on general fund programs -- including stimulus money -- was essentially the same at the start and end of Kaine’s term. When the stimulus money ran out in 2012, the state began feeling the full brunt of budget cuts Kaine and the General Assembly approved. Under the six governors that preceded Kaine, the general fund budget grew by an average 33.8 percent -- not adjusted inflation -- from the day they came to office to the day they left. This figure does not include the spending levels each governor proposed in their budgets for the fiscal year that would begin six months after their terms ended. Our ruling Kaine said the general fund budget was smaller at the end of his gubernatorial term than at the start. The raw numbers hold up his claim: The general fund budget was $15.1 billion when Kaine took office and $14.8 billion when he left. These figures don’t include $1.5 billion in federal stimulus money the state used to support general fund programs during Kaine’s last year. But this does not detract from Kaine’s claim. Virginia did not count the one-time stimulus money as part of the general fund, which mainly consists of income and sales tax revenues. And when the stimulus ran out, there was no backfill for the budget cuts Kaine endorsed. We rate Kaine’s statement True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2012-07-27T06:00:00	2012-07-21	['None']
pomt-04409	"Oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-oil-production-down-14-percent-ye/	President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney sparred during the second presidential debate over drilling policy on federal lands. Romney said -- among other things -- that "oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land." That’s similar to a statement that PolitiFact Ohio checked last April-- "Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before." It’s also similar to a claim we checked a few weeks later, that oil "production's down where Obama's in charge." We’ll recap our analysis here. The 14 percent number We turned to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration titled, "Sales of Fossil Fuels Produced from Federal and Indian Lands, FY 2003 through FY 2011." To produce the report, EIA worked with the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands, including oil from offshore wells. While Romney said "this year," the most recent data available is from 2011, so that's what we'll use. In 2010, EIA data show, 726 million barrels of oil came from federal lands, including offshore wells. In 2011, it was 626. That’s a drop of 13.77 percent, which can be rounded to 14 percent. This data, as well as a more complex measure (it involves royalties and British thermal units of energy, but we’ll spare you), would appear to render the statement accurate. How reliable is it? But is the 14 percent figure cherry picked? Yes, says Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration. "From a statistical standpoint, to take one year out of three — one year is not indicative of a trend," he said. So we pulled the numbers from when George W. Bush was in office -- January 2001 to January 2009 -- as well as from when Obama was in office. In our chart, we’ve italicized the years he was in office and put in bold the years Obama led. We note that: • From 2004-08, well into Bush’s tenure, oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years, for a net decrease of 16.8 percent. • From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent. Fiscal year Offshore (million barrels) Onshore Total Percent change from prior year 2003 579 101 680 n/a 2004 572 97 669 -1.6% 2005 542 96 638 -4.6% 2006 471 101 572 -10.3% 2007 514 105 619 +8.2 2008 462 104 566 -8.6% 2009 527 105 632 +11.7% 2010 618 108 726 +14.9% 2011 514 112 626 - 13.8% Source: EIA; some numbers slightly off due to independent rounding in source data It’s also worth taking a closer look at what went into the overall number. From 2009 to 2010, oil production from offshore sources rose by 14.9 percent. Prior to that, before Obama’s presidency, the offshore volume fell for several years, and it was erratic even during a phase in which it rose, EIA figures show. Yet onshore oil production generally rose on federally owned land -- and did again in 2011, by 3.7 percent. Offshore production that took the hit, falling 16.8 percent. So the big story of the one-year dropoff in public production is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. A six-month moratorium on exploratory drilling followed — though it by no means stopped gulf oil production— along with changes in regulation that forced the industry to adjust. While the moratorium could have been more targeted, it wasn’t a policy choice unique to Obama, said Hakes, the former EIA director who also directed policy and research for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. Bush had his own disasters to contend with: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 also drove a decline the next year, said Shirley Neff, a senior adviser at EIA. And President Richard Nixon ordered a moratorium in the wake of a 1969 well blowout off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif. "Every president, if you have a blowout like that … is going to get a moratorium," Hakes said. Who gets the credit or blame? It’s important to note that most big boosts in production, according to experts, follow years of earlier exploration and drilling -- efforts begun under the policies of prior administrations. By the same token, Obama’s actions in office should have an impact in the years to come. "I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that Bush can," said Hakes, the author of A Declaration of Energy Independence, which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush. "If you're going to go back — who should get the credit — I might be able to find something that Nixon did." The recent expansion of hydrofracking — using pressurized fluid to get gas or oil out of rock formations — came about over decades. "That's why attaching production things to any particular administration is a very, very tricky business, and probably best handled in books rather than in articles," Hakes said. "There are just too many factors." So, Obama certainly shouldn’t be claiming full credit for increases in oil production on private land — but neither should supporters of Bush. Our ruling So: Did the United States produce 14 percent less oil on its public lands last year? Yes. But there’s nuance in the number. Production under Obama was hobbled due to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, making a one-year figure subject to cherry-picking. And it’s not at all clear that the president in charge when the oil is taken out of the ground deserves full credit or blame; years of prior policies on exploration and drilling had an impact. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-16T22:46:58	2012-10-16	['None']

pomt-06753	Says that before Rick Perry became governor, "only 4 percent of our total labor force was a minimum wage job ... Today, that number has more than doubled (to) 9.5 percent."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/24/mike-villarreal/mike-villarreal-says-texans-earning-minimum-wage-m/	Among Democrats vowing to critique Republican Gov. Rick Perry’s record, state Rep. Mike Villarreal of San Antonio swiped at his stewardship of the state’s economy. At an Aug. 6 rally outside the Texas Capitol, Villarreal first noted news stories on Perry’s "D" in an economics course at Texas A&M University. Perry’s college transcript was recently snagged by the left-leaning Huffington Post. "But you know," Villarreal said, "I have less concern about that ‘D’ than his record in the governor’s office. Before he took office, only 4 percent of our total labor force was a minimum wage job, 4 percent. Today, that number has more than doubled (to) 9.5 percent." The latter statistic immediately rang a bell; The Austin American-Statesman noted in a July 17, 2011, news article that Texas and Mississippi led the nation last year with 9.5 percent of hourly workers earning at or less than the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25. Hourly workers aren’t the entire labor force, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as adults who are working plus those lately looking and available for work. The Statesman story says that according to the bureau, 550,000 Texans earned no more than the minimum wage in 2010, and the number of Texas workers earning the federal minimum wage or less was greater than the totals for California, Florida and Illinois combined. The story quotes Lori Taylor, associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, attributing the state’s lower wages to its having a younger, less educated workforce and a lower cost of living. To support his claim, Villarreal pointed us to a March 28, 2011, post by the Bureau of Labor Statistics titled "Minimum Wage Workers in Texas — 2010." The post says that nearly 5.8 million Texas workers were paid hourly rates in 2010, representing 55.7 percent of the state’s workers, compared with 58.8 percent nationally. A bureau economist, Steven Haugen, told us that most other workers are salaried, though some work on commission or do piece work. And, he said, the bureau doesn’t collect data on those workers’ pay rates. The post includes a graph plotting the state’s share of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage from 1997 through 2010. Separately, regional bureau economist Cheryl Abbot sent us an easier-to-read breakdown showing that in 2000, which Perry mostly spent as lieutenant governor before being sworn in as governor, 5.8 percent of Texas hourly workers were paid at or below the minimum wage—not the 4 percent aired by Villarreal, though. In 2001, Perry’s first full year as governor, 4.2 percent of Texas hourly workers were paid at or below the minimum wage. According to the bureau, the share of Texas hourly workers in that category reached 4.5 percent in 2003, then dropped to 3 percent in 2006 before increasing each of the four subsequent years, reaching 9.5 percent in 2010. There’s a wrinkle in these percentage changes that we noted in a 2010 fact check. The federal minimum wage increased three times between 2001, when it was $5.15 an hour, and 2010 — rising to $5.85 in 2007, to $6.55 in 2008, and to $7.25 in 2009. These stair-step jumps brought some above-minimum wage jobs down into the minimum-wage-or-below fold. For that article, Abbot told us that from 2006 to 2009, "just over 300,000 more Texans" entered the minimum-wage-or-less category. She said the bureau has "no way of determining if those are actually 'new jobs' or, more likely, workers whose pay rate is now equal to or below the increased federal minimum wage." By email, Villarreal told us the wording of his rally statement was off. He said that if he’d said the percentage of hourly workers earning the minimum wage or less in Texas has doubled since Perry's first full year as governor, his "point would have been the same, the audience would have understood the same idea, and the statement wouldn't be snagged on any technicalities." Asked why the governor is responsible for changes in the state’s share of minimum-wage hourly workers, Villarreal replied that Perry has taken credit for job creation in the state, so all jobs should be taken into account. He said he offered the comparison in arguing that Perry has not led Texas "towards investing in the education and human capital needed to grow high-paying jobs." Our take: Villarreal’s statement wobbles in two important ways, first by saying the percentages apply to the total Texas labor force when they do not and second by understating the percentage of hourly workers paid at or below the minimum wage before Perry became governor; it was 5.8 percent, not 4 percent, though the share dropped to 4.2 percent his first full year as governor. We rate Villarreal’s statement Half True.	None	Mike Villarreal	None	None	None	2011-08-24T06:00:00	2011-08-06	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-01781	Russia "has an economy the size of Italy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/27/lindsey-graham/graham-russia-has-economy-size-italy/	While the fighting in Ukraine stirs memories of the Cold War, there's little appetite in the United States to get into a military showdown with Russia. Where's there's bipartisan support is to get Europe to take stronger stand. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday that President Barack Obama should be getting the European Union nations into line. "They’re dysfunctional political organization, Europe is," Graham said. "And without American leadership organizing Europe and the world, you see people like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, who has an economy the size of Italy -- he’s playing a poker game with a pair of 2s and winning." Really? Russia is the world’s second-largest producer of natural gas and the third-largest producer of oil, and it has an economy the size of Italy? Turns out they largely do. The numbers Russia and Italy are very close to each other in terms of nominal gross domestic product, which is the standard unit used to measure the size of a country’s economy. Nominal GDP is the total cost of all goods and services produced or sold in a country in within a certain time frame. Russia’s 2013 nominal GDP was $2.1 trillion, and Italy’s was $2.07 trillion, according to the World Bank. That’s not the only way to measure a country’s economy, of course, and this is where the two countries differ. Purchasing power parity takes nominal GDP a step further and shows the value of this level of economic activity if it took place in America. (The Economist explains it by showing how much a McDonald’s Big Mac costs around the world.) Russia’s GDP calculated for purchasing power parity was $3.5 trillion, while Italy’s was $2.1 trillion. So in 2013, Russia had a higher level of economic activity than Italy, but because goods and services are more expensive in Italy, the overall value (nominal GDP) ended up the same. Also, Italy has more wealth relative to the size of its population than Russia does. Italy’s 2013 GDP per capita (per person) was $34,619, and Russia’s was $14,612. But nominal GDP is the standard way to measure an economy’s size compared to other nations, and Graham got that right. Russia’s influence Though Russia may have an economy the size of Italy’s, that hardly means it's too small to throw its weight around. Russia ranks eighth among the world’s top 10 economies, based on 2013 nominal GDP: United States -- $16.8 trillion; China -- $9.2 trillion; Japan -- $4.9 trillion; Germany -- $3.6 trillion; France -- $2.7 trillion; United Kingdom -- $2.5 trillion; Brazil -- $2.2 trillion; Russia -- $2.1 trillion; Italy -- $2.1 trillion; India -- $1.9 trillion. Also of note: the European Union’s 2013 nominal GDP was $17.4 trillion. Graham compared Russia’s economy to Italy’s to show how small it is -- but Italy’s economy isn’t that small compared to the rest of the world, so neither is Russia’s. In terms of level of economic activity -- purchasing power parity -- Russia is No. 6 in the world. In fact, their spot on the list today is close to what it was in the last couple years of the Cold War (the earliest data the World Bank has on Russia’s GDP). In 1992, the year the Soviet Union officially dismantled, their nominal GDP was ranked ninth in the world (America was No. 1). The Russians were also ninth in 1991 and 1990, and they were eighth in 1989. Russia’s economic standing among other countries has been on the rise in recent years. Only in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013 has Russia’s nominal GDP been in the top 10. One likely reason for their growth is rising oil prices, which have quadrupled since 2002. Oil and natural gas make up nearly 70 percent of Russia’s exports. (Though this isn’t to say the rest of Russia’s economy is thriving.) Although some say Russia’s overwhelming dependence on oil won’t sustain them for long, Russia has used this natural resource to gain leverage in the Ukrainian conflict -- such as cutting off a major gas supply to Ukraine. And the origins of the conflict lie in whether Ukraine should strengthen its ties with Russia or the European Union -- proving that Russia still exerts a strong influence over some countries’ economic activity. Our ruling Graham said Russia "has an economy the size of Italy." In terms of nominal GDP, Graham is correct. But if you run the numbers a different way and measure purchasing power parity, Russia's economy is larger than Italy's. Graham's statement is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-04607	"The president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion debt."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/19/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-engaged-spending-binge-ran/	When the Treasury Department announced on Sept. 4 that the national debt had topped $16 trillion, the Associated Press reported, Barack Obama's GOP rivals "used the grim-but-expected news to criticize the president for the government's fiscal performance over his 3 1/2 years in office." Among the leaders who issued news releases was House Speaker John Boehner. Instead of working to cut the deficit, the Ohio Republican said, "the president went on a stimulus-fueled spending binge that stuck every American man, woman, and child with a $50,000 share of this $16 trillion national debt." PolitiFact Ohio was interested. Does spending under Obama break down to a $50,000-per-person share of the national debt? We asked Boehner's office for more information. They responded that the speaker "has often talked about President Obama’s stimulus-fueled spending binge" and called it "a reference to his entire approach to economic policy, not just one bill ... "It's the strategy Obama has pursued since taking office: spend more, refuse to make cuts and reforms where needed because, he argues, such cuts and reforms would hurt the economy. Under his presidency," Boehner’s staff said, "our national debt has increased by $5 trillion and has brought the total share in debt for every American to $50,000. We would not have reached that level of debt on September 4th without the contribution of his economic policies." The cost per person is accurate, and even a little understated. With population estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau at roughly 314.4 million, the average share works out to about $50,900. The national debt has risen more than $5.4 trillion from its level of $10.6 trillion when Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009. But can that all be tied to Obama's spending? It’s a question we’ve addressed before. In May, PolitiFact looked at historical data from the Office of Management and Budget along with projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and calculated the average spending increases per year for 10 presidents over the past 60 years (skipping President Gerald Ford, whose tenure was too short to adequately measure). Using raw dollars (not adjusted for inflation), Obama oversaw the lowest annual increases of spending among them. Jimmy Carter had the highest, followed by Richard Nixon. PolitiFact also did a recalculation because of the special case of 2009, which came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation’s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. The 2009 fiscal year began four months before Obama moved into the White House, and its major spending decisions were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress. The recalculation shifted spending from Bush to Obama for the economic stimulus package, an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, an incremental increase in appropriations over Bush's level and the Troubled Asset Relief Program. That shift moved Obama from last place in spending increases to either second from the bottom or third from the bottom. Using inflation-adjusted dollars, Obama had the second-lowest increase in average annual spending. In fact, he actually presided over a decrease once inflation is taken into account. (Lyndon Johnson was highest on that chart; Dwight Eisenhower was lowest.) So why the disconnect between Obama’s image as a big spender and the reality of how much federal spending has actually grown? First, Obama’s record on debt is a lot less flattering than is his record on federal government spending. During the time that spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year. The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven’t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there’s an annual deficit, the national debt grows. Second, federal spending under Obama is higher as a share of gross domestic product than it has been in most of the previous 60 years. That, too is because of the economy, which has simultaneously slowed the growth of GDP and boosted government spending for programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. Third, the aging of the baby boomers has driven a rise in entitlement spending that is masking cuts Obama and the GOP Congress have made, and have promised to make, in discretionary spending. Finally, many Americans associate Obama with the high-profile legislative activities of his first year or two, when initiatives such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- commonly called the stimulus -- sent spending upward the fastest. Since then, spending has slowed, thanks in part to spending cuts pushed by congressional Republicans. FactCheck.org found the spending Obama inherited "was so high that even modest increases keep it at a level that is extraordinarily lofty by historical standards." As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, the nation's economic production, spending is running at the highest level since the 1940s. But tax revenues are also low by historical standards, FactCheck.org found, and are at their lowest level as a percentage of GDP since 1950. Boehner’s claim included an accurate estimate of what the national debt of $16 trillion would cost per person. But his claim stated that as a result of a presidential "stimulus-fueled spending binge" every American man, woman, and child" was stuck with a $50,000 share of the $16 trillion debt. That’s an overreach. The debt grew to $16 trillion not just because of Obama's actions, but also due to actions taken by present and past presidents and Congresses. The stimulus package came with a $787 billion price tag. If you include all growth in the national debt under the Obama administration, it’s roughly $5.4 trillion, not $16 trillion. The administration inherited a national debt of more than $10 trillion when it came into office. But Boehner’s claim saddles the administration with responsibility for all of the $16 trillion. On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner’s claim rates False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2012-09-19T06:00:00	2012-09-04	['United_States']
pomt-00864	There was "just about zero press coverage" of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/15/juan-williams/media-reaction-george-w-bushs-email-controversy/	Why is everyone picking on Hillary Clinton -- they didn’t mind when President George W. Bush’s White House also used private email, pundit Juan Williams asked on Fox News Sunday. The show’s March 15, 2015, pundit panel debated the importance of the ongoing controversy regarding Clinton’s decision to exclusively use a private email account, rather than a .gov account, during her time as secretary of state. In doing so, experts say she was able to circumvent transparency and records preservation standards. Williams turned to his fellow commentator, Republican strategist and former Bush adviser Karl Rove, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didn’t garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted. "When Karl was in trouble back in ‘07, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue," Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use. "Juan, you are in a different reality, and I wish that I was there with you," Rove said. We decided to look back and see what press coverage of the Bush administration email controversy looked like at the time and how it compares to coverage of Clinton. The Bush email story First, a quick refresher about what happened in the Bush administration. In March 2007, eyes were on then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after the administration unexpectedly fired eight U.S. attorneys. Congress (recently taken over by Democrats) investigated the firings, alleging that the administration had dropped the prosecutors for political reasons. Over the course of the investigation, it came out that some White House officials had conducted White House business over private email accounts set up on a server through the Republican National Committee. The White House later admitted that some internal White House emails conducted on the RNC server might have been lost. Democrats in Congress accused the administration of purposefully circumventing recordkeeping processes, while the White House said staffers were supposed to use the RNC emails solely for political affairs, not official business. Comparing the Bush and Clinton email scandals is not exactly apples to apples, but there are some similarities. We looked back at media coverage at the time, and Williams has a point that it didn’t cause the same level of hubbub as the Clinton email scandal. Though to say there was "zero press coverage" is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. Comparing the coverage We did a search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks news articles and transcripts, between March and May 2007. We found more than 125 transcripts from the major cable networks and National Public Radio that include "Republican National Committee" and "email" within 10 words of each other. The Lexis-Nexis search also yielded more than 200 related newspaper articles across the country within the same time frame. Let’s compare that to coverage of the Clinton controversy. Since the story broke March 3, 2015 -- two weeks ago -- we found 204 cable and public radio transcripts that include "Clinton" and "email." We also found 1,700 newspaper articles across the country. That’s several times as many articles and transcripts about Clinton than there were about the Bush email controversy in a quarter of the time. It’s a rough measurement, but clearly there has been more media attention on Clinton’s use of private email than that of the White House staffers. What about Williams’ reference to the singular Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use among White House staffers? We found the one editorial, as well as a couple opinion columns. In comparison, the Washington Post has so far written two editorials regarding Clinton’s private email use. Not the same Williams’ argument is that Republicans are stoking the media fire of the Clinton email scandal because they’re worried about Clinton’s 2016 potential, compared to Republican candidates. There’s some nuances and contextual factors that might explain the difference in media coverage. First of all, there’s the difference in who’s at the receiving end of the criticisms. In 2007, it was a group of higher-up White House staffers and advisers (notably Rove) who occasionally used private email accounts for official business. As far as we can tell, though, Bush himself was not suspected as being part of this group. Today, the target is a former secretary of state, who only used private email when conducting official government business. What’s more is that Clinton is in all likelihood running for president in 2016, so she has a lot of media attention on her to begin with. At the time of their email controversy, the Bush administration was past their 2004 second-term election and the 2006 midterms. Additionally, the White House email controversy was on the periphery of a much larger scandal -- the firings of the eight U.S. attorneys. We searched Lexis-Nexis for articles about Attorney General Gonzales in the same time frame that we used to explore coverage of the White House email controversy. The search came up with more than 6,000 combined newspaper articles and transcripts. (Compared to the more than 325 about the emails). As one Washington Post article put it: "The controversy over the outside e-mail accounts is a byproduct of the ongoing showdown over the prosecutor firings." Our ruling Williams said there was "just about zero press coverage" of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy. We emailed Williams and did not hear back. Saying there was "zero press coverage" is an exaggeration -- even allowing for a bit of hyperbole. We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clinton’s use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin. Williams’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08446	John Kitzhaber created 128,000 new jobs while governor.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/16/john-kitzhaber/john-kitzhaber-claims-credit-oregon-jobs-when-he-w/	Politicians of all stripes love to tout the number of jobs they have created. Current Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski talks about his transportation funding packages that have resulted in new roads while putting people to work. President Barack Obama talks up stimulus spending. John Kitzhaber -- the former emergency room doctor best known for health care reform and salmon restoration -- is no different. In public statements, responses and campaign mailers, Kitzhaber states he is the only candidate with a record of creating jobs for Oregon. Sometimes he says that 128,000 jobs "were created" during his 1995-2002 reign. Other times he takes active ownership, saying that "we created over 125,000 jobs." In any case, the implication is clear: He was responsible for Oregon’s heady growth during his governorship. And here PolitiFact Oregon thought the national dot-com frenzy of the 1990s had powered Oregon’s go-go decade. Anyway, we decided to find out more, noting that previously, PolitiFact Oregon had rated Chris Dudley, the Republican in the race, Half True for blaming Kitzhaber for the economic woes that slammed Oregon at the end of his tenure. First, the numbers. The Kitzhaber campaign cites the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to back up its claim of 128,000 new jobs. A review of the data shows the campaign is actually lowballing the figure. Nearly 128,000 more people were working in December 2002 than in January 1995, but the number of jobs added over the time period was closer to 179,000. Either way you count it -- workers or jobs -- there was growth. But how much of it was Kitzhaber's doing? He says a lot. "During my two terms as governor, we created over 125,000 jobs in Oregon; wages rose by 49 percent and our state gross annual product rose by 48 percent," he wrote in July. "This did not happen by chance. It resulted from a series of intentional decisions based on the recognition that while government doesn't create jobs, it can help create the climate in which job growth can occur. The repeal of the unitary tax; the reform of Oregon's workers' compensation system; the establishment of the Strategic Investment Program; the many trade delegations I led to Asia, Europe and Mexico; the investment we made in rural infrastructure — all laid the foundation for the dramatic economic growth Oregon experienced in the 1990s." Let’s break down some of those claims. Kitzhaber was in the state Senate in 1984, but it was then-Gov. Vic Atiyeh who led the charge to repeal the unitary tax. Before that, multinational corporations could be taxed on sales outside Oregon, discouraging them from setting up in the state. Kitzhaber was not in office when state lawmakers approved the Strategic Investment Program in 1993, and in fact it was then-Gov. Barbara Roberts who pushed the program, which provides a cap on business property taxes, after losing a multibillion-dollar Intel plant to New Mexico. Over the years, the program helped land biotech company Genentech, LSI Logic and another Intel expansion in Hillsboro. A 1995 story by The Oregonian noted that the state that year "attracted more semiconductor investment than any other state." Kitzhaber played a large role in the 1990 fight to reform Oregon’s costly workers’ compensation system. He was senate president at the time and helped pass landmark legislation lowering the high cost of Oregon’s system. Neil Goldschmidt was governor and Kulongoski was insurance commissioner at the time. Low and predictable rates are good for business. Finally, it’s true Kitzhaber went on at least five overseas trade missions, mostly to Asia, while in the governor’s office. He was in office in 1996 when Delta Air Lines announced the launch of the first-ever direct flight from Portland to Europe (Frankfurt, with a hopscotch stop in Cincinnati). And he also championed investment in rural Oregon, with money to upgrade sewer and water systems and to dredge the Columbia River. Kitzhaber campaign spokeswoman Jillian Schoene also added that in 1995 he helped push an ambitious $750 million transportation package, which included a nice chunk for light rail in Portland. In 2002, Kitzhaber started the Oregon Business Plan, a framework still used by business today to get behind a common agenda, such as money for bridges and roads and investments in nanotechnology. "He gives credit where credit is due when he talks about it. In the ‘80s and through the ‘90s there was a series of intentional decisions made that made our state very attractive to business," she said. "He was part of that." But economists agree that the 1990s were just plain strong around the country. In Washington County, Intel eventually led a surge of chip and wafer makers in former farmland west of Portland. Part of the growth had to do with global demand for products; part of the business decisions to settle in Oregon had to do with tax incentives. "There's no question employment went up during that time period," said John Mitchell, a former economist with U.S. Bank who owns a consulting company in Portland. Tom Potiowsky, who has been state economist since 1999, said the Strategic Investment Program probably helped. But, he added, "you’re going to have a lot of other things involved, too. You need to have, what’s your transportation look like? What’s your work force like? You have to have some synergy going for you." How much Kitzhaber was responsible for that synergy or in laying the groundwork for economic growth is hard to say. "An awful lot of what happens in Oregon is driven by global and national trends. So that’s probably the biggest overlay," said John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest. "However, the governor is responsible for setting a tone and building a foundation and climate that is ... a favorable business climate." The state must have been doing something right, since personal income per capita grew faster than the U.S. average from the late 1980s to 1997. But after that, the pace cooled. "A lot of the activity in Washington County either slowed down or fell, and we didn’t have anything to replace it with," Tapogna said. As the earlier Oregon Truth-O-Meter ruling notes, in 1995, Oregon’s per capita income stood at 97 percent of the nation’s. When Kitzhaber left office it had dropped to 95 percent. It’s true that overall, there was a 13 percent growth in jobs over his eight-year term, but the number of jobs actually began to decline after December 2000. The bottom line is that Kitzhaber didn’t have to focus too much on job growth or ponder budget cuts for the bulk of his administration. Oregon had scads of money. Just about every state added jobs and workers from 1995 through 2002. In the west, Washington added 319,400 jobs, a nearly 14 percent increase; Colorado, 372,200 jobs, a nearly 21 percent increase; California nearly 2.2 million jobs, or 18 percent increase. Idaho added 103,900 jobs, a 22 percent increase. The economy was not a central concern for most of his administration. Kitzhaber played a role in making Oregon more attractive to business, but the global and national economies played a larger role in Oregon’s success. The fact of increased jobs in his claim is accurate but by trying to take credit for jobs creation, he leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06624	One Wisconsin school district "is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/19/al-sharpton/rev-al-sharpton-says-wisconsin-gov-walkers-budget-/	Schoolchildren in America’s Dairyland going without milk? Blame Gov. Scott Walker, the Rev. Al Sharpton says. Sharpton, a civil rights activist and former Democratic candidate for president, is a nationally syndicated radio talk show host and, since August 2011, permanent host of MSNBC’s "Politics Nation." On Sept. 7, 2011, as part of a segment of "calling out" Republicans for acts of "injustice," Sharpton attacked Wisconsin’s first-term governor. "Governor Scott Walker’s budget cuts mean some kids are going without," Sharpton declared. "One school district is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time." Walker has prided himself as a budget cutter; his 2011-2013 spending plan reduced state funding of schools by nearly $800 million. But did mere fear of state budget cuts leave some Wisconsin schoolchildren without milk to go with their graham crackers? We called and emailed MSNBC and the National Action Network, Sharpton’s Harlem-based civil rights organization, asking for evidence to back up Sharpton’s statement. Neither responded. But we found that the day before Sharpton’s program aired, the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison carried an article about milk for schoolchildren in Baraboo, which is about an hour northwest of the state capital. The newspaper article said the Baraboo School District "decided to end its practice of providing milk with students' morning snack this year, citing concerns the state might eliminate subsidies for the program." Sharpton wasn’t the only one to jump on the news. The article was posted on the website of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state’s largest teachers union. The liberal Daily Kos blog, which has a national following, carried an article of its own. And "Fabulous Farm Babe" Pam Jahnke, who does a daily agribusiness report on Wisconsin radio stations, posted a poll question about the issue on her website. To sort out whether Sharpton’s characterization of the situation was accurate, we interviewed Crystal Ritzenthaler, the school district’s superintendent; Kevin Vodak, the school board president; and Doug Mering, the board vice president. All three said school administrators did eliminate milk during morning snack for elementary school students in the 2011-2012 school year. But they said Walker’s state budget cuts had little, if anything, to do with the decision, which Ritzenthaler, the superintendent, said was made in spring 2011 while Walker’s budget was being debated. The three Baraboo officials said that, for more than a year, the school district’s Wellness Committee had discussed milk being served during snack time and that the decision to eliminate the milk was recommended by the committee. Ritzenthaler told us milk during snack was eliminated for a number of reasons: 1. Concern that children were consuming too much milk -- one half-pint carton during breakfast at school, another during morning snack and a third at lunch. There was a concern that the milk reduced the kids’ appetite for lunch, plus the school board wants to promote the drinking of water, which has been substituted for milk at snack time. 2. Concern about the amount of milk wasted because many children drank only a portion of the carton. 3. Administrative time needed to track how much milk was being consumed. Ritzenthaler said less important factors were the $10,400 the school district spent on milk for snack time in 2010-2011 -- and the fact that figure likely was to increase because Walker’s budget cut 10 percent from the state’s funding of the program. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie confirmed the 10 percent cut. The same set of reasons was cited in a May 25, 2011 email from Baraboo schools administrator and principal Molly Fitzgerald informing her fellow elementary school principals that milk at snack time would be eliminated. The email added that state funding for the program "may be eliminated anyway in the state budget." Vodak, the school board president, was emphatic that budgetary considerations played little or no role in the decision to stop serving milk during snack time. He said he believed administrators cited cost as one of the reasons to eliminate the program only "as an afterthought" in explaining the decision. So, is that the final word on why Baraboo kids aren’t drinking milk at snack time? Not quite. Although the May 2011 email from Fitzgerald to principals emphasized non-budgetary reasons for eliminating milk at snack time, she gave a different response when interviewed by the local newspaper for an article Sept. 2. The program was eliminated "due to concerns the state might eliminate" its funding, the Baraboo News-Republic quoted Fitzgerald as saying. News of the decision in early September troubled the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, so Laura Wilford, director of the board’s Wisconsin Dairy Council, contacted Baraboo school officials. She said she was told cost was the major reason for eliminating the program and that school officials were concerned about the condition of the Baraboo schools budget as well as cuts in state funding. Ritzenthaler said the Baraboo paper didn’t accurately report Fitzgerald’s comments and that Fitzgerald has tried to clarify to the dairy council the non-budget reasons for eliminating milk at snack time. We also asked Ritzenthaler for copies of minutes of recent meetings of the school district’s Wellness Committee, which Baraboo officials said had discussed the milk at snack program for a year or two. But she said the discussions aren’t reflected in the minutes. OK, it’s almost break time. In criticizing Walker, Sharpton said "one school district is so worried about losing state funding that it has stopped giving milk to elementary school kids during snack time." Baraboo school officials now say state budget cuts had little or nothing to do with the decision to stop providing milk at snack time, but previously some of them indicated that fear of state budget cuts was the main reason.

pomt-03123	An average of seven children in America are killed by guns every day.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/18/mayors-against-illegal-guns/group-uses-kid-gun-deaths-demand-tougher-laws/	There’s little that is more tragic than the death of a child. One group recently attempted to use those emotions to sway a prominent Georgia lawmaker to its side in the national gun legislation debate. Mayors Against Illegal Guns sent backpacks to the Atlanta office of U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss that were filled with postcards calling on him to support "comprehensive, life-saving background checks on all commercial gun sales." "[S]even backpacks will be dropped to represent the seven children and young people who are murdered with guns every day in America," the Mayors Against Illegal Guns news release reads. "Every day, 33 Americans are murdered with guns in America — and seven of those are children." PolitiFact Georgia read about this on the website Georgia Unfiltered and wondered whether Mayors Against Illegal Guns was correct about how many children were shot and killed every day in America. Mayors Against Illegal Guns was co-founded in 2006 by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. The coalition wants legislation passed that would require background checks on all gun sales. It claims more than 1,000 members across political party lines. Georgia mayors in the organization include Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, Roswell’s Jere Wood and Earnestine Pittman of East Point. The coalition has been pressuring senators such as Chambliss who’ve either been on the fence or against gun bills it supports. Chambliss voted against a gun-control measure earlier this year. That amendment would have allowed a vote on a measure to require nearly all gun buyers to undergo background checks. The coalition said it based its claim on data from the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also noted that other organizations, such as the Children’s Defense Fund, have touted similar numbers. In July, the Children’s Defense Fund released a report that found 2,694 children and teens were killed by guns in 2010. That’s an average of 7.4 deaths a day. Raymonde Charles, a spokeswoman for the CDF, said it began compiling such data on its own 20 years ago and noted it refers to this age group as "children and teens" to reflect that its data include 18- and 19-year-olds. Here’s a chart the mayors coalition shared with PolitiFact: Year Gun homicides 0-20 Gun deaths 0-20 2006 2,813 4,064 2007 2,725 3,871 2008 2,597 3,777 2009 2,352 3,539 2010 2,308 3,459 Average 2,559 3,742 Per day 7.0 10.3 We looked at the CDC site and did a search for how many people 18 and under were killed in homicides by guns in each of those years. The numbers do not include suicides. A CDC spokesman confirmed that is the best way to research such information. Here were the totals: 2006: 1,629 2007: 1,568 2008: 1,486 2009: 1,359 2010: 1,260 That’s a total of 7,302 deaths, an average of four a day. Yes, we included the extra day in 2008 for our calculation. An average of four children killed by homicides from guns a day is troubling, but it is substantially less than seven a day. We asked the coalition why it decided to use those 20 and younger for its claim as opposed to 18 and under. Some may not consider anyone older than 16 a child, since that’s the age most states allow someone to get a driver’s license or get married (with parental consent). The coalition said it included victims under 21 because they cannot legally buy firearms or possess a gun in some states. "The unfortunate reality is that the most recent CDC research shows that we lose seven children - not yet twenty one years old - to gun violence every day in America," Mark Glaze, the executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia. "These are young people - treated as minors under many of our laws - who won't see their twenty-first birthday because Congress won't pass the common-sense laws that a big majority of parents are calling for." To sum up, Mayors Against Illegal Guns said in a news release to U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, in an effort to encourage him to support legislation that the group believes would keep firearms out of the wrong hands, that seven children are killed by guns every day. The coalition should have been more specific by saying it was referring to people under the age of 21. We believe that information would add significant context for those who may not believe anyone older than 16 or 18 is a child. The Children’s Defense Fund was more specific, noting its total included children and teenagers. The coalition’s claim is accurate, but it omits some important details.

pomt-14395	Says Donald Trump and Marco Rubio opposed Cruz’s "efforts to defund Planned Parenthood."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/mar/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-levels-flawed-claim-about-donald-trump-op/	In a TV ad, conservative pastor James Dobson tells viewers that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has the support of thousands of likeminded pastors thanks to his unwavering support for "the sanctity of human life and traditional marriage." In the ad, which Cruz’s campaign mostly ran in Iowa in advance of the 2016 presidential caucuses, Dobsonthen turns his attention to others vying for the Republican presidential nod. "After Donald Trump and Marco Rubio announced they would accept the Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage, we knew we could not support them," Dobson said. Dobson goes on: "Our decision was confirmed when they," Trump and Rubio, "opposed Senator Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood." His gay marriage comment rang a bell. Rubio, the Florida senator, and Trump, the New York businessman, each called the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage the law of the land while Cruz insisted in June 2015 that states not singled out in the ruling didn’t have to comply, which we found Mostly False. We focused on Dobson’s closing claim: Did Rubio and Trump each oppose Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood? This seemed unlikely. Republican efforts to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, limited already to family planning and non-abortion health services, gained steam last summer when videos secretly shot by an anti-abortion group purported to show Planned Parenthood officials selling fetal tissue for a profit, a conclusion that hasn’t factually borne out. Cruz’s efforts extended to a failed September 2015 attempt to stop Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan to fund the government unless, Cruz said, Congress amended the agreement in a way that would defund Planned Parenthood. This ad first aired in November 2015 and then throughout December and January leading up to the Iowa caucuses. A version captured in video online by the Political TV Ad Archive, however, shows Dobson mentioning Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, as a reason for GOP voters to elect Cruz. We checked with Internet Archive, the database that manages these ads, on how that could be possible. According to the Television Archive’s managing editor, Nancy Watzman, the Scalia mention was most likely added to the original ad, before this version began airing after the justice’s death Feb. 13, 2016. Asked about the basis of the Rubio-Trump claim, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email that "Trump has said he’s against defunding Planned Parenthood, and Rubio missed the votes to defund Planned Parenthood." Where was Marco? According to news accounts, Rubio indeed missed two votes on defunding Planned Parenthood, both of which Rubio called "show votes." Rubio was at a Florida campaign fundraiser at the time of a Sept. 28, 2015, cloture vote on McConnell’s plan to fund the government. He then missed a Sept. 30, 2015, vote on final passage of that plan. News stories and Senate records otherwise indicate that from August 2015 through December 2015, the Senate voted at least five times on defunding Planned Parenthood. Set aside the votes Rubio missed, the records show, and Rubio and Cruz each voted three times to defund. Yet we didn’t spot any instance of Rubio opposing defunding, though that judgment doesn’t take into account Rubio’s absence from the Senate the day that all but one Republican colleague of Cruz didn’t go along with the Texan’s move to reject McConnell’s government funding plan until it defunded Planned Parenthood. Cruz's September song In September 2015, Cruz was one of the last hold-outs on McConnell’s government funding plan, which included an extension of Planned Parenthood funding. In one of his last moves protesting the funding bill, Cruz called for -- and failed to get -- a roll call vote or a voice vote to register Republicans’ positions on the final plan. Cruz said later that denying him the vote was a way for his colleagues to avoid accountability. Republicans in the Senate, Politico reported, loudly yelled "no" when Cruz called for a voice vote, a resounding rejection for what was described as typically an uncomplicated procedural matter. The only Senate colleague to back Cruz in his last-ditch effort was Mike Lee of Utah. This all took place on Sept. 28, 2015, when Rubio was absent, and shortly before the funding bill was finalized, which kept the government running and eliminated the possibility of defunding Planned Parenthood in the immediate future. Rubio camp's response Cruz has attacked Rubio’s record on this matter before. At the Faith and Family Presidential Forum at Bob Jones University Feb. 12, 2016, Cruz told voters that Rubio didn’t want to use Congress’ "constitutional authority to defund Planned Parenthood," Politico reported, quoting Cruz saying: "Marco Rubio has spoken out about Planned Parenthood. But when these videos came out I stood with millions of Americans calling on Republican leadership to use the power of Congress to defund Planned Parenthood and to cut off the money. And Marco stood up and said: 'No, we shouldn't.’" At the time, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told Politico that Cruz was "making things up." On the other hand, a Sept. 17, 2015, Politico news story said Rubio had refused to sign a letter circulated by Cruz urging McConnell not to advance government funding without an end to Planned Parenthood aid. In a Sept. 27, 2015 interview with NPR News, Rubio said he wouldn’t "prefer to see it (the government) shut down." He said, "I don't think there is any single organization in the country that's worth shutting the government down over," but he also laid the blame for a potential shutdown on Democrats for insisting on funding Planned Parenthood. When we asked the Rubio campaign about the claim in the Cruz ad, spokesman Jahan Wilcox sent a press release the campaign initially distributed Feb. 12, 2016, the day of Cruz’s speech at Bob Jones University. The release said Rubio has cosponsored legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and has "always" voted to do so. The Rubio release offered specific votes: Rubio’s Dec. 3, 2015, vote to defund Planned Parenthood in a reconciliation bill, his Sept. 24, 2015 vote for a funding bill that defunded Planned Parenthood, his Aug. 3, 2015 vote to defund Planned Parenthood, and his co-sponsorship of that bill. Anti-abortion group We also reached out to National Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, to seek its perspective on Cruz’s claims. (The group hasn’t endorsed a presidential candidate.) By email, we fielded a comment from its president, Carol Tobias, saying Rubio had voted to defund Planned Parenthood even before Cruz joined the Senate; she pointed out a roll call on H. Con. Res. 36, April 14, 2011. Tobias also said that since Cruz joined the Senate in 2013, "both he and Sen. Rubio have voted the same on every roll call that National Right to Life regards as pertinent to defunding Planned Parenthood. To suggest that Sen. Rubio voted wrong or missed meaningful votes on the Planned Parenthood issue is inaccurate and misleading." Trump supported Cruz's push at first As for Trump, National Right to Life pointed out his lack of a congressional voting record. We asked Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, about Cruz’s claim. Hicks said by email: "Mr. Trump has always stated he will defund" Planned Parenthood "as long as abortions are taking place, but believes the women's health services like cancer screenings for cervical and breast cancers are essential to millions of women across the country." That seems to represent the progression of Trump’s position on the matter. As well documented, Trump favored abortion rights earlier in his life. At the first GOP presidential debate Aug. 6, 2015, Trump said he had had a change of heart after a friend decided not to get an abortion, and he saw that child grow up. News stories show that in August 2015, Trump supported Cruz’s unsuccessful push to shut down the government unless Congress defunded Planned Parenthood. But Trump shortly backtracked, saying he would look at the "good aspects" of the organization. And in October 2015, Trump told Fox News he wouldn’t shut down the government over Planned Parenthood though he also said the organization should "absolutely be defunded." On Meet the Press Feb. 21, 2016, Trump said he wouldn’t fund Planned Parenthood "as long as they’re doing abortions." In the same interview he said that his friends, who are women, "understand Planned Parenthood better" than he ever would. At the Feb. 25, 2016 Republican presidential debate, Trump said: "Millions and millions of women — cervical cancer, breast cancer — are helped by Planned Parenthood. So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly," but that he also "wouldn’t fund it." Our ruling Dobson said in Cruz’s ad that Trump and Rubio opposed Cruz’s "efforts to defund Planned Parenthood." In the narrowest way, you could say Rubio opposed Cruz’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood by expressing misgivings about holding the government hostage to funding of a particular organization. But that's also misleading. Rubio, like Cruz, otherwise repeatedly voted to defund. Trump, meantime, expressed support at the time for Cruz’s efforts. He later reversed course on that but he's been clear lately about wishing to defund so long as the group provides abortions. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08740	Michael Thurmond "authored major legislation that has provided more than $250 million in tax relief to Georgia’s senior citizens and working families."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/31/michael-thurmond/thurmond-claims-legislation-helped-low-income-geor/	Michael Thurmond, Georgia's outgoing labor commissioner, calls it the most important legislation he has written. Back in 1990, when Thurmond was a state representative, he proposed a bill to give a tax credit to Georgians with annual incomes of less than $20,000. Then-Gov. Zell Miller announced his support for the idea a year later, and it became Georgia law shortly thereafter. Thurmond, the Democratic Party's nominee for the U.S. Senate in the Nov. 2 general election, boasted about the bill's impact on his campaign website. He is running against incumbent Johnny Isakson, a Republican, and Libertarian Party candidate Chuck Donovan. "Thurmond authored major legislation that has provided more than $250 million in tax relief to Georgia’s senior citizens and working families," his campaign bio says. But is that true? Did Thurmond write the legislation, and did it save Georgians that much money? AJC PolitiFact Georgia was curious. We first called Thurmond, who was eager to talk about the statement. Thurmond said his legislation was written to help offset the sales taxes low-income Georgians pay for groceries. Miller was part of a push in the late 1980s to remove groceries from Georgia's 4 percent sales tax. Thurmond offered his suggestion as a compromise. Miller initially opposed Thurmond's idea. But Miller eventually endorsed the plan after being told his idea was not financially viable, particularly since state finances were struggling. Miller said he was "swallowing his pride of authorship." The refunds in question were relatively small -- they ranged between $5 and $26. Thurmond said the refunds may seem puny to some, but he argued they were a big help to many recipients. "For a senior citizen, that might be dinner for a week," Thurmond said of $26. Thurmond's desire to discuss the claim stems from a successful effort earlier this year to repeal the key portion of his legislation. State lawmakers added language to a bill on the next to last day of this year's session that ends the refunds. Gov. Sonny Perdue signed the bill on June 4. Thurmond argues his legislation has helped senior citizens and low-income Georgians. He equates ending the refunds to a tax increase. "I just don't believe we need to be raising taxes in the midst of a recession, particularly on low-income people," Thurmond said in an interview. State Rep. David Knight, R-Griffin, was the lead sponsor of the effort to repeal the refunds. "People who have paid in no income tax and have zero tax liability are in essence getting a check back," Knight told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in April about the current system. "If you pay no income taxes, how can you get a refund? How can you justify someone getting a check back from the state? That is, in its purest form, taking away from the taxpayer and giving to someone who has no tax liability. [It's] a redistribution of wealth." Thurmond argues the sales tax has a greater proportional impact on the wallets of low-income Georgians. Sarah Beth Guhl, deputy director of the liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, explained Thurmond's point in an e-mail. "Low-income families consume more of their income, and thus pay the sales tax on a larger portion of their earnings," said Guhl, who agreed with Thurmond that a sales tax is regressive on low-income Georgians. Thurmond admitted an error in his statement the first time we talked to him. The legislation provided about $300.3 million in tax relief over the span of 13 years, according to the most recent Georgia Department of Revenue data available. Thurmond sold himself short by about $50 million. "It lacks the truth in a positive direction," Thurmond said in a telephone interview. The Thurmond campaign came to the $250 million total using data available on the Revenue Department's website. The data comes from the department's annual statistical reports. The reports on the Revenue Department's Web site, however, only go back to 2000. The Revenue Department has reports that date to 1997 with annual low-income credit figures in its north DeKalb County offices. But Thurmond's website gives him some serious wiggle room by saying "more than $250 million in tax relief." We rate his statement as True.

pomt-02088	"Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States. They are working fewer hours for more pay, … living longer on average, and facing less income inequality."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-united-states-falling-behind-/	The next presidential election may still be two and a half years away, but the presumptive Democratic frontrunner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is all over the news. On May 16, 2014, in a speech at the New America Foundation, a moderate-to-liberal think tank, Clinton compared the United States and Canada on several measures of well-being. Clinton found the United States wanting. "Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States," Clinton said. "They are working fewer hours for more pay, enjoying a stronger safety net, living longer on average, and facing less income inequality." We’ll set aside the claim about the safety net, since that’s tricky to measure statistically. But the other claims are ripe for a closer look. So we’ll take them in order. (Clinton’s camp did not respond to our inquiry.) Canadian middle-class incomes are now higher than in the United States This is the trickiest of the measurements Clinton mentioned, for a couple reasons. First, there’s no universally recognized definition of "middle class" in the available data. Second, there’s more than one way to measure the data. Some measurements take a nation’s economic output as a whole and divide it by the population, whereas others sample individual people or households to find out how much they make, then find the midpoint. Clinton has support from New York Times article that looked at data from the Luxembourg Income Study database, which is based on surveys going back 35 years. The study surveyed people in various countries, asked them what they earned, then used a median to determine the mid-range income level. The New York Times concluded that "median income in Canada pulled into a tie with median United States income in 2010 and has most likely surpassed it since then," due to studies conducted by other groups since 2010 suggest that pay in Canada has risen faster than pay in the United States. On the other hand, if you look at gross domestic product per capita -- the total amount of economic activity divided by population -- the United States tops Canada, and not by a trivial amount. In 2012, GDP per capita in the United States was $51,689, compared to $41,559 for Canada, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (These figures, as with all other money figures in this article, have been converted to U.S. dollars, so that they can be compared.) But this method has drawbacks. Because it represents an average across the entire economy, the final results tend to over-represent the income that flows to the wealthy. So it’s not ideal for measuring "the middle class." Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo, and Ross Burkhart, co-director of the Canadian Studies Program at Boise State University, told PolitiFact that using the Luxembourg Income Study is at least as good a measurement for Clinton’s claim as the other figures, if not better. They are working fewer hours for more pay than Americans OECD data for the average number of hours worked annually per employed person shows that Clinton is correct. In the United States in 2012, workers spent 1,790 hours per year on the job, compared to 1,710 hours per year in Canada. One could say that Americans are working harder and producing more goods and services, but Clinton’s point was that Canadians have greater opportunities for leisure, and on that point, the statistics support her point. As for getting more pay, OECD statistics for 2012 show that the average annual wages for workers in Canada were $58,376, compared to $55,048 in the United States. This measures the average wages earned by a full-time, full-year employee. These statistics support Clinton’s claim. Canadians are living longer OECD data for life expectancy at birth shows that in 2011, Canadians could expect to live 81 years, while in 2009, the most recent year available, Americans could expect to live 78.7 years. So Clinton’s right on this one, too. There’s less income inequality in Canada The primary statistic used for gauging income inequality is the "Gini coefficient." Gini coefficients range from 0, or perfect equality, to 1, or perfect inequality. According to the OECD, the Gini coefficient for Canada in 2010 was .320, compared to .380 in the United States. That means Canada is modestly more equal than the United States is, which is what Clinton had claimed. Overall, the five comparisons Clinton made are reasonable and aren’t cherry-picked or subject to statistical quirks, Burkhart said. "It's fair, in my understanding of the Canadian and U.S. economies, for Ms. Clinton to make the kinds of comparisons that Ms. Clinton has made," Burkhart said. Our ruling Clinton said that "Canadian middle class incomes are now higher than in the United States. They are working fewer hours for more pay, … living longer on average, and facing less income inequality." She’s indisputably correct on four of these five measures, and the data is more mixed on the fifth. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-06738	Public-employee unions spent $30 million in Wisconsin unsuccessfully trying to flip the state Senate to Democratic control.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/28/reince-priebus/republican-national-committee-chairman-reince-prie/	In a round of interviews following the Wisconsin Senate recall elections, the Republican Party’s national chairman framed the results as a clear victory for Gov. Scott Walker. Republicans lost two seats but retained Senate control, despite a major -- and expensive -- effort from Democrats and their supporters. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown on Aug. 18, 2011 that the results show Walker shouldn’t worry about the left trying to recall him in 2012. He argued voters stood with Walker in the face of the challenge by public employee unions outraged over his changes that curtailed collective bargaining for most government workers. And he put a number on the union’s effort. "I don’t think he should be worried at all, and if the public employee unions want to flush another $30 million down the toilet, and then allow Scott Walker to be even stronger and win a recall election … then they should go ahead and do it, because the $30 million they flushed down the toilet will be $30 million they don’t have for other races. So, hey, go for it." Thirty million -- that’s a pile of money. Especially if that’s just what unions spent on the races. An RNC spokesman told us Priebus -- the former Wisconsin GOP chairman -- actually was referring not just to labor unions, but to any spending on the pro-Democrat side. "Analysis from our political folks in Wisconsin suggests that when all is said and done, pro-Democrat groups will have spent between $20 (million) and $30 million on their failed effort to win a majority in the state Senate," said Ryan Mahoney of the RNC. Of course, Priebus on MSNBC limited his claim to the public unions -- and said a flat $30 million. So there are already problems with his claim. We’ll focus on what Priebus said on MSNBC, but also take a quick look at spending by both sides. Asked for backup for his claim, the RNC sent us dozens of links to media accounts of the disclosed spending in the recalls. Priebus, like reporters, based his arithmetic on what is publicly known about spending in the nine races. That’s notable. Under state and federal laws, millions of dollars in campaign spending by various political groups goes unreported, but Priebus isn’t suggesting he has inside information about that. He’s citing the information that is publicly released. That -- and a decision by labor groups to collectively work through a political action committee, We Are Wisconsin, that has to publicly account for its spending -- makes our math easier. A coalition of national, state and local labor groups funded most of the activities of We Are Wisconsin. The national AFL-CIO was most prominent, followed by various teachers unions; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the Service Employees International Union, and many others. We Are Wisconsin was by far the major player on the pro-Democrat side, spending nearly $10.8 million through election day, according to official figures reported to the state. Several teachers unions and miscellaneous small unions separately spent about $1 million more. So that’s a total of about $11.8 million, far short of $30 million. Let’s look at this another way, and compare our numbers with those of other organizations that track campaign spending. We looked at links between We Are Wisconsin and other major liberal groups active in the election. If you stretch the union label to include groups that got direct financial support from We Are Wisconsin, you could count at least another $2.2 million. So that would get you to $14 million in union-linked money. Meanwhile, two organizations have produced comprehensive scorecards of left vs. right spending in the nine recall contests. They base their numbers on official campaign reports filed with the state Government Accountability Board. The John K. MacIver Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank in Wisconsin, produced an elaborate flow chart of pro-Dem spending – including unions but also "national and state liberal groups." MacIver’s definition, then, was broader than Priebus’ "union" claim. Still, its total tops out at about $15.2 million, or roughly half of what Priebus claimed. The most prominent campaign-spending tracker is the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonprofit that advocates for transparency in campaign spending. It’s allied with a coalition of left-leaning groups, including several unions. Its total for pro-Democrat spending by groups: $15.1 million. Again, $15 million is far short of $30 million. None of these figures include spending by the candidates themselves. The candidate spending was dwarfed by the outside groups, but still amounted to about $2.5 million by all the Democrats in the recall elections, according to our tabulations of reports filed with the state Accountability Board. So, even if you include candidate spending -- which Priebus didn’t -- the pro-Dem total is only about $17.6 million. That’s the pro-Dem side. What about the pro-GOP side? Looking just at the publicly disclosed money, Republican candidates and pro-GOP groups spent about $3.5 million compared to the $17.6 million on the other side, according to official figures compiled by the Democracy Campaign. That’s a big mismatch -- but there’s a big caveat. Several prominent pro-Republican groups -- including the biggest player on that side, the Wisconsin Club for Growth -- were set up in way that doesn’t require disclosure of millions of dollars in spending on TV ads and other activities. To a much lesser extent, pro-Democrat groups did the same. The Democracy Campaign estimates that undisclosed spending by groups could equal the publicly reported figures. But that’s an educated guess at amounts of undisclosed spending. The bottom line: Nobody really knows how the undisclosed numbers break down. So we -- and Priebus -- were left with the publicly reported numbers. Priebus claimed public-employee unions poured $30 million into the state Senate recalls in Wisconsin. But the publicly disclosed spending reports that he cites -- by our account as well as groups affiliated with the left and right -- put total spending by pro-Democrat groups at $15 million or less. And that includes campaigning by liberal groups not connected to unions. Based on available information, even if he meant to say all pro-Democratic spending he was way off. We rate his claim False.

pomt-14085	Says Demond Means, "turnaround district" superintendent for Milwaukee Public Schools, said the district "needs to be gutted."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/18/wisconsin-jobs-now/debunking-claim-demond-means-said-milwaukee-public/	The Milwaukee education community is paying close attention to Demond Means, superintendent of the so-called "turnaround district" for Milwaukee Public Schools. The position is the result of the Opportunity Schools and Partnership Program, created by the Republican-controlled state Legislature. The measure directed Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele to appoint a special commissioner with the power to take over a limited number of low performing MPS schools. Some, including the teachers’ union, see Means as leading a de facto takeover of MPS, which could mean the replacement of school leaders, lost jobs for teachers, even the closing of schools. In November 2015, Abele selected Means, superintendent of the Mequon-Thiensville School District, as the special commissioner, a part-time post for which both say he is not currently being paid. On April 21, 2016, Means laid out his initial plan for the Milwaukee School Board. Under his plan, specific schools -- which have not yet been chosen -- would be transferred to the opportunity schools district, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. Students would remain part of MPS, and teachers and staff would keep their jobs and benefits as district employees. MPS board members would retain "many of their statutory powers" under state law. But the plan also calls for the creation of an "independent, autonomous school governing body" at each school. Those bodies would take part in the budget process, and interview and make recommendations on principal appointments. Opponents, including Wisconsin Jobs Now pushed back. The liberal group posted a picture of Means on Facebook on April 28, 2016. The image showed Means holding a sign that read "MPS needs to be gutted!" Unlike a meme, which typically makes clear the message is fake, the Facebook post included this note: "Abele's MPS Takeover Czar Demond Means really said this." Whoa. Did Means really say that? In a word: No. At least there is no hard evidence of it, nor does not track with his public statements and actions. And when we asked Wisconsin Jobs Now Executive Director Martha De La Rosa about the image, she acknowledged the image was a "photoshopped picture." But she argued it conveys what the group believes are Means’ intentions. The original photo actually comes from the 2016 edition of Stritch Magazine, published by Cardinal Stritch University. Means is among a group of alumni profiled. Like the others, he is pictured holding a card with his "personal mission statement." His statement: "My mission is to close the gap for all students." That’s a far cry from the statement used in the Wisconsin Jobs Now post. When we asked DeRosa about the words it attributed to Means, De La Rosa said they came from a private conversation that two people had with Means. "It’s from a credible source -- actually two people say he made that comment," De La Rosa said. OK. But who? "Unfortunately, I can’t say who," De La Rosa said, adding that "the setting was over some drinks at a bar. He thought he was talking with some people who were on his side." As for any additional evidence, De La Rosa simply offered that she feels the image conveys the intentions of Means and others supporting the Opportunity Schools program. "Look at what he’s putting forward," she said. "You can see where it is going." The record so far To the contrary. Public statements by Means and Abele on the topic have been measured, with Abele stressing that he did not seek the appointment authority and stating he wants the turnaround provisions to be carried out in a targeted manner. In January, a month after he was appointed to his position, Means notified MPS that he had no interest in taking over vacant or underused school district buildings -- a symbolic gesture that was intended to assure the district he is not plotting a "takeover." "That was a very important moment in establishing trust and demonstrating that we mean everything we say when we say we want to help Milwaukee Public Schools," Means said in January. "Our intent is to help the schools of Milwaukee." In an interview, Means said he was bothered by the Facebook post. "It is diametrically opposed to the work that I’ve continued to dedicate my career for," he said. "I want to make sure that I help MPS, not hurt MPS." Means said that he didn’t make the statement attributed to him by Wisconsin Jobs Now. "I just don’t use that type of language," he said. "That is the opposite of how we are approaching the work." Our rating A group opposing the "turnaround" program for MPS posted a photo of Demond Means with a statement that says "MPS needs to be gutted." But Means says he never said those words, the group offers no real evidence he did and acknowledges the photo was doctored to make their point. Indeed, the original words on the photo conveyed a message of helping public schools, not gutting them. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-11929	"There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/13/colin-jost/colin-jost-weekend-update-texas-dildos-law-6-own-m/	Saying individual Americans should own fewer guns, a co-host of the news-like Weekend Update segment on NBC’s "Saturday Night Live" wrapped in a claim about Texas. Colin Jost, who also wondered aloud about the mass shooter in Las Vegas owning 47 guns, said in the Oct. 7, 2017 episode: "No one should own 47 of anything." Cats, for instance, Jost went on, before adding: "There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos. And I get why—no one needs that many! If you have more than six dildos, it’s a clear sign you are training for something awful." Cue laughter. But does Texas have such a law? An NBC spokeswoman, Lauren Roseman, declined to comment when we sought the basis of Jost’s statement. We similarly failed to draw comment--about Jost's accuracy--from the Texas attorney general’s office, law professors and representatives of Texas law officers and district attorneys. A law found unconstitutional For our part, we suspected that Jost was referring to a state law restricting "obscene devices" that remains in place despite being found unconstitutional by a federal appeals court nearly a decade ago. We recently looked into the law, which dates to the 1970s, in finding Mostly False a claim that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the former Texas solicitor general, once supported a ban on sex toys. Cruz’s defense of the law, we concluded, came as part of his duties as the state’s top appellate lawyer at the time. Section 43.23 of the Texas penal code does not specify dildos. It states: "A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device." Another provision specifies: "A person who possesses six or more obscene devices or identical or similar obscene articles is presumed to possess them with intent to promote the same," the implication being that the person would violate the restriction on promoting such devices. In ruling against the state in February 2008, judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited Lawrence and Garner v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 opinion striking down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, in violation of the 14th Amendment. State lawyers did not appeal the dildo ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. "Just as in Lawrence," the circuit court judges wrote, "the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence." Law remains in place Lawyers familiar with the appeals court ruling agreed, when we asked, that the sexual devices statute remains in Texas law — but that’s an empty reality, most said. James C. Todd, a since-retired Texas assistant attorney general who defended the law in federal district court, said by phone he wasn’t surprised that legislators haven’t acted to repeal the law. His speculation: "They don’t want to go back and in the next election have it said (that) my opponent voted against a law to prohibit indecency." Todd said that while the law remains on the books, it’s unenforceable; since it’s declared unconstitutional, no prosecutor would prosecute someone for violating it, he said. Gary Krupkin, a Dallas lawyer who represents vendors of sex toys, said by email that the circuit court’s ruling had the same effect as the Texas Legislature repealing the law. Krupkin said he’s unaware of any other state law that could be used to ban, restrict, or otherwise impede the purchase, ownership, commercial sale or use of multiple dildos. Former judge suggests legal limbo We should otherwise note a legal twist explored by PolitiFact Florida in 2015. In 2008, a Texas state appeals judge upheld a conviction stemming from the sale of a vibrator by a store in Corpus Christi. The majority opinion upholding the Texas law was issued months after the federal circuit court had found it unconstitutional. In 2015, legal experts commented on this contrast by saying that technically, federal rulings are not directly binding on state courts, but plaintiffs still would be assured of relief if they pursued their case in federal court. In the July 2008 state appeals court ruling, Linda Reyna Yañez, a judge on the 13th District Court of Appeals covering Brownsville north to Wharton, wrote that though the court embraced the circuit court’s ruling against the law’s constitutionality, it wasn’t required to follow it. Yañez wrote: "Fifth Circuit precedent is not binding on Texas courts." The judge also wrote that because the state’s chief criminal appeals court earlier held that the same law didn’t violate due-process rights, the state appeals court had no binding basis to hold otherwise. In 1985, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had held that the statute did not violate an individual's right to privacy, concluding that there was no constitutional right to "stimulate another's genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose." At our request, Yañez, an Edinburg attorney who’s no longer a member of the appeals court, re-read the ruling in October 2017. Next, she told us by phone that she stands by the conclusion despite her personal backing of the circuit court’s ruling. "I remember," she said, "not being able to do what I really wanted to do," which would have been to find the law at fault, she said. But because the U.S. Supreme Court hadn’t taken up the law’s constitutionality while the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had previously upheld it, she said, "I had absolutely no choice." "Theoretically a law enforcement officer could still arrest somebody" for violating the law, Yañez said. "This is the way it works. Sometimes you have these inconsistencies and people are left in limbo." Todd later agreed by phone that it’s a rule of judicial decision-making that Texas appeals courts follow the highest state court’s ruling even on a matter of federal constitutionality. Then again, Todd said, "I’ve always felt like they’re not going to ignore what the 5th Circuit says." Krupkin said by email that we’d have to check every Texas county to cement whether anyone has been prosecuted under the law. "However, there is a very small cadre of attorneys that specialize in dildo defense. As part of that group, I have not heard of any prosecutions," Krupkin said. Our ruling Jost said: "There is a real law in Texas that says it’s illegal to own more than six dildos." Such a cap on "obscene devices" has been state law since the 1970s though it’s worth clarifying that the law mostly hasn’t been enforced since federal appeals judges found it unconstitutional in 2008.

pomt-04318	"We’re talking right now about a $12 billion hole in our current, so-called balanced" state "budget."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/oct/29/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-so-called-balanced-state-budget-/	Can a balanced budget also have gaping holes? So suggested state Rep. Donna Howard, who told an East Austin meetup organized by Texans for Obama in August 2012: "We’re talking right now about a $12 billion hole in our current, so-called balanced (state) budget." The Austin Democrat’s chief of staff, Scott Daigle, later told us that the declared hole lies in lawmakers last year not covering the full projected 2012-13 costs of Medicaid and public schools while also diverting billions of dollars from special dedicated funds to balance the books. Specifically, he said, the 2012-13 budget does not cover some $5 billion in projected Medicaid costs, defers a regular school payment of about $2 billion and diverts about $5 billion that was supposed to be dedicated to particular programs to balance the $173.5 billion budget. About $4.9 billion was diverted from dedicated accounts to balance the budget, according to a September 2011 report by the comptroller’s office, though it’s not a novel tactic. We previously rated as Mostly True a November 2010 claim by state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, that the 2009 Legislature had diverted $3.5 billion in dedicated funds to make the 2010-11 budget look balanced. Howard’s other figures hold up, we learned, though there were twists after the budget passed into law. The cost of a postponed distribution of school aid, put off to the fiscal year beginning Sept. 1, 2013, has been ratcheted down from an initial $2.3 billion estimate to $1.9 billion due to changes in enrollment growth, according to information from the advisory Legislative Budget Board. And while the budget’s Medicaid under-funded amount was initially pegged at $4.3 billion, Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst for the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that pending agency budget requests reveal that the Texas demand on Medicaid, the jointly federal-state-funded insurance program serving low-income families, will be higher in 2013 than originally estimated. She said increased caseloads and costs drive up the under-funding to $5 billion. Rolling up these adjusted figures gets us to $11.8 billion, close to Howard’s $12 billion. DeLuna Castro and other close observers of state spending -- John Kennedy of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and Chuck DeVore of the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation — did not quibble with Howard’s building blocks. Then again, Kennedy suggested that only the cited Medicaid amount must be covered before services are sought. That’s because Medicaid is an entitlement program; states must serve qualified applicants. If lawmakers wanted to do so, DeLuna Castro separately countered, they could fail to cover all the funding gaps, though she said that would have negative effects. For instance, she speculated, lawmakers could dramatically cut nursing home reimbursements rates by 30 percent, which she said would prompt nearly every benefiting nursing home to shut down, touching off client lawsuits. "Politically, there is a need for health care and schools," DeLuna Castro said. We were curious if schools or Medicaid already have been hindered by the budget decisions singled out by Howard. Not so, relevant agencies said. Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us by phone that Medicaid recipients haven’t been affected by the Medicaid IOU because the state’s matching money has yet to run out. She speculated the 2013 Legislature would cover the funding gap in time to maintain the state’s Medicaid commitments. Education agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe said by email that school districts have not been battered by the deferred state payment partly because officials have been cognizant of the payment delay since mid-2011. "We have long advised districts to have sufficient (local) fund balances to manage through times when cash is tight. We would certainly hope that districts can manage a two-week delay without causing significant financial distress," Ratcliffe said. DeVore of the public policy foundation posited another wrinkle. Along with any shortfalls in the budget, he said, it’s relevant to consider what many expect to be a projected revenue surplus when lawmakers write the next budget. That is, holes can be filled -- and soon. The state treasury has accumulated revenue thanks to larger-than-expected receipts from sales, oil and gas production taxes. State Comptroller Susan Combs said in September 2012 that through the previous month, the state had reaped $3.7 billion more in tax revenue than earlier projected, on top of a previous unexpected surge of $1.6 billion, according to a Sept. 12, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article. Dale Craymer, president of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, then commented he would not be surprised if lawmakers convening to write the next budget in 2013 are told the state faces a record revenue surplus. The established high-water mark is the $8.8 billion surplus reported at the end of 2007, Craymer said. On top of the better-than-expected revenues forecast, there is the rainy day fund -- the state savings account that can be used to close budget gaps. The comptroller estimated in fiscal year 2011 that the rainy day fund contained $8.2 billion and would contain $9.4 billion in fiscal year 2013. Our ruling Donna Howard says the current "so-called balanced" state budget has a $12 billion hole. Lawmakers did not cover all projected state costs of Medicaid in 2013 and put off a regular payment to school districts. As before, too, portions of funds intended for special purposes were set aside to balance the budget. On the other hand, school districts have not been slammed by the deferral and the agency overseeing Medicaid doesn’t expect consequences to eligible Texans unless lawmakers unexpectedly fail to cover costs during the 2013 legislative session. Besides, billions in unallocated projected revenue could help the next Legislature meet funding needs. Howard’s "hole" traces to funding shortfalls in the latest budget. But that budget still was balanced. We rate this claim as Half True.	None	Donna Howard	None	None	None	2012-10-29T06:00:00	2012-08-30	['None']

pomt-00691	I "helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the State Senate."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/may/05/van-taylor/van-taylor-says-texas-senate-sent-largest-tax-cut-/	First-term state Sen. Van Taylor recently credited the Texas Senate with advancing a record tax cut. The Plano Republican’s March 25, 2015, press release, said he’d "helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the State Senate," providing $4.6 billion in property and business tax relief. Taylor was among more than 20 Senate primary authors of Senate Bill 1, which with voter approval would amend the state’s mandatory homestead property tax exemption, which has been $15,000 since 1997. If adopted, the new variable exemption, equal to 25 percent of the statewide median home value, was predicted to save homeowners $206 on average in 2016 and $233 on average in 2017. Two other measures, each authored by more than 20 senators (including Taylor), reduced the state’s business franchise tax rate by 15 percent and exempted an additional 61,000 small businesses from it. Tax-cut history has been ballyhooed in Texas before. State leaders in the 1990s and again in 2006 declared history in the works when they drove down school property taxes — even though the homeowners who were supposed to benefit didn’t always notice reductions because school districts and other local governing bodies still raised tax rates and reaped more due to escalating property values. Stumping for president in fall 1999, then-Gov. George W. Bush ran TV ads in Iowa saying he’d "signed the two biggest tax cuts in Texas history." In 1997, lawmakers had proposed and voters approved the new $15,000 homestead exemption, up from $5,000 before. The two-year cost to the state of that move was pegged at $1.04 billion, according to a January 2015 report by the state comptroller’s office covering tax changes since 1972. In 1999, lawmakers funded local school property tax relief at a state cost of $1.4 billion in 2000-01, the report said. A billion here, a billion there, those reductions had far short of the projected two-year effect of the plans saluted by Taylor. 2006: $14 billion in relief Then again, in May 2006, the Republican-led Legislature and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to what was then touted as more than $6 billion a year in school property tax relief to be partly offset by revisions in the state’s business franchise tax, a $1-per-pack hike in cigarette taxes and tighter tax-reporting requirements for buyers of used cars. According to a May 2006 Austin American-Statesman news story, homeowners would benefit from the legislated one-third cut in maximum property tax rates for school operations. The owner of a $100,000 home was in for annual savings of about $145 starting in fall 2006 with the savings rising to $425 in fall 2007, the story said, though savings would be lessened if school boards inched up tax rates. On full implementation, the relief was projected to cost the state $14 billion every two years, according to a Legislative Budget Board chart published in 2012. So, the 2006 tax changes whomped the 1997 and 1999 cuts by the yardstick of projected state costs biennium by biennium. And, it appears, that $14 billion in intended relief also exceeded the $4.6 billion in relief predicted due to the Senate-passed proposals that Taylor described as record-setting. Taylor’s analysis We asked Taylor how he reached his conclusion. To our inquiry, Lonnie Dietz, Taylor’s chief of staff, said by email that Taylor relied on the comptroller’s 2015 report on tax changes since 1972 to gauge the legislated actions of 1997, 1999 and 2006. According to the report, Dietz noted, the school tax-rate cuts ordered in 2006 were projected to cost the state $3.9 billion through August 2007 and another $18.8 billion the next 24 months, money that would make up for lost local revenues due to the mandated rate cuts. Then again, the report said, the tax hikes approved to help fund those costs were predicted to generate more than $8 billion in the same period--making the 2006 actions a tax swap, not a pure cut, Dietz told us. Another thing: Dietz pointed out the lasting effect of the 2006 tax-rate action was to slow rather than reverse property tax increases. In 2008, a business group, the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, compared 2007 school property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without the legislated rate cut. The difference amounted to about $7 billion, it said. "The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative," the group said. Separately, the Texas Education Agency offered data to us in 2010 showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were down 30.2 percent in 2007 compared with what the state projected they would have been without the rate cuts. Then again, taxpayers don't typically compare their tax bills to what they might have paid but to what they actually paid last time. And why didn't school taxes fall more between 2005 and 2007? At the time, Dale Craymer, TTARA’s president, gave two major reasons. The first was a provision in the 2006 tax overhaul giving school boards the option of raising the maintenance and operations rate by a few cents for enrichment purposes. By 2007, more than 1,000 Texas school districts had done so. That lessened the impact of the mandatory 33 percent rate reduction in those districts. The second, most powerful factor, Craymer said, was rising property values. If values rise proportionately more than tax rates are cut, savings are negated and tax bills go up. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year. Dietz also suggested we set aside property tax relief for comparative purposes because such taxes are locally set. If you do set aside property tax actions, he said, it’s clear the Senate’s 2015 measures shrinking the business franchise tax alone--SB 7 and SB 8--have a two-year savings to businesses of nearly $2.48 billion, according to legislative fiscal notes. "So on its surface right there no other state tax cut in the history of Texas even approaches what the Senate passed with SB 7 and SB 8," Dietz wrote. The comptroller’s report lists about 10 instances of lawmakers revising the franchise tax from 1975 through 2013 including some expansions and hikes. There also were attempts to cut the tax or reduce who pays; none of those actions were projected to cut more state revenue from the franchise tax than the proposals celebrated by Taylor. Other views As we analyzed the senator’s statement, other questions arose. For instance: Biggest tax cut in history for whom? And: Biggest tax cut based on the impact over two years--or longer? The school property-tax reduction adopted in 1997, for instance, surely has cost the state much more than its initial two-year price tag. On the other hand, it doesn’t seem fair to compare many years of accumulated costs (and savings to homeowners) to the two-year expected impact of the latest Senate moves. We gathered other views. By email and telephone, Vance Ginn, an economist for the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, and Chris Bryan, spokesman for State Comptroller Glenn Hegar, each said the Senate-supported measures amount to the largest potential tax cuts in Texas history. Ginn stressed the 2006 school tax actions provided tax relief--stopping short of keeping taxes down. Like Dietz, he pointed out a chart in a December 2014 report by the state comptroller’s office indicating total school property tax collections decreased $2 billion in 2007 compared to the year before, but such taxes went up in 2008 and also increased all but one subsequent year through 2013. A school finance expert We shared Ginn’s message about total school property tax collections bouncing up after going down for just one year after the 2006 changes with school lobbyist Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency finance official. Wisnoski commented by email: "Come back in a year, and I would imagine the same could be said about the Senate’s property tax cut of 2015." He further speculated that likely increases in property values will outpace projected savings from the Senate plan (see his calculations here) leading him to predict no reduction in overall school property taxes levied for tax year 2015. "That is not to say that the additional exemption" for homesteads in the Senate plan "is trivial," Wisnoski wrote, "and I would never characterize it as anything other than a tax cut. But I don’t believe it to" be "larger than the 2006 rate reduction." The 2006 law, he wrote, ultimately reduced school maintenance and operation rates by at least 22 percent; the maximum allowed M&O rate is lately $1.17 per $100 valuation, he said, compared to the $1.50 per $100 valuation in 2006. And district rates are even lower in some districts, Wisnoski indicated. Even factoring in districts that impose the state’s maximum debt-related tax rate of another $0.50 per $100 valuation, he wrote, the lingering percentage rate reduction would remain around 16.5 percent. Footnote: Weeks after Taylor made his claim, Texas House members approved proposed cuts in sales and business franchise taxes projected to cost the state $4.9 billion ($300 million more than the Senate’s plans) over two years--about $2.3 billion from shaving the state sales tax rate and nearly $2.6 billion from shrinking the franchise tax. The legislative session ends June 1, 2015. Our ruling Taylor said he "helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the state Senate." Senate-approved proposals reducing the business franchise tax promise a record slash in that tax. But together, the Senate measures reducing franchise and property taxes by about $4.6 billion over two years, what Taylor highlighted, add up to less tax relief than the school property tax-rate reductions legislated in 2006, which cost the state $14 billion every two years. Homeowners might not notice those changes partly due to escalating values. Still, the state-imposed ceiling on school operations tax rates remains 22 percent lower than what was in place before.

pomt-02798	"The administration was kicking and screaming all the way with these sanctions being put in place (on Iran)."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/03/bob-corker/corker-said-congress-dragged-obama-kicking-and-scr/	The tentative nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by the Obama administration has met with wariness in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties press for tougher sanctions. Just hours after President Barack Obama announced the deal with Iran on Nov. 24, 2013, Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, expressed skepticism on Fox News Sunday. Among other things, Corker told host Chris Wallace that it was Congress, not Obama, that had pushed for the tough sanctions that forced Iran to the negotiating table. "Congress is what brought us here," he said. "The administration was kicking and screaming all the way with these sanctions being put in place." Corker’s comments turned out to be a GOP talking point. Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., told CNN the administration "opposed the Senate putting the key oil sanctions on Iran," while Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., also told CNN that "the president opposed the first round of sanctions." Is that the way it happened? Deal or no deal First, a quick explanation of the new deal. Iran has already surpassed enrichment levels necessary for nuclear power, leading the world to believe it is pursuing a weapon. The country has faced sanctions from the United States since 1979, with additional sanctions in recent decades by the United Nations and the European Union. A deal reached last month in Geneva between the U.S., Iran and five other world powers would open the door to easing those sanctions. It’s a complicated arrangement, but in exchange for easing some sanctions, Iran will agree to scale back or completely halt its nuclear weapons program. Under the deal, uranium that has been enriched beyond levels necessary for nuclear energy must be diluted or converted, and the country may continue to seek nuclear technologies for power. Iran must also open up its nuclear sites to frequent monitoring and inspections from the U.S. and United Nations. So far, Iran has already made enough progress that it would take just one or two months to reach weapons-grade enrichment levels if it wanted. The new deal would add weeks to that time frame. In exchange, Iran would receive between $6 billion and $7 billion in sanctions relief, more than half from oil revenue that’s currently frozen in foreign banks. The agreement is temporary and only lasts for six months. At that time, U.S. officials say the sanctions could be put back in place if Iran reneges on its side of the bargain. Corker’s comments What Corker said sounded a lot like a statement made by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in the 2012 vice presidential debate: "This administration has no credibility on this issue (Iran). It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress." At the time, we rated the statement Mostly False. And gave the same rating to similar comments made by Romney earlier in the presidential cycle. We asked Corker’s staff for evidence to back his claim, and they sent us a handful of articles from 2011 and 2012 that highlighted the tension between the White House and Congress on the best path to pressuring Iran to drop its nuclear weapons program. An article from Foreign Policy dated December 2011 noted that Obama had angered Democratic allies by coming out against a Senate compromise his administration had asked for. But a day later, the administration sang a different tune after the bill passed the Senate 100-0, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Despite its initial misgivings, the administration came to see the bill as useful in pressuring Iran, and came to support it "so as not to damage U.S. relations with partner countries," the CRS report said. The last bit is a key point and is a big reason why we gave Ryan a Mostly False in 2012. There has been frequent tension between Congress and the White House on how to proceed with Iran. Both have eyed tough sanctions, and under Obama the U.S. has in place the "most sweeping sanctions on Iran of virtually any country in the world," according to the Congressional Research Service. In fact, after three decades of sanctions, the U.S. has reached a point where there’s little left to ban going into and out of Iran. So it has instead sought to punish companies and countries that do business with Iran. But while Congress has pushed forward with a unilateral crackdown, Obama has asked for the flexibility to negotiate. In some instances, it would appear he used executive orders and signing statements to water down Congress’ attempts to pass tough sanctions. But when we looked at this question in 2012, a number of Iran experts told us that such episodes do not necessarily mean that Obama was showing weakness. Rather, it allowed him to negotiate with the European Union and countries like China to increase international pressure on Iran. Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, told PolitiFact last year that "flexibility is the watchword. … It's really hard to argue that this administration hasn't brought strong pressure to bear on Iran." At the time, James Jeffrey, a deputy national security adviser in the Bush administration and ambassador to Iraq and Turkey under Obama, said the back-and-forth between Congress and the executive branch is common, and while some may call Obama’s maneuvers as "watering down," others counter that they actually strengthened the U.S. position. For this article, we checked back with Jeffrey to see if he held the same opinion. He did. "The Obama administration has supported tougher sanctions against Iran consistently," Jeffrey said. "But on this or any other issue it will push for maximum flexibility with the Congress. Thanks to that pushing, it got authority to waive or suspend sanctions based on either countries' reducing oil imports, or a presidential national security waiver — not yet used, but probably necessary to uphold the ‘First Step’ (Geneva) agreement. Without — repeat — without these modifications, to the initial congressional effort, it would have been much more difficult to mobilize the international community." Our ruling Corker said that on Iran sanctions, "the administration was kicking and screaming all the way with these sanctions being put in place." Experts agree that the term "kicking and screaming" is a large exaggeration. There was wrangling between the executive and legislative branches to secure negotiating flexibility for Obama — flexibility that made it possible to get the international community on board with tougher sanctions. Corker ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Bob Corker	None	None	None	2013-12-03T13:49:43	2013-11-24	['Iran']

pomt-14603	The 2013 immigration bill "expanded President Obama’s ability to bring Syrian refugees to this country without mandating any meaningful background checks."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/03/ted-cruz/cruz-repeats-false-attack-about-gang-8-bill-allowi/	Fresh from his victory in Iowa, Ted Cruz faced his first group of New Hampshire voters at the Crossing Life Church in Windham, N.H. They asked him about many things, from protecting the rights of the disabled to the 2013 immigration bill, once backed by GOP rival Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. An audience member asked Cruz to clarify his immigration position. Cruz has taken heat for introducing an amendment to the bill to provide legal status to undocumented immigrants. Cruz defended that move as parliamentary maneuver to help defeat bad legislation; Rubio said it showed Cruz's actual postion. (S. 744 passed the Senate, with Cruz voting no, but wasn’t taken up in the House.) But in criticizing the original bill, Cruz noted a failing that would have special resonance today. "The bill expanded President Obama’s ability to bring Syrian refugees to this country without mandating any meaningful background checks," Cruz said. We checked a very similar assertion Cruz made in December during a GOP debate in Las Vegas. His case was thin then and remains so today. The Cruz campaign did not respond for a request for comment. In December, Cruz was a bit more absolute. He said the bill gave Obama "blanket authority" without "mandating any background checks whatsoever." In Windham, he said it expanded the president’s authority without "mandating any meaningful" background checks. The most recent version is more nuanced, but still inaccurate. The heart of the assertion is that the immigration bill would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless. That designation would identify people who had no country to which the United States could send them. If refugees fleeing Syria were called stateless, the argument was that they could be admitted without vetting. David Bier, the director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center, told us in December that the immigration bill specifically stated that all refugees would still be subject to background checks. The average screening time for refugees from across the globe is between a year to a year and a half, involving background checks, interviews and confirmation from several federal agencies. The "stateless" classification wouldn’t have been for refugees aiming to get into the United States, said Joanne Kelsey, the assistant director for advocacy at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps resettle refugees. She explained that only people who are already in the country would face this situation. Another part of the bill about specially designating certain groups of refugees, Section 3403, is an attempt to codify something called the Lautenberg Amendment, an immigration provision that has been in effect since 1989 and must be renewed each year. The amendment has traditionally been aimed at certain religious minorities. By law, refugees seeking asylum in the United States must prove they have a "well founded fear of persecution." Our expert sources said Section 3403 would have allowed the president to designate a group of interest to the United States as being persecuted as a whole. Think Christians in Syria or Yazidis in Iraq targeted by the Islamic State. Basically, it allows potential refugees to get in line faster. But instead of making individuals prove they are in danger, the threat would already be associated with their group, moving the rest of the screening process along. The bill’s aim was to streamline the vetting process for refugees, not get rid of it. "It doesn’t create refugees or allow more refugees to come to the United States," Bier said. "They would still be subject to the normal refugee limit. It would create no additional numbers, but would increase, perhaps, the eligible pool of applicants." The experts we reached all agreed that the immigration bill required background checks for refugees and to the extent that it gave the administration more flexibility, that leeway applied to people already in the country, not those seeking to get in. Our ruling Cruz said the failed immigration bill "expanded President Obama’s ability to bring Syrian refugees to this country without mandating any meaningful background checks." The key flaw with that assertion is the bill still required background checks for refugees. While there can be some debate over what constitutes a "meaningful" background check, the experts we reached said nothing would have directly changed the quality of the vetting performed on people attempting to enter the country.

pomt-06735	"The estimated savings of this (debt ceiling) deal only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/aug/29/bobby-scott/scott-says-debt-limit-deal-pays-half-bush-tax-cuts/	U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, was not pleased with the debt limit deal that became law earlier this month. He said the measure will lead to deep cuts to programs that help needy families, students and seniors while keeping George W. Bush-era tax cuts that benefit the middle-class and wealthy. Scott has long called for ending the tax reductions. "The estimated savings of this deal only pay for half of the cost of extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts for another decade," Scott said in an Aug. 1 news release. Do the savings in the debt deaI come to half the price of keeping the Bush tax cuts? We decided to check. First some background. The deal passed by Congress earlier this month expanded the nation’s debt limit to $16.4 trillion -- a $2.1 trillion increase the will give the federal government enough money to pay its bills until early 2013. The measure requires Congress to cut $2.4 trillion out of the budget over the next 10 years in order to meet or exceed the size of the debt ceiling increase. The deal calls for $900 billion in cuts up front. A recently appointed bipartisan deficit reduction panel is charged with finding an additional $1.5 trillion that could come from spending cuts and revenue hikes, though House Republicans could still block any move to increase taxes. If the committee deadlocks, there’s a trigger in the legislation that would enact $1.2 trillion of cuts to domestic and defense spending. So the total reduction would be at least $2.1 trillion and could as much as $2.4 trillion. Scott, in a phone interview, said he used the $2.1 trillion figure in his comparison of spending reductions to the 10-year cost of extending the Bush tax cuts. Jason Peuquest, a policy analyst with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Scott is justified in using the lower figure. "It seems the $2.1 (trillion) is what people are focusing on most because the goal of the super committee is backed up by this automatic trigger," he said. Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed. He said there is "at least an even chance" that the deficit panel will not reach an agreement, forcing the total of $2.1 trillion in spending reductions. The Bush tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003 and scheduled to expire in 2010. Congress, at the end of last year, extended them through 2012. Scott pointed us to Congressional Budget Office reports that say the total cost of keeping the tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion. Of that amount, $3.3 trillion comes from lost revenues and the cost of interest payments needed to service the additional debt caused by the tax relief. The remaining $600 billion is the cost of maintaining adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Bush tax cuts required many Americans who had once itemized their returns to pay the more expensive AMT. As a result, about 20 million Americans lost part or all of the benefits of the tax relief. Congress came to their aid by increasing AMT exemptions. Three analysts said it’s legitimate to lump together the expense of extending Bush tax cuts for 10 years with the costs related to increasing the Alternative Minimum Tax exemptions. "Back when the (initial Bush) tax cuts were in play, a lot of people thought they wouldn’t be given any of the benefits of the tax cuts because more people would be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax," Peuquet said. So let’s sum this up. Scott says spending cuts required by the recent debt-limit deal pay half the cost of maintaining the Bush tax cuts through 2020. Scott figures $2.1 trillion in spending reductions will result from the agreement. That’s the smallest amount of cuts Congress is required to make under the deal, but it’s a widely-used number because its set in stone. The CBO says the total cost of extending the Bush tax cuts through 2020 is $3.9 trillion. That means the spending cuts would equal 53.8 percent of the Bush tax cut costs through the end of the decade. It’s questionable whether the divided Congress will agree on a bipartisan package of spending cuts and revenue increases to achieve the maximum $2.4 trillion goal in debt savings. If it does, the savings over the decade would equal 61.5 percent of the cost of extending the Bush tax cuts. But three analysts said Scott’s use of the $2.1 trillion figure is solid. His claim lands close to a moving bull’s-eye and we rate it True.	None	Bobby Scott	None	None	None	2011-08-29T06:00:00	2011-08-01	['None']

pomt-14742	The Milwaukee County bus system has "among the highest fares in the nation."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/17/chris-larson/state-sen-chris-larson-mark-claim-about-milwaukee-/	State Sen. Chris Larson supported Chris Abele’s bid for the Milwaukee County executive post in 2011. Now, Larson is challenging the incumbent and trying to convince voters Abele’s time in office hasn’t been successful. Larson, a Milwaukee Democrat and former member of the County Board, appeared Nov. 22, 2015 on WISN-TV’s UpFront with Mike Gousha program and said he’s disappointed in Abele’s leadership. "He’s out of touch," Larson said. Gousha listed some of Abele’s successes and asked, "Does he get any credit for (the successes)?" Larson countered by attacking one of Abele’s main talking points -- transit. Larson said the Milwaukee County bus system has "among the highest fares in the nation." We recently checked Abele’s claim that since he took office "we have never raised" bus fares and "this year there’ll be a million more route-miles than there were five years ago." We rated the claim Mostly True. Budget documents show fares have been $2.25 since Abele took office in 2011 and route-miles are up by about 1 million. But Abele credited himself for the increased route miles, when many of them were the result of a settlement related to a lawsuit. So, fares have stayed at $2.25. But is Larson right that they are "among the highest fares in the nation"? National comparison The Milwaukee County Transit System charges a flat fare of $2.25 in cash for a one-way adult bus ticket. Patrons who get a Smart Card pay $1.75 per ride. Transfers are free. When asked for backup, Larson’s team sent a list with the one-way adult bus fare for 11 cities. In that comparison, only Pittsburgh was higher than Milwaukee County, charging $2.50 for a base fare that increases to $3.75 for longer trips. Two other cities -- Denver and Cleveland -- charge $2.25 per ride, the same as Milwaukee County. In 2016, fares in Denver will increase to $2.60. But is Larson cherry picking the data? When we reached out to the Milwaukee County Transit System for its take, officials compiled a list of 20 systems comparable in size to MCTS. That list showed seven transit systems with higher base fares than Milwaukee County. At the top was Pittsburgh, with fares in Seattle and the Twin Cities rounding out the top three, at fares of up to $3.25 and $3, respectively. Another four systems had rates above $2.25 for longer routes (matching Milwaukee County) or charged $1 for a transfer (something that is free in Milwaukee County). There is no great single resource for information of bus fares across the country and the fares are often change. One survey conducted by the American Public Transit Association in 2014 compares about 250 transit systems across the country, though some of its data is already outdated. At the time, nine cities on that list charged more than Milwaukee’s $2.25 cash fare. The highest fare -- in Nashville -- was $4 per ride. Our rating Larson said the Milwaukee County bus system has "among the highest fares in the nation." But the system’s’ $2.25 cash fare wasn’t at the top of a national comparison, with fares reaching as high as $4 per trip. And regular patrons who use a Smart Card are charged just $1.75 a ride, making the Milwaukee County bus system about on par with average costs. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06804	Says Republican recall challenger Jonathan Steitz "failed to pay his taxes."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/12/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/gop-recall-candidate-jonathan-steitz-failed-pay-hi/	The Greater Wisconsin Committee, a liberal group active in Wisconsin politics, has asserted itself in the historic state Senate recall campaigns. In the two remaining races, which will be decided Aug. 16, 2011, it has accused Republican challengers of not paying their taxes. In a North Woods race, the Madison-based group said tea party leader Kim Simac, who is running against Sen. Jim Holperin, D-Conover, "was delinquent paying her property taxes eight of the last nine years." We rated that claim True. The Greater Wisconsin Committee made a similar statement against Jonathan Steitz, a lawyer who is trying to oust Sen. Bob Wirch, D-Pleasant Prairie, in a Kenosha-based district in the state’s southeastern corner. A headline on a flier hat the group mailed to voters Aug. 4, 2011 says: "Jonathan Steitz failed to pay his taxes." The wording on that claim is much less specific than on the one against Simac. But we have been down a similar road before. In one of the six recall races decided Aug. 9, 2011, Democratic challenger and eventual winner Jessica King said during the campaign that Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, "didn’t pay" his state income taxes, in contrast to average voters who declared "we work hard, we pay our taxes." We ruled that statement Mostly False because in the years Hopper didn’t pay the taxes, he didn’t owe any. So, let’s dig into the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s claim that Steitz, who is making his first run for public office, "failed to pay his taxes." The flier that makes the claim contains a footnote, which cites a Kenosha County court case. Kirk Brown, spokesman for the committee, referred us to an online court summary of the case. The summary shows the state filed a tax warrant against Steitz in November 2003 for $1,875 plus $853 for interest and a penalty, for a total of more than $2,700. The summary also shows the warrant was paid off two months later. Brown said that was the only evidence the Greater Wisconsin Committee relied on in claiming that Steitz failed to pay taxes. Steitz campaign spokesman Dan Hunt said the tax warrant was issued because Steitz failed to make a sales tax payment in September 2002 for a business that he owned that staged events such as concerts. Hunt called it an oversight, saying most of the business’ work was done outside of Wisconsin, so Steitz did not have to regularly pay Wisconsin sales taxes. Hunt also said Steitz owed -- and paid -- a total of only $260, even though the court summary indicates he owed and paid more than 10 times that amount. We turned to Diane Hardt, a tax administrator with the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. She said she could not discuss a particular taxpayer, but she said tax warrants are issued only after a taxpayer has received more than one notification that a payment is owed and only after the taxpayer is given at least 60 days to pay. Hardt also said that when the department issues tax warrants, the amount of tax demanded of the taxpayer and reflected in court records is estimated and inflated, sometimes by as much as 10 times what ultimately is determined to be owed. Hardt said the department inflates its estimate of what will actually be owed in hopes of getting the taxpayer to respond quickly. Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter. The Greater Wisconsin Committee made a flat statement -- "Jonathan Steitz failed to pay his taxes." There is a basis for it in that nine years ago Steitz failed to make one monthly sales tax payment for a business he owned. But the claim leaves out important details -- namely, that he paid up two months later and there is no evidence he failed to pay other taxes. That fits our definition for Half True.

Trump faces a pending lawsuit against his eponymous Trump University. As a "recovering lawyer," Chabot wrote, "settle the damn case, and apologize to the judge." Earlier this month, Trump caused the GOP heartburn when he accused the federal judge over the case of being unfair because of his Mexican heritage. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, is a first-generation U.S. citizen, born in Indiana to Mexican parents. Chabot advised Trump to throw a blanket over his sticky legal situation ASAP, because, "when it comes to ripping off the public, you’re a piker compared to Hillary and Bill Clinton." (Definition of piker: a small-time gambler.) Chabot continued: Even the Obama Administration recognized the inherent conflict of interest issues with respect to the Clinton Foundation, and therefore recommended a ban on all contributions to the Foundation from foreign nations. The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and United Arab Emirates. We’re going to unpack that statement to see if the Clinton Foundation did violate a ban and accept millions. ‘Ban’ on foreign donations When the Obamas were prepping for their move into the White House in 2008, and Hillary Clinton was awaiting confirmation to the cabinet as secretary of state, Barack Obama’s Presidential Transitions Team and the CEO of the Clinton Foundation drew up a Memorandum of Understanding, with provisions to deal with conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts. In the memorandum, the foundation pledged to publish its contributions from 2008, ahead of Hillary Clinton’s confirmation as secretary of state. For the duration of Hillary Clinton’s service at the State Department, the memorandum said, the foundation would seek approval from the State Department’s ethics office before accepting donations from new foreign interests that hadn’t given in the past, or from past donors who upped their contributions from previous levels. Nowhere in the memorandum does the word "ban" appear. Memorandums of understanding are generally not legally binding. ‘Millions and millions?’ ‘Again and again?’ The Clinton Foundation accepted millions of dollars from Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Qatar and Oman, which was allowed under the terms of the memorandum because they were previous donors. Oman is the only country included in Chabot’s blogged complaint. According to the foundation’s website, the Sultanate of Oman donated between $1 million and $5 million while Clinton was at the State Department (the foundation discloses its funding in ranges). This donation was not prohibited by the memorandum. The Washington Post reported that the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia did not donate to the Clinton Foundation until after Clinton left the secretary of state’s post, in 2013. Our own reporting found the same thing. That leaves Algeria. Algeria! On Jan. 12, 2010, the day after a massive earthquake struck Haiti, Clinton Foundation officials admitted that they failed to seek State Department approval before accepting an unsolicited donation from the Embassy of Algeria of $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund. The foundation staff told us the foundation did not seek pre-approval in part because it did not have prior knowledge of Algeria’s intended contribution and in part because of the urgency of Haiti’s needs. The donation was disclosed on the foundation’s website. Our ruling Chabot wrote, "The Clintons violated that ban time and time again, and accepted millions and millions of dollars from governments like Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Oman and United Arab Emirates." The agreement, a memorandum of understanding, was not a ban. At the very least, the Clinton Foundation accepted $1.5 million from Algeria and Oman, and at most, $5.5 million. Oman’s donation was allowed under the memo’s terms, but Algeria’s was not. Is the amount likely "millions and millions?" Probably. The Clinton Foundation has accepted funds from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, too, but not while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. We rate his statement Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c643bdb6-f953-4775-afb7-95d0cfdb2227	None	Steve Chabot	None	None	None	2016-06-20T16:01:27	2016-06-08	['Saudi_Arabia', 'Oman', 'Algeria', 'United_Arab_Emirates', 'Clinton_Foundation']
pomt-03899	Says a majority of Americans -- and Republicans -- support his approach for deficit reduction.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-majority-american-people-agree-m/	The sequester lives, and it’s the Republicans’ fault, President Barack Obama told Americans on Friday. As blunt, broad spending cuts started their slow crawl across the federal government on March 1, 2013, the president said he just needed Republicans in Congress to "catch up to their own party and the country." That means an approach to deficit reduction that "asks something from everybody," he said, including raising tax revenue. Saying he believes Congress "can and must" replace the sequester’s cuts with "a more balanced approach," he added: "I don't think that's too much to ask. I don't think that is partisan. It's the kind of approach that I've proposed for two years. That's what I ran on last year. The majority of the American people agree with me and this approach, including, by the way, a majority of Republicans." Is that true? Do most Americans, including most Republicans, prefer to raise taxes and cut spending to address the deficit? Polls supporting the president We searched for public opinion polls to see if they supported the president’s declaration. The best evidence in Obama’s favor was a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and USA Today as the sequester loomed. Researchers talked with 1,504 adults across the country from Feb. 13-18, 2013. The survey found broad concern over the federal budget deficit — and support for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. To reduce the budget deficit, 19 percent said the president and Congress should focus only on spending cuts. Just 3 percent preferred only tax increases. A strong majority — 76 percent — sought a combination of both. What about "a majority of Republicans"? Here was the breakdown of support for a mixed approach by party: Democrats: 90 percent Republicans: 56 percent Independents: 76 percent So, yes, the poll shows that a majority of Republicans support both spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the deficit. A November 2012 poll from CNN/ORC International of 1,023 adults was in line with the Pew Center’s results. It asked, "If you had to choose, would you rather see Congress and President Obama agree to a budget plan that …" Only included cuts in government spending: 29 percent Or a budget plan that includes a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on higher-income Americans: 67 percent The party breakdown for the "combination" response? Democrats: 87 percent Republicans: 52 percent Independents: 60 percent Meanwhile, a Bloomberg News poll conducted Feb. 15-18 showed majority support for curbing the budget deficit "through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on companies and high earners, as the White House has proposed, rather than focusing exclusively on spending reductions, as Republicans assert," according to Bloomberg’s article. (We didn’t see the actual poll.) We also came across this Fox News poll, conducted by Republican and Democratic pollsters of 1,010 registered voters on Feb. 25-27. It asked, "In January, the president and Congress reached a budget agreement that raised tax rates on wealthy Americans and postponed making cuts to government spending. This time, would you prefer the budget deal reduces the deficit by focusing …" Only on cutting government spending: 33 percent Mostly on cutting spending, and a small number of tax increases: 19 percent On an equal mix of spending cuts and tax increases: 36 percent Only on adding further tax increases: 7 percent Don't know: 5 percent So, a majority of respondents, 55 percent, supported a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The results we saw didn’t break out responses by party. Polls that don’t address or undermine Obama’s claim We asked House Speaker John Boehner’s office if there were other polls we should consider. Press secretary Brendan Buck pointed us to an NBC/WSJ poll of 1,000 adults conducted Feb. 21-24. They were asked whether they supported the sequester’s automatic cuts, more cuts, or fewer cuts. A majority, 53 percent, either favored more cuts or the sequester’s automatic cuts, which Buck interpreted as support for Republicans’ cuts-only approach. But the poll didn’t ask respondents whether they wanted to see revenue as part of a deficit reduction plan. It focused on cuts only. Meanwhile, 50 percent agreed with the statement: "These spending cuts are too severe and will hurt our economy. The President and Congress need to find a way to reduce our deficit by working together to avoid this from happening." While 46 percent agreed with: "Washington has become too partisan and the President and Congress cannot reach an agreement on reducing our deficit. Allowing these spending cuts to go into place may not be perfect, but it is time for dramatic measures to reduce the deficit.** The poll results don’t directly support Obama’s claim. But they don’t undercut it, either. Buck also mentioned a survey from Rasmussen Reports, a survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 24-25. It asked, "Should the long-term federal budget deficit be reduced by cutting spending, by raising taxes, or combination of tax hikes and spending cuts?" Rasmussen’s respondents found cutting spending the most attractive approach, with 45 percent support. Just 6 percent, it said, supported raising taxes alone. So, a plurality supported the Republican approach of cutting spending only, while a minority supported Obama’s solution. It’s worth noting that some polling experts, such as the New York Times’ Nate Silver, have raised issues with Rasmussen’s methodology. Its "robopoll" strategy, which uses a digitally recorded voice to conduct interviews, showed a statistical bias toward Republicans in the 2010 and 2012 elections. Meanwhile, Pew’s work in 2012 was more favorable toward Obama than the pollster consensus (though Silver hasn’t raised issues with Pew, which he says he respects). Buck also mentioned a survey from Republican polling firm Winston Group, but beyond the poll’s conservative phrasing, it had the same issue as the NBC/WSJ poll — it didn’t offer respondents the choice of a mixed approach to replacing the sequester. It asked registered voters only whether they preferred Republican spending cuts or Democratic revenue increases or sequester delay. They favored Republican spending cuts over Democratic revenue increases by 52 percent to 40 percent. One other way the president doesn’t enjoy majority support: Just a plurality of Americans, rather than a majority, wanted Congress to pass legislation to avoid the sequester, according to Gallup. Our ruling Obama said of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that "the majority of the American people agree with me and this approach, including, by the way, a majority of Republicans." We found two polls that supported his statement in its entirety, several polls that supported at least the first half, and polls from Rasmussen and Republican pollster Winston Group presented more of a mixed picture. The majority of the polls we found support the president. We rate the president’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08735	McDonald's in England only sells organic milk and free-range eggs, which provides more nutritious offerings than in the U.S.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/31/jamie-oliver/chef-jamie-oliver-praises-mcdonalds-england/	Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is a well-known crusader for healthier eating. So it may have come as a surprise to hear him give a shout-out on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Aug. 29, 2010, to the fast-food giant McDonald's -- or at least the restaurants in his homeland, England. Oliver, AKA the Naked Chef, is perhaps best known to American audiences for his Emmy-winning reality program Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution on ABC, in which he tried to transform the eating habits of the residents of Huntington, W.Va., statistically one of the unhealthiest cities in the country. On ABC's This Week, Oliver said the food revolution is about giving people the tools to make good, nutritious choices. But host Christiane Amanpour asked Oliver to respond to a comment David Letterman made to him when he appeared on the Late Show: "Try as hard as you might, you're never going to succeed, because we are living in a culture dominated by the commerce of selling food which is inherently unhealthy," Letterman said. Said Oliver: "In the one way, he's right. You know, the structure of commerce and food in America is so intertwined in broadcast, print media, advertising, TV. I think that the problem we have to have -- and it's an interesting one. I'll throw it back at you. Like fast food I've hated for many years. And the last two years, I like stopped. And I actually now start to see (fast food chains) ironically as part of the solution. "Now, I'll give you -- I'll give you one brand, like McDonald's. McDonald's, in England, has had its best three years ever, profitability. It only sells organic milk, free range eggs. You know, it's got an incredible standard of beef. And their ethics is really ... moving. But that's nothing like the one in the States. And the only distinguishing part is the public and what they expect." Part of the allure of McDonald's is its uniformity, that a Big Mac in New York will be the same as one in London. And so we wondered if Oliver was right that McDonald's restaurants in England really "only sell organic milk" and "free range eggs," and that, by implication, they are dramatically different and more healthy than McDonald's restaurants in the United States. We made queries with McDonald's officials in the U.S. and Britain, and neither responded, but we were able to piece together the pertinent facts from company web pages and documents. Let's break this into two parts. First, do McDonald's restaurants in England "only sell" organic milk? According to the McDonald's UK website, all of the bottled milk offered for sale in UK McDonald's (most of it sold along with kids' meals) is "semi-skimmed organic." In 2007, McDonald's UK made an even bigger commitment to organic milk, announcing that all the milk served with the teas and coffees it sells in 1,200 outlets in the UK will come from organic British cows. The company said organic farmers who supply McDonald's "don't use (genetically modified) feed or artificial pesticides in fields where their cows graze." Media reports suggested McDonald's alone could account for 5 percent of the UK’s organic milk supplies. Organic milk is not, however, used in milkshakes in the British stores. According to the website, "Organic milk is still a relatively small industry in the UK and McDonald's simply can't find a supplier that can meet the high volume demands. The company is in talks with the dairy industry about how it can facilitate more farmers switching to organic but, until the organic food supply chain can guarantee that it can supply the required amount, McFlurries, Sundaes and Milkshakes will continue to be made from non-organic milk from the British Isles." (In the U.S., McDonald's does not use organic milk.) Second, do McDonald's restaurants in England only use free-range eggs (meaning, eggs that come from hens that are not in cages and are free to roam outside)? McDonald's does, and the move generated quite a bit of positive press for McDonald's, including a "Good Egg" award from Compassion in World Farming in recognition of McDonald's Europe committing to using 100 percent free-range, cage-free eggs in all locations in the European Union by the end of this year. "We’re thrilled to be awarding such a well-known company for moving to cage-free eggs across the whole of Europe," said Dr. Lesley Lambert, Director of Research & Food Policy at Compassion in World Farming, in a press release for the award. "McDonald’s decision will benefit huge numbers of farm birds. By choosing to do the right thing on eggs across Europe, McDonald’s has shown great leadership on an issue which many consumers feel strongly about." McDonald's in the United States, however, has not embraced a similar switch. In April, the Humane Society of the United States (which owns stock in McDonald's USA) proposed to shareholders that the company switch 5 percent of the eggs it purchases for its U.S. locations to "cage-free" eggs by January 2011. The Board of Directors recommended against the switch, saying it would not be in the best interest of shareholders. "As we have examined this issue over the years, we have determined that there is no agreement in the global scientific community about how to balance the advantages and disadvantages of laying hen housing systems," the board wrote in a proxy statement. "Cage-free systems, for instance, allow birds to exhibit more natural behaviors, but may pose more risk with regard to the spread of infectious diseases. Furthermore, there seems to be a significant gap in scientific knowledge related to a wide range of sustainability impacts of laying hen housing—environmental impact, food safety, worker safety, animal health and well-being, and food affordability." According to a New York Times story about the proposal in May 2009, "McDonald’s USA announced its participation in a coalition with leading animal welfare scientists, academics, non-governmental organizations, such as the American Humane Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association, food manufacturers, egg suppliers and other retail companies to study housing alternatives for egg-laying hens in the U.S. The study will look at the sustainability impacts of different laying hen housing options, including cage-free aviary housing, enriched housing (which includes nests and perches) and conventional caged housing systems (currently used by the vast majority of the contemporary U.S. food supply system)." Paul Shapiro, senior director of the Humane Society’s factory farming campaign, said McDonald's has been "looking into" the issue for years. "There is a dramatic difference between the two companies (McDonald's in the U.S. versus the U.K.) with regard to animal welfare," Shapiro said. In April, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s, Lisa McComb, told the New York Times the disparity was due to the high consumer demand for cage-free eggs in Europe and a more robust cage-free egg production infrastructure there. Oliver doesn't explicitly argue the U.K. McDonald's restaurants offer more nutritious food, but given Amanpour's question -- and the topic of the segment -- we think many people would be left with that impression. So is it true that the organic milk and free-range eggs mean healthier food than in the U.S.? "No, that would not reliably mean better nutrition," said Dr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at the Yale University School of Medicine. "It appeals to the popular sentiment, without changing much about the food." One can make a case that using "cage-free" hens is more humane to the animals, Katz said, but that doesn't directly correlate to better nutrition for consumers (though it may reduce the risk of bacterial infection). As for using organic skim milk, Katz said there is definitely value, health-wise, to using fat-free milk. But the nutritional value of organic milk versus non-organic is unproven, he said. "I am a proponent of organic dairy," Katz said. "But there is no definitive evidence that organic means better health value in people. I think there's probably a potentially small movement in nutritional value. But there is a much larger movement in public perception." Katz said McDonald's could take much more meaningful steps to improve the nutritional value of its food, for example, by changing to whole wheat bread in buns or making the burgers lower in saturated fat. But just switching to organic milk and using free-range eggs doesn't much alter the nutritional value of McDonald's meals, he said. As for Oliver's comment, he's correct that McDonald's in England uses organic milk. Organic milk is served with coffee and tea, and for bottled milk. But Oliver was off a bit when he said it "only uses" organic milk. The British McDonald's stores still use non-organic milk in milkshakes. Oliver was on the mark when he noted that in the U.K., McDonald's uses only free-range eggs, while they are not used in the U.S. But when Oliver said McDonald's in England is "nothing like" the U.S. one, he implies the policies in England translate to substantially more nutritional food offerings. While the U.K. policies have drawn praise from animal rights groups, experts say it's a stretch to say they translate to better nutrition. And so we rule Oliver's claim Half True.

pomt-14698	"We are taking Virginia’s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth’s history."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/11/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffes-claim-record-school-budget-dubious/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe says his two-year state budget proposal would bestow unprecedented riches on Virginia’s public schools. "Ladies and gentlemen, we are taking Virginia’s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth’s history," he said on Dec. 17 as he introduced his budget to the General Assembly’s money committees. "We’re not only setting a record in total state spending on education; we’re also pushing up our per-pupil contribution to $5,446 in 2018," McAuliffe added. "Again, this is the highest level of student support in our history." We wondered whether the governor’s budget truly would be a record breaker for public schools, which suffered deep state cuts during the most recent recession and have struggled for years to regain those funds. Raw dollars Christina Nuckols, McAuliffe’s deputy press secretary, sent us a chart detailing total state aid for schools and per-pupil funding from 2001 through the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. The chart also carried forward those figures for each of the next two fiscal years in the governor’s biennial budget proposal. In raw dollars, McAuliffe’s overall school budget would exceed the record $6.45 billion being spent during the current school year. lt would raise education spending to $6.54 billion next school year and to $6.82 billion during the 2017-18 term. Many of those new dollars, if matched by local school systems, would fund about 2,500 new instructional jobs over the biennium and a 2 percent pay raise for teachers in July 2017. In raw dollars, the governor’s spending plan also would break the state record of funding $5,248 per student - set during the 2008-09 school year in the last budget that was approved before the recession decimated revenues. McAuliffe’s budget would increase that level to $5,251 in 2016-17. The following school year, it would rise to $5,446. What about inflation? There’s a problem with comparing historic spending levels in terms of the raw money that was spent each year: A dollar spent today or in the future doesn’t buy as much as a buck spent in the past. So we took a more meaningful look at whether McAuliffe's plan, when adjusted for inflation, would remain the richest school budget in Virginia history. The governor’s claim failed this test. We adjusted each of the education budgets since 2001 to 2015 dollars, using inflation data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Under these measurements, the high-water mark came in the 2008-09 school year, when the state spent an adjusted $6.96 billion on public education. That figure exceeds the peak $6.83 billion expenditure - in raw dollars - in McAuliffe’s 2017-18 budget. And the governor’s outlay drops further in the rankings when it’s adjusted for inflation. Financial forecasters generally are predicting annual 2 percent inflation rates for the next few years. If that proves accurate, then the adjusted dollars in McAuliffe’s peak education budget in 2017-18 would fall below the inflation-revised level of three state budgets that were in effect from July 2006 through June 2009. We applied the same inflation adjustments to per-pupil spending, which is the gold standard in evaluating education budgets because it takes into account Virginia’s rising enrollments. The glory years for state spending per student once again occurred during the budgets that were in effect from July 2006 to June 2009. Virginia, in adjusted 2015 dollars, spent $5,524 to $5,825 per pupil during those school years. McAuliffe’s peak proposal of $5,446 per student doesn’t rise to that level in raw dollars and falls further when adjusted for inflation. Our ruling "We are taking Virginia’s investment in public education to the highest level in the commonwealth’s history," McAuliffe said last month. In raw dollars, the governor’s proposed budget would set state records for overall education spending and per-student outlays. But this is a misleading way of comparing spending levels, because raw dollars lose value over time. A meaningful comparison of historic spending levels requires that the figures be adjusted for inflation. When that’s done, the governor’s education budget does not rise to the levels reached one to three years before the most recent recession. So we rate the governor’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-02078	A proposed amendment "allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/may/22/dont-let-florida-go-pot/medical-marijuana-amendment-allows-teenager-get-re/	Family Feud time! Today’s question: Name something most teenagers cannot do. Vote? Ding! See R-rated movies alone? Ding! Buy beer? Ding! Score some weed without a hitch under Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment? BUZZZZ! An anti-marijuana coalition operating the website DontLetFloridaGoToPot.com has claimed as much. Among the talking points was the assertion, "The amendment allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent." There’s already plenty of debate over the legalities of Amendment 2, which is on the November ballot. But can teens easily score a nickel bag solo should it pass? We’ll have to take our own survey and see what it says. A minor hitch Amendment 2 calls for the state to allow patients with cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and unspecified "other conditions" to obtain medical marijuana with a doctor’s written recommendation. Technically, the physicians won’t write prescriptions, because marijuana would still be illegal under federal law. If 60 percent of voters ratify the amendment, the state must set up a dispensary system and write regulations for growing and selling the drug. The Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot website lists more than 40 "coalition partners." The Orlando Sentinel reported the site is run by Save Our Society From Drugs, a St. Petersburg-based lobbying group, and the Florida Sheriffs Association. The sheriffs association’s tax status prevents it from actively lobbying for people to vote against Amendment 2, but the group publicly opposes the measure. The sheriff’s association and Save Our Society did not answer our questions about why they think teens will be free to roll up spliffs without asking mom and dad first. Others have complained the measure’s language doesn’t set a minimum age, and therefore targets minors. But the vague amendment language is by design, according to the organization behind the amendment. United for Care attorney Jon Mills told PolitiFact Florida that by not addressing the age issue, a topic that was discussed while drafting the proposal, the amendment allows state law to take precedent on the issue of age. Currently, a parent or guardian must provide consent for medical treatment for a minor, except in emergencies or other unusual circumstances, such as when the Department of Children and Family Services must get involved. The absence of an age limit is to allow the state freedom to write the rules as they see fit, should the amendment pass and become part of the state Constitution. "If we put a minimum age in we’d never be able to modify it," Mills said, referring to how the amendment will change the state’s Constitution, rather than creating a new statute, as many medical marijuana states do. There are 21 states with laws that allow medical cannabis. Only three (California, Washington and Massachusetts) make no mention of minors in their language, as in the Florida amendment. Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors measures to allow medical marijuana, said all three still require parental involvement in some way. Minnesota, which will soon be the 22nd state to allow it, also doesn’t include language about children. Three other states (Connecticut, Delaware and Illinois) specifically exclude allowing minors to use the drug -- and Illinois is on the brink of changing its law concerning kids. The other 15 allow children access to the drug to some degree but only with parental consent. "In Florida, I think there is no way that minors will actually ultimately be allowed to sign up for medical marijuana without their parent or guardian’s support. In fact, the rules may be even more strict than they are in most states," O’Keefe said. She compared Amendment 2 to Massachusetts’ 2012 law, which didn’t mention minors. The state ended up heavily regulating use by children. Vanderbilt Law School professor Robert Mikos pointed out that any teenager would have to go through the same vetting process as adults. That means they would undergo whatever examination, registration and regulation process the state creates. "Does this mean a 13-year-old could just go in and get a certification? That’s not the case in any state," he said. "There’s nothing about the Florida proposal that says Florida would be worse than any other state." So if concerns about minors are unfounded, could Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot potentially mean 18- or 19-year-olds? They’re technically teenagers. Mikos says if that’s what Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot is saying, "it’s a very misleading statement meant to scare people." He points out that 18-year-olds are allowed to buy tobacco and are allowed prescriptions to Oxycontin, so marijuana probably shouldn’t be treated any differently. Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor who edits a marijuana policy blog, says the opposition’s concern about teen use could possibly be better illustrated by the possibility of those older teens exploiting the system. "There’s nothing in this to stop college kids on spring break to go into the doctor’s office and saying, ‘My back hurts,’ and getting some, not for medicinal purposes, but because they want to have fun," Berman said. But focusing on that angle in medical legislation is a dubious argument. "There’s nothing else in medicine that we go to a 19-year-old and say, ‘Hey, you need your parents’ permission," Berman added. Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot says "the amendment allows a teenager to get a recommendation for medical marijuana without the consent of a parent." The group didn’t offer us any specifics on what it meant. The amendment is actually silent on the issue of minors. The proposal’s framers say they specifically didn’t include minors in its language in order to let state law reign supreme. Policy experts said state regulations usually dictate parental consent is necessary, and there’s no reason to think Florida would be any different. We should note that in all probability, 18- and 19-year-olds would have access like any other adult. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-01007	The streetcar project proposed for downtown Milwaukee "would actually take precious revenue away" from the Milwaukee Public Schools.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/03/joe-davis-sr/ald-joe-davis-claims-streetcar-project-would-hurt-/	A key opponent of Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s plan for a $123.9 million downtown streetcar is criticizing the project by saying it would hurt Milwaukee Public Schools. Ald. Joe Davis Sr., who is running for mayor in the 2016 election, had this to say in a YouTube video: The streetcar would "actually take precious revenue away from one of the taxing industries which I truly care about, and that is the Milwaukee Public School system." We haven’t heard the phrase "taxing industry" before, but we have heard variations of the claim. Would the streetcar project "take precious revenue away" from MPS? The money picture Let’s start with where the money is coming from to build the controversial project (the budget for operating it is a separate question). The primary source of funding is a $55 million federal grant. The city hopes for another $10 million from the feds. The remainder would come from various taxing districts, including $9.7 million that has already been authorized by the Common Council. Barrett wants to borrow another $49.3 million that would be repaid through two Tax Incremental Districts, or TIDS. The districts typically work like this: The city pays for infrastructure improvements, such as new or reconfigured roads or site preparation to help assure a development takes place. The money the city borrows is repaid through taxes generated by the increased value of properties within the district. Once the borrowing is paid off, the value of the land is added to the general tax rolls. Under Barrett’s plan, some of the streetcar borrowing ($31 million) would be rolled into a new TID -- No. 82 -- near downtown's lakefront that would also include the proposed Couture high rise project. The rest ($18.3 million) would come from an existing TID -- No. 56 -- on E. Erie St. in the Historic Third Ward. Here’s the catch: The borrowing from that second TID is nearly paid off. So, instead of that money going to the general tax rolls, the life of the district would be extended and the money from the increased property taxes would go to repay the streetcar borrowing. That makes this district central to Davis’ argument. After all, when property is tied up in a district, none of the other taxing units -- such as MPS and Milwaukee County -- can collect money based on the increasing value. Indeed, when we asked Davis for backup, he responded with an email linking to a Jan. 7, 2015 memo from the city’s Legislative Reference Bureau, which does research on issues for the Common Council. The memo says "total estimated property tax deferrals for all taxing entities" from the two tax districts that would help fund the streetcar would be $104 million, and says the MPS portion of that sum is $40 million. We’re already heading down the wrong track. In the video, Davis said the project would take revenue away from MPS. The memo talks about property tax deferrals from tax districts. That phrasing sounds like it would be money otherwise collected by MPS. In reality, that $40 million represents the MPS "share" of the projected increased overall property value within the districts. It is MPS’ ability to draw on this value to collect taxes that would be "deferred." No matter how you characterize it, there isn’t money currently flowing to MPS that will be choked off by the streetcar. Additionally, by law, tax money being collected through a TID can’t be used for other purposes such as police or, for that matter, other taxing entities such as MPS. Indeed, on Feb. 3, 2014, the Legislative Reference Bureau retracted the earlier memo saying it was based on "inaccurate assertions and incomplete analysis" and that the analysis had "misinformed and become a distraction from this important policy debate." Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said Davis is "wrong on several counts." "As debt is incurred to fund TID improvements, those bonds are repaid with the incremental property tax revenue that comes from the new increased value of the TID," Berry said in an email. "Other units of government would never have received that money anyway, because without (the district) there would be no increased value." Indeed, Berry said, the opposite of Davis’ claim might be the case -- if a district works as planned. "In the long run, schools, etc. will get more money than they would otherwise have received" because those entities will eventually have a larger tax base, he said. We also asked MPS about the impact of tax districts on revenue. The "districts do not directly impact MPS' revenue authority under the funding rules for K-12 education," said MPS spokesman Tony Tagilavia. Davis did not respond to emails or telephone messages seeking an interview on the matter. More to consider There is another wrinkle to Davis’ claim. For the new TID, the one surrounding the Couture development, Berry’s argument clearly holds true. The development is contingent on the TID. And there are no new taxes generated without the increased value from the development. But what about the second, existing TID -- the one about to go back onto the tax rolls? Wouldn’t that money otherwise go to MPS and the other taxing entities? Yes and no. The increased value would be added to the city’s overall property tax base, which MPS and the other entities draw upon. But the amount collected in taxes for schools is driven by the MPS budget and the spending plan from the School Board. That is, once MPS and the other taxing entities set their annual budgets, the portion to be collected from property taxes is simply divided into the city’s overall property base. This sets the annual tax rate, which in turn creates the tax bills. As such, there may be more capacity for MPS to collect taxes -- but other factors, including state-imposed property tax caps play a role in how much of that new, increased tax base MPS can tap. A separate memo -- in response to the one from the Legislative Reference Bureau -- made this very point. That memo was written Jan. 8, 2015 by city budget director Mark Nicolini and Assessment Commissioner Mary Reavey, both part of Barrett’s administration. "There are no ‘property tax deferrals’ nor any other automatic revenue growth that occurs when TIDs are closed," the memo said. A final footnote: The city currently has 45 active taxing districts, with some performing better than others. Twice in the past the city has redirected revenue from the high-performing TID 56 -- the one slated to be redirected to the streetcar -- to bolster "neighborhood-based" TIDs in the central city. In all, about $10.5 million has gone to this purpose. Davis voted in favor of those previous changes to TID 56, as well as in favor of about $225 million in projects using the same kind of tax district funding, council records show. Our rating Davis says the streetcar project would take revenue away from Milwaukee Public Schools. He bases his argument on the use of two tax financing districts that would help pay for the streetcar project. From a technical perspective, he is off base. Taxes generated on additional development in the tax districts would go -- by law -- to the designated use until the borrowing is paid off. And once the districts close, it still wouldn’t be direct revenue for the schools. Rather, it’s additional tax base. From our perspective, that does lend some credibility to Davis claim. If the increased value went onto the overall tax rolls, all property taxpayers in the city would benefit. And, in theory, MPS could collect more without taking a bigger bite out of the pocketbooks of property owners. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-12364	"Nearly $2 billion in cash was flown over to Iran, money that the Obama administration has admitted is being used for terrorists and to support further activities there."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/jun/06/karen-handel/Handel-pushes-details-Iran-deal-terror-support/	All politics might be local but foreign policy dominated the open of the televised debate in the Georgia congressional race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel. Asked about Iran and the Barack Obama-era deal that was designed to put the brakes on its nuclear program, Handel said, "Nearly $2 billion in cash was flown over to Iran, money that the Obama administration has admitted is being used for terrorists and to support further activities there." We decided to fact-check Handel’s claim. Iran nuclear deal The Iran deal focused on reducing Iran’s stockpiles of nuclear-grade material, but a key provision unlocked Iranian assets that had been frozen for decades. How much money was there is a matter of debate. The U.S. Treasury Department estimated the value of Iran’s foreign currency reserves at $100 billion. An article in Foreign Policy magazine cited $120 billion. The Institute of International Finance, a trade association representing banks, insurance companies and other financial entities worldwide, ran its own numbers and settled on $100 billion. Handel’s $2 billion Handel’s staff pointed to a March 17, 2016, letter from the U.S. State Department saying Iran had received about $1.7 billion as part of the nuclear agreement. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but then the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered. In August 2016, many news organizations reported the delivery of $400 million of that $1.7 billion in cash. As part of that exchange, an unmarked cargo plane delivered the money after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran. Given the isolation of Iran’s banking system, it is possible that the payment was made in cash and flown to Iran, but neither we nor Handel’s staff could point to any report that said that definitely took place. Money for terrorism The idea that the Obama administration admitted that the money is being spent on terrorists comes from something then-Secretary of State John Kerry said in an interview. Kerry told CNBC’s Squawk Box in January 2016 that Iran could spend the unfrozen assets however it wanted. "I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists," Kerry said. "To some degree, I’m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented." The IRGC, as Iran’s premier security institution, fields an army, navy and air force and "presides over a vast power structure with influence over almost every aspect of Iranian life," according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the IRGC’s elite Quds Force a terrorist supporter for aiding the Taliban and other terrorist organizations. So, Kerry was saying some of the money ultimately would end up with organizations involved in terrorism. That’s not quite the same as saying all of the money would go for terrorists and activities to support terrorism as Handel said. Iran has many needs, including rebuilding aging infrastructure. Kerry did tell reporters the same day, according to the Associated Press, that he understands the IRGC is "already complaining that they are not getting the money." Our ruling Handel said the Obama administration admitted that nearly $2 billion flown to Iran is being used to fund terrorism and various supporting activities. She is more specific than the record supports. One way or another, the United States transferred $1.7 billion owed to Iran. As for what the administration admitted, Kerry said it was likely that some portion of any money Iran received would go to its top security organization and some of that money would end up advancing terrorism. Beyond that general statement, details are lacking. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08092	The tax cut deal is giving "$700 billion to millionaires and billionaires."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/15/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-overstates-amount-millionaires-a/	The rich are different from you and me. With apologies to F. Scott Fitzgerald, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown has been prone recently to talk about the rich. They tend to want tax breaks. To be more precise, Republicans want lavish tax breaks for their rich constituents, says Brown, an Ohio Democrat. And some of these breaks go too far, says Brown, citing the recent deal to extend all Bush-era tax breaks, which President Barack Obama and congressional Republican leaders announced on Dec. 6. Three days after that announcement, Brown told Kathleen Parker and Eliot Spitzer on CNN, "You know basically what we're doing here is we're borrowing $700 billion from the Chinese. We're charging it to our kids’ and grandkids' credit cards for them to pay off later and then we're giving that $700 billion to millionaires and billionaires." That’s a lot of money, even for billionaires, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. We’re not here to ask whether whether it’s fair or whether it will trickle down and help the economy. We’re asking something more basic: Will there really be $700 billion worth of tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires? A short answer: No. That’s because Brown’s figure is loaded with an assumption and a rhetorical flourish. The assumption is that the top income tax bracket for people with high incomes will remain at 35 percent for 10 more years. That’s roughly what it would take for the tax cuts for the nation’s top 2 percent of earners to reach a cost of $700 billion, according to projections in August by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Republicans at the time were pushing for a permanent extension of all the cuts that Congress passed in 2001 and 2003, and tax writers in the House of Representatives asked the joint committee to run a cost projection. The problem with using that figure now is that the Obama-GOP deal, and the resulting tax package that Congress could approve this week, calls for extending the tax breaks for only two more years. A 10-year extension is not on the table. It is true, as Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak notes, that Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and other economic advisers used the $700 billion figure as recently as September. They sounded a lot like Brown. But that was before the White House cut the two-year extension deal. What figure should Brown have used? The answer depends on the rhetorical flourish we mentioned, which is this: That $700 billion figure for ten years includes a whole lot of people who are neither millionaires nor billionaires. The figure, in fact, includes all single filers earning more than $200,000 a year and joint filers earning more than $250,000. If you added up all the tax filers expected to report incomes of more than $200,000 in 2012, you’d get 7.5 million people, according to a rough calculation using figures from the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. But out of that 7.5 million people, only 531,000 would be from people with incomes of $1 million or more. So the figure used by Brown -- and previously used by others -- includes "millionaires, billionaires and a whole bunch of people with incomes below that," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Using a slightly different technical perspective, the Joint Committee on Taxation said that out of 161 million tax filers nationwide, 315,000 earn at least $1 million. People earning less than that can be considered millionaires, of course, because of their home values, investments and net worth. But to call a two-earner couple making $251,000 "millionaires and billionaires" exaggerates matters, and the $700 billion projection that Brown used never included such an assumption. So if the cost is not $700 billion for millionaires and billionaires, what is it? The Joint Committee projections earlier this year showed that a single year of extensions for just the $1 million-and-above filers would cost $32.7 billion. Run out over 10 years, that would come to $327 billion, although this is a rough estimate because the number of filers and their incomes and deductions can vary year to year. The best estimate available comes from Joint Committee projections released on Dec. 10, a day after Brown spoke on CNN. They show the cost of retaining both the 33 percent tax bracket and the 35 percent bracket for two more years would come to $60.7 billion. This, too, covers a lot more people than millionaires and billionaires. There is a chance that the two-year deal will be extended again in 2012. Obama, who is up for re-election that year, has not said as much, but Spitzer suggested it to Brown on CNN, and Brown agreed. "Nobody really believes this is only a two-year extension of middle class tax cuts or the payroll tax holiday or the income tax cut or frankly the estate tax cut," Brown said. "I don't think anybody thinks that's only a two-year extension. I think it's well into the future. Who knows how to predict, five or 10 years out?" But he did know how to project, and he chose 10 years. How to rate Brown’s statement, then? His $700 billion cost figure certainly was used by the Obama White House when rejecting another 10 years worth of tax cuts for top earners. Yet by the time Brown appeared on CNN (three days after the administration announced the compromise), the deal was for two years, and it was that very deal that Brown went on the air to criticize. Even if the deal had been for 10 years, Brown misapplied the cost figure by describing the whole $700 billion as going to millionaires and billionaires. Joint Committee projections from earlier this year estimated that cost would be more like $327 billion over 10 years. Those are two key points on which Brown’s statement simply is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his statement False.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2010-12-15T06:00:00	2010-12-09	['None']

pomt-15091	"We're the only major oil-producing nation in the world with a self-imposed ban on exporting our crude oil to other nations."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/17/barry-duval/barry-duval-says-us-only-major-oil-producer-bans-c/	Barry DuVal, president and CEO of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, says it’s time for the U.S. to scrap its 40-year-old ban on exporting domestic oil. "We’re the only major oil-producing nation in the world with a self-imposed ban on exporting our crude oil to other nations," DuVal said in an Aug. 25 radio interview on "The John Fredericks Show," a Hampton Roads-based broadcast. We wondered whether DuVal was correct. Chamber spokesman Paul Logan backed the statement by pointing us to an Aug. 11 editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that made a similar statement. Logan provided no other materials, so we did some digging on our own. The export ban The U.S. put the ban in place in 1975, two years after an embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries halted crude oil deliveries to the United States. Adam Sieminski, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, told Congress last December that the embargo seriously curtailed U.S. oil imports and highlighted U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The export ban covers the vast majority of crude oil produced in the U.S. -- but it’s not an absolute prohibition. For example, it doesn’t bar crude exports to Canada as long as the oil is used in that country. There are other exemptions as well. Some heavy crude produced in California, for example, is not subject to the ban, according to the U.S. Bureau of Security and Industry. The U.S. exported 401,000 barrels of crude oil a day, most of it to Canada, in July 2014, according to the Congressional Research Service. That month, EIA figures show the U.S. produced almost 8.8 million barrels of crude daily. We should also note that although the ban affects raw crude oil, it does not prohibit export of "refined" petroleum products, such as gasoline. There have been several unsuccessful congressional attempts to lift the ban in recent years in the wake of rising U.S. oil production. Amid the shale fracking boom, production increased from 5.4 million barrels a day in 2009 to 8.7 million barrels a day last year, according to EIA statistics. Efforts to lift the ban are ongoing. On Sept. 10, a House Energy and Power subcommittee approved a bill that would end the prohibition. Is the U.S. ban unique? EIA officials told us they weren’t aware of any other country with an export ban similar to the U.S. ban. But they stressed they couldn’t provide a definitive answer on whether the U.S. is the only nation among major oil producers that has such a limitation. So we turned to a couple of energy market analysts for further insight. Kenneth B. Medlock, senior director at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, told us in an email that DuVal’s statement is correct. "The US is the only major producing country that does not allow exports of raw crude oil," he wrote in an email. Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow at the Energy Security and Climate Initiative at the Brookings Institution, also told us the U.S. is alone among major oil-producing countries in having the export ban. American Petroleum Institute, which supports scrapping the export ban, released a report this month saying "the U.S. and China are the only major oil producers in the world that don’t export a significant amount of crude." Ebinger, who also backs lifting the U.S. ban, says China’s tiny export of oil is not caused by a national ban. Instead, the low export is driven by high internal demand for oil within the nation, he said. Our ruling DuVal said the U.S. is the only major oil-producing nation in the world that bans export of its crude oil. Two experts we contacted agreed with DuVal’s statement, and officials at the EIA said they’re not aware of any other country with similar export restrictions. But the ban is not absolute -- a small portion of U.S. crude is exported to Canada. So we rate his DuVal’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-05661	Says "the governor took away a billion dollars of rebates, so in real dollars, our property taxes have gone up 20 percent."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/19/john-mckeon/chris-christie-cut-1-billion-rebates-leading-20-pe/	New Jersey taxpayers are paying 20 percent more in property taxes, thanks to a $1 billion cut in rebates from Gov. Chris Christie, according to state Assemblyman John McKeon. In a March 4 interview on My9 News’ "New Jersey Now," the Essex County Democrat claimed "the governor took away a billion dollars of rebates, so in real dollars, our property taxes have gone up 20 percent." PolitiFact New Jersey found a couple of problems with McKeon’s statement. Instead of $1 billion, Christie has reduced Homestead rebates by about $660 million since signing the fiscal year 2011 budget, his first spending plan as governor. That reduction in rebates coincided with a 20 percent property tax increase, but a state official disputed that figure, pointing out that rebates did not directly lower property tax bills in the past. First, let’s talk about the Homestead property tax credits. In fiscal year 2011, Christie cut funding for Homestead rebates by $850.4 million. But in fiscal year 2012, Christie increased funding by $189.8 million. So, during Christie’s tenure, there has been a net decrease of about $660.6 million in Homestead rebates. But McKeon argued that the governor cut rebates by about $1.5 billion. In addition to the $850 million cut in Christie’s first budget, the funding level in his second budget represented a "$683 million cut" from fiscal year 2010, according to McKeon. We told McKeon he was double-counting the governor’s cut in fiscal year 2011, but he maintained that his statement is "absolutely true." "Said in plain language, had Gov Christie funded rebates at the same level as the (level) in the final year before he took office, New Jersey taxpayers would have had $1.533 Billion dollars more in their pockets," McKeon told us in an e-mail. Now, let’s talk about that property tax increase. According to the state Department of Community Affairs, the average Homestead rebate was $1,037 in 2009 and $240 in 2011. After deducting the average Homestead rebates, the bill for "average net property taxes" was $6,244 in 2009 and $7,519 in 2011, according to the DCA. That’s a 20.4 percent increase in property taxes between 2009 and 2011. But the 2009 figure is misleading, DCA spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said in an e-mail. Starting with the Christie administration, homeowners receive the rebates as credits on their property tax bills. But previously, the rebates were paid out in the form of checks and not applied directly to property tax bills, Ryan told us. In other words, although those checks were meant as property tax relief, that doesn’t mean homeowners used them to pay their property tax bills, according to Ryan. "An eligible homeowners’ property tax bill in 2009 – the actual bill – was not lowered because he/she received a rebate check in the mail," Ryan said. The heading of "average net property taxes" is "leftover from previous administrations that wanted to claim property tax rebates lowered property taxes when they did not," said Ryan, adding that state officials dispute that property taxes went up by 20 percent. McKeon rejected the department’s argument: "For us to even entertain an argument by the DCA controlled by the Governor that rebates not transmitted by credit shouldn't be counted doesn't even meet the laugh test." Our ruling In a TV interview, McKeon claimed "the governor took away a billion dollars of rebates, so in real dollars, our property taxes have gone up 20 percent." But Christie cut about $660 million in Homestead rebates. Following the reduction in rebates, the average net property tax bill went up by about 20 percent between 2009 and 2011, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs. A DCA spokeswoman claimed the tax hike is inaccurate, because Homestead rebates were not used in previous years to directly lower property tax bills. Still, no matter how the rebates were distributed, their purpose always has been property tax relief. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

Greg Abbott suggested the Democratic president slipped a gear. Obama, kicking off the South by Southwest Interactive conference March 11, 2016, said the U.S. is the world’s only advanced democracy that "makes it harder for people to vote." Perhaps he was referring to voter registration hurdles or the mandate in more than a dozen states, including Texas, that voters present a photo ID before casting a ballot. Obama otherwise called it important to study ways of redesigning "our systems" to step up turnout. Then he said that "the folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren’t interested in having more people participate." Abbott, a Republican, bridled at Obama’s pokes, telling reporters a few days later: "To the contrary of the president’s comment, the… fact is, despite our voter registration laws, we had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary that occurred just a few weeks before he made that comment." Really? We wondered because last year, we found Texas not doing well in voter turnout compared to other states. Specifically, U.S. Census research indicated that in November 2014, some 59 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens were registered to vote, placing Texas 45th among the states in a virtual tie with New York and Nevada. Also in 2014, nearly 35 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens cast ballots, placing Texas 46th among the states. Nationally, 42 percent of voting-eligible citizens turned out. Abbott didn’t respond when we sought the basis of his "record" claim. We found that his turnout tout holds up if you look at the raw count of voters in both 2016 primaries or even solely at the share of registered voters who participated in the Republican primary. However, no record was set in overall percentage turnout, arguably the best metric for population-adjusted comparisons over time. Record count of voters A post-primary Austin American-Statesman news story walked through the record number of voters: "More than 2.83 million Texans cast ballots in the GOP primary’s presidential contest, roughly double the number who voted in each of the past three state primaries," a result celebrated by Tom Mechler, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, in a party press release. According to the Texas secretary of state, nearly 1.4 million Texans voted in the 2008 GOP presidential primary and 1,449,477 voted four years later. The 2,832,271 voters who cast ballots in the dominant party’s 2016 primary was nearly a doubling from four years before. But Texas wasn’t alone in high voter counts. The Statesman story said: "A similar dynamic has played out in other states, with record or near-record Republican turnout for Super Tuesday contests in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Virginia — coming after marked gains in numbers of GOP voters in earlier contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina." Record Republican turnout, but... We asked the secretary of state’s office if any records in percentage turnout were set in the 2016 Texas primaries. By email, spokeswoman Alicia Pierce said 19.89 percent of the state’s registered voters participated in the Republican primary. By a wide margin, that amounted to a record for Texas Republican primaries, according to agency records covering turnout in statewide elections since 1972. The next-highest turnout in the party’s presidential primary occurred in 2012 and 1996. In each of those years, 11 percent of the state’s registered voters voted GOP. But the approximately 30 percent turnout across both primaries was not record-setting. Pierce noted the 33 percent turnout of registered voters in March 2008; that year, Democrats had a showdown between Obama and Hillary Clinton. "To get a percentage number higher than 2008 based on the number of registered voters," Pierce wrote, "you have to go back to 1980" when some 36 percent of registered voters joined the primaries. She said 1992 "came close with 29 percent of voters." Similarly, the records show, combined Texas primaries turnout in 1988 (36 percent) and some 1970s primaries exceeded 30 percent. In 1972, remarkably, 60 percent of registered voters participated in the primaries, all but 3 percent of them on the Democratic side -- again, no 2016 record there. Notably too, a March 16, 2016, Texas Tribune news story suggested the 2016 Texas turnout lagged turnout in nearly all of the states to have already held presidential primaries. That is, the more than 4.2 million Texas voters in 2016 represented nearly 25 percent of voting-eligible citizens 18 and older and that placed the state second to last among the 19 states that had already primaried for president, the story said. Our ruling Abbott said Texas "had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the" 2016 "primary." We don’t know if Abbott was tunnel-visioning raw counts of primary voters or if he was fixed on the 19 percent share of registered voters participating in the Republican primary. By both of these metrics, the 2016 turnout set Texas records. However, percentage turnout across both primaries was previously higher in several years including 2008, 1988 and 1972. This gubernatorial statement also failed to acknowledge that Texas remains among the nation’s lowest-turnout states. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11284	"Most of our taxes are spent on the so-called ‘War on Terror.’"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/24/ro-khanna/are-most-our-taxes-spent-war-terror-no/	A recent Facebook post by Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., made an incorrect assertion about the scale of military spending in the federal budget. When PolitiFact contacted Khanna’s office, the congressman personally emailed us to say he was fixing the post — which happened before we could publish our fact-check. Our reporting started when a reader asked us to fact-check the April 19 post on Khanna’s Facebook page. Khanna’s post shared a graphic from the National Priorities Project, an effort sponsored by the liberal Institute for Policy Studies. The graphic was headlined, "Your Taxes Are Going to War." The part that caught our eye was Khanna’s personal comment alongside the graphic: "Republicans mention ‘fiscal responsibility’ when talking about cutting SNAP and Medicaid, even though most of our taxes are spent on the so-called ‘War on Terror’ which has sacrificed countless lives. It’s time to change our priorities." Here’s a screenshot of the original post. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our policy is to acknowledge and applaud after-the-fact corrections by speakers we check, but we still put the original comment to the Truth-O-Meter. So we’ll do that here. Checking Khanna’s original post One tricky aspect of checking Khanna’s statement is that the federal budget does not cleanly separate "War on Terror" spending from overall national defense spending. Under a simple but admittedly generous definition, we assumed that the entirety of spending on national defense went to the "War on Terror." The reality is that many aspects of the federal military budget — from nuclear weapons to troops stationed in South Korea to the U.S. Marine Corps band — are far removed from the front lines of the "War on Terror." (Khanna offered us an even more expansive estimate that include veterans services, the State Department and other agency spending, but we decided to stick with our definition.) Another tricky aspect is that Khanna referred to "our taxes." It’s not always easy to determine what ordinary Americans pay in federal taxes. Obviously they pay income taxes directly, but many taxation specialists would say that taxpayers indirectly foot the bill for corporate taxes and for the employer’s share of payroll taxes. For simplicity, we decided to include all tax revenues collected by the federal government, regardless of type. So how does national defense spending compare with federal tax revenues? Federal tax receipts in 2017 totaled $3.3 trillion. By comparison, outlays for national defense totaled $598.7 billion. That works out to 18.1 percent of tax receipts — not "most" of our taxes, as Khanna originally put it. "It is pretty far off the mark to say that the majority of taxes are used for the wars," said Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Even if you wanted to expand it as broadly as possible to include all national defense, homeland security, and veterans funding, it still does not add up to half." In fact, while federal spending on national defense is sizable, it pales compared to social spending. If you add together the two programs Khanna cited — Medicaid and SNAP (what used to be called food stamps) — and further include Social Security and Medicare, those four programs collectively accounted for 60.4 percent of tax receipts, or more than three times the proportion spent on the military. It’s also worth remembering that all federal spending currently exceeds the amount of taxes collected -- that’s what having an annual deficit means. Looking at discretionary spending only Khanna would have been more accurate if he had clarified that he was talking about "discretionary spending" rather than the entire federal budget. What does that mean? There are actually four major types of spending. One type of spending, known as "mandatory spending," is essentially automatic, given to any American who’s eligible based on existing rules and formulas. This category includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. Another type of spending is interest on the federal debt. This spending is also mandatory, but is typically considered a separate category. The two remaining types fall under "discretionary spending." The term "discretionary" doesn’t necessarily mean less important, but it does mean that such lines of funding must be approved on a more or less annual basis by Congress. All spending on national defense falls into the category "defense discretionary spending." And all other types of federal spending — from the Labor Department to the Environmental Protection Agency — makes up the category "non-defense discretionary spending." This chart shows that non-defense discretionary spending slightly outpaces defense discretionary spending, but the two are very close. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So Khanna would have been closer to the mark if he’d said that national defense spending accounted for about half of discretionary federal spending. That’s what Khanna did when he changed the wording of his post. "We should have clarified that this was excluding mandatory spending," Khanna said in an email to PolitiFact. "The caption we used is clearly poorly written. We do believe it is the majority of discretionary spending when counting all of the costs of the war on terror — which are beyond defense. ... You were right to bring it to our attention." The new caption on Khanna’s post reads, "Republicans mention ‘fiscal responsibility’ when talking about cutting SNAP and Medicaid, even though a majority of our taxes, related to discretionary spending, go to the so-called ‘War on Terror.’ Post updated to clarify that these numbers are related to discretionary spending only — based on PolitiFact's Louis Jacobson’s comments." Our ruling Khanna’s original post said, "Most of our taxes are spent on the so-called ‘War on Terror.’" That’s close to accurate if you specify that you’re referring to discretionary spending only, but the original post did not do that. To his credit, Khanna pointed out the distinction when he rewrote the post. We applaud the change, but our policy is to rate the original wording, and that earns the initial statement a False.

pomt-01370	"More than 70,000" job openings are listed on a state jobs website.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/17/scott-walker/plenty-jobs-people-wisconsin-who-want-work-scott-w/	Gov. Scott Walker broke his promise to create 250,000 jobs, but as he seeks re-election, he argues there are plenty of jobs for people in Wisconsin who are willing to work. "We don’t hear about this often enough, but we have a website called JobCenterOfWisconsin.com," Walker said at a campaign stop near Milwaukee on Sept. 20, 2014. "You know how many jobs were listed on that website last week?" the governor asked. "More than 70,000 jobs." There were gasps from the audience. "Jobs are not the problem," Walker continued. "Connecting people to those jobs with the skills they need and, more importantly, getting people off of the couch and off the dependence who are able and into those jobs, making it more effective, a bigger incentive for them to get back to work is really the difference." Walker has since repeated the claim, including during his first debate with Democratic challenger Mary Burke on Oct. 10, 2014. Do his numbers add up? The website JobCenterOfWisconsin.com is run by the state Department of Workforce Development, whose secretary is appointed by Walker. The department describes the site as a no-cost employment exchange that links employers and job seekers. Its popularity appears to have grown dramatically in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4, 2014 election. The home page shows a running tally of the number of job openings listed on the site. In releasing a jobs plan on Sept. 16, 2014, Walker said there were more than 60,000 job openings on the site. By the morning of Oct. 17, the running tally on the site’s home page was just under 80,000. That’s an increase of roughly one-third in a month. Moreover, a plus-sign (+) next to the running tally indicates that even more jobs are available. The database We asked the Department of Workforce Development to provide us a spreadsheet showing all of the job openings on the website. We received it Oct. 9, 2014. There were more than 79,000 job listings on the main part of the spreadsheet, including about 74,000 that had been posted within the past six months. Those are the ones that power the running tally on the website’s home page. There were more than 65,000 listings on the second part of the spreadsheet. More on those in a minute. Those figures obviously are well above the more than 70,000 that Walker claimed. But whether there were that many jobs actually available is less clear: 1. The state itself doesn’t vouch for the accuracy of all the listings. Of the 79,000 primary listings on the site, about 41,000 are reviewed by state employees and are set to automatically expire after 90 days, the workforce development department told us. The other 38,000 primary listings come from two national "partners" and the department relies on those firms to update their listings. Regarding the other 65,000 listings -- which are not specifically counted on the home page of the website -- the state told us it advises job seekers to beware when searching those listings that they come from multiple sources and can include duplicates. Those sources include Career Builder and Craigslist. 2. Thousands of jobs are outside of Wisconsin. Walker made his claim in the context of jobs in Wisconsin, even if he didn’t specifically say that all 70,000 job openings were within the state’s borders. According to One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, about 13,000 of the job listings were for openings not in Wisconsin but in neighboring states, a figure the Department of Workforce Development did not dispute. Our own check found, for example, roughly 1,100 listings in Dubuque, Iowa, and roughly 950 each in Rockford, Ill., and Duluth, Minn. Finally, although Walker’s claim didn’t address the quality of jobs listed on the website, it’s worth noting that many are on the low end of the pay scale. Among the most common job titles advertised were cashier, certified nursing assistant, registered nurse and restaurant crew. Two of the three employers with the most job listings were McDonald’s and the Kwik Trip convenience store chain. Our rating Walker said "more than 70,000" job openings are listed on a state jobs website, JobCenterofWisconsin.com. The raw number of job listings exceeds that figure. But not all of the listings are verified by the state and thousands of the jobs are outside of Wisconsin. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-11987	"We have one senator who’s a ‘yes’ vote ... but he’s in the hospital. And he’s a ‘yes’ vote. So we can’t do it by Friday. So we have the votes" to pass a health care bill.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-blames-hospitalized-senator-g/	President Donald Trump claimed that Senate Republicans could pass a health care reform bill by the end of September if a senator’s hospitalization weren’t preventing him from casting the deciding vote. "We have one senator who’s a ‘yes’ vote, a great person, but he’s in the hospital," Trump told Fox & Friends in a Sept. 27 interview. "And he’s a ‘yes’ vote. So we can’t do it by Friday. So we have the votes." Trump repeated similar claims throughout the day. "With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!" Trump tweeted Sept. 27. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to look more closely at whether Senate Republicans in fact have the needed votes, and if a hospitalized senator, unable to cast his "yes" vote, is preventing its passage. Do Senate Republicans have the votes? It doesn’t appear so. Under congressional rules, Republicans had until September 30 to pass the bill with a simple majority. Republican hold 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they could afford to lose two senators, and still pass the legislation, with the vice president casting the tie-breaking vote. No Democrats were expected to support the legislation. As of Sept. 25, however, three Senate Republicans — Maine Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, Arizona Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — were firm "no" votes. Still others expressed skepticism about the overhaul. So at most, even with all senators in attendance, Republicans had 49 votes in the Senate, short of the simple majority it needed for the bill to clear the chamber. Is the ‘hospitalized’ senator the sticking point? Trump’s repeated claims about a hospitalized senator were an apparent reference to Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. For his part, Cochran tweeted yesterday to clarify that he was ill but not in the hospital. "Thanks for the well-wishes. I'm not hospitalized, but am recuperating at home in Mississippi and look forward to returning to work soon," Cochran tweeted. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Cochran’s office told the USA Today the senator was recovering from what they referred to as treatment for a "urological issue." It’s unclear whether Cochran’s health concerns would prevent him from returning to cast a vote on the health care reform. But what’s clear is that even with his vote, Senate Republicans are still short of the majority. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said Senate Republicans would have enough votes to pass health care reform but for a hospitalized senator who’s unable to cast the deciding vote. At most, Senate Republicans have 49 "yes" votes — that’s short of the majority they need to pass the latest health care overhaul. This shortfall would not be overcome even with a "yes" vote from Cochran, who is not hospitalized, but rather recuperating at home after receiving medical treatment. We rate this False.

pomt-03652	Says state Senate leaders have accepted $142,400 in campaign contributions from dentists and pharmacists during the past two years.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/01/renee-unterman/did-vote-come-price/	A state senator caused a stir when she gave a speech accusing some of her colleagues of being beholden to some influential industries because of their support for a bill. Sen. Renee Unterman, a Republican from Gwinnett County, opposed House Bill 132, which would allow dentists, dental hygienists and pharmacists to regulate their own professions under the auspices of the Department of Community Health and remove those regulatory duties from Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Kemp’s office annually handles more than 430,000 license renewals for professionals across Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. Unterman said this change would create another layer of government, which she said is counter to Republican Party principles. On the next to last day of this year’s session, Unterman offered a reason why some lawmakers supported the bill. She posted a graphic in front of her fellow senators detailing how much money some of them have received from dentists, pharmacists and some of their political action committees. The total: $142,400. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Unterman’s figure was correct, along with the context she included. "These figures up here are not everybody in this room," she said. "This is only leadership, and this is only for a one two-year term." Unterman added, hoping to shame some senators into voting against the bill: "Let your money do the dialing in the state Senate because the pharmacists and dentists had the money." Atlanta Journal-Constitution Political Insider columnist Jim Galloway wrote that gasps could be heard from the lobbyists watching the proceedings. Some senators may have been searching for something more comfortable at that moment, like a root canal. The Senate passed the bill by 45-8 margin. Unterman voted against it. Gov. Nathan Deal signed the legislation last week. Unterman forwarded us 57 pages of records detailing the contributions. It took PolitiFact Georgia some time to dig through Unterman’s information and to conduct our own research. As she said, contributions totaled more than $142,000. But we noticed a few problems with the information she forwarded. Most of the contributions were made more than two years ago. Unterman’s staff was focusing on contributions made since 2008, they said, although some of the contributions they included dated to the 2006 election cycle. In her floor speech, the senator used the words "a two-year term." "I made a mistake," Unterman said. "I was thinking it was the last term." We noticed some of the names of the senators in Unterman’s list were not in Senate leadership, and that some of the senators currently in leadership were not included. Senate leadership includes Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, the Senate’s presiding officer; David Shafer, the Senate’s president pro tem; three senators picked by Gov. Nathan Deal as his floor leaders; and three senators from the Democratic and Republican parties. Unterman said she included the names of some senators who are currently not in leadership because they served on the Senate’s Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee. The bill was vetted by that committee before it came to the entire Senate, Unterman explained. Fourteen senators, including Unterman, serve on that committee. Four members of that committee are part of the official Senate leadership. During the past two calendar years, Senate leadership received about $40,000 in contributions from dentists, pharmacists and their PACs, state records show. If you go back to 2008, the total is $85,875. About one-half of those donations were made to Cagle. By law, Cagle cannot vote on any bills. Unterman said she’s received lots of money from dentists and pharmacists. Over the past two years, we found $12,200 in contributions. We found $27,500 in contributions if you go back to 2008. PolitiFact Georgia also calculated all contributions we found were made since 2008 to the current Senate leadership and to all members of the Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee except Unterman. The total was $140,375. If you add Unterman, the total is $167,875. "My whole point was to look at the amount of money put into the Gold Dome," Unterman said. "It was a lot of money." Indeed, it is. To sum up, Unterman said state Senate leaders collected $142,400 in campaign contributions from dentists and pharmacists during the past two years. Unterman told us she misspoke when she said the past two years. Her research was intended to go back to 2008. Her research included eight members of a Senate committee that is not part of the current leadership. If you include those senators, Unterman’s claim nearly hits the mark. If you exclude those senators, the claim is off by nearly 40 percent. Unterman’s dollar figure is accurate, but there’s some important context missing here. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-02063	"As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan. I kid you not."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/28/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-federal-government-spending-tax-money-/	Sarah Palin’s Facebook page is a popular venue where her 4.2 million fans can track her political endorsements, follow her reality TV appearances and join in on her outrage about how the country is being run. Recently, the former GOP vice presidential nominee and Alaska governor made an "unbelievable" connection between the abuse of tax dollars and zombies. "As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan. I kid you not," Palin wrote May 22. "(Google it; it really is the strangest thing. It’s not like government isn't trillions in debt and wasting billions of your dollars everyday ... but I digress.)" We took her advice to heart and did some digging. After a few Internet searches and some interviews, we found this: The government does not have a plan for the zombie apocalypse. We repeat: There is no zombie apocalypse plan. "Nor do we conduct any research or know of any viruses or other conditions that would result in zombie-type behavior," said Centers for Disease Control spokesman Llelwyn Grant. That’s probably not all-too surprising given the lack of real-life zombies. But since Palin was so matter-of-fact about the plan being real, we’ll explain where she got her information. Palin’s claim is based on a public outreach strategy developed by the communications office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011. Officials aimed to grow the audience of their annual, and tired, message about preparing for hurricanes and other disasters by connecting it with a zombie apocalypse, like the one depicted in AMC’s The Walking Dead (which PolitiFact Georgia dutifully fact-checked). CDC officials created a tongue-in-cheek blog post from Dr. Ali Khan, assistant surgeon general and director of the CDC’s Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Khan wrote: "The rise of zombies in pop culture has given credence to the idea that a zombie apocalypse could happen. In such a scenario zombies would take over entire countries, roaming city streets eating anything living that got in their way. The proliferation of this idea has led many people to wonder 'How do I prepare for a zombie apocalypse?' "Well, we’re here to answer that question for you, and hopefully share a few tips about preparing for real emergencies too!" Khan advised people to build emergency survival kits before a zombie outbreak that include water, non-perishable food, a battery-powered radio, tools, medications, cleaning supplies, vital documents and a first-aid kit -- supplies that are key to surviving the aftermath of a hurricane or tornado. And Khan advised families to create an emergency plan detailing where to go and who to call if zombies show up, though "you can also implement this plan if there is a flood, earthquake or other emergency." Reading the screed makes clear that Khan was having fun with the zombie fascination, and that this wasn’t an actual government plan to fend off walkers. The CDC, however, does offer real tips for preparing for and responding to explosions, nuclear blasts, smallpox, Anthrax, earthquakes and other hazardous situations. Zombies didn’t make the official list. Most people realized the joke. The Atlantic bemoaned the lack of meaningful advice for effective zombie-killing weapons, hot-wiring cars, figuring out the best time of day to travel, "or really any worthwhile strategy for keeping zombies out of your house." As a PR stunt, it was pretty effective. The CDC department expected a week’s worth of attention but it stretched over a year, leading to an elaborate graphic novella generated within the agency and a "CDC Zombie Apocalypse Team" T-shirt produced by the CDC Foundation that benefited disaster and health programs. It earned a spotlight in national media, including the New York Times, CNN and Fox News, where host Bill O’Reilly dubbed the campaign one of the "dumbest things of the week." Most CDC blog posts get between 1,000 and 3,000 hits, according to a case study of the campaign for the University of Southern California. But the zombie post crashed the server after getting tens of thousands of hits, and generated more than 4.8 million page views in the two years after its launch. A chunk of the online traffic came from the agency sharing the blog post on Twitter. Palin attacked the zombie apocalypse plan (remember, not a real how-to guide) as wasting tax dollars. But this doesn’t appear to be a story about wasted stimulus grants or $16 muffins or IRS Star Trek parodies. In this case, the CDC was using an unorthodox tactic to disseminate real information. People may argue with the method, but the campaign was designed to get people prepared for real disasters. The CDC says the zombie apocalypse campaign did not require outside contractors and did not take much time. Essentially, the project cost the hours that it took to produce it by its in-house staff. We asked for more specifics but did not hear back by our deadline. Stock images of zombies cost the team $87, but there were not many initial expenses because the project was based on social media sharing, according to the USC case study, co-authored by the CDC staffer who drafted Kahn’s original blog post. When the campaign became Internet gold, the CDC spent $20,000 on posters, postcards and copies of the graphic novella for libraries, schools and scout troops, the report says. The CDC retired its zombie attack campaign, but it remains online to accommodate public interest, a spokesman told us. Officials blogged in 2012 about "teachable moments" from The Walking Dead, such as keeping your gas tank half full during an emergency and keeping a first-aid kit around to quickly treat cuts induced by rooting around rusty cars in search of abandoned gasoline. For the record, the CDC says it would take a zombie apocalypse very seriously, conducting an investigation into the disease, helping to quarantine infected citizens and sending medical teams into the field. But it’s not banking on it happening. Our ruling Palin wrote on Facebook, "As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan. I kid you not." People who worry about the zombie apocalypse will not be comforted to hear this, but there is no plan. The CDC played off the zombie apocalypse craze in 2011 as way to pass along real information about preparing for emergencies that don't involve zombies. They wrote up a tongue-in-cheek blog post, which successfully generated plenty of attention. So when the zombies come, you’re on your own. And Palin’s claim is False. May 28 update (2:04 p.m.): Since our fact-check first posted, our zombie friends have alerted us to some more zombie government business that we think is worth mentioning. None of it affects our rating of False. In the first case, the Washington Examiner reported on the Department of Homeland Security allowing federal government contractors to potentially be reimbursed for attending HALO Corp.'s 2012 Counter-Terrorism Summit. As part of the summit, Halo put on a "live war game of a zombie apocalypse, complete with 40 actors in full zombie makeup," the Washington Examiner reported. In the second, Foreign Policy magazine found a 2011 military training document that included plans for a zombie attack. But it’s not really a "plan." It’s part of a training exercise, the magazine reported. "The document is identified as a training tool used in an in-house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario," Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze, a spokeswoman for U.S. Strategic Command, told CNN. "This document is not a U.S. Strategic Command plan."	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2014-05-28T11:10:32	2014-05-22	['None']
pomt-01927	"Wendy Davis’ legal work is currently under FBI investigation."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/jun/27/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-lacks-proof-wendy-davis-under-fbi-scru/	Democrats gathering in Dallas for their state convention were welcomed by a billboard featuring a photo of their gubernatorial nominee, Wendy Davis, and this message: "Wanted: Wendy Davis’ legal work is currently under FBI investigation." It’s one of several billboards rented by the campaign of her Republican opponent, Greg Abbott, according to a June 26, 2014, Abbott press release. A photo of the billboard also appeared in an Abbott campaign tweet. Davis is "wanted" by the FBI? Michelle Lee, spokeswoman in the FBI’s San Antonio office, told us by phone: "Our policy is that we don’t either confirm or deny the existence of an investigation." Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed to several April 2014 news stories as the campaign’s evidence. The reports said the FBI was investigating an agency with which Davis’ law firm has done business. FBI officials had no comment in those news stories, and a Travis County prosecutor cautioned against concluding that Davis was in federal sights. April 2014 news stories Let’s look at those reports in detail. A news story posted online by the Dallas Morning News on April 17, 2014, quoted Travis County officials as saying documents related to Davis’ work as an outside lawyer for the North Texas Tollway Authority, "are part of an FBI inquiry of the agency." That work, the story said, had related to land condemnations and delinquent toll collections. The story also touched off an Abbott campaign tweet: But, the News’ story said, it wasn’t clear whether Davis’ work for the authority "is a focus of the FBI or only part of the material collected in connection with its look into tollway agency operations." The story said the authority disclosed in 2011 that the FBI was investigating potential conflicts of interest among current and former board members. Davis, it noted, had not served on the board. Also, the story said, no one had been charged. In 2013, the story said, the Public Integrity Unit of the Travis County district attorney’s office built a file while reviewing a complaint filed by the Republican who lost to Davis for her Senate seat in 2012. Elizabeth Winn, a Travis County assistant district attorney, told the newspaper her office had confirmed with the FBI that the material from the county’s review of the complaint by Mark Shelton was now part of a federal investigation. "We did confirm by telephone … they still have a pending investigation," Winn said. The newspaper quoted Gregg Cox, who heads the county’s investigatory unit, as saying that in looking into Shelton’s complaint about Davis, his office fielded information from the FBI. "They shared information with us, and that information was in our files," Cox said. "We ultimately closed our investigation." The News said it learned of the FBI link after its request for the investigative file under the Texas Public Information Act was rebuffed by the Public Integrity Unit. The paper quoted Cox as saying: "When the open records request came in, we felt a need to protect the information in our files that we had learned from the FBI." In a September 2013, letter to Shelton, the News reported, the district attorney’s office said it had conducted legal research into his complaint against Davis but had been "unable to accumulate sufficient evidence to support a prosecution" for any offense that might have occurred in Travis County. Much of what the allegations deal with occurred elsewhere, in Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth. "Thus we do not have proper venue to prosecute any criminal conduct that occurred," the letter said. A day later, on April 18, 2014, the Austin American-Statesman followed up with a news story stating: "There is no evidence that Davis is an object of interest for the FBI, which is mum on even the question of whether there is an investigation." A Statesman news story posted online earlier that day quoted Cox as saying Shelton’s October 2012 complaint concerned the North Texas Tollway Authority hiring Davis’ law firm in exchange, Shelton asserted, for her vote on legislation that mattered to the authority. Davis, the newspaper said, had said she voted in the interests of her constituents and it had nothing to do with being given work by the authority. Cox said that, when the county embarked on looking into the matter, "we came across a bunch of news articles about the FBI investigating the NTTA so we reached out to them and they shared information with us about their investigation." The Statesman said the disclosure about the sharing of information between the Public Integrity Unit and the FBI was prompted by the Dallas newspaper’s March 11, 2014, open-records request for a copy of the case file. Travis County asked the open records division of Attorney General Abbott’s office on March 24, 2014, for a ruling, and on April 1, 2014, received an affirmative reply, confirming that it did not have to make the documents available, the Statesman said. According to the Statesman, Winn’s letter seeking the AG’s ruling said "the requested information is the subject of an open investigation" by the FBI and "the information’s release would interfere with the FBI’s prosecution of the crime underlying the information." Cox told the Statesman it would be wrong to read into the letter that Davis is a subject of the FBI investigation. Cox said the Public Integrity Unit did not provide the FBI any information; it was the FBI that provided the Public Integrity Unit with information about its investigation of the authority. We called Cox and didn’t hear back. We also asked Hirsch of Abbott’s camp how Abbott knows Davis’ work is "currently" under investigation. He didn’t say, replying by email with a question: "Has the FBI said the investigation is closed?" Our ruling Abbott’s billboard said: "Wendy Davis’ legal work is currently under FBI investigation." That's largely unsupported. According to news reports, the FBI has looked into an agency that’s also relied on Davis for legal work--and her work may or may not be an element of the inquiry. But the FBI has been silent about the inquiry and any Davis element and we see no official confirmation otherwise of a focus on the senator. Notably, a Travis County prosecutor said two months ago it’d be wrong to conclude his office’s mention of the FBI inquiry in a letter indicates Davis is under federal scrutiny. Also, Abbott’s camp offered no evidence the declared investigation is "currently" happening. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

pomt-03451	A study ranked Florida "No. 1 in government corruption" under Gov. Rick Scott.	false	/florida/statements/2013/jun/20/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-link-states-no-1-corruption-rank/	Florida Democrats play up the significance of "one" in a Web video designed to get members fired up about taking on Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2014. A segment riffs off a clip of Scott saying, "Florida won’t stop until we’re No. 1." The words "Um, right" appear on the screen, followed by a newspaper headline typed over Scott: "Study ranks Florida No. 1 in government corruption." "No. 1 in government corruption," the text states. "Yep, Rick Scott, you’re #1 alright." Florida Republicans were not amused with the video for many reasons, taking particular issue with the corruption claim. (For the record, the clip of Scott was not of him talking about trying to make Florida No. 1 in government corruption.) We decided to check it out. Is it fair for Democrats to link Scott with the report on corrupt government officials? At issue is a study released by Integrity Florida, a nonprofit watchdog group, in June 2012. From 2000 to 2010, the study found Florida led all states in total convictions of officials and staff who broke federal public corruption laws. Florida had 781 convictions, followed by more populous states California, Texas and New York. During that time, for example, four Palm Beach County commissioners and two West Palm Beach commissioners pled guilty to corruption charges over several years, leading to it being derided as "Corruption County." Without getting into more of the nitty gritty of the report, we’ll note it included a disclaimer key to our fact-check on page 2: "The public corruption conviction data included in this report is from a time period prior to Gov. Rick Scott taking office." Integrity Florida included the line to discourage people from doing essentially what the Democrats did: misconstruing a correlation between the decade of corruption cases and Scott, who had been in office a year and a half when the report was released. "We were concerned about that kind of interpretation," Integrity Florida executive director Dan Krassner told us. The Florida Democratic Party stands by its video. Spokesman Joshua Karp directed us to a story by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald about Scott promising ethics reform with an executive order on his first day in office but not following through. Scott had pledged his administration would develop a plan for implementing "all or certain" recommendations by a grand jury convened by former Gov. Charlie Crist. "We feel that we have a strong case here given that the text of the ad is 100 percent true," Karp said, "and the fact is that Scott has not addressed the problems addressed in the report." But the video does not get into that degree of detail. It also fails to mention that Scott did sign two ethics measures into law this year. The laws give the state Commission on Ethics more power to investigate complaints referred to it, requires constitutional officers to go through four hours of ethics training and bans former legislators from lobbying state agencies for two years after leaving office, among other things. One more note: Florida is not universally considered the most corrupt state. A study by researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago examined Department of Justice data for corruption convictions across the states from 1976 to 2010. The broadened time period meant Florida ranked No. 4 in total federal public corruption convictions (1,762 convictions), trailing New York, California and Illinois. Per capita, Florida ranked eighth. Our ruling The Democrats took too big a leap by blatantly linking Scott with a report about Florida being No. 1 for federal corruption convictions. The report specifically stated it was looking at the decade before Scott took office. The juxtaposition in the video is misleading, leaving viewers with the wrong impression. We rate this claim False.	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2013-06-20T10:41:42	2013-06-16	['None']
pomt-03198	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies emit "unlimited carbon pollution into our air"	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/29/league-conservation-voters/sen-ron-johnson-voted-unlimited-carbon-pollution-e/	On Aug. 14, 2013 -- more than three years before U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson could face re-election -- a national environmental group hit him with an attack ad. The first-term Wisconsin Republican responded by using the TV spot to solicit political contributions. We didn’t think we’d have to go into campaign mode yet for the 2016 elections. But we’re game. In the ad, the League of Conservation Voters alleges that Johnson "has taken more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air." Johnson has received $109,550 from oil and gas interests since his campaign for the 2010 election, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. So that is not really in dispute. Let’s see if he voted in favor of unlimited carbon pollution. Getting our bearings To be clear on terminology, we'll start with four points. 1. Global warming: The world’s leading science academies have long warned that the planet is warming. The pace has slowed in the past 15 years, although 2000 through 2009 was the warmest decade on record, according to NASA. In August 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of scientists, reiterated the role of human beings, saying in a draft report the odds are at least 95 percent that humans are the main cause of the warming in recent decades. 2. Greenhouse gases: The main human-caused producer of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, which trap the Earth's heat. 3. Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide makes up 84 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has determined that greenhouse gases are a threat to humans. 4. Carbon pollution: Carbon dioxide -- or carbon pollution, the term used in the ad -- comes largely from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Like Johnson, many congressional Republicans elected in 2010 have expressed doubt about the science of global warming and opposed regulation of climate-altering gases. The ad’s evidence The Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters is "a liberal-leaning organization that raises money primarily in support of environmentally friendly public policy," according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2011-2012 election cycle, the five candidates who received the most money from the league -- Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin among them -- all were Democrats. To back its claim against Johnson, the League of Conservation Voters cited three Senate votes, each an amendment to a bill; one was in 2011 and two were on the same day in 2013. Two of the votes were noted in the ad and the third was cited by the league as additional evidence. 1. EPA regulations, April 6, 2011 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to an unrelated small-business bill. The amendment would have prohibited the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and repealed the agency’s scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are endangering human health and the environment. So, under Johnson’s vote, the EPA couldn’t regulate any carbon emissions, including those emitted in the extraction and refining of oil, or by gasoline-burning vehicles. 2. Global warming, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to the 2014 federal budget bill. The amendment would have prohibited "further greenhouse gas regulations for the purposes of addressing climate change," which includes global warming. Like the earlier vote, Johnson supported the status quo: no federal limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, or carbon pollution, whether by oil and gas companies or other energy producers. 3. Carbon emissions, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for another amendment to the budget to require a vote of 60 senators in order to enact a new federal tax or fee on carbon emissions.The amendment passed. This measure doesn’t regulate carbon emissions, per se, but does make it more difficult to tax emissions. Such a tax, arguably, could lead to less production of energy that results in carbon emissions. For our purposes, the third vote really isn’t necessary in evaluating the claim against Johnson. The intent of the other two votes is clear. Johnson spokeswoman Melinda Whitemarsh Schnell told us the three votes sought to stop President Barack Obama’s administration "from passing regulations that Congress had earlier refused to enact." She also called the ad misleading because it showed smokestacks that suggested the production of electricity, and said gas and oil companies are not responsible for the carbon emissions used to make electricity. But the question here is the effect of the measures Johnson voted for. Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told us that as a practical matter, the only way to reduce carbon pollution is to reduce the amount of fossil fuel produced. But he said Johnson's votes do preserve the status quo, which has no limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Our rating The League of Conservation Voters said Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies "keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air." Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02872	Says the Affordable Care Act has already reduced the number of uninsured in Oregon by 10 percent.	true	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/13/jeff-merkley/has-new-health-care-law-helped-oregon-reduce-numbe/	News that hundreds of thousands of Americans would not actually be able to keep their exact health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act has buffeted Washington. President Barack Obama and aides have had to repeatedly defend themselves against cries that they lied to the public. Obama isn’t alone, either. Anger about this revelation has turned into fodder for attacks on a number of Democrats including Oregon’s own Sen. Jeff Merkley. The Republican National Committee recently announced it had launched robocalls against the senator -- along with 10 other Democrats up for re-election -- accusing them of lying about the new law. The claim: In response, Merkley’s spokesman told The Oregonian that the law had already been extremely successful. "Merkley spokesman Matt McNally responded with a statement saying that the new law has already reduced the number of uninsured people in Oregon by 10 percent," politics reporter Jeff Mapes wrote. We’d heard that number from the Oregon Health Authority and Gov. John Kitzhaber, as well. Plus, The Oregonian had reported on it (which is where Merkley's staff got it). Given that the online application system for Cover Oregon -- the state’s health exchange under the new law -- isn’t running, we were a little suspicious. We decided to take a closer look. The analysis: Our first call was to the Oregon Health Authority, where the 10 percent figure originated. Spokeswoman Patty Wentz broke down the math for us. Some background first, though: In 2011, the Oregon Health Authority conducted an exhaustive survey that found that nearly 15 percent -- or some 560,000 Oregonians -- did not have health insurance. When the Affordable Care Act passed, Oregon was one of several states that opted to expand its Medicaid program using federal dollars. To help enroll people in this expansion, the Oregon Health Authority looked at the people receiving food stamp benefits and determined who among them would be eligible for the expansion. Under a fast-track enrollment program, those folks were prequalified. Near the end of September, about 260,000 Oregonians received a letter informing them of their eligibility along with a mail-in application. As of Oct. 18, about 56,000 Oregonians had returned the applications -- that’s about 10 percent of the total uninsured. These days, the number is closer to 70,000. Of course, we thought it was important to know whether these new enrollees would have been eligible without the Affordable Care Act. Wentz checked and explained that while a segment of those newly enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan might have previously qualified, there’s no way all of them would have been accepted into the plan because of budgetary constraints. Oregon used to have a lottery to join the plan because it had too few slots for all the folks eligible. That lottery is now gone because the slots are unlimited; if you qualify, you get in. So, it is fair to say the Affordable Care Act -- or more specifically the Oregon Health Plan expansion it enabled -- is the reason these folks will be insured come 2014. Something else occurred to us, however. If this enrollment figure was Merkley’s defense of folks not being able to keep their insurance plans, was there anybody out there who might be losing their insurance as result of the ACA? Could that number offset these gains? Cheryl Martinis with the Oregon Insurance Division filled us in on those details. She told us Oregon has about 168,000 people with individual insurance. Of those, 23,000 will keep their grandfathered plans. However, 145,000 will see their insurance plans change to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. That said, none of them will find him or herself without insurance. Instead, they’ll be moved automatically to a new plan that most closely resembles whatever it was they had before the new law. This might not be ideal, of course, but it won’t leave them without a plan. One group could be out of luck, though. Some insurance companies offer what is called a portability plan. These plans are for people who lose or drop their employer-sponsored insurance. Basically, it’s an individual policy through the same insurance company, though they generally have different benefits than what was covered under the employer’s program. Nearly 14,000 people in Oregon are on these plans, and they will not necessarily automatically be switched to new ones. So, in effect, at least some of them will be forced back into the marketplace to look for insurance. The ruling: Even if you count all of them as having lost their insurance, though, when Merkley’s staff referenced the 10 percent figure on Nov. 4, some 70,000 had received coverage through the fast-track program. That means you still have a net gain of 56,000 people covered. Put another way, Oregon had reduced its uninsured by 10 percent. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07955	Poll results from the past 35 years show that State of the Union speeches "do not move" presidential approval numbers.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/24/matthew-dowd/maureen-dowd-says-theres-no-evidence-state-union-b/	CORRECTION: The initial version of this item erroneously attributed the comment to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. With President Barack Obama about to give the State of the Union address, pundits of all stripes have been pre-analyzing and prognosticating what he may say before a joint session of Congress on Jan. 25, 2011. On the Jan. 23, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, former Republican strategist Matthew Dowd offered some historical context to how State of the Union speeches actually change public opinion -- or rather, how they do not. "To me, the State of the Union (addresses) … they don't affect the American public," Dowd said during the program’s roundtable segment. "If you look at … approval numbers going into State of the Unions over the last 35 years and coming out, they do not move the numbers. Even Ronald Reagan, who was lauded as one of the best communicators in the history of this country, never moved the American public." We thought we’d see whether Dowd was correct. While a number of media-affiliated polling organizations track presidential approval ratings, we turned to Gallup because polling experts frequently used the company’s polls for long-term studies. Gallup, which began polling before World War II, has the longest and most consistent track record of publishing such polls. Mark Blumenthal, a polling analyst who founded the website Pollster.com, published a thorough analysis of the topic in 2006. It was augmented in a 2010 study by Gallup’s own Jeffrey M. Jones. The Gallup data goes back to 1978 -- to President Jimmy Carter’s first State of the Union address -- and includes a total of 28 addresses. (Most presidents have given an address to a joint session of Congress shortly after their first inauguration, but technically these are not State of the Union addresses. Because of that, neither Blumenthal nor Jones included them in their surveys, and we won’t either.) Here’s the bottom line as Jones puts it: "A review of Gallup historical data suggests these speeches rarely affect a president's public standing in a meaningful way, despite the amount of attention they receive." By our count, presidents are actually somewhat more likely to see their polling numbers decline than see them rise after they give a State of the Union address. In all, the numbers rose 10 times, fell 15 times and remained unchanged three times. (You can see the year-by-year figures here.) Even more strikingly, the shifts were usually quite small. If you were to define a presidential "bounce" as a 5-point rise or more -- a bit outside the typical margin of error of 3 points -- then there have only been three "bounces," or about once in every 10 speeches. In fact, during the period studied, a president’s standing rose by more than 6 percentage points only once -- the 10-point rise for Bill Clinton in 1998. And that speech was somewhat exceptional, since the Monica Lewinsky scandal had just broken and Clinton used the address to refocus Americans (with some success) on his policy agenda. Clinton was the only one of the five presidents prior to Obama whose numbers rose when the poll numbers after each president's addresses were averaged together. Clinton saw his approval ratings rise by 3 points on average, while Carter and President Ronald Reagan saw their ratings drop by 1 point, President George H.W. Bush saw his ratings drop by 4 points and President George W. Bush saw his drop by 1 point. We should note that there is another type of poll taken during State of the Union season, usually with strikingly different results -- so-called "instant polls." When Gallup does these polls, they ask people who responded to a pre-State of the Union poll if they minded getting a quick call after the speech to gauge their immediate reaction. Typically, these polls show favorable results toward whoever the president is. However, Blumenthal discounts the value of these polls, citing data showing that, in most cases, viewership for the State of the Union tilts heavily toward the president’s party. "Simply put, people who don't like a particular president are considerably less apt to tune him in," he quotes ABC polling director Gary Langer as saying. Since Blumenthal’s published analysis is now five years old, we checked with him to see whether he still felt the same way. "I definitely think the argument still holds," he told us. Dowd was very close to correct that State of the Union addresses "do not move the numbers." Over the past 33 years at least, that has been the case more often than not. And the one president Dowd specifically cited, Reagan, never got a bump greater than 3 points. But there are a few exceptions, including Clinton's 10-point bounce in 1998. So we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Matthew Dowd	None	None	None	2011-01-24T16:17:50	2011-01-23	['None']

pomt-07504	Says "an average of $4 billion is added to the national debt" every day.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/11/saxby-chambliss/senators-ring-alarm-about-4-billion-debt-problem/	Four billion dollars. Imagine what could be done with that amount of money. MARTA, metro Atlanta’s mass transit system, has said it could use $4 billion for various expansion projects. The Obama administration has set aside that much money for its Race to the Top education program. Or, perhaps, you can buy the New York Yankees andthe Beatles music catalog and still have about $1 billion to spare. Here’s a disturbing figure concerning $4 billion. "An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt" every day, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in a March 29 op-ed. Is it really that much money? We wanted to find out. The estimate is aimed at raising awareness among Americans into facing and dealing with what the two senators believe is one of the nation’s biggest problems -- its rapidly rising debt. Chambliss and Warner will come to Atlanta on Monday to talk about the debt to more than 500 business and community leaders at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Atlanta. The two senators are part of what’s been called the "Gang of Six" -- a group of six senators working on ways to lower the debt. The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending. "Every dollar that we spend simply paying the interest on our nation’s staggering debt is disappearing into a fiscal sinkhole," they wrote. "These are resources that cannot be targeted toward creating jobs, expanding the U.S. economy or addressing any of our other shared priorities." We wondered if Chambliss and Warner had their math right -- or are they trying to scare the public with false and gaudy numbers? PolitiFact Virginia checked out a prior claimin December by Warner that the debt grew by an estimated $15 billion in one weekend. They ruled his claim was on the money. There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion. Those numbers are as of April 6, 2011, the most recent figures available. The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show. So, to see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two other dates. On Dec. 31, 2010, it was $9.4 trillion. A year earlier, the debt held by the public was $7.8 trillion. Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day. In 2010, it grew by an average of $4.3 billion a day. The pace of debt increase does seem to have slowed this year. The debt has risen by $250 billion between the end of 2010 and April 6, an average of $2.6 billion a day. If you look at the total debt, the average daily increase is about $4.3 billion. In 2010, it grew by about $4.7 billion a day. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day. Our math shows the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion per day since 2009. It grew by that rate during 2010 as well. The average daily rate has slowed to slightly less than $3 billion so far this year. Either number shows the debt is indeed a big problem. The senators’ op-ed did not detail what time frame they were discussing to spell out their claim. They said they were basing it off Warner’s claim that had been checked of what amounted to $5 billion a day and decided to be conservative and chose the $4 billion daily estimate. This year, their claim is off by about $1 billion. Over the last two years, it’s correct. Since the average daily debt through the first quarter of 2011 is more than $1 billion less than their statement, we rate the Chambliss claim as Mostly True.

pomt-04645	Says Sierra Club sued him to stop oil and gas activity on Texas coast, but "we won" and "the turtles are fine."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/12/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-sierra-club-sued-him-stop-gul/	Sea turtles surfaced at the state Republican convention in Fort Worth -- in a speech. State Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said June 9, 2012: "I have been sued by the Sierra Club. Sued me. They wanted to stop oil and gas exploration, production, on the Texas Gulf Coast," he said. "We won. We’re producing oil and gas, and the turtles are fine." We decided to check on the oil and gas and turtles. Patterson told us by phone that he was referring to a 2002 lawsuit brought by the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club over drilling at the Padre Island National Seashore, the federal park southeast of Corpus Christi on North Padre Island that is a nesting ground for sea turtles including the endangered Kemp’s ridley. We looked up the case on the U.S. District Court website for the Southern District of Texas, where records show the suit was filed April 18, 2002, and dismissed May 7, 2003. The Sierra Club took the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed the appeal Aug. 27, 2003. The club sued the U.S. secretary of the interior, National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, saying they had not done enough wildlife impact analysis to comply with federal laws before giving BNP Petroleum of Corpus Christi permission to drill in the park. When the area became a federal park in 1962, the original private landowners and the state retained the rights to extract and profit from minerals at the site. According to the park’s website, drilling has occurred there since the 1950s. The state’s share of royalties from oil and gas goes into the Texas Permanent School Fund, an endowment established in 1876 to channel income from state lands to Texas public schools. The Sierra Club lawsuit sought an injunction to halt drilling permits until the defendants complied with the federal laws the club claimed were broken. The district court, however, found that the government had sufficiently investigated the impact of drilling and operation on the turtles, and the appeals court affirmed that decision. So, was Patterson sued, as he says? We realized he could not have been one of the parties originally sued in 2002 -- he wasn’t even elected land commissioner until November 2002. Rather, court records and our phone interview with Patterson spokesman Jim Suydam showed that in his role as land commissioner, Patterson filed to intervene in the suit Jan. 14, 2003. After that, according to the court documents and an April 19, 2003, Associated Press news story, Patterson was listed as a defendant in the suit. According to the appeals court summary, the district court said government had not shirked its duties in estimating the effect drilling would have on the turtles, noting that the Park Service’s March 2001 oil and gas management plan spelled out restrictions and mitigation requirements. The plan’s 16 pages of drilling/production requirements include measures such as having turtle-spotting monitors precede heavy equipment being driven along the beach and shielding light sources so turtles would not become disoriented. The courts’ dismissals of both the lawsuit and the club’s appeal amounted to victory for the government, or as Patterson said, "We won." And how about those turtles? Texas’ coast once had many. According to a news story in the June 2012 issue of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s magazine, canneries nearly wiped out the Texas green turtle population after the Civil War. The department’s website said the turtles were hit hard again from the 1940s to 1960s by people gathering and selling "truckloads" of eggs. Today, the story said, the shrimping industry is the biggest threat. Sea turtles must surface to breathe; if they’re trapped below water in a net, they will drown. "All species in Texas waters — leatherback, hawksbill, loggerhead, green and Kemp’s ridley — are listed as either threatened or endangered," the story said. The Parks and Wildlife website said Kemp’s ridleys are the most endangered sea turtle species in the world. In a U.S.-Mexico program from 1978-88, Kemp’s ridley eggs from a turtle sanctuary in Tamaulipas were brought to Padre to hatch, "imprinting" the baby turtles to return there for nesting, according to the story, which also said, "All along the Texas coast, scientists and advocates have dedicated their careers to sea turtle research and protection." According to news stories dating from 2002 through August 2012 that we found using the Nexis news database, since 1996, turtle nest counts on the Texas coast have risen almost every year. Texas’ growing colony of Kemp’s ridleys now serves as a backup of sorts -- if disaster struck the Tamaulipas sanctuary, the species might not be wiped out. Carole Allen, Gulf office director with the nonprofit Sea Turtle Restoration Project, told us by email that she believes the major reasons for rising turtle numbers are increased protection of the turtles in Tamaulipas and the requirement of turtle excluder devices on U.S. shrimp boats. The devices, called TEDs, provide a grill of bars in a trawl net that large sea creatures can fit through; shrimpers, however, sometimes sew nets together again to counteract that escape hatch. In its 2002 lawsuit, the Sierra Club described ways that oil and gas operations could harm turtles, but included no measurement of harm occurring. We checked with the club’s lead volunteer in the lawsuit, Pat Suter, who chairs the Corpus Christi chapter. She told us by phone, "As far as I know, there has not been direct impact on the turtles that can be proved." Sierra said in its suit that trucks traveling to and from the well site would threaten turtles. The news articles we reviewed included no reports of turtles hurt or discouraged from nesting by oil and gas rigs, trucks, drilling or pumping at the federal park. Separately, an April 15, 2004, "white paper" on the park’s website said, "There has been vehicle traffic, from both visitors and heavy equipment operators, on the Gulf of Mexico shoreline for over fifty years with no documented case of a crushing of a nesting sea turtle within the park." Allen told us, "My personal opinion is that everything is being done to protect nesting sea turtles and hatchlings from being run over at the National Seashore. Kemp's ridleys are in far more danger from law-breaking shrimpers." As we closed out this check, Suydam conceded that Patterson was not sued by the Sierra Club. "It looks like Commissioner Patterson misspoke there," Suydam said. "He intervened in the Sierra Club's lawsuit, and then became a defendant." Still, Suydam said, "The sentiment is true. When the Sierra Club sues to stop oil and gas exploration, it is in effect suing to limit oil and gas production on Permanent School Fund lands," which is Patterson’s responsibility. Our ruling The Sierra Club did not sue Patterson; he wasn’t quite land commissioner when the group filed its suit against federal agencies. Still, he later joined the lawsuit, which the government won. And, despite ongoing oil and gas activity at the park in accord with the 1962 terms, Texas’ threatened and endangered sea turtles are increasing in numbers. We rate Patterson’s statement as Half True.	None	Jerry Patterson	None	None	None	2012-09-12T12:00:00	2012-06-09	['Texas']

pomt-00966	In states that have private-sale background checks for handguns "49 percent fewer women are shot and killed."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/16/lori-haas/haas-says-fewer-women-killed-guns-states-expanded-/	Closing a loophole in state law that allows some Virginians to buy firearms without going through a background check is a matter of life and death to women, according to Lori Haas, state director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Haas was among a number of gun control advocates who spoke at a news conference last month in favor of a series of bills aimed at tightening state firearm laws. Haas has compelling experience with gun violence: Her daughter, Emily, was grazed twice in the head during the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead and 17 wounded. Her brief remarks touched on background check laws. All states require licensed gun dealers to conduct a background check before selling a firearm to make sure the prospective buyer does not have a criminal record or disqualifying mental condition. But Virginia and 32 other states don’t require background checks for firearms bought through an unlicensed seller -- someone who isn’t in the routine business of selling guns. Haas backed a bill that would have narrowed that exception. In states that run background checks for privately-sold handguns, "49 percent fewer women are shot and killed," she said. Since Haas spoke, the General Assembly has scuttled major gun control bills, including the loophole closer. But background checks for all gun buyers is a perennial issue before the legislature and we wondered whether Haas’ statement was correct in terms of the number she used and the cause and effect of background check laws on women’s lives. She told us the figure came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The numbers The group issued a report last September examining firearm homicides of women by intimate partners -- current and former husbands, as well as boyfriends. It found that from 2008-2012, the rate of such murders was 46 percent lower in 14 states that had background checks for some or all private handgun sales when compared with the rest of the nation. Stacey Radnor, a spokeswoman with Everytown, said the group also found that the level of non-gun intimate partner homicides of women was much less stark -- only 4.3 percent lower in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns. We should note, however, that Haas’ statement focused on a broader definition of victims. She cited "women" without any reference to whether they were domestic violence victims. So to examine her exact statement, we needed to find figures on gun murders deaths of all women, which are not in Everytown’s report. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiles fatality data based on information from death certificates filed in each state. We looked at the 14 states that had background checks on private handgun sales during the 5-year period Everytown references. Those states are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. Three other states have in recent years added private-sale background checks: Colorado, Delaware and Washington. We found those firearms homicide figures of women for all but three states with small populations -- Rhode Island (which requires a background check for private handgun sales) as well as Vermont and Wyoming (which do not). The CDC withholds the number of firearms homicides of women in those states because they are so few in number. But given the small size of each state’s population, it wouldn’t affect the overall trend line for the 47 other states where the information was available. We found that in states with private-sale background checks, the rate of firearm homicides of females age 18 and over was 1.0 per 100,000 women. In the states that didn’t extend background checks to private handgun sales, the homicide rate was 1.6 per 100,000 women in that age group. That means there were 38 percent fewer firearms homicides of women in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns than the rest of the nation, lower than Haas’ statistic but still a significant figure. In Virginia, the rate was 1.4 per 100,000 women. We should note some states without background checks on all handgun sales bucked the trend of lower firearms violence against females. Minnesota, which has no requirement for background checks on private handgun sales, had a rate of 0.6 firearms homicides for every 100,000 women. That was one-third the rate of North Carolina, which requires a background check of anyone seeking to buy a handgun. Cause and effect Two analysts we contacted urged caution in interpreting a correlation in lower rates of gun violence to private-sale background checks. "Making causal claims is always riskier," Jacquelyn White, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, said in an email. "States that require background checks may also be more likely to support other efforts that contribute to the well-being of their residents. Remember, correlation is not causation. There may be other factors, such as a more enlightened commitment to creating healthy and safe communities, that result in an array of programs and policies that reduce domestic violence." Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, said Everytown’s figure "takes no other account of any other factors that affect homicides." "States do not randomly pass gun laws -- those that pass gun laws are different in many ways from those that do not," Kleck, who has studied the impact of background checks on homicide rates, said in an email. "For obvious political reasons, it’s easier to enact stricter gun laws in states with fewer gun-owning voters. Thus, states that extended background checks to private gun transfers had lower gun ownership rates even before those laws were passed. Likewise, states with stricter gun laws are more urban, less likely to be Southern or Western (and thus culturally different), more politically liberal etc. You can’t isolate the effect of a gun law without controlling for other violence-related factors." Our ruling Haas said in states with comprehensive background checks for handguns, "49 percent fewer women are shot and killed." She supports that statement by pointing to figures examining a narrower group of female firearms victims -- those killed in domestic violence situations. But figures examining the broader group of victims she cited in her statement -- women in general -- show 38 percent fewer women were shot and killed in the states with private-sale background checks on handgun sales. That’s not quite high as the figure she cited, but it still represents a lower rate of gun homicides of women in states with comprehensive background checks. But experts cautioned against reading too much into that correlation. They noted that there may be other factors beyond background checks that led to that result. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-08577	Says Zack Space voted for budgets and debt, energy taxes and the stimulus, and "we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/27/americans-job-security/americans-job-security-targets-zach-space-other-de/	A new political ad shows a burglar climbing into a window, taking someone's wallet, and driving off in their car. "What would it feel like if someone broke into your home?" The narrator asks. "Would you be upset? Then what about what's happening in Washington? Zack Space voted for Nancy Pelosi's budgets and debt, for job-killing energy taxes, and for her wasteful stimulus. And we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs. With Pelosi and Space's agenda, it can feel like you're getting robbed. This November, vote against Zack Space." The ad comes from Americans for Job Security, a conservative anti-tax group. The group does not disclose its donors, and that has led to questions about who funds the group and for what purposes. The ad, called "Robbed," is part of an ad buy against several Democratic candidates around the country. The ad targets Space of Ohio, Pennsylvania Rep. Jason Altmire and Democratic challengers Bryan Lentz of Pennsylvania and Trent Van Haaften of Indiana. For Lentz and Van Haaften, the ad says that each candidate "wants to join Nancy Pelosi," and then lists the measures as "Pelosi's agenda." The ad mentions major pieces of legislation passed by Democrats in Congress and labels them a failure because "we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs." Take away the scary robber imagery, and it's a fairly straightforward claim. We decided to fact-check the ad for Space, who represents eastern Ohio and is a member of the Blue Dog coalition, a group of fiscally conservative Democrats. We'll take the ads' claims about him in order. • Space "voted for budgets and debt." Space did vote for the 2010 budget, a vote that in the U.S. House of Representatives was mostly along party lines, 233-193. (Seventeen Democrats voted with Republicans in opposition.) One might argue that the budget is more President Barack Obama's than Nancy Pelosi's -- the president proposes the budget, and Congress votes on it. But Pelosi, as speaker of the House, leads the Democrats, who overwhelmingly approved the budget. But the ad gets it wrong on Space's vote on "debt." Here, the ad cites a vote from December 2009 that permitted the national debt limit to increase from $12.1 trillion to $12.39 trillion. The vote in this case was 218 to 214, with 39 Democrats joining all the Republicans. In this case, Space voted with the Republicans and against raising the debt limit. So the ad gets this point wrong. • Space voted for "job-killing energy taxes." This is Americans for Job Security's way of saying that Space voted for major energy legislation (Republicans lately have been fond of putting "job-killing" in front of many things the Democrats support.) But as we've pointed out before, the legislation was for a cap-and-trade system, not an energy tax. At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Presumably, the costs associated with that end up getting passed on to consumers. PolitiFact Ohio looked into this issue previously, when Republican candidate Bob Gibbs attacked Space for voting for the legislation, saying the measure would cost the average household "approximately $1,761 per year in increased energy rates." We found that number to be a wild exaggeration, based on estimates that were not part of the bill that Space voted for. We rated that statement Pants on Fire. And whether the measure is job-killing is also a contested issue. Some say it will actually create jobs, and there's a lively debate on the issue. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that employment rates would be "slightly lower" if cap-and-trade passes. Here, we'll note that Space did vote for the cap-and-trade legislation, but calling it a "energy tax" is not an accurate way to describe the measure. • Space voted for a "wasteful stimulus." Again, Space did vote in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, popularly known as the economic stimulus. Whether it was "wasteful" is still a matter for debate at this point. (We've done many fact-checks on the stimulus, read them all here.) We should point out that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released new estimates on Aug. 24, 2010, that the stimulus added between 1.4 million and 3.3 million jobs to the economy, compared with not having any stimulus. Still, the economy was in such bad shape that overall employment declined anyway, as we'll see in the next point. • "And we still lost more than 2.5 million jobs." To check this jobs number, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Given the ad's content, we think it's fair to start counting from about the time the stimulus passed to today. There are several different ways to calculate employment numbers, so we decided to look at two measures. Both supported the ads' claim. First, we looked at total employment, the number of workers in the United States. It was 132.8 million in February 2009, and 130.4 million in June 2010. (June is the most recent month with final numbers; data for July and August are still preliminary.) That's a difference of 2.4 million workers, very close to the ad's statement. If you look at only private employment, there were 110.3 million people employed in February 2009 and 107.7 million employed in June 2010. That's a difference of 2.6 million people. So the ad's claim on jobs lost since the Democrats passed their legislation is accurate. In deciding upon a Truth-O-Meter ruling for this ad, we had a lot to consider on the many different points the ad raises. The ad's bottom line is that the Democrats passed legislation that Space voted for, and overall employment still declined. But the ad gets some of its details wrong, most notably Space's vote on increasing the debt ceiling. That point is flat-out wrong. The ad also mischaracterizes cap-and-and trade legislation as an energy tax. Space did vote for cap-and-trade, the 2010 budget and the stimulus. Given the ad's inaccuracies, we rate its statement Half True.	None	Americans for Job Security	None	None	None	2010-09-27T12:07:26	2010-09-23	['None']
pomt-05891	"If you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax on it."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/07/chain-email/home-sales-tax-e-mail-surfaces-again/	"THIS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!" said the message that arrived in our e-mail box on Feb. 2, which warned of a "ploy to steal billions from unsuspecting homeowners." "Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it?" the e-mails says. "That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home, etc." the e-mail says, adding that "under the new health care bill, all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% sales tax." The e-mail, circulating now in Rhode Island, directs recipients to GOP.gov, "the Website of the Republican majority in Congress." It also encourages recipients to forward the message to everyone in their address books. It turns out that versions of this e-mail have been around for a few years, sparked by a provision in the new health care law, sometimes referred to as Obamacare, that is designed to cover some costs of the program. In April 2010, Snopes.com declared it False and FactCheck.org determined that it was bogus, a massive misstatement of a tax that would fall on relatively few people. And one year ago, national PolitiFact gave it a Pants on Fire because it was so deceptive. Because the e-mail has gotten new life in Rhode Island, we thought we’d remind people about the facts behind this claim. First of all, the 3.8-percent tax the e-mail cites, due to take effect next year, doesn't apply to taxpayers making less than $200,000 in the year of the sale. (The limit for couples is $250,000 in adjusted gross income.) Any profit from the house sale is not included in the income calculation. This limitation alone excludes the vast majority of homeowners. The nonprofit, pro-business Tax Foundation estimated in 2010 that this provision alone would make the new tax irrelevant to about 98 percent of families. It would only apply to those with the highest incomes. Next, it isn’t a sales tax at all, because it applies only to the profit from the home sale, not the sales price itself. Third, if the property you're selling is your primary residence -- and not a second home, vacation home or rental property -- you can turn a profit of $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) before the tax kicks in. In addition, the tax is assessed only on the amount of profit that exceeds that limit. (The median sale price for a home in the U.S. was $164,500 in December, 2011, one big reason why the vast majority of Americans won't be affected by the tax.) (Other property, such as that second home, would incur the tax, but, again, your basic income has to be high enough for you to be hit.) The 3.8-percent tax is in addition to the existing capital gains tax that must be paid now. That rate is generally 15 percent. So consider a couple who sells their home for $1 million after buying it many years ago for $100,000. If they earn $249,000 that year, they will pay no new tax. If they earn $251,000, they will be taxed. Although the profit on the home sale will be $900,000, the first $500,000 is not taxed. They will have to pay 3.8 percent on the remaining $400,000, in addition to the usual capital gains tax. The National Association of Realtors (Realtor.org) has an 11-page booklet, "The 3.8% Tax; Real Estate Scenarios & Examples," that outlines various scenarios and shows who will need to worry about the tax. Our ruling The chain e-mail claim that "if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8 percent sales tax" is untrue on so many levels as to be ridiculous. It's not a sales tax because it doesn't apply to the full sale price of the home, only the profit made in the sale. It's not going to apply to the vast majority of Americans, only those whose income is more than $200,000 ($250,000 for couples). It's not going to apply to most people selling their home because they won't be getting $250,000 more than they paid for it ($500,000 for couples). Because the e-mail wildly misrepresents one aspect of the new health care law, we rate it Pants on Fire. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

The group, which opposes Obamacare, has run a handful of ads featuring people telling health care "horror stories" meant to tug on the heartstrings. We’ve looked at a couple and explained how they can be misleading. But a pair of new ads take an entirely different tack to undercut support from Democratic Sens.

In these ads, a woman on screen trashes political ads in her 30-second personal pitch. "People don’t like political ads. I don’t like them either. But health care isn’t about politics," she says. "It’s about people. And millions of people have lost their health insurance, millions of people can’t see their own doctors, and millions are paying more and getting less." We’ve tackled claims about lost insurance and access to personal doctors before. But we haven’t heard someone say that the health care law is causing people to pay more for less, so we decided to check it out. Paying more There are a lot of factors in the health care law — and health insurance in general — that make it difficult to pin down whether people are paying more or less for coverage. In general, insurance premiums were increasing every year well before Obamacare became law. In fact, rates have increased consistently during the last 15 years. But there are signs that the rate of the increase has declined since the law was passed. Kaiser Family Foundation, for example, surveyed people who purchase insurance through their employer. Here are the average annual cost of premiums: Year Single % increase Family % increase 1999 $2,196 $5,791 2000 $2,471 12.52% $6,438 11.17% 2001 $2,689 8.82% $7,061 9.68% 2002 $3,083 14.65% $8,003 13.34% 2003 $3,383 9.73% $9,068 13.31% 2004 $3,695 9.22% $9,950 9.73% 2005 $4,024 8.90% $10,880 9.35% 2006 $4,242 5.42% $11,480 5.51% 2007 $4,479 5.59% $12,106 5.45% 2008 $4,704 5.02% $12,680 4.74% 2009 $4,824 2.55% $13,375 5.48% 2010 $5,049 4.66% $13,770 2.95% 2011 $5,429 7.53% $15,073 9.46% 2012 $5,615 3.43% $15,745 4.46% 2013 $5,884 4.79% $16,351 3.85% Other than a sharp increase between 2010 to 2011, the Obama years have experienced the smallest rate increases of the last 14 years. Throughout much of the early 2000s, premium increases of 9 percent or more were the norm. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid also found a slowdown in the increase in health costs during the last four years, including a modest 4 percent increase from 2011 to 2012. The government attributed the decrease in health costs to the economic downturn. Kaiser, too, said the recession accounted for much of the decline, though they said the health care law may have played a role, too. Because of the law, people making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level are now eligible for subsidies to buy insurance, and for many of them, costs are going down. Those costs are capped at a percent of their income. But some people may see rate increases on existing policies or as they transition to new plans. Insurers can no longer deny individuals with pre-existing conditions, and there is now a much larger pool of people looking to purchase coverage. For younger, healthier people, this means they are now taking on some of the financial burden so older or sick people can buy insurance at a reasonable price. (This is especially true for young males, since young women were often charged more, and even more so if they don’t qualify for premium subsidies.) There were also people who previously purchased very cheap plans. But those policies provided very little coverage or capped their benefits at low levels, which the new health care law bars. So they’re getting more coverage, albeit at a greater cost. Getting less? Which gets us to our next point. We found it strange that the ad claimed that people are getting less under the Affordable Care Act. In fact, we’ve usually heard the opposite from critics of the law that people are now paying for types of coverage they don’t need. The favorite example is single men who now will now have maternity coverage if they buy a plan on the individual market. In October 2013, Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., grilled Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius on this very point. "An insurance policy has a series of benefits whether you use them or not," Sebelius said during her testimony on the Hill. "And that is why the health care premiums are increasing this high," Ellmers said. "We’re forcing them to buy things that they will never need." "Individual policies cover families. Men often do need maternity coverage for their spouses and for their families," Sebelius responded. "To the best of your knowledge, has a man ever delivered a baby?" Elmers asked. The discussion ended there. So are you getting less coverage, or getting more than you need? We asked Americans for Prosperity to clarify their position. "Getting less speaks to a multitude of data points that has been America's Obamacare experience so far: botched website, shrinking provider networks, a string of broken promises, missed deadlines, and unilateral rule changes that have kept the entire country in limbo ever since this debacle rolled out," said spokesman Levi Russell. That’s a pretty ambiguous definition of "less." We think most people would assume "less" is referring to the amount of coverage or benefits under the law. Americans are getting more benefits under the law in a number of ways -- including, in some cases, being able to buy affordable insurance for the first time. In addition, insurance purchased in the individual and small group marketplace must meet 10 essential health benefits. This includes coverage for emergency services and hospitalization, prescription drugs, free preventative coverage for things ranging from basic immunizations to HIV screening, and maternity care. The law also caps out-of-pocket costs, providing greater protection from exorbitant hospital bills. The most a person could pay for health care in a year is $6,300; the most a family can pay is $12,600. Before the law passed, some insurers capped annual or lifetime benefits, forcing people who thought they were covered to pay large hospital bills once they passed the threshold. People with pre-existing conditions are also seeing a lot more benefits, since they previously couldn’t buy a policy at all. So it’s a tough sell to say millions are getting less. And for many, they aren’t paying more, either. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said "millions are paying more and getting less" under Obamacare. We found their explanation of "less" rather dubious. Most people on the individual market are getting more benefits under the law. At worst, they’re paying more to get more, though in many cases they’re actually paying less. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11983	"We’re the only developed nation in the world that doesn’t have paid maternity leave."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/28/claire-mccaskill/us-only-developed-nation-without-mandated-paid-mat/	Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill hosted dozens of town halls throughout the state in August. She made several bold statements during her visits with constituents, but one claim caught our attention. "We’re the only developed nation in the world that doesn’t have paid maternity leave," McCaskill said on Aug. 22, 2017 at a town hall in Monett, Missouri. Last year, PolitiFact rated a similar statement by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand as Mostly True, but a lot can change in year. So we decided McCaskill’s statement was worth a follow-up. The most frequently used measure of determining a developed country is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), according to University of Missouri Associate law professor Sam Halabi. The United States became a member of the OECD in 1961, and is now one of 35 member countries. As of 2016, the United States had the third highest GDP per capita in the world. Sarah Feldman, a spokesperson for Sen. McCaskill, cited last year’s fact-check on Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand as evidence. "Senator McCaskill and Senator Gillibrand made the same statement, with a few small differences: ‘industrial’ vs. ‘developed’ and ‘paid family leave’ vs. ‘paid maternity leave,’" Feldman said. "Maternity leave is a subset of paid family leave, so if a country has paid family leave it would have maternity leave as well." Maternity leave in the U.S. The United States ranks dead last in a study conducted by the OECD on the national paid maternity leave policies of its member countries. The average amount of paid leave time for mothers among its members was a little over one year, as of 2016. Mexico comes in second-to-last place. Though there are some United States companies that provide paid maternity leave for employees, like Etsy, Ikea and Twitter, there is no national mandate. The Family and Medical Leave Act requires that mothers have a minimum of 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. California, Rhode Island and New Jersey are the only states with paid maternity leave mandates, and New York will join them beginning in 2018. But California and New Jersey only require six weeks of partial income replacement, and Rhode Island only requires four weeks of 60 percent income replacement. That’s nowhere near what some countries mandate that employers provide. Jessica Ciccone, St. Louis University School of Law director of communications, worked with Missouri Sen. Jill Schupp on Senate Bill 69, which would have created a state family and medical leave program this past legislative session. Gov. Eric Greitens signed an executive order providing paid maternity leave for the executive branch and encouraging the legislature to pass a similar measure. Ciccone cited an International Labour Organization study, which found Papua New Guinea and the United States are the only two of the 185 countries and territories reported in the study that do not provide paid maternity leave. Papua New Guinea is not considered an industrialized nation. Our ruling Senator McCaskill said the United States is the only developed nation without paid maternity leave. Based on OECD and ILO data, the United States is the only industrialized nation without paid maternity leave. Yet, as previously reported in PolitiFact, some nations with paid maternity leave exclude certain groups of workers, meaning it isn’t quite universal. In the same sense, the United States has some states that do mandate paid maternity leave and parents can take unpaid time off after a child is born or adopted, although there isn’t a national law. We rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Claire McCaskill	None	None	None	2017-09-28T16:17:31	2017-08-22	['None']
pomt-14651	Texas has the sixth-highest property taxes in the nation.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/22/jeff-judson/texas-has-sixth-highest-property-taxes-nation/	Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio faces two opponents in the March 2016 Republican primary, including Jeff Judson, a former San Antonio Tea Party director who is citing his record of "fighting for low taxes and limited government" in his campaign to represent District 121. A Dec.1, 2015, post on the Conservatives in Action blog quoted Judson saying, "Texas has the 6th-highest property taxes in the country even though we have very conservative state officials, but not municipal officials." Judson made the statement as a criticism of Straus' leadership. Texans are probably not paying the nation’s highest total taxes. According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, in 2012 Texas ranked 46th in state-local taxes per resident. Still, Judson made us wonder if Texas property taxes are comparatively steep. From the top, we noticed a couple of considerations distinguishing Texas. Property taxes might be higher here because unlike most states, Texas levies no state personal income tax. Notably too, unlike in some states, Texas property tax rates are set locally, not by the state, according to the Texas comptroller. That’s because the state lacks the constitutional authority to levy a property tax, according to the Texas Legislative Council. Generally under the current system, a county appraisal district does an annual property valuation, then each area city, county, school and special district (like hospital and road districts) set the respective tax rate necessary to raise the money needed to fund the related adopted budget. And according to U.S. Census Bureau data, property taxes in 2013, the latest year of available data, were the source of 81.6 percent of local tax revenue in Texas (the national average for this figure was 46.7 percent). When we asked Judson how he reached his Texas ranking, he directed us to an Aug. 13, 2015, post on his Facebook page that cited a blog post published that day by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank focused on national, state and local tax policy. The foundation tends to argue for lower tax rates under the premise that, as a 2015 foundation report put it, " a state with lower tax costs will be more attractive to business investment and more likely to experience economic growth." The foundation’s August 2016 post, drawing on 2013 Census data, calculated and mapped the average amount of residential property tax paid as a percentage of home value state by state; the Texas rate proved lower only than those of New Jersey, Illinois, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Wisconsin and higher than the rates in the other 44 states. According to the post, written by Tax Foundation policy analyst Jared Walczak, the calculation only considered taxes on owner occupied-housing, not property taxes paid by businesses and those passed along from landlords to renters. So, according to the foundation’s calculations of home property taxes as a share of home values, property taxes in Texas in 2013 were the nation’s sixth-highest, as Judson said. Mindful the foundation looked at average residential taxes, we wondered about taking into account the variety of property values and tax rates around Texas. Were average rates alone fairly representative? Maybe so. A 2013 report on property taxes from the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, notes that in general, "most of the variation (in property tax burdens) is due to variation across rather than within states;" however, the researchers found that Texas was among three states with the most variation in property tax levels as a share of home prices. Another analysis We wondered how organizations other than the Tax Foundation went about comparing property taxes across the country. Texas advocates including Dick Lavine of the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities and Dale Craymer of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association suggested we consider a 2015 comparison study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy which calculates the rates of four different types of property taxes in the biggest city in each state, a rural city in each state, plus the country’s 50 largest cities overall. The report’s rankings suggest that Texas’s biggest cities (especially Houston, San Antonio, El Paso and Fort Worth) have had some of the highest urban homestead property taxes, industrial property taxes and apartment property taxes compared to large cities in other states. But what about on the county level? In some counties, like Jeff Davis, Pecos, Zapata, Starr, and Mason, homeowners paid less than 1 percent of their home value in annual property taxes from 2007 to 2011, while in Wilson, Bastrop and Travis counties, homeowners paid more than 1.5 percent of home values annually, according to the report. Residents of Bexar and Harris counties paid over 2 percent of their home values in property taxes in that period, according to Census data. The disparity between counties also comes through in real-dollar terms, although measures of taxes in terms of dollars paid can be distorted by the difference in home prices from county to county. Another map from the Tax Foundation used real dollar amounts and illustrates just how much property taxes can vary from county to county. This one estimates the property tax burden using IRS data on the amount of real estate taxes people declare on their taxes. The counties paying the most in dollar values are Travis ($7,553), Kendall ($6,916) and Fort Bend ($6,813), while those paying the least are Dickens ($1,325), Stonewall ($1,425) and Hudspeth ($1,450). Lavine, asked how best to compare taxes between different jurisdictions within and across state lines, suggested we consider the share of personal income paid in taxes. Using IRS Statistics of Income data to calculate a rough average amount of real estate taxes paid as a percentage of average income reveals huge differences from county to county -- residents of Crane County pay as little as 2.9% of their income by this metric, while in Dallas County, it’s closer to 13.9% -- a large spread. So there’s a great deal of variation in the property tax rate within Texas whether it’s measured in percentage of income, percentage of home value, or raw dollar amounts. Yet another factor to think about when considering the property tax burden for the average Texan is the rate of home ownership. The Tax Foundation map Judson cited considered the percentage of home value that’s paid in property taxes on owner-occupied housing, but only 62.7% of housing in Texas is owner-occupied. Texas had the ninth-lowest rate of homeownership in the nation from 2010 to 2014, according to Census Bureau data. But lest one think property taxes are paid only by the rich, it should be noted that while the property tax burden in Texas is not necessarily shouldered by every taxpayer, it consumes a fairly equal percentage of family income across earning groups. The lowest 20% of earners pay 3.8% of their income in property taxes, the next quintile pays 2.8%, the middle quintile pays 2.6%, the fourth quintile pays 2.8%, the next 15% pays 3.2%, the next 5% pays 3.1%, and the top 1% pays 2.1%, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Because so much is determined on the local level, it’s worth noting that state legislation is limited in its ability to reduce the property tax burden, even through expanding exemptions. Although an amendment expanding exemptions for school district property taxes was approved by voters in November 2015, an analysis by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee found that such legislation was unlikely to lower property tax bills for many homeowners because increasing home values will offset whatever relief is provided by the legislation. Our Ruling Jeff Judson, in a criticism of Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, said Texas has the sixth-highest property taxes in the nation. While it may be true that on average, Texas property taxes are the sixth-highest in the nation, the actual taxpayer burden on state residents varies hugely from county by county, making the average less representative. We rate this claim as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-03297	"The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office, did an analysis and said that passing comprehensive immigration reform will reduce the federal deficit by $200 billion over the next decade."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/01/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-passing-senate-approve/	For many people, creating a path to citizenship for individuals who came into the United States illegally seems counterproductive. But U. S. Rep. David Cicilline says that it makes economic sense. During an appearance from Washington on the WPRI-TV program "Newsmakers," which aired July 21, Cicilline said passing the bipartisan immigration bill already approved by the Senate would save the country billions. "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office, did an analysis and said that passing comprehensive immigration reform will reduce the federal deficit by $200 billion over the next decade," said Cicilline. Roughly $20 billion per year? When we inquired, Cicilline's office sent a link to the CBO report. It does indeed offer that as an estimate. The actual projected savings: $197 billion from 2014 to 2023. The legislation would increase the deficit in 2014 by $2.5 billion but beginning in 2015, as new income and payroll tax revenues from the new workers start accumulating, it would cut away at the deficit by an ever-increasing amount, according to the budget office, starting at $4.7 billion and shaving as much as $55.9 billion in the final year of the projection. The savings will come despite the government having to pay an additional $82 billion over 10 years for health insurance subsidies, $29 billion for Medicaid for adults and children, $6 billion more for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (commonly known as food stamps) and $5.1 billion more for unemployment insurance. Why the savings? Passage of the law would increase federal revenues by $459 billion from 2014 to 2023, the report said. "That increase would stem largely from additional collections of income and payroll taxes, reflecting both an increase in the size of the U.S. labor force and changes in the legal status of some current workers." The report estimates that passing the immigration proposal would increase the number of permanent U.S. residents by 10.4 million and the number of temporary workers and their dependents by 1.6 million. (There would also be 1.6 million fewer unauthorized residents.) During that time, none of the immigrants who entered the country illegally would be eligible for Social Security or Medicare. And after that? The CBO estimated that immigration reform would reduce the deficit by $700 billion from 2024 to 2033, but those longer-range projections are less certain. PolitiFact usually doesn't offer rulings on predictions such as the ones in the CBO report. But we can say that Cicilline is correctly quoting the federal nonpartisan report. We rate the claim True.

pomt-08300	Says John Raese said he wants "1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/31/joe-manchin/lasers-sky-military-trying-it/	An ad from Joe Manchin, the Democratic candidate for Senate in West Virginia, uses a Star Wars theme to target his opponent as "Darth Raese." (Watch it before George Lucas' lawyers hear about it.) The Web ad shows video of John Raese, the Republican candidate, making these statements: "We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now." "I'm in the business of not providing jobs, I'm in the business of making money." "I don't agree with minimum wage." "We don't need the Department of Education." Manchin then uses a hunting rifle to shoot down a TIE fighter. (Not kidding!) The ad concludes, "No more crazy John Raese ideas." Raese does oppose the minimum wage, on the grounds that the free market should set wages; he recently defended that view in a candidates' debate. He also thinks the U.S. Department of Education should be abolished, because states and counties should run schools. His comment on business was a strong defense of the profit motive in running a business. But we were perplexed by his comment, "We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now." Manchin's ad provides it without context, as if Raese is calling for construction of the Death Star. So we decided to check into it. We tracked the comments back to an NBC News report about comments Raese made at a voters' forum sponsored in part by the tea party movement. Here's a fuller version of what he said (watch the video): "I want to put in a strategic defense initiative in this country that will take care of us and our friends ... Strategic Defense Initiative, better known as Star Wars: We need to bring it back," Raese said, referring to a defense program proposed by President Ronald Reagan. He said the U.S. should not negotiate with countries like Iran. He also made fun of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's name while the audience laughed. "What you do with them is you put them on notice that we have a defense system in our country that is the best, the best. Right now, any nuclear weapon launched from North Korea can hit Alaska and can almost hit California," he said. "We are sitting with the only technology in the world that works, and it's laser technology. We need 1,000 laser systems put in the sky, and we need it right now. That is (of) paramount importance," he said. The Raese campaign confirmed the extended remarks and pointed us to two opinion pieces by The Heritage Foundation that advocate missile defense, which means developing ways to intercept and destroy in-flight missiles launched by hostile forces. That would primarily be done by anti-ballistic missiles, but there's also been considerable research into Reagan's proposal to use some type of lasers. The pieces note correctly that Reagan was a strong supporter of missile defense. In recent years, President George W. Bush supported a long-range missile defense shield in Poland. President Barack Obama, on the other hand, scrapped the Bush administration plan in favor of a system designed to down short- and medium-range missiles from sites closer to Iran. So the "1,000 laser systems put in the sky" is a reference to a longer-term plan for missile defense that presumably would use lasers instead of missiles (hence, the "Star Wars" theme.) If you think using lasers for missile defense is fanciful, we should point out that the military is actively studying the use of lasers to knock missiles out of the sky. The technology remains controversial, though, because some military officials believe it hasn't really worked and is too expensive. In a test on Oct. 23, 2010, a jumbo jet outfitted with a laser gun failed to knock a test missile out of the sky as part of the Airborne Laser Test Bed program. In May 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Congress that he wanted to continue funding prototype testing as part of basic research, but that it was not realistic to use anti-missile lasers any time soon. Gates said a basic program near Iran, for example, would require 10 to 20 jets costing $1.5 billion each, plus hundreds of millions in operating expenses. "And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept," he added. Getting back to the Manchin video, Raese may have been speaking a little hyperbolically about putting "1,000 lasers systems in the sky." Clearly, the Manchin campaign could have used a more straightforward quote to indicate what Raese was talking about, but they cherry-picked a quote that sounded the most nutty. You can support or oppose a missile defense shield, but this ad gives a distorted view of Raese's position. In fact, we couldn't even figure it out at first. We're not sure what West Virginia voters will make of it. Still, Raese clearly supports beefing up efforts at laser-based missile defense. So we rate Manchin's statement Half True.

pomt-10162	"John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie...but Democrats blocked the reforms."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/30/john-mccain/fannie-freddie-and-john-at-odds-in-2006/	Seeking to portray Sen. John McCain as prescient on the financial crisis, McCain's campaign unveiled a new advertisement saying he had spotted problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago. "John McCain fought to rein in Fannie and Freddie ... but Democrats blocked the reforms," McCain's new ad says. As evidence, the ad points to McCain's support of a bill in 2006 to strengthen oversight of Fannie and Freddie, and Democrats' opposition to that bill. Those points merit caveats, but first, some context. Fannie and Freddie, private corporations created and sponsored by Congress to lower the cost of mortgage capital, quintupled in size between 1995 and 2004, as they pioneered the practice of selling bundled mortgages in the form of securities. Federal officials in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations sought greater authority to regulate them, but were largely stymied by Congress. In early September 2008, with home values plummeting, the government seized control of Fannie and Freddie to prevent them from failing, a move that could cost U.S. taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. McCain has taken heat for recent revelations that Freddie Mac paid a lobbying firm co-owned by his campaign manager, Rick Davis, $15,000 a month from 2005 through August 2008. But the campaign has called attention — in advertisements like this one — to McCain's support for tighter oversight of the companies. McCain did indeed co-sponsor the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, a bill that would have enhanced oversight of Freddie and Fannie. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., introduced the bill in January 2005 and immediately garnered co-sponsorship from two other Republican senators. McCain signed on in May 2006 after a damning federal report on accounting practices at Fannie Mae was released. "If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole," he said in a statement . The National Association of Home Builders opposed the bill, as did the National Association of Realtors. Senate Democrats said they supported some form of stricter oversight, but would not support a provision of Hagel's bill that would limit the size of the company's portfolios. Negotiations stalled and the bill never made it to the floor. Does McCain's support for that bill amount to fighting to rein in Freddie and Fannie? Sort of. Others had been fighting for Fannie-and-Freddie reform for more than a decade, and McCain signed onto the bill a year-and-a-half after it was introduced. And he reportedly didn't do too much for the bill beyond co-sponsoring it and issuing a statement. The McCain campaign has also noted that in 2003 he was one of five Republican senators to co-sponsor a prior bill to tighten oversight of Fannie and Freddie. Still, if he "fought" for reform, it wasn't exactly guns-a-blazin'. Did Democrats block the reforms? More or less. They preferred a pared-down bill, and so did not support Hagel's. McCain overstates his role in pushing for Fannie and Freddie reform, and slightly oversimplifies the dynamic at work in the Senate. We give his claim a Half True.

The first of these capped the amount of income from defined benefit schemes that seniors are able to exclude from the pension's income test. However, there is no record of Mr Xenophon having voted for the measure, and his office did not provide details of his support. He did vote for changes to the age pension assets test, which took effect on January 1, 2017. These amendments raised the "free area" threshold, below which a person's assets do not affect how much pension they receive. But they also doubled the rate at which payments are reduced for every $1,000 of assets above the threshold. Three experts told Fact Check that the results of the changes were mixed: some people with fewer assets will have had their pension increased, while relatively wealthy people with greater assets will have had their payments reduced or cut entirely. Figures issued recently by the Department of Social Services demonstrate this double-edged result, with 165,200 people benefitting from the changes and another 370,000 (roughly 9 per cent of pensioners, nationally) losing out. So, while the age pension itself has not been cut, some people's individual entitlements have been affected. This is not the case, however, for people who are less well-off. For example, home-owning couples with assets of less than $375,000 and individual homeowners ($250,000) will not have been affected. SA Unions also suggested to Fact Check that the Turnbull Government's Welfare Reform Bill was further evidence of Mr Xenophon voting to cut pensions. However, these changes do not affect seniors payments specifically and the bill is yet to pass the Senate.

pomt-07418	"The Georgia Lottery Corp. has only once in the past 16 years paid out the agreed upon 35 percent of proceeds to the account which funds the HOPE scholarship."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/27/allie-mccullen/luck-runs-out-student-lottery-claim/	With the cost of higher education rising every year, some students probably think they need to win the lottery to afford tuition. But others -- math majors probably -- believe there’s a more likely way for the Georgia Lottery Corp. to help students pay their bills. Student organizations along with some state lawmakers have called on the corporation, the quasi-governmental entity that runs the game, to provide a higher percentage of its proceeds to the HOPE scholarship fund. Last month Georgia Students for Public Higher Education, a group that has participated in public protests related to a variety of issues, and other student organizations criticized elected officials and the Geogia Lottery Corp. at a rally in downtown Atlanta in response to cuts in the HOPE scholarship program. Allie McCullen, a statewide organizer with Georgia Students for Public Higher Education and a senior at the University of Georgia, said in a speech: "The Georgia Lottery Corp. has only once in the past 16 years paid out the agreed upon 35 percent of proceeds to the account which funds the HOPE scholarship." Not a single PolitiFact scribe has yet to retire on a big-ticket prize. So we decided that in the meantime we’d look into whether the odds of the Georgia Lottery Corp. paying the agreed upon percentage to the HOPE scholarship are better than the 1 in 175 million odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot. McCullen said she obtained the figure from an article published in February in the University of Georgia’s student newspaper The Red and Black, a publication she has been quoted in several times this year. The Georgia Lottery Corp.’s numbers show the lottery provided 36.1 percent of its revenue toward education in 1995, 35 percent in 1996 and 35 percent in 1997. But McCullen, who has also been quoted in The New York Times, points to the steadily declining percentage of revenue going toward education as proof that the theme of her speech still stands. Since 1997 the percentage of revenue declined from 35 percent to a low of 25.6 percent in 2009. And the lottery has not provided 30 percent of its revenue to the education fund since 2004. "I do recognize I had incorrect information, but since 1997 we have not seen a return to the 35 percent," she said. "I think the opinion I expressed remains the same." Also in dispute, however, is what percentage of revenue the lottery is required to provide the scholarship fund. The statute states that net proceeds of the lottery should be 35 percent of gross revenue "as nearly as practical." The Georgia Lottery Corp. said in a statement to PolitiFact that the phrase was added to the statute to allow the lottery to be flexible and maximize its revenue. If the organization was legally required to provide 35 percent, it could not provide large enough cash prizes to entice those looking for a lucky day, the corporation said. "In fiscal year 1997, the Georgia Lottery returned 35 percent of lottery revenues to the state for lottery-funded educational programs in the amount of $581 million," the corporation said in a written statement. "In FY10, the Georgia Lottery raised a record $883.9 million for HOPE and Pre-K, accounting for 26.1 percent of lottery revenues. Undoubtedly, more Georgia students benefited from the larger dollar amount, not the larger percentage." The dollar amount in 2010 is more, but the Georga Lottery Corp. did not make a straight comparison. In 2010 dollars the $581 million in 1997 would be the equivalent of $789 million. But some elected officials do not believe the 35 percent number included in the legislation is meaningless. Rep. Stacey Evans, D-Smyrna, said the intent of the legislation was to ensure the lottery comes close to 35 percent. She said that intent is not respected today. "I’m not sure they’re even trying anymore," she said. "We need more oversight of them and need them to come close to that 35 percent." If McCullen had said the Georgia Lottery Corp. has not hit its target of 35 percent since 1997, the accuracy of her statement would have hinged on what "as nearly as practical" means and why the legislation even included the number 35 percent. The legislators who PolitiFact spoke with agreed that the number was included for a reason and the corporation has not come close to reaching that target in recent years. But, alas, McCullen said that in the past 16 years the Georgia Lottery Corp. met the 35 percent goal only once, but it has met the target three times. So she has a better chance of winning the lottery than receiving a True on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate her statement False.	None	Allie McCullen	None	None	None	2011-04-27T06:00:00	2011-03-02	['None']

pomt-12876	North Carolina could save "literally tens of millions of dollars" if it stopped prosecuting 16-year-olds as adults.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/jan/27/duane-hall/raise-age-could-juvenile-justice-reform-save-north/	At least one North Carolina legislator is saying the state could save millions of dollars if it would stop prosecuting all 16- and 17-year-olds in the adult criminal justice system. Only two states – North Carolina and New York – consider everyone as young as 16 to be adults if they commit a crime, no matter the severity or circumstances. But that might change this year. Legislators and law enforcement officers are campaigning to treat those youthful offenders as juveniles (except for serious crimes), like most of the country already does. Both the liberal N.C. Justice Center and the conservative John Locke Foundation support it. But in recent years, several similar attempts to change the law have failed. So why do supporters think things are different now? "One of the objections to the bills I had was, obviously, cost," Rep. Duane Hall, a Raleigh Democrat, told the N.C. Courts Commission in December. "But all the studies and all other states have shown that juvenile systems save states literally tens of millions of dollars." Hall has co-sponsored "Raise The Age" bills in years past and was speaking last month to drum up support for another bill he plans to file this year. Since the legislature is now back in session, we thought it was time to revisit Hall’s claim. His meaning is clear: He says "all other states" have saved millions, implying North Carolina would, too. But why has cost been a concern in the past? Expanding the juvenile-justice system isn’t free. It’s more personalized to focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment, so the costs per person can sometimes be greater than in the prison system. Yet there is a wealth of evidence that keeping teens out of adult prisons leads to lower recidivism, which is the term for when someone commits another crime after being released. That lowers the burden on courts and prisons, and society benefits, too – there are fewer crime victims, and people who would have been committing crimes are instead at school or work. But could those benefits really lead to "literally tens of millions of dollars" in savings, like Hall said? Spend money to make money William Lassiter, North Carolina’s head of juvenile justice, said that past reforms to the juvenile-justice system have led to short-term cost increases but long-term savings – to the tune of more than $40 million. Lassiter pointed to reforms for youth offenders in the late 1990s. He said they were largely responsible for decreasing juvenile infractions from 48,089 in 2006 to 29,542 in 2015 – a nearly 40 percent drop. "In 2008 our budget was $178 million," he said. "Last year it was $132 million. So already we have saved the taxpayers a significant amount of money." There’s a large body of evidence that juvenile programs lead to lower recidivism rates than adult programs. Moving teens from adult prisons and into the juvenile system, Lassiter said, would lead to future savings. "It's an evidence-based decision," Lassiter said. A study from Princeton University and the Brookings Institute backs up that line of thinking. "While it costs states billions of dollars a year to arrest, prosecute, incarcerate, and treat offenders, investing in successful delinquency-prevention programs can save taxpayers seven to 10 dollars for every dollar invested, primarily in the form of reduced spending on prisons," the study concluded. NC costs, benefits In North Carolina specifically, the most recent study on a potential "Raise The Age" law is several years old. In 2009, the N.C. General Assembly created the Youth Accountability Planning Task Force, which hired The Vera Institute of Justice to conduct a cost-benefit study. It made several key findings about treating 16- and 17-year-olds as juveniles. Some back up Hall’s claim; other’s don’t. The study found it would increase the state’s costs by $49 million per year at the start. That’s a knock against Hall’s claim. But it also found the changes would benefit the state economy (by reducing crime, hospital visits, lost days at work and more) to the tune of $102 million per year due to an expected 10 percent drop in recidivism – certainly a point in Hall’s favor. Overall, the study reached a favorable conclusion: "These results indicate that the benefits of the plan outweigh the costs and that, from a cost-benefit standpoint, the policy change merits consideration." North Carolina might receive other benefits from the law as well. A legislative report in 2013 said the change would create 450 jobs. And Lassiter said the state is currently ineligible for potentially millions in public safety grants because it’s noncompliant with federal rules for dealing with teenage offenders. And Hall said there are also intangible economic benefits to consider. "Kids in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, all around us, they could do the exact same act and not get the (criminal) record," he said. "And that’s going to make it so much easier for them to get into college or get a job than our kids." He's also right that other states have seen substantial savings. A few examples: Connecticut’s juvenile budget decreased $2 million after it passed a "Raise The Age" law. Texas was able to cut $100 million from its prisons – which researchers attributed, in part, to the substantial reduction in recidivism that new juvenile justice reforms were responsible for. University of Arizona researchers found that sending teen drug offenders through special treatment courts rather than the criminal justice system resulted in net benefits of $84,000 per teen. And in Wisconsin, a study found that "for every 1,000 youth returned to the juvenile system there will be $5.8 million in direct savings each year through reduced law enforcement costs, court costs, and losses to victims." Our ruling Rep. Duane Hall said that despite concerns over the cost of moving youthful offenders in North Carolina from the adult justice system to the juvenile justice system, the move could save the state "literally tens of millions of dollars." The state government would actually see increased costs according to one study – although the same study found the economy would reap a net benefit of tens of millions of dollars. Furthermore, the head of the state’s juvenile justice system said while previous reforms did cost millions to implement, they have since led to fewer youths in the system and corresponding savings of more than $40 million. Hall is also right that other states have found juvenile justice reforms including taking teenage offenders out of adult prisons do lead to less crime and long-term savings – possibly as much as $10 for every $1 spent on reform. Yet despite all the evidence about long-term savings, there’s also no denying there would be short-term cost increases for state government. For that reason we rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9a456e6f-a40d-4b4c-be0f-f39fc85aeab2 Share the Facts Politifact 1 6 Politifact Rating: Says North Carolina could save "literally tens of millions of dollars" if it stopped prosecuting 16-year-olds as adults.

pomt-08847	"Police officers in this state have that right," to check the immigration status of people they arrest.	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/09/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-says-florida-police-can-check-immigr/	The red-hot topic of immigration came up again in the Aug. 5, 2010, debate between Bill McCollum and Rick Scott, the Republican candidates for governor. Referencing Rick Scott's May 2010 TV ad about the need for stronger immigration laws, Bill McCollum alleged that Scott doesn't understand the state laws already on the books. "As the next governor of Florida, you're going to pass a law that allows police, when they make an arrest, to be able to find out if somebody has been here illegally. That shows an ignorance of Florida law. Currently, police officers in this state have that right already. What Arizona has is a mandate that says when you're stopped, detained, or arrested, police officers shall check to see whether you're legal or illegal. I favor that law for Florida, I favor the Arizona immigration law," McCollum said. PolitiFact Florida has already reviewed Scott's explanation of the law (Half True) and McCollum's shifting support for it (Full Flop). This time, we want to check the claim that Florida police officers are able to check the immigration status of individuals who have been arrested. Turns out, McCollum is right. On June 29, 2010, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced that law enforcement officials in all 67 Florida counties will now have access to the biometrics-based immigration records in the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT), a database maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. Police officers will be able to run the fingerprints of individuals they arrest through the database to identify both lawful and unlawful aliens. Previously, police officers were only able to use the fingerprints to check the individuals' criminal history through a database maintained by the FBI. ICE explained the process in a press release: "If any fingerprints match those of someone in the DHS biometric system, the new automated process notifies ICE. ICE evaluates each case to determine the individual's immigration status and takes appropriate enforcement action. This includes aliens who are in lawful status and those who are present without lawful authority. Once identified through fingerprint matching, ICE will respond with a priority placed on aliens convicted of the most serious offenses first -- such as those with convictions for major drug offenses, murder, rape and kidnapping." The program is part of ICE's Secure Communities initiative, a plan that "improves public safety by implementing a comprehensive, integrated approach to identify and remove criminal aliens from the United States," according to the ICE website. As of June 2010, 23 states participated in the program, and ICE plans to make the system available nationwide by 2013. So McCollum is correct. Florida police officers are able to check the immigration status of those who are arrested. Still, after reviewing McCollum's comment and the Rick Scott ad that he referenced in more detail, we should probably provide some more clarification to our readers. First, the ad. According to the narrator, "Arizona is tackling the problem of illegal immigration, but Bill McCollum rejects the Arizona approach." The ad then goes on to say that "Rick Scott backs Arizona's law. He'll bring it to Florida, and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally. That's common sense." As we said above, Florida already allows its police officers to "check if the people they arrest are here legally." But the Arizona immigration law actually requires police officers to do much more than that. As we explained in the previous item, Arizona's law allows people to be questioned if they are lawfully stopped or questioned for any reason, whether it's a traffic stop, or a municipal violation like letting your grass grow too tall in a community that requires frequent mowing. In other words, Arizona police officers are required to check an individual's immigration status even if that individual is not under arrest. That is not the case in Florida. Heather Smith, a press representative from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, told us in an e-mail that the agency is not aware of any court ruling or a legal opinion issued by the Florida Attorney General's office that "specifically prohibits an inquiry of an individual’s immigration status" during an investigative encounter. In other words, Florida police officers can, in theory, check the immigration status of someone pulled over for a traffic stop, but there is currently nothing in state law that would require them to do so. Implementing Arizona's law in Florida, as Scott and McCollum both favor, would change that. We also considered the counter argument that Scott's ad went up in May of this year, several weeks before the joint ICE and FDLE announcement, so McCollum's implication that Scott does not understand Florida law would not have been valid at the time. Smith told us, however, that Florida police officers have always had the ability to check an arrested individual's immigration record. Before the implementation of the Secure Communities initiative, however, they had to rely on named-based checking. The new ICE program uses "state of the art technology" and allows police officers to use digital fingerprint data for a more accurate determination. Finally, we must note that on July 28, 2010, Judge Susan Bolton of Federal District Court issued a preliminary injunction against parts of the Arizona law -- including the requirement that we discuss above. The injunction prevents certain provisions of the law from going into effect. Bolton wrote in her ruling that immigration falls under the jurisdiction of the federal government and that "there is a substantial likelihood that officers will wrongfully arrest legal resident aliens." To recap. McCollum says that Scott's ad "shows an ignorance of Florida law," because Florida police officers already have the right to check the immigration status of those who are arrested. We found that implementing an Arizona-style mandate would change existing immigration enforcement laws in the state. Currently, there is no law requiring Florida police to check the status of those who are lawfully stopped or detained, but there is nothing that would prevent them from doing so. Still, our focus in this fact-check is McCollum's claim about individuals who are already arrested, and with that, he is on solid ground. We rate this True.

pomt-12771	There were "50 percent more murders" in Orlando and Orange County, Fla., last year "than in all of Sweden."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/feb/22/carl-bildt/former-swedish-pm-says-more-murders-florida-where-/	Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt is taking a card out of President Donald Trump’s playbook: foreign relations in 140 characters or less. At a political rally in Melbourne, Fla., on Feb. 18, Trump wrongly suggested a horrible crime had taken place in Sweden. After media reports, including PolitiFact, noted that no terrorist incident transpired in Sweden Feb. 17, Trump tried to clarify his statement multiple times. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Bildt — unsatisfied with Trump’s latest charge — struck back. "Last year there were app 50% more murders only in Orlando/Orange in Florida, where Trump spoke the other day, than in all of Sweden. Bad," Bildt wrote in a tweet Feb. 20. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It’s worth noting that Trump actually spoke at the Orlando Melbourne International airport, which is approximately 65 miles southeast of Orlando and located in Brevard County, not Orange. Still, the shade being thrown was too much to resist, so PolitiFact Florida decided to take a look at Bildt’s claim for ourselves. What we found is that Bildt’s assertion relies on data that isn’t uniformly available yet, and is based on a single point of time. Not only does picking one year make it hard to make meaningful comparisons, it also includes the year with the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Crunching the numbers We never heard back from Bildt’s assistant about where he got his numbers, which made it impossible to verify the specific point he made. Bildt specifically said "last year" in his comparison, but 2016 data regarding homicides won’t be uniformly available in Sweden until March 30. Furthermore, experts said using Orlando’s 2016 murder count inflates the real murder rate because of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. "You can't make meaningful comparisons when you’re using outliers, which is why it’s better to look at long-term trends in crime," said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor at the State University of New York in Oswego. With these factors in mind, we tried to answer the overarching question Bildt’s point makes: Are there typically more murders in Orange County, which includes Orlando and has a population of about 1.2 million people, than in Sweden, population 9.8 million as of 2015? To get the most accurate picture of the situation, Schildkraut compiled 10 years worth of data (2006-15) from the U.S. Census Bureau, the FBI Uniform Crime Report and the The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. Two important notes before we go on. First, Bildt said murders. The FBI tracks homicides. Murder falls under the larger homicide umbrella, which also includes justifiable or excusable homicides, for example. The statistics that Schildkraut provided are for murder and non-negligent manslaughter, which are still homicides, but eliminate the other justifiable or excusable cases. Second, Sweden, Orange County, Orlando and Melbourne have drastically different populations, so to get the best idea of how the Florida locations compare to Sweden it’s better to calculate the homicide rates and then compare. That rate can be calculated by dividing the number of homicides by the population and then multiplying that total by 100,000. For Orange County, Orlando and Sweden, Schildkraut found the number of homicides, the population and the homicide rate. That data shows that the homicide rate in Orange County and Orlando between 2006 to 2015 was significantly higher than Sweden’s. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com From 2006 to 2015, Sweden’s homicide rate has remained steady, hovering between 0.7 to 1.2 homicides for every 100,000 people. Orlando’s homicide rate has been significantly higher through the years. It peaked in 2006 with 22.6 homicides per 100,000 people in 2006. It’s lowest rate was in 2015, when there were 5.8 homicides per 100,000 people. As for Orange County, which pulls in the Orlando suburbs, the homicide rate was still significantly higher than in Sweden. In 2015, the homicide rate in Orange County was roughly 4.3 homicides for every 100,000 people. Even if you check Melbourne, the actual location of Trump’s speech, the pattern holds. Our ruling Bildt said, "Last year there were app 50% more murders only in Orlando/Orange in Florida, where Trump spoke the other day, than in all of Sweden. Bad." We're not sure where Bildt got his numbers from because data from 2016 is incomplete. But if history is any guide, he will actually have understated the comparison between Orlando, Orange County and Sweden. For almost a decade, homicide rates in those Florida municipalities have far exceeded that of Sweden. His argument also would have been on par for Melbourne too, had Bildt designated that as the city Trump spoke in. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/79abc69a-1b6b-43da-8af5-8f86e6eb3fb7	None	Carl Bildt	None	None	None	2017-02-22T16:57:39	2017-02-20	['Sweden', 'Orange_County,_California', 'Orlando,_Florida']
pomt-05149	Says 97 cents of every dollar played "represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/20/oregon-lottery/does-97-cents-every-lottery-dollar-played-go-back-/	Every biennium, about a billion dollars flows into the state’s budget by way of the Oregon Lottery. People who play scratchers and video poker are, in a roundabout way, sending some of their cash to schools and parks and other ventures even as they hope to win the big one. But what piece of the overall Lottery revenues does that represent? Well, according to the Lottery website, billboards, TV spots and print ads, it’s about 97 cents on the dollar. Here’s what the Lottery said in a recent print ad that appeared in the June 17, 2012 Oregonian: "Every time a dollar is played on a Lottery game, think about ninety-seven cents of that dollar helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all. Ninety-seven cents represents over $500 million dollars that is returned to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds. Ninety-seven cents really adds up." We’d seen this same messaging several times before (some variation of the 97-cent ad has been in circulation since October 2010). And so had at least one of our readers who wrote in asking us to take a look at this claim. We called the Oregon Lottery’s spokesman, Chuck Baumann, to see where they got the figures. He pointed us to a lengthy report on the Lottery’s home page that details the operation’s finances for fiscal year 2011. The pertinent table, he said, was on Page 24 and showed that the Lottery had net sales of some $9.8 billion in 2011. Of that cash, about $300 million -- or 3 percent -- went to administrative expenses, which left 97 percent for the state. The thing is, not all of that leftover 97 percent is going to community development. The same chart shows just $523 million going to the economic development fund -- the pot of money that helps schools and parks and other areas of the state. But, as most any math student can tell you, $523 million is not 97 percent of $9.8 billion -- it’s a bit more than 5 percent. The majority of it -- more than $9 billion -- went to "prizes to the public." After looking through the report, we found another breakdown of expenses that seemed to tell a different story altogether. This one, on Page 14, showed the Lottery’s total operating revenue at just over $1 billion. Of that money, $514 million went to operating expenses -- prizes, salaries and wages, game vendor charges, market research, public information, etc. Another $550 million went to the economic development fund -- about 52 percent of the the total operating revenues. We asked Baumann what the difference was between the two tables. The one he showed us, which has nearly $10 billion in revenues, counts something called "churn," he said. See, the state’s biggest source of income (as far as gambling goes) comes in the form of video Lottery. Let’s say you sit down to play and put $20 into the machine. You play the full $20 dollars and you wind up with $10 in winning credits and you play them and lose. Well, that all gets added up in the chart as $30 of revenues -- even though that subsequent $10 never existed as real cash into the system. Conversely, the operating revenues chart that we looked at only represents the initial $20 that you played -- the actual cash into the system. In the end though, it doesn’t really matter which way you look at it, the Lottery’s ads are clearly misleading. The way the ads read, you’d think 97 cents of each dollar goes to "helping schools get updated computers, parks get new trails, communities get new jobs and countless other projects that benefit us all." Now, the Lottery does note that $500 million dollars is returned "to Oregonians every year to help support job creation, schools, state parks and watersheds." But, however you slice it, that $500 million is not 97 cents of each dollar played. If you look at the big total, which includes the churn, that $500 million is about 5 percent of the Lottery revenues. With the smaller operating revenues budget, it’s a bit over 50 percent. If the Lottery were really returning 97 percent of every dollar played to those programs, the state’s budget problems would be smaller by at least a billion dollars a biennium. The Lottery argues that the prize money going back to players ultimately benefits the state’s economy -- that’s why some earlier ads simply said "97 cents of every dollar played comes back to Oregon." But even those ads mislead by highlighting state services. And what’s more, winnings don’t necessarily stay here. If you win $1 million in the Oregon Lottery, would you spend it all in Oregon? Baumann defended the earlier version but acknowledged that you could "certainly misconstrue" the meaning of the ad we’re ruling on. We think it’s more than a matter of misconstruing meaning. For nearly two years, the Oregon Lottery has been running a disingenuous ad campaign that tries to paint playing the Lottery as giving back to schools, parks and other economic development projects. Yes, a piece of the revenue goes there -- but not 97 cents of every dollar played. We think a state agency that deals with money in billions -- and spends nearly $13 million a year on advertising, market research and public information -- should know better.

pomt-07577	As a prosecutor, Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser did not investigate or file charges in a case involving 30-year pedophile priest, then participated in cover-up.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/29/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-supreme-court-jus/	A new TV ad claims that in 1978, when Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser was a district attorney, he didn’t ask police to investigate an abuse case involving a longtime pedophile priest, then refused to file charges and participated in a cover-up. The claims are made by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which frequently runs TV ads critical of Republicans. The group is also running an anti-Prosser ad linking the 13-year justice to Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Both ads were released less than two weeks before Prosser faces challenger assistant state attorney general JoAnne Kloppenburg in the April 5, 2011, election. The priest ad quickly sparked controversy partly because two brothers who were the victims in 1978 case repudiated it. Here’s what the narrator says in the ad, which began airing March 24, 2011: "A priest sexually abuses children for 30 years across Wisconsin. A mother tells DA David Prosser her two young sons were sexually assaulted. What does Prosser do? Prosser refuses to prosecute; doesn’t even ask the police to investigate. Instead, Prosser meets with the bishop. To avoid scandal, they send the priest to another community and the assaults continue. Tell David Prosser: Judges should protect our children, not sex offenders." A picture of Prosser is shown throughout the ad. A picture of the priest is shown briefly, along with two newspaper headlines revealing that Prosser had declined to file charges and was questioned about the decision. The priest, the mother and her two sons are not identified by name. But there is no dispute that the ad refers to a May 1978 incident that Sharon Merryfield reported to Prosser, who was the Outagamie County district attorney at the time. Merryfield told Prosser -- who said he attended middle and high school with her -- that Catholic priest John Patrick Feeney improperly touched her sons Todd, then 14, and Troy, then 12, at the family’s home. A court summary in a later matter says Feeney, who worked at a church in Freedom, touched the boys in the chest area and moved his hand downward toward their penises but did not touch them there. Feeney also pinched one of the boys on the buttocks. The incident -- as a result of a later investigation, in 2002 -- helped put Feeney behind bars. Let’s see whether information in the ad backs up the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s central claims -- that Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate the two boys’ accusations against a longtime pedophile priest; that Prosser didn’t file criminal charges; and that he participated in a cover-up of the priest’s actions. We’ll draw from evidence cited by the Greater Wisconsin Committee, news reports, court records and comments Prosser made during a 20-minute discussion of the case with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board on March 24, 2011. The ad essentially makes three sets of claims. We’ll address them one at a time. The incident involved a priest who had abused children for 30 years The ad suggests that when the matter came to Prosser, he was aware Feeney had a long history of molesting boys. But evidence that Feeney molested boys over some 30 years emerged 24 years later, in the 2002 investigation, which was conducted by the Outagamie County Sheriff’s Department. That investigation found Feeney had molested boys dating back to 1969, although no charges were filed in the older incidents because the statute of limitations had expired. So, while the priest may have had an extensive history of sexual abuse, the ad takes it out of context to suggest this was known by Prosser in 1978. Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate and refused to prosecute. Prosser said in the editorial board interview that he interviewed both boys and found another Feeney victim, but that victim refused to testify. He did not ask a police agency -- in this case, the Sheriff’s Department -- to investigate, so the ad is correct on that claim. It is an open question whether the Sheriff’s Department would have investigated the Merryfield boys incident and related cases more vigorously than Prosser did. The ad is also correct that Prosser decided not to file charges against Feeney. But it provides no context as to why they were not pursued. In his comments to the Journal Sentinel, Prosser cited several reasons. Prosser said the case would have been difficult to prove at the time because Feeney had not indecently touched the boys, and because it would pit the credibility of two boys against the credibility of a priest. He also said the case would be hard on the family because it would become sensationalized, given that Feeney’s brother, Joe Feeney, was a regular performer on the Lawrence Welk network television show. And he said his office lacked experienced prosecutors. So, this statement also leaves out key information. Indeed, records show more details came out during the future investigations, which made the case against Feeney stronger. By that point, other victims had emerged. Prosser and a bishop, "to avoid scandal," sent the priest to another community and the assaults continued. Prosser said that as part of his investigation, he told Green Bay Bishop Aloysius Wycislo that Feeney needed to be removed from the Freedom parish and that the bishop replied by saying, "I will take care of it." Prosser said he related that information to the Merryfield family when he told them he had decided not to file charges. "The family didn’t seem to be that upset at the time," told the editorial board. Wycislo wrote a letter in 1978 saying Prosser had come to him "to prevent unnecessary scandal." He also wrote: "I had to agree with the district attorney that the church would prefer to keep this out of court and out of the public eye and I was able to tell (Feeney) of our decision last week, with which he agreed." So, the "avoiding scandal" characterization is attributable to the bishop. Prosser says choosing not to prosecute had nothing to do with avoiding scandal. What’s more, Prosser would not have had any official role in moving Feeney, although it appears he and the bishop agreed that should be done. Prosser said that, to his surprise, Feeney was not moved until more than six months later. By that time, Prosser had won election to the state Assembly and left his district attorney post. He had been campaigning for the job when Sharon Merryfield first came to him. Prosser also noted that in January 1979, Sharon Merryfield filed a report with the Sheriff’s Department about the incident in her home, and that that report also did not result in criminal charges. In 2002, the Sheriff’s Department opened another investigation after another Feeney victim was discovered. News reports said Feeney worked in 18 parishes over 30 years in the Green Bay diocese before he left Wisconsin in 1983. The reports cited church documents in saying that Feeney left amid numerous allegations of sexual misconduct with altar boys. Authorities were able to charge Feeney in the 2002 investigation because he had left Wisconsin, which meant the statute of limitations had not expired. That supports the point in the ad that says abuse continued. That’s where the ad ends. But let’s finish the story about how Feeney ended up behind bars. As the case summary shows, Troy Merryfield stated in the 2002 sheriff’s investigation that Feeney had grabbed his penis during a face-to-face confession one or two months before the May 1978 incident in the Merryfield home. Prosser said Troy Merryfield never told him about the earlier incident; and the appeals court noted that the earlier incident was not mentioned in the January 1979 sheriff’s report that had been filed by Sharon Merryfield. So, Prosser did not have that allegation to consider when he decided not to file charges against Feeney. The 2002 sheriff’s investigation produced five felony charges against Feeney for the two incidents involving the Merryfield brothers. The charges included attempting to touch the boy’s penises during the incident in their home. Feeney was convicted of four of the charges and was sentenced in 2004 to 15 years in prison. Now 84, he could be released from prison in November 2011 on extended supervision, according to the state Department of Corrections. Troy Merryfield issued a statement the day after the Greater Wisconsin Committee’s ad was released, calling the ad "offensive, inaccurate and out of context." The statement said the sheriff’s 2002 investigation resulted in charges because he and his brother were able to provide more detailed information about Feeney’s actions than they did when Prosser handled the case in 1978, and that, as adults, they were more comfortable about testifying. In 2008, Troy Merryfield had been critical of Prosser, saying he should step aside when cases involving priest sexual misconduct come before the Supreme Court. "He knows damn well what happened and what was said," Merryfield said about his own case in 2008. "He dropped the ball, and he should recuse himself." Todd Merryfield told PolitiFact Wisconsin he stands by his brother’s statement condemning the ad and agreed it should no longer be aired. So, where does all of this leave us? The Greater Wisconsin Committee claims David Prosser didn’t ask police to investigate a mother’s report that a 30-year pedophile priest had indecently touched her two sons, then refused to file charges him and participated in a cover-up of the priest’s acts. The committee’s TV ad uses generally factual statements to make its case, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. By using information that only became known later, it suggests more information was available to Prosser at the time than really was. For instance, Prosser didn’t know that the priest had a long history of molestation -- that came out 24 years later. And it wasn’t until 24 years later that one of the brothers made the most serious allegation against the priest. Finally, the two brothers have condemned the ad as "offensive, inaccurate and out of context." We rate the committee’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14911	"No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted (clean energy) targets more ambitious in scale."	mostly true	/california/statements/2015/nov/03/kevin-de-leon/does-california-have-most-ambitious-clean-energy-g/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: California is known for setting lofty clean energy goals. But are its targets the most ambitious on the planet? That’s what state Senate leader Kevin de León claimed in a speech in October after Gov. Jerry Brown signed SB 350, a landmark climate change package authored by the senator. The current legislation requires 50 percent of California’s electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2030. That’s up from an earlier mandate calling for 33 percent of the state’s energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. Currently, California gets about a quarter of its energy from renewables, thanks to the huge solar and wind farms that have popped up in places like the Mojave Desert in recent years. The bill by the Los Angeles Democrat also calls on the state to double the energy efficiency of its buildings by 2030. "Senate Bill 350 puts us on track to generate half, half of our electricity from renewable sources. And double the energy efficiency of all of our buildings by 2030. No city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted targets more ambitious in scale," De León said in a speech at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. We decided to fact-check De León’s claim that no one else has more ambitious clean energy targets than California, with a focus on renewable energy. Our research At first glance, the senator’s statement seemed headed for a "False" rating or even "Pants on Fire!" That’s because some countries, as well as other U.S. states, and even some cities in California have more aggressive renewable energy goals, at least on a percentage basis. San Francisco’s goal, for example, is to meet 100 percent of its electricity demand with renewable power by 2020 — a decade before California wants to get half of its electricity from renewables. Hawaii’s target is 100 percent renewable energy use by 2045. Vermont’s is 75 percent renewable use by 2032. The percentage threshold is higher for both states but further out than California’s. Internationally, Norway has a goal to produce 67.5 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020, which would be a higher rate and earlier timeframe than California’s goal. But looking at De León’s statement closely, he qualifies it by saying California’s clean energy goals are the most ambitious "in scale." His office clarified that the senator was referencing California’s large population size, and its potential to consume and produce more clean energy compared with other states and even some countries. California used 261.5 million megawatt hours of electricity two years ago. That was 27 times the amount used in Hawaii that year, and also far more than Vermont or even Norway. Considering that disparity, some clean energy experts said California does have the most ambitious goals, at least nationally. "There are many different ways you can try to quantify this, and ways that you can judge how ambitious something is," said Brian Lips, who manages a national database on renewable energy for the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center. "But, I think, in general, this claim was mostly true." More difficult to answer is the question about whether California’s clean energy goals are the most ambitious globally. Various rankings place China at or near the top for global production of renewable energy, far beyond what California can produce. But that country’s goal of deriving 15 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020 lags behind the Golden State’s target of 33 percent by that year. Comparing California’s clean energy targets and with those of countries is difficult because not all goals are measured the same way, said Laura Wisland, a senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists and an expert on California renewable energy. Some countries list goals for future clean energy capacity, or the amount of energy they hope to generate after building wind, solar or other renewable energy projects, Wisland said. California’s goal, on the other hand, is tied to the amount of energy it actually uses each year. The enforcement of clean energy standards is a key factor in judging how aggressive they are. Goals set by about a quarter of the states in the U.S. that have renewable energy goals are non-binding recommendations, Wisland added. That’s not the case in California, said Alex Jackson, legal director for the Natural Resources Defense Council’s California Climate Project. NRDC is an environmental advocacy group. "I think what differentiates California is the degree of specificity and accountability on the main strategies that we are going to be deploying to achieve that target," said Jackson, referring to the goals in SB 350. "We have the goals in place. We also have the roadmap to get there, with the appropriate oversight and enforcement to hold emitters accountable." In 2012, California became the first state to create a comprehensive cap-and-trade program. It effectively puts a price on carbon emissions by imposing a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide industry can release. The state raises money for clean energy projects each year by auctioning emissions permits. Jackson said that model plus the new goals in SB 350 set California apart. "If you add up the combined effect of the targets that are in the bill, they easily represent the most ambitious clean energy roadmap anywhere in the world," he said. Our ruling Senate leader Kevin de León says "no city in the state, no state in this nation, for that matter the entire world, has adopted (clean energy) targets more ambitious in scale." If we define "ambitious" as setting high goals and being able to follow through on them, then California clearly has some of the strongest clean energy initiatives in the country and on the planet. That doesn’t mean, however, that it has established the only aggressive targets. Prominent examples include Norway, Hawaii and even San Francisco. In terms of producing clean energy, California won’t be able to compete with global leaders such as China or the United States even if those countries have less aggressive renewable energy targets. Their size makes that impossible. But working in California’s favor, it has an enforcement framework in place. Notably, its cap-and-trade system provides an incentive for industry to invest in renewable energy. We rate the claim Mostly True, which we define as "accurate but needs clarification or additional information."	None	Kevin de León	None	None	None	2015-11-03T00:00:00	2015-10-07	['None']

pomt-03751	"Expanding Medicaid will worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-expanding-medicaid-will-worsen-healt/	Editor's note: After we published this report, the staff at Cruz's office gave us more information to consider. We considered that evidence in a separate report, but it did not change our initial findings or our ruling. Our original report remains below. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who is gaining a reputation for bold statements, is backing Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to reject a major expansion of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. Under the new health care law, states can get federal dollars to enroll their uninsured residents in Medicaid. Some politicians, including Cruz and Perry, argue that taking the federal money now leaves the state on the hook for long-term fiscal commitments it can’t afford. Cruz, though, has gone beyond arguing that the expansion is too expensive. He recently said it would also leave the uninsured worse off. "Our friends who are saying they want health care do not realize that expanding Medicaid will worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas," Cruz said at an event with Perry and others in the state capitol in Austin. This struck some observers as illogical: How could moving someone who’s uninsured onto the Medicaid rolls actually worsen someone’s health care options? When we checked with Cruz’s office, they referred us to a floor speech he gave on March 13, 2013. Here’s the relevant portion of that speech: "The data demonstrates Medicaid beneficiaries face worse health outcomes than just about anybody else in the marketplace. In 2010, the Annals of Surgery issued a landmark study which examined the outcomes from nearly 900,000 individuals undergoing surgery from 2003 to 2007. ... Medicaid patients, when compared to people without health insurance, people who were uninsured, Medicaid patients were 13 percent more likely to die. They stayed in the hospital for 50 percent longer and cost 20 percent more. "In 2011, Johns Hopkins did a study of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Their conclusions were very much the same. They found that Medicaid patients were 8.1 percent less likely to be alive 10 years after the transplant compared with those with private insurance and also compared to those without any insurance at all. Overall, the Johns Hopkins study found that Medicaid patients faced a 29-percent greater risk of death, and yet Obamacare is moving more and more of the economically disadvantaged onto Medicaid, which subjects them to those worse health care outcomes." This is a line of argument that had appeared earlier in a number of conservative outlets, including a Wall Street Journal op-ed and a Manhattan Institute briefing paper. These analyses offered some additional studies with similar findings. Even though Cruz did not specifically mention these other studies, they have been cited so frequently in the debate that we will include them in our analysis. To start, we should note that even many critics of Cruz’s perspective acknowledge some concerns about the Medicaid expansion under the new health care law. First, most experts we contacted agreed that studies, including the two Cruz specifically cited, show that patients on Medicaid tend not to have health outcomes as positive as patients on private insurance (though they add that Medicaid is not necessarily the cause, since it’s hard to disentangle insurance status from socioeconomic and lifestyle factors). Second, experts acknowledge that Medicaid is not a perfect program and that various policy changes could make it more effective. And third, they say that adding millions of additional beneficiaries under the new health care law will impose additional strains on the program. That said, our examination of the medical papers, including interviews with some authors of the studies in question, suggests that Cruz has made too big a leap by arguing that an uninsured patient actually becomes worse off when they sign up for Medicaid. Here are a few of the reasons for caution: • The trends are more mixed than Cruz’s claim suggests. In many of the studies, uninsured patients did end up having better outcomes than Medicaid patients did, such as fewer complications and longer survival. But this trend isn’t universal. For instance, in one study, Medicaid patients had worse outcomes for clogged arteries but better outcomes for abdominal aortic aneurysms. • The authors of the studies do not make the argument Cruz does. Not one of the half-dozen studies we looked at articulated Cruz’s argument that someone will have a worse health outcome if they move from no insurance to Medicaid. The studies generally did not focus on comparing Medicaid patients to uninsured patients. Rather, they focused on the performance of Medicaid and uninsured patients collectively, compared to Medicare and private insurance on the other hand. In addition, most papers inserted extensive language urging caution about the limitations of their research. What Cruz and others have done is "the worst kind of selective reading of the studies," said Michael A. Gaglia Jr., a professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine and the co-author of one of the papers. • The definition of "uninsured" in these studies is too fuzzy to be reliable. In these studies, the term "uninsured" doesn’t just refer to the popular image of someone who’s too economically strapped to afford health insurance. It can also include poor people getting free charity care from world-class hospitals, very wealthy patients who pay their own bills rather than carrying health insurance, and healthy young adults who gambled by not obtaining insurance but got sick anyway. Each of these patient groupings may have advantages in recovering more quickly, which could explain some of the the better outcomes among the uninsured. Meanwhile, the definition of Medicaid is also fuzzy because people can sign up for Medicaid after being diagnosed with a serious ailment at a hospital. The studies didn’t distinguish between patients who have been on Medicaid for years, people who were uninsured for years but suddenly signed up for Medicaid before receiving treatment, and those who remained uninsured all the way through treatment. • The number of both Medicaid patients and the uninsured who were studied was quite small. In many of the studies, private insurance and Medicare patients dominated the pool of those studied. (Medicare is the federal health insurance program for Americans over age 65; because it’s mandatory for seniors, it includes people of all income levels.) Typically, uninsured patients and those on Medicaid represented 3 percent to 5 percent of the individuals studied. Experts say it’s unwise to draw sweeping conclusions from small sample sizes. • The Annals of Surgery study Cruz cited has an important quirk in the results. The study looked at 11 types of surgery and found that in all 11, the outcomes were worse for Medicaid patients than for the uninsured. However, in 10 of those cases, patients on Medicare also had worse outcomes than the uninsured did. As Boston University health economist Austin Frakt has put it, "Any theory to explain what’s going on in Medicaid had better explain Medicare, too." • Other studies have shown a positive health benefit from joining Medicaid. A recent study in Oregon compares Medicaid enrollees who had been chosen by a lottery to uninsured residents who were not enrolled. The study indicated that the new Medicaid enrollees reported better health than those who remained uninsured, though the findings are preliminary. Our ruling Cruz said that "expanding Medicaid will worsen health care options for the most vulnerable among us in Texas." Not only does this assertion make no logical sense -- some health coverage should always be an improvement over none -- but the evidence Cruz and others have pointed to also doesn’t back up his point. None of the studies make the argument Cruz does, and the small sample sizes of uninsured patients, combined with the challenge of defining the terms "Medicaid" and "uninsured," pose serious questions about whether Cruz’s conclusion is valid. In fact, several authors of the papers we contacted disagreed with Cruz’s interpretation of their research. This sweeping generalization does not hold up. We rate the claim False.

pomt-10031	The omnibus bill has only $3.8 billion in earmarks.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/02/democratic-congressional-leadership/democrats-claim-omnibus-spending-bill-has-only-38-/	Stung by charges that the economic stimulus bill that passed last month was packed with pork, Democrats are claiming the big 2009 spending bill they're now considering has a relatively small number of earmarks. Many news outlets have cited Democratic estimates that there are only $3.8 billion in earmarks in the $410 billion bill, which is known as the Omnibus because it is the product of nine bills that failed to pass last fall. But Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that tracks federal spending, says the number is $7.7 billion. Why the big difference? The Democrats count the number differently. Before we explain, here's a little context. These numbers aren't just a matter of arcane bookkeeping. They are significant because earmarks have become a key political issue. As a candidate, President Obama promised to reduce earmarks to the levels from 1994, the year that Republicans took control of Congress. So it's important to measure them accurately. The Democrats' $3.8 billion figure has been widely reported. We found it in Congressional Quarterly , the New York Times , the Associated Press and USA Today , among others. Most stories attribute the number to the Democratic leadership in Congress, while USA Today specifically cited Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Democratic staff of the House Appropriations Committee. Brost told us that she specified to reporters that the number was for "non-project-based" federal programs, such as water projects for dams, navigational improvements and beach renourishment. These programs have such a high percentage of earmarks that Democrats exclude them from their totals. Their reasoning is that if they promise to cut earmarks by a certain percentage, as they have in the past few years, these programs will be disproportionately cut. But Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said they should be included in the definition of earmarks because the projects being excluded meet Congress' own definitition — the funding is requested by lawmakers for specific projects that in most cases are in their districts or home states. (For more on the definition, see this earlier PolitiFact item on White House claims that there were no earmarks in the stimulus bill.) "According to Congress, these are earmarks. So to say there are $3.8 billion in earmarks (in the Omnibus) is misleading at best," Ellis said. Ellis invoked a weight-loss analogy to explain what the Democrats are doing. "It’s easier to make your weight loss goals if you don’t count your rear end," he said. Brost says she has been precise with reporters that she was referring to the "non-project-based" numbers. But judging from the number of times we found the number cited as the Democratic estimate for earmarks, her nuance was not caught by reporters or by Democrats who have cited the figure. Either way, the number is not a fair account of the total earmarks. We find the Taxpayers for Common Sense estimate to be right and we find the statement False.

pomt-10851	"When NAFTA was passed, there was an acceleration of immigration from Mexico because people were in search of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/07/dennis-kucinich/nafta-not-a-big-factor-in-increase/	At the Univision debate in Miami on Sept. 9, 2007, Kucinich said the North American Free Trade Agreement had led to a surge in immigrants coming into the United States from Mexico. He said, "When NAFTA was passed, there was an acceleration of immigration from Mexico because people were in search of jobs." He is correct that migration from Mexico has accelerated since NAFTA took effect in 1994, but it's a stretch to attribute that to the trade agreement. Independent analysis suggests there are several other factors involved besides NAFTA. Experts point out that migration from Mexico in the 1990s was encouraged by the booming economy in the United States. Migration peaked in 2000 and since then has fallen off by more than a quarter following the slowdown in the economy after 2001. Emigration was already high before 1994, especially due to people fleeing the wars in Central America in the 1980s. Poverty, coupled with natural disasters (Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998 and an earthquake in El Salvador in 2001) continues to draw large numbers of migrants from Central America. In fact, immigration patterns were not substantially affected by NAFTA, according to a February 2004 report by the Congressional Research Service. The report found that while legal and unauthorized worker migration from Mexico to the United States did accelerate after NAFTA was implemented in 1994, the trade agreement was "largely irrelevant." It found that workers were drawn to the United States by Mexico's inability to provide jobs for a burgeoning work force, as well as periodic financial crises that caused huge job losses and undermined confidence in the Mexican economy.

pomt-04454	"Newgard owed more than $13,000 for unpaid taxes on his $1 million Milwaukie apartment complex."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/11/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/did-steve-newgard-owe-13000-back-taxes-1-million-p/	House Democrats have been slamming Republican candidate Steve Newgard pretty hard on his failure to pay property and income taxes over the years. Newgard faces Democrat Brent Barton, a former representative and lawyer, in the race to replace outgoing Rep. Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone, for House District 40 in Clackamas County. Democrats have set up a website devoted to Newgard’s tax delinquency. There’s also a TV ad paid for by Friends of Brent Barton, which has been on air for about three weeks. Newgard doesn’t contest that he has failed on multiple occasions to pay his taxes on time -- although he resents the implication that what he’s done is illegal. He did pay up, along with late penalties. But one statement made by Democrats has puzzled him and his children. "Newgard owed more than $13,000 for unpaid taxes on his $1 million Milwaukie apartment complex," says the gloomy voice-over in the bleak ad targeting Newgard. The ad later states that he "won’t pay his taxes." One million dollars? If only he owned the multi-story, Craftsman-style units featured so briefly in the campaign attack ad. Alas, Newgard says, his five-unit complex in Milwaukie is decidedly more modest, "little ramblers built in the 1960s." The single-story units are numbered 9 through 14. (There is no No. 13.) The Clackamas County tax assessor’s office says the property has a real market value of $302,000 for 2012. So how do Democrats go from $300,000 to $1 million? We did some sleuthing with our Scooby nose. Apparently there are four complexes at this address, with three separate owners. Newgard owns one. Another person owns two, with a combined market value of $480,000. The third person owns the most expensive portion, valued at $1.2 million. Newgard doesn’t own the $1.2 million property. And it would seem that House Democrats who set up www.stevenewgardfacts.comunderstand this. Because the only property tax statement they post is the one that shows his property valued last year at $280,000. So what gives? We sent an email to Jared Mason-Gere, spokesman for House Democrats’ political action committee. "We screwed up," he wrote back late Tuesday. "The assessment of the apartment complex is a mistake, plain and simple." "It was never our intent to mislead anyone on this, since the point was never about the building, it's always been about the unpaid taxes. The ad will be down tomorrow, if it's not already down, and it will be corrected with the right figure." We also checked with the Newgards to verify the accuracy of the amount owed on the apartment complex. Linda, Steve Newgard’s wife, said they fell behind on payments but paid the amount due with interest in July. The amount paid was about $13,200, she said. She said they have paid taxes faithfully but fell behind when the economy soured. Her husband runs a masonry business. The commercial, she said, "villainized him, like he had done a crime. Being on top of our taxes is important to us. These are not easy times." Obviously, it’s up to Clackamas County voters to decide whether this is an issue for them. What we can confirm is that Newgard owed more than $13,000 on his apartment complex. And if the Democrats want to make the point that Newgard paid his taxes late, that’s fine. But the complex he owns is nothing like the fat cat pad pictured and claimed as valued at $1 million. "The core argument remains," Mason-Gere said. "Steve Newgard thinks he plays by a different set of rules; voters should not trust Steve Newgard with their taxes when he can't even be trusted to pay his own." We’re not so sure. It’s not cool to get behind on your payments to government, but it’s an option open to others, not just to Newgard. And he did pay, despite the assertion in the ad that he "won’t pay his taxes." The ad, in our view, gives the image of a wealthy candidate wiggling out of rules that apply to the humble rank-and-file. And that’s what turns this into a statement that contains an element of truth -- property taxes were owed -- but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. A $300,000 rental property doesn’t have the same ring as a $1 million one. Late Wednesday House Democrats shared a new version of the ad. There is no mention of the value of the property and no image of one either. We like how quickly Democrats work. We still rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-01803	More than 3,000 homicides were committed by "illegal aliens" over the past six years.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/jul/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-claim-about-3000-homicides-illegal-immi/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry expressed concern about border-crossing immigrants committing crimes, going on to tell Glenn Beck in a July 17, 2014, interview "the number of illegal activities up to and including homicides--I think over 3,000 homicides by illegal aliens over the course of the last six years; that’s unacceptable and that’s the reason that we have to secure that border." That sounded like a lot of killings by unauthorized residents. (Where were those headlines?) Perry's backup We decided to put Perry's number to the Texas Truth-O-Meter, starting with Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed, who told us to consult the Texas Department of Public Safety. DPS Director Steve McCraw referred to that many homicides in his July 3, 2014, testimony to the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security. After saying the "consequences of an unsecured border with Mexico" undermine public safety, McCraw said: "Another consequence seldom discussed is the high number of criminal aliens arrested for non-immigration crimes throughout Texas." He then mentioned "over 3,000 homicides" since 2008. Asked for elaboration, a DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, pointed to an agency web page, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," stating that since January 2012, a monthly average of 5,899 "foreign nationals" -- individuals legally authorized to live in the U.S. or not -- have been arrested in Texas, with 40 percent having been arrested before on a criminal charge. Also on the page: "From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults," the agency says. The web page includes a pie chart tallying the criminal charges accumulated by the defendants: Source: Web page, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," Texas Department of Public Safety (accessed July 21, 2014) The last line on the page says "these are minimum figures as these numbers include only those aliens whose fingerprints were already in the federal system when they were booked and it does not necessarily include all those who are incarcerated in federal prison." We asked Vinger for more detail about the homicide charges. We especially wondered how many charges had been leveled since the flow of children crossing the border started to escalate in 2011. Vinger replied by email, "We don’t have any additional information." Outside criminologists Next, we explored whether Perry accurately cited the DPS information. To rehash, the governor told Beck more than 3,000 homicides had been committed by "illegal aliens" since 2008. However, the DPS web page doesn’t say that; it doesn’t even specify when (or where) the 3,070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the "alien" individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated. Via the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, we reached criminologists who looked over the DPS presentation. Michael Walker, an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, said the DPS information doesn’t demonstrate the 3,000-plus homicides were committed by any residents since 2008. Rather, Walker said by phone, the presentation telescoped the arrest histories of the 203,685 individuals put in county jails in the 69 months that were reviewed. "Where did they offend--Texas? Oklahoma? Mississippi?" Walker said, his point being such information isn’t on the web page. Walker and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each suggested it’s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in the years mentioned by Perry. Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS, Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012, there were 3,903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state. Walker said it’s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths. He conceded, too, he wasn’t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014; he didn’t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS. Martinez offered up his own analysis, which started by averaging the FBI’s tally of a little more than 1,100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6,700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS. By email, Martinez said Perry’s statement to Beck potentially would suggest 3,070, or 46 percent, of the estimated homicides were committed by "illegal aliens." But, he said, "that makes no sense." He said in a follow-up email: "It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed." The criminologists noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixes together recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago. Also, they noted, the agency tallied arrests only, not homicide convictions. Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U.S. residents and individuals in the country without permission, risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today. By the state's approach, he said, it’s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U.S. from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and/or committed a homicide. If so, he said, that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande. Neither the DPS or Perry’s office offered more information. Our ruling Perry told Beck over 3,000 homicides were committed "by illegal aliens over the" last six years. This claim is unsupported by the presentation he relied on, which indicates that since 2008 in Texas, more than 200,000 arrested immigrants -- foreign nationals living here with or without legal permission -- had among them accumulated 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their lives. Put another way, for this declaration to hold water, one would have to assume illegal immigrants committed nearly half of the state’s homicides since 2008; we found no such data.

pomt-13685	On whether he’s had a relationship with Vladimir Putin.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-gets-full-flop-whether-hes-had-relati/	The intrusion into the Democratic National Committee’s computers, allegedly by Russian hackers, has put a renewed spotlight on Donald Trump’s connections to Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. When Trump sat for an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos shortly after the Democratic National Convention, Stephanopoulos brought up the topic. Trump told Stephanopoulos that he didn’t have a relationship with Putin. Stephanopoulos challenged him on this -- and the host was on solid ground. Trump’s denial of a relationship with Putin contradicted what he had said on multiple previous occasions. Prior to early 2016, Trump seemed to tout his ties to the Russian leader. Trump, a lifelong businessman, boasted of foreign policy experience based on his experience hosting the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. For instance, during an interview with Fox News on May 6, 2016, Trump told host Bret Baier, "I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success." But the closeness Trump claims to Putin-era Russia has prompted questions from critics, including foreign policy professionals in both parties. The U.S. government sees Russia as a geopolitical rival and Putin in particular as a sometimes problematic force in international relations. Trump’s seeming fondness for Putin has worried critics in both parties. For instance, Trump took flak a few days before the Stephanopoulos interview after he seemed to encourage Russia to spy on the United States in order to find thousands of Hillary Clinton’s emails. "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," he said. "I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press," Trump said during a news conference in Florida." So, facing growing questions about the wisdom of attaching his star to Putin’s, has Trump changed his position on whether the two have had a relationship? Here’s a closer look. Trump’s earlier comments suggesting a relationship with Putin Here are four occasions between 2013 and 2015 when Trump touted his ties to Putin. • When Thomas Roberts of MSNBC asked Trump, "Do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin? A conversational relationship or anything that you feel you have sway or influence over his government?" Trump responded, "I do have a relationship, and I can tell you that he's very interested in what we're doing here today. He's probably very interested in what you and I am saying today, and I'm sure he's going to be seeing it in some form." -- interview, November, 2013 • "You know, I was in Moscow a couple of months ago. I own the Miss Universe Pageant and they treated me so great. Putin even sent me a present, a beautiful present." -- address at the CPAC conference, March 2014 • "Russia does not respect our country any longer. They see we've been greatly weakened, both militarily and otherwise, and he certainly does not respect President Obama. So what I would do—as an example, I own Miss Universe, I was in Russia, I was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success. The show was live from Moscow, and we had tremendous success there and it was amazing, but to do well, you have to get the other side to respect you, and he does not respect our president, which is very sad." -- address at the National Press Club, May 2014 • "As far as the Ukraine is concerned … if Putin wants to go in -- and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes. We were stablemates, and we did very well that night." -- portion of an answer at the Fox Business News debate, Nov. 2015. (The notion that the two men appeared together on 60 Minutes has been debunked. As Time magazine put it succinctly, "In fact, they weren’t even on the same continent.") The Stephanopoulos interview Recently, though, Trump has changed his tune. Here are excerpts from the Trump-Stephanopoulos interview, which aired on ABC’s This Week on July 31. Stephanopoulos: "Let's talk about Russia. You made a lot of headlines with Russia this week. What exactly is your relationship with Vladimir Putin?" Trump: "I have no relationship to -- with him. I have no relationship with him." Stephanopoulos: "But if you have no relationship with Putin, then why did you say in 2013, I do have a relationship. In 2014, I spoke…" Trump: "Because he has said nice things about me over the years. I remember years ago, he said something -- many years ago, he said something very nice about me. I said something good about him when Larry King was on. This was a long time ago. And I said he is a tough cookie or something to that effect. He said something nice about me. This has been going on. We did 60 Minutes together. By the way, not together-together, meaning he was probably shot in Moscow…." Stephanopoulos: "Well, he was in Moscow…." Trump: "And I was shot in New York." Stephanopoulos: "You were in New York. But that's the thing." Trump: "No, just so you understand, he said very nice things about me, but I have no relationship with him. I don't -- I've never met him. … I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him. I never met him. … I mean if he's in the same room or something. But I don't think so. ..." Stephanopoulos: "You've never spoken to him on the phone?" Trump: "I have never spoken to him on the phone, no. … Well, I don't know what it means by having a relationship. I mean he was saying very good things about me, but I don't have a relationship with him. I didn't meet him. I haven't spent time with him. I didn't have dinner with him. I didn't go hiking with him. I don't know -- and I wouldn't know him from Adam except I see his picture and I would know what he looks like." Also, on July 27, Trump said at a press conference in Florida, "I never met Putin -- I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin." For the record: Media outlets have said the more accurate translation for what Putin said was "flamboyant," rather than "genius," and Putin subsequently confirmed that he was trying to indicate "flamboyant" when he made his his remark. Our ruling Trump has changed what he’s said about whether he’s had a relationship with Putin. In 2013, he said, "I do have a relationship." In 2014 he said, "I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin" and said the Russian leader had sent him a present. In 2015, he said, "I got to know him very well" due to their joint appearance on 60 Minutes. More recently, though, Trump has said, "I never met Putin -- I don't know who Putin is" and "I have no relationship with him."

pomt-01817	Says former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that "if the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society" because "they'll serve the masters gladly and passively."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/21/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-alan-greenspan-said-insecur/	Amid a stubbornly slow economic recovery, a reader recently forwarded us a social media post taking aim at former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for using callous language about worker insecurity. The post features images of Greenspan and says: I am Alan And, I used to run the Federal Reserve. And, I actually said this: If the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society, because if workers are insecure they won't ask for wages, they won't go on strike, they won't call for benefits; they'll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that's optimal for corporations. The reader wondered if the five-time chairman of the United States’ central bank actually said something so dismissive about America’s economically left-behind. So did we. As it turns out, Greenspan didn’t say it. Instead, it's academic Noam Chomsky's take on something Greenspan said. And Greenspan and Chomsky couldn’t be more different ideologically. As a young man, Greenspan was a member of the inner circle of Ayn Rand, the libertarian thinker and novelist. (Rand would eventually stand with Greenspan when he was sworn in as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1974.) Greenspan was nominated for the Fed chairmanship by three Republican presidents (Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush) as well as by Democrat Bill Clinton. Meanwhile, Chomsky is an influential academic linguist who’s at least as well known for his political views. They veer sharply left and are sometimes referred to as "anarcho-syndicalist," a philosophy he’s described as promoting "a very organized society, but organized from below by direct participation at every level, with as little control and domination as is feasible, maybe none." So how did this misattribution happen? It emerged from remarks Chomsky made to the Adjunct Faculty Association of the United Steelworkers on Feb. 4, 2014, reprinted in transcript form in the February-March issue of CounterPunch. Here are excerpts from a section of the transcript where Chomsky discusses the issue of universities hiring non-tenure-track faculty: "That’s part of the business model. It’s the same as hiring temps in industry or what they call ‘associates’ at Walmart -- employees that aren’t owed benefits. It’s a part of a corporate business model designed to reduce labor costs and to increase labor servility. When universities become corporatized ... they want to keep costs down and make sure that labor is docile and obedient. The way to do that is, essentially, temps. … "This idea is sometimes made quite overt. So when Alan Greenspan was testifying before Congress in 1997 on the marvels of the economy he was running, he said straight out that one of the bases for its economic success was imposing what he called ‘greater worker insecurity.’ If workers are more insecure, that’s very ‘healthy’ for the society, because if workers are insecure they won’t ask for wages, they won’t go on strike, they won’t call for benefits; they’ll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that’s optimal for corporations’ economic health. At the time, everyone regarded Greenspan’s comment as very reasonable, judging by the lack of reaction and the great acclaim he enjoyed." We looked at Greenspan’s Feb. 26, 1997, testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Here’s a portion: "The performance of the U.S. economy over the past year has been quite favorable. … Continued low levels of inflation and inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. … Atypical restraint on compensation increases has been evident for a few years now, and appears to be mainly the consequence of greater worker insecurity. The willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably well documented. The unanswered question is why this insecurity persisted even as the labor market, by all objective measures, tightened considerably." Greenspan, in his testimony, then suggests technological change and international competition as possible reasons for worker insecurity, before noting that "suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end. In other words, the relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because there is a limit to the value of additional job security people are willing to acquire in exchange for lesser increases in living standards." Chomsky’s take on the substance of what Greenspan said seems reasonably on target. However, Greenspan’s tone is far different than Chomsky’s. Greenspan’s words are explanatory and analytical, displaying none of the sarcasm that Chomsky, or the creator of the Facebook post, ascribes to them -- especially the part about workers serving their masters "gladly and passively." Reached by email, Chomsky confirmed that he and other economists have periodically pointed to Greenspan’s 1997 testimony, including a reference in his book, Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy. Chomsky added, "Don’t know anything about Facebook. I don’t use it." Our ruling The meme says Greenspan said that "if the workers are more insecure, that's very healthy for the society" because "they'll serve the masters gladly and passively." Those words actually come from a sarcastic critique of Greenspan’s words by Noam Chomsky, not from Greenspan himself. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-02783	"For the cost of $5 vanilla soy latte a day, you can get a sweet health insurance plan to match."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/06/cover-oregon/can-health-insurance-plans-be-purchased-cost-5-van/	The success of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act relies heavily on persuading younger people to sign up. While it’s not guaranteed that those in their early 20s are healthier than their older, graying counterparts, they tend to be. Without them, health insurance exchanges are likely to fill with people who need more care, increasing overall risks and sending insurance premiums higher. Still, it may not be an easy sell to get the 75 percent of younger people who lack health care insurance according to a recent Gallup poll, to sign up for coverage. Some may bet they simply don’t need health care coverage. Others may do the math and figure they’d spend less on the federally mandated penalty for not having coverage. So state and federal insurance officials are coming up with novel ways to get the message to their target audience. A group in Colorado, for instance, crafted an Internet-only ad campaign showing a college student doing a handstand on a keg of beer. "Keg stands are crazy," the ad said. "Not having health insurance is crazier." Cover Oregon is now running ads with the same goal of attracting young people. In trying to show that health insurance is more affordable than many think, the tag line is, "For the cost of [a] $5 vanilla soy latte a day, you can get a sweet health insurance plan to match." That figure caught our eye. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check whether Cover Oregon has the grounds to say coverage can be obtained for the cost of a daily coffee drink. We called Michael Cox, a Cover Oregon media contact. He passed along charts showing the cost for monthly insurance premiums in the seven coverage areas around the state: Portland, Bend, Eugene, Salem, Medford, Pendleton-Hermiston and the coast. Each chart contains rates of the 14 companies expected to offer plans through Cover Oregon for people ages 21, 40 and 60. The rates assume that those applying for insurance are single, non-tobacco users. The chart includes prices for three levels of coverage: Bronze (pays an estimated 60 percent of medical costs), Silver (70 percent), and Gold (80 percent). As noted later, catastrophic-only plans will also be available. All amounts represent costs before financial help in the form of tax credits. When asked about the $5-a-day claim, Cox directed us to a plan offered by Moda Health. It charges a 21-year-old unmarried non-tobacco-user $130 a month for bronze-level coverage. That comes out to $1,560 annually. Divide that by 365 days, and you get just over $4.27 per day. "So really," Cox said, "you’d get a little change back for that $5 bill." (And, yes, the costs are roughly in line with a vanilla soy latte. At Portland-area Starbucks, the drink runs $3.85 to $4.85, depending on size.) A 40-year-old, by comparison, would pay $166 a month for the same Moda Health coverage, and a 60-year-old would see premiums of $352. But the claim holds up if applied only to the younger demographic Cover Oregon is targeting. Of the 12 companies that have published rates, four offer plans for that age group for less than $5 a day. Six more offer coverage ranging from $5.06 to $5.95. The others cost $6.08 and $6.96. It’s also important to note that, at this point, nine of the companies offer catastrophic-only plans that, for the most part, are well below the $130 per month premiums charged by Moda Health. So is the question that simple? We wanted a little more context, so we asked Cox how the campaign came about. It is, indeed, aimed at younger people, he said in a telephone interview. That’s why the ads, showing the image of a steaming cup of coffee with "$5" stamped on the front, appear only on Internet sites likely to be viewed by so-called Millennials. And bringing "vanilla soy latte" into the discussion? "It’s more of an appeal to younger people," Cox said. "Plus, Portland is known for its coffee. We thought it was relevant both to the geography and the demographic." Jesse Ellis O’Brien, a health care advocate with the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group, said Cover Oregon’s campaign makes sense. "For Cover Oregon to succeed, it has to have a balanced risk pool so people buying coverage in the marketplace aren’t just unhealthy folks buying coverage to take care of their immediate expensive medical needs," O’Brien said. "This is certainly one way for them to try to balance out who is buying insurance on the exchange." The ad is aimed at Millennials, and the ones who see it are likely to know their way around a fancy cup of coffee well enough to get the comparison to insurance coverage. In addition, one-third of the plans with published rates on Cover Oregon offer coverage to this group for less than the cost of a "$5 vanilla soy latte." But words matter, and the ad’s message wouldn’t be accurate for many. Most older people will need to shell out considerably more than $5 a day to buy insurance through Cover Oregon. We find the claim Half True.	None	Cover Oregon	None	None	None	2013-12-06T17:47:33	2013-11-25	['None']
pomt-15016	"100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/oct/06/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-all-crime-estimate-committed-15-p/	Urging a positive view of law officers "that you and your family depend on every day," Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick went on to say the vast majority of citizens are law-abiding. He put precise numbers on that. "You know," Patrick said during a Sept. 2, 2015, interview with David Brown of the Texas Standard, a statewide news affairs program based at KUT, the NPR affiliate in Austin, "100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population." (We have regularly talked about our fact checks on the program.) A curious listener emailed us. Could Patrick's 100/15 statement be so? Patrick’s backup Asked how Patrick reached his figures, his spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by email that Patrick "uses 15% as the number of citizens that commit 100% of crime as an indicator of the number of criminals in the total population to make the point that most citizens are law-abiding. That is higher than statistics would indicate," Garcia said, writing that according to law enforcement data, "we have approximately 2.2 million people in jail in America and another 5 million on probation and parole. That is roughly 2.5% of the total population that has been convicted of a crime including non-violent drug offenses." Garcia declined to elaborate on how that 2.5 percent justified Patrick’s 15 percent figure. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, part of the Justice Department, said in a December 2014 report that in 2013, 2.2 million people were incarcerated and more than 4.7 million people were under community supervision (on probation or parole). The report further says those counts (which roll in some people not convicted of crimes) equate to 2,830 people per 100,000 U.S. adults, meaning 2.8 percent of U.S. adults were under correctional supervision. That ratio was the lowest since at least 2005, when there were 3,160 people per 100,000 U.S. adults in the "correctional population," the report said. A pair of criminologists told us the numbers offered by Patrick didn’t make a case for the unfamiliar 100/15 formulation. "Gibberish," Candace McCoy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, commented by email, elaborating that the attempt to account for U.S. residents behind bars doesn’t necessarily support what Patrick declared on the air. "I don't know how the two statistics supposedly relate to each other, if at all," McCoy said. Robert Brame, a University of South Carolina professor who has led research into young Americans arrested for non-traffic offenses, said by phone he didn’t see how the backup offered by Patrick "addresses the fraction of the population that’s responsible for the crime problem in the United States.That’s not clear to me." Broadly, Brame and other criminologists we reached said they weren’t aware of a factual way to get to an accurate statement that ‘x’ percent of the population commits all the crime. But there have been studies suggesting a subset of residents commit about half of crimes. Alex Piquero, a criminologist at the University of Texas at Dallas, said by email: "A routine finding in the criminological literature is that about half of the crime is committed by a very small fraction of the population, around 5-8 percent depending on the sample and methodology used. This finding has been replicated in many different studies around the world. The bottom line is that a small fraction of the offending population is responsible for a great majority of crime." Piquero said most of the studies tracked residents only into late adolescence or early adulthood. The Philadelphia studies and others Since the 1960s, researchers have probed how often youths come into police contact, consistently finding that a subset of people account for around half of the crimes reported to police. In the seminal "Crime in a Birth Cohort" and a followup study, a team led by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Marvin Wolfgang tracked nearly 10,000 boys born in 1945 and living in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17; they ultimately gauged how often each boy came in contact with police for an offense. One upshot: 627 boys, 6 percent of the group, each accounted for five or more offenses, according to police reports. Those boys, Wolfgang wrote, were collectively identified as responsible for 52 percent of all the offenses recorded in the study and, he said, about two-thirds of all violent crimes believed to have been committed by the juveniles. In Patrick-speak, Wolfgang found that 6 percent of juvenile boys accounted for about half of alleged juvenile crimes. The follow-up study, presented in progress in 1982, tracked more than 28,000 boys and girls born in 1958 who lived in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17. Among males, the study found, 61 percent of reported offenses were committed by 1,030 "chronic recidivists," comprising 7 percent of males in the study. That is, 7 percent of the boys accounted for 61 percent of the juvenile offenses. David Farrington, a University of Cambridge professor of psychological criminology reported in 2006 on criminal offenses by 411 South London boys occasionally interviewed by the team starting when the subjects were 8 years old in 1961. The researchers, who also checked criminal records, found that a "small proportion of the study males (7%) were defined as ‘chronic offenders’ because they accounted for about half of all officially recorded offenses" in the study. The most common offenses, they wrote, included thefts, burglaries and car thefts followed by violence, vandalism, fraud and drug abuse. In 2014, Swedish researchers drawing on records accounting for the experiences of 2.5 million people born in that country from 1958 to 1980 reported that from 1973 to 2004, some 1 percent of the population accounted for 63 percent of all violent crime convictions. Researcher Örjan Falk added: "Psychotic disorders are twice as common among repeat offenders as in the general population, but despite this fact they constitute a very small proportion of the repeat offenders." In the United States, Brame in 2011 reported that based on interviews of a representative sample of residents aged 12 to 16 at the end of 1996, some 25 percent to 41 percent of participants had been arrested by the time they turned 23. Brame told us a widely quoted takeaway from the study was that by age 23, around 1 in 3 of people in that age group would have been arrested for a non-traffic offense at least once. Then again, it’s not a good idea, Brame told us, to assume the same figure would apply to young residents nowadays because teen crime and arrest rates were higher in the mid-1990s. Brame said another vital consideration in mulling how much of the population is responsible for all crime is that many crimes go unreported to police. In 2014, according to the 2014 National Crime Victimization Survey, only 37 percent of U.S. property victimizations and only 46 percent of violent victimizations were reported to police. To our inquiry, William Kelly, director of the University of Texas Center for Criminology and Criminal Justice Research, noted that according to the U.S. Sentencing Project, as many as 100 million U.S. residents, which in 2014 would have been equal to 41 percent of the adult population, had a criminal conviction. Our ruling Patrick said: "100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population." Sure, not all of us commit crimes, a point that’s patently obvious. When it comes to the specifics of this "15 percent" declaration, however, we found nothing to back it up — including the statistics offered by Patrick’s office. Invented stats meet our definition of a ridiculous claim. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-08754	The sales tax increase, if approved, will cost taxpayers "up to $300 million per year, in perpetuity, to finance a rail system for the City of Tampa."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/27/sam-rashid/hillsborough-county-sales-tax/	On Nov. 2, voters will be asked to decide a number of ballot questions. One of the most important ones asks Hillsborough County voters if they support raising the sales tax by a penny to pay for a new commuter rail system, expanded bus service and road building. If the primary election was any indication, the transit tax question will color the debate in other political contests. One recurring assertion from tax opponents was that the proposed increase will cost taxpayers $300 million a year. It was often infused with the suggestion that all of that money will go toward rail and benefit only Tampa. We decided to test one such statement. It came in the context of Hillsborough County Commissioner Mark Sharpe’s successful re-election bid. Sharpe has been a leading advocate of the referendum. He had faced a challenge in the Republican primary from former county party leader Josh Burgin, who opposed the tax. Sam Rashid, a conservative activist and transit tax opponent, put out a mid-summer mailer that claimed Sharpe, a previously avowed opponent of new taxes, was seeking to "impose" a huge one. "Up to $300 million per year, in perpetuity, to finance a rail system for the City of Tampa," Rashid wrote. Burgin used the $300 million figure repeatedly in his own campaign material. We decided to look at whether $300 million, and the way Rashid couched its use, was accurate. We started with the number itself, asking Rashid where he got it. He told PolitiFact Florida that it was based on his recollection of what existing Hillsborough County sales taxes have produced at their peak, and that he simply tacked on a bit more to account for anticipated growth and inflation. The county has two sales taxes it assesses, both a half-cent charged on goods and some services. One pays for health care for the poor. The other funds such things as roads, jails and the construction of Raymond James Stadium. County records show that revenues from the two sales taxes peaked in 2006 at $107.1 million each. Double that figure to get what a full penny tax would have raised: $214.2 million – quite a bit shy of $300 million. Since then, sales tax revenues have dropped off considerably. Through the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, the tax was projected to bring in $64.8 million, making Rashid’s figure look like an even greater exaggeration. Rashid gives himself some cover by using the qualifier "up to." He says he was trying to project what the tax will cost annually over its lifetime, and his word choice in the mailer gives that sense. So we asked Kevin Brickey, the economist for Hillsborough County government, when sales tax receipts might reasonably be expected to reach $300 million. Brickey noted such predictions can be debated during stable economic times. The current recession makes it more of a dicey proposition. But Brickey prepared just such an analysis for the county’s transit agency, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit, in July. HART would oversee the rail and bus system if the referendum is approved. His analysis was based on a conservative annual growth rate assumption of 4 percent. It estimated that sales tax revenues from a full penny tax will not reach $300 million until fiscal year 2022 – more than a decade after the tax goes into effect. Brickey performed a second analysis for PolitiFact using a 6 percent growth rate, still considered conservative, but one forecasters might typically use under normal circumstances. It shows the $300 million threshold getting crossed in fiscal year 2019. Due to compounding, Brickey predicts that even under a growth scenario of approximately 4 percent, the sales tax would approach $600 million by its 30th year. So under reasonably conservative projections, Rashid’s number is certainly in the ballpark, and arguably understates the long-term cost to taxpayers. But there are problems with Rashid’s assertion because he contends that all the money will go toward rail in Tampa. For one, 25 percent of sales tax revenues would be obligated toward road work. That means that by the second year of the tax, when Brickey estimates it should bring in nearly $200 million, $50 million will go toward road projects that have nothing to do with rail. They are spread throughout the county and are concentrated outside of Tampa by design, particularly in early years. Figuring out how much of the rest will go toward rail, as opposed to buses, presents a greater challenge. Estimates vary from year to year as construction of the rail system progresses and trains start rolling. HART has prepared an analysis of where all the money will go over the next 30 years. But it combines sales tax revenues and money local officials hope to get from the state and federal government in matching dollars, plus property tax revenues, in one pot. Based on those numbers, HART expects to spend about 52 percent of all of its future revenue on rail. Working with Brickey and HART, the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization has prepared a detailed analysis of how the sales tax would be spent through 2035. It shows that, of the 75 percent of the penny tax that would be spent on transit, 57 percent would go toward rail. That represents 43 percent of all projected sales tax expenditures. Even adding in a significant "oops" factor, about half the money would go toward rail. The rest would go toward buses, roads and trails, much if not most of it outside Tampa city limits. These numbers are subject to change. HART is still doing an analysis to determine if rail makes sense along the corridors identified for it. And they’re still determining what specific paths the rail lines would take, which they won’t finish until after the election. That all affects the bottom line. Finally, while it is true that the first two legs of the train system would be within Tampa city limits, there are plans for later expansion outside the city, including a line to Brandon. If Rashid had confined his statement to asserting that the proposed hike would cost taxpayers $300 million a year, we probably would have rated that Mostly True, since it will be soon enough. But he said that it was all going for trains in the city of Tampa. It is true that this whole exercise was largely initiated by Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio, who made building a commuter rail system a top goal. But the discussion ended up in the hands of the County Commission, which ultimately put the question on the ballot. After months of study initiated by Commission Chairman Ken Hagan, a task force recommended that a significant portion of the money go to roads and buses. And that’s the position the County Commission took in crafting the ballot language. So while critics want to label the initiative a rail tax for the city of Tampa that will not benefit suburban residents, PolitiFact finds Rashid’s attempt to frame the issue as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03884	The United States gives $8 million a day to Israel and gives that country a blank check.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/06/council-national-interest/billboards-question-aid-israel/	A message on an electronic billboard in Gwinnett County caught our eye one evening. "$8 million a day to Israel just doesn’t make sense!" it read. Underneath those words, it read: "STOP The Blank Check.org." Does the United States give Israel $8 million a day? Is there a "blank check" for Israel? Since we’ve seen the same message on other billboards in the Atlanta region, PolitiFact Georgia thought it’d be worthwhile to figure out whether the claim is accurate or are the thousands of motorists who’ve seen this billboard being told misleading information. The Council for the National Interest paid for the billboard. The nonprofit organization’s goal, according to its website, is support of a just resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It has claimed, for example, that the news media devotes more coverage to Israeli deaths rather than Palestinian deaths in Middle East violence. Some groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, say the council is anti-Israel and claims some leaders of its educational arm have met in recent years with terrorist leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah. The council’s executive director, Phil Giraldi, said the group, based in northern Virginia, has about 12,000 members. The group is paying for 10 billboards in the Atlanta area and six others nationwide, he said. Giraldi said he got a good deal on billboards in Atlanta. "We wanted to make the public aware at a time that budgets are being cut, aid to Israel is not," said Giraldi, who added that Israel has a "booming" economy. "Whenever Israel needs more money, Congress appropriates it," he said. The council’s website describes Giraldi as a former CIA counterterrorism specialist. Giraldi recently wrote a column called "Why I Dislike Israel" that criticized the U.S.-Israel relationship as too cozy and said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was meddling in the 2012 U.S. presidential race. The nonpartisan, federal Congressional Research Service released a report in 2012 on U.S. foreign aid to Israel. Most of what the United States gives Israel is military aid. The report found the U.S. gave more aid to Israel than any other nation between 1976 and 2004. Afghanistan is currently at the top of the list, the report said. Israel uses almost 75 percent of those funds to buy U.S. defense equipment. By law, Congress must be notified of most new purchase agreements. Over the years, the two nations have had occasional disputes over which weapons that contain U.S. materials can be sold to other nations. In the mid-1990s, the CRS noted, following efforts in Congress to reduce foreign aid funding, Israel proposed (and Congress agreed) to phase out U.S. economic aid to Israel entirely. As Congress phased out economic aid to Israel from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2008, military aid gradually increased, according to the CRS. President Barack Obama proposed spending $3.1 billion in military financing for Israel and an additional $15 million on refugee resettlement for fiscal year 2013, a 12-month period that will end Sept. 30. That’s nearly $8.5 million a day. It’s unclear what impact the sequester may have on aid to Israel. End of story? Not yet. We were still curious about whether the United States has written a blank check to Israel, since "STOP The Blank Check.org" is mentioned so prominently on the billboard. Israel is considered one of America’s closest allies, and politicians who do not strongly support that relationship do so at their own peril. A Pew Research Center poll in December found about 50 percent of Americans sympathized with Israel over the Palestinians, while just 10 percent side with the Palestinians. For much of Obama’s first term, Republicans accused the president of damaging ties with Israel because of disagreements between his administration and the Israeli government over issues such as Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Obama’s critics also complained he hadn’t visited Israel since he took office. The president may visit Israel as soon as this month, according to some Israeli news accounts. Some say there is no willingness in Washington to question Israel or America’s funding for it. "There is no debate," said M.J. Rosenberg, director of the Washington office of the Israel Policy Forum, a left-wing organization that pushes for peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Then, according to the Jerusalem Post, he corrected himself, saying, "The debate is like this: ‘I like Israel.’ ‘Well, I like Israel more.’ " Philip Wilcox, president of the Washington-based Foundation for Middle East Peace, said he has seen the $8 million a day claim and agreed "it’s in the ballpark." As for whether there is a "blank check" for Israel, Wilcox told us that the U.S. generally accepts Israeli military actions in the region. Wilcox spent years working in the federal government on Middle East affairs. He noted, though, that the U.S. has conducted inquiries into Israeli use of weapons. "This is really a matter of interpretation," Wilcox said of whether there is a blank check. Giraldi cited Obama’s decision to fund Israel’s "Iron Dome" missile defense program as part of the blank check to Israel claim. In fiscal year 2011, the White House approved $205 million for the program. In July, the president provided an additional $70 million for the program. "The United States being one-sided to Israel is not beneficial to the United States," Giraldi said. Our conclusion: The council’s billboard says the U.S. gives $8 million a day to Israel. In essence, that’s an accurate estimate. The billboard may leave the impression that there is a blank check to Israel. That’s a matter of interpretation. Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-05783	"It’s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is now to buy a gun..."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/27/janet-howell/sen-janet-howell-says-its-easier-guns-virginia-vot/	State Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, recently complained about socially conservative bills being approved this winter by the Republican-controlled General Assembly. During a Feb. 10 interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation, Howell called the GOP majority "a steamroller" in passing legislation to ease gun control laws and strengthen voter identification requirements. "What’s really ironic with what’s happening is it’s going to be harder to vote in Virginia than it is to buy a gun with what they’re doing on gun control issues," she said. Is it really becoming easier to buy a gun than cast a ballot in Virginia? Howell told us her statement was a "rhetorical slur." She cited some of bills that have been approved by the General Assembly this year but did not offer a point-by-point comparison of the requirements to buy a gun or cast a vote. So we looked at Virginia’s laws overseeing firearm purchases and voting. You have to be at least 18 for either activity. You have to be a state resident to vote in Virginia. But you don’t have to live in Virginia to buy a gun here. Let’s examine the other requirements. Identification To register to vote, you must present a document that shows your name and address. It can be a valid photo ID, utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document. To cast a ballot, you must show identification or sign a statement -- subject to felony conviction for false information -- that you are the registered voter you represent yourself to be. This requirement is being altered by the General Assembly this year, a point we’ll address later. To buy a gun from a licensed dealer in Virginia, you must show primary and secondary forms of identification. The primary document must be a state-issued photo ID. The secondary identification just needs to contain your current address and can be a utility bill, voter registration card, bank check or hunting or fishing license. But in the case of private guns sales -- if you buy a firearm from an individual who is not a licensed dealer -- the identification requirements go away. Application To register to vote, you must fill out and submit an application 22 days before a general or primary election. The form can be submitted at variety of locations or by mail. To buy a gun from a licensed dealer, you have to submit to a computerized background check run by the state police. It’s usually completed in a matter of minutes, but can take as long as four days. The background check does not apply to private gun sales, and such transactions can occur instantly. Disqualification You can’t vote if you are a felon and have not had your rights restored, or if you have been judged mentally incapacitated. Many things could turn up on a background check that would bar someone from buying a gun from a licensed dealer. They include conviction or indictment on felony charges, an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor or felony, outstanding protective or restraining orders, use of illegal drugs, mental incompetency judgement, orders for mental health treatment, dishonorable discharge from military, and conviction on domestic violence charges. In private sales, it is a felony to knowingly sell a gun to a person who would be disqualified under the instant background check. But there is no onus on a private seller to inquire about a buyer’s background, and no requirement that a purchaser disclose whether he or she is legally qualified to buy a firearm in Virginia. What could change As Howell noted in her interview with Sharpton, the General Assembly has passed several bills this year affecting voting and gun purchases. The major change in voting concerns what happens if voters don’t have identification when they show up at the polls on Election Day. Instead of signing an affidavit and having their vote counted immediately, anyone who can’t present ID would turn in a provisional ballot. Local electoral boards meet the day after the election to determine which of the votes are valid. But this provision does not necessarily make voting tougher than buying a gun. You would have no hope of buying a gun from a licensed dealer if you did not present identification. And you still won’t need ID to buy a gun for a private dealer. So the comparison doesn’t change. Legislators have also repealed a law limiting handgun purchases to one a month. Many exceptions have been put in the law since passed in 1993. But the repeal would not change the requirements for buying a gun in the first place, it will allow you to buy more each time you clear the hurdles. Our ruling Howell said it is becoming harder to vote in Virginia than buy a gun.. There are more restrictions on buying a gun from a licensed dealer than voting. The firearm purchase requires more identification. The gun buyer has to go through a background check that the voter does not. And you can be more easily disqualified from buying a gun than you can be from voting. But there are fewer barriers to buying a gun privately than there are to voting. The private gun sale requires no wait, no identification, and no easily enforceable disqualifications. We rate Howell’s statement Half True.

pomt-02759	"Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/13/generation-opportunity/will-affordable-care-act-close-down-volunteer-fire/	Editor's note: Almost two months after we published this report, the Obama administration clarified guidelines on volunteer fire departments. The new rules specifically exempt volunteer fire and rescue units. Read our story that details the new guidelines. Our original report from December is below. Few things tug on the heart strings, or put fear in people’s minds, like the image of a small town losing its volunteer fire station. So you can imagine why a number of readers alerted us to a Facebook post making the rounds that alleged just that. According to a graphic posted by Generation Opportunity, an organization that opposes the Affordable Care Act through outreach to young people, the health care law will have an adverse effect on volunteer emergency services. "Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service," the post alleges, "or close entirely!" As of Dec. 12, the post had nearly 4,000 shares, 2,500 "Likes," and dozens of comments. We’ve heard plenty of claims about the Affordable Care Act and its effect on employers, but hadn’t looked into how it treats volunteer fire stations. Ask and you shall receive, readers. What’s at issue There actually is quite a bit of uncertainty regarding the health care law and how it addresses local volunteer emergency services. The employer mandate in the law states that employers with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time employees must provide health insurance to their workers. If not, they face a stiff penalty of $2,000 for every worker after 30. There are 783,300 volunteer firefighters in the United States and nearly 25,500 stations are either entirely or mostly made up of volunteers, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Some of them are small, serve rural areas, and are made up of a handful of volunteers. They’re not likely to be affected by the law. Then there’s the question of hours worked. The law specifies that a full-time employee works at least 30 hours a week. Many volunteers wouldn’t hit that threshold, though it is unclear how hours would be counted. Does it include time spent on call or fundraising for the department? The National Volunteer Fire Council is concerned that the employer mandate will still apply to many stations. Under current law, the Internal Revenue Service considers a volunteer an employee for tax purposes. "It does not matter whether firefighters are termed ‘volunteers,’ are considered employees, or are identified by any other name, if the work they do is subject to the will and control of the payer, under the common-law rules, they are employees for federal tax purposes," according to the IRS. That allows any benefits a volunteer firefighter receives to be taxed. And while the U.S. Department of Labor has tight restrictions on the benefits (mostly awarded to cover the costs of travel and equipment for the job) a volunteer can receive, so far the IRS has not said whether it will treat them as employees or volunteers under the Affordable Care Act. In fact, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released draft regulations last year for the employer mandate. There was no mention of volunteer fire services. "The more we looked at the law we saw there’s nothing in this that says the IRS has to listen to the Department of Labor," said Dave Finger, director of government relations for the National Volunteer Fire Council, an organization representing volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. "Around the spring we realized this could be a significant problem for our folks. Finger added that most volunteer fire stations serve sparsely populated areas that don’t have a large tax base. Some even get their revenue from pancake breakfast fundraisers. Finding the resources to suddenly pay for health insurance or the fee would be very difficult. Some stations employ more than 50 volunteers, some volunteers lend their time to stations operated by county or municipal governments with more than 50 employees, and others band together and can surpass the mandate threshold that way. Under any of these scenarios, volunteer departments are worried they could be required to offer health insurance. Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol, and both sides of the aisle, agree that the law is vague and could potentially affect volunteer units. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., has introduced a bill in the House that would exempt volunteer forces from the employer mandate, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has asked the Senate to do the same. "(The Treasury) put out regulations that didn’t include this," said Elizabeth Falcone, a legislative assistant in Warner’s office. "It wasn’t clear it was going to be dealt with and revised. There’s a history of showing why strong force is important (to get action from IRS). "When there’s ambiguity you need to create certainty," she added. "And that’s the issue. That’s what we’re trying to fix." How big is the problem? But let’s get back to what the graphic said: The Affordable Care Act could "force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!" We reached out to Generation Opportunity to get clarity on the severity of the accusation. They didn’t reply to our call. But both Warner’s office and the National Volunteer Fire Council felt that was a big leap. "That sounds like the predictable messaging you would hear about these issues," said Kevin Hall, spokesman for Warner. "In Virginia, we have a highly organized and professional volunteer fire team in Virginia Beach, and they sniff at this as being a nonissue. But there is concern in some communities and they’re seeking help in getting more definitive guidance." It’s also worth noting that most volunteers have other full-time jobs, Finger said, and would receive health benefits from their employer or the government. Additionally, many stations don’t come close to reaching the 50-employee threshold, no matter how the IRS chooses to count them. It would also require the IRS to go out and enforce the law and target volunteer fire stations. While "it’s a worst-case scenario that you can’t rule out," Finger said he thought department closures were "unlikely" and thousands of closures were "very unlikely." There’s no doubt that if the employer mandate is applied to volunteer fire departments it would mean additional costs for those that qualify. But it’s more likely departments will decrease their workforce or cut and cap other benefits volunteer forces receive, before slashing services or closing stations, Finger said. For their part, the Treasury Department said it was taking the concerns of volunteer firefighters and other emergency services into account as it works toward the final employer mandate regulations, though they could not say when that would be. President Barack Obama has also delayed the employer mandate for a year, so it won’t go into effect until 2015. And Warner’s office said the cast of support he has recruited for his bill, including two Democrats, two Republicans and an independent, "was noteworthy to people in White House," and they expected action sooner than later. Finger echoed those sentiments. "We’re telling our members: ‘One, we think it’s going to be fixed,’" he said. "‘And two, no penalties are coming until 2015, so it’s still a long way off. Don’t do anything drastic now.’" Our ruling The Facebook post said "Obamacare could force thousands of volunteer fire stations to cut service or close entirely!" "Could" is a dangerous word that allows rabble rousers to generate hysteria without being completely false, but we think it’s somewhat inflated. There certainly is cause for concern, but even those looking to change the status quo see this as an exaggeration. Furthermore, it sounds like those in the know expect the issue to be resolved now that pressure is mounting. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it as Half True.	None	Generation Opportunity	None	None	None	2013-12-13T16:17:43	2013-12-10	['None']

pomt-07624	Says "for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/19/sam-adams/portland-mayor-sam-adams-says-portlands-spent-its-/	Portland’s biking infrastructure is the stuff of legends. For the people who support it, we’re Biketown U.S.A. -- the city that boasts (at least among medium and large cities) the highest bike commuter rate. For those who are less into that title, our investments in cycling paths and signs are monetary drains on the city budget. You’d think, then, given the strong feelings, that Portland has made significant investments to get a significant infrastructure. But something Mayor Sam Adams said recently caught our attention. In a video on Streetfilms.org, Adams touts our biking culture while adding that we built our bike network for about the same amount of cash that a mile of highway would set us back. "You know in 1993 we weren't the bicycling capital of America," he says. "Seventeen years later, for the equivalent cost of a single mile of freeway, we have a bike infrastructure." Could that be true? We checked it out. Our first stop was the mayor’s office, which forwarded us an e-mail from Roger Geller, the city’s bike coordinator. Geller said that in 2009, the staff set out to put together an estimated total cost for the city’s bike infrastructure in 2008 dollars. When all was said and done, they came up with an estimated value of $52 million and adjusted it up to $60 million to be safe. Here’s how they arrived at that figure: "We assumed that all elements that contributed to the city's bikeway system were reasonable costs to include, even if they were not built for the express purpose of creating a bikeway. For example, we included the cost of pedestrian half-signals and bicycle-pedestrian bridges across I-5, among others. These signals and bridges facilitate crossings for existing bicycle boulevards, even though they were in place before the bicycle boulevards were constructed. "For multi-use trails we split the construction cost of the trail in half and assigned half the cost to pedestrians. For the Eastbank Esplanade I believe we divided the cost into thirds and assigned one-third of the cost to park development, as much of the construction of that pathway was not about transportation but was also about creating a parklike environment." To be clear, he added, the network did not actually cost $60 million. It was probably less than that: "The $60 million figure is essentially the replacement value of our network as it existed in 2008 in 2008 dollars. In other words, if the bikeway network disappeared overnight -- and all the elements that contribute to its functionality, whether built by the city's bikeway program or not -- $60 million is approximately what it would cost to replace it all." We called Geller directly to go over the specifics with him, just to make sure we were on the same page. We wanted to be sure that this official estimate included bike-only corridors and other such construction projects. He confirmed it did, adding: "I'm very confident in the quality of our estimates." The one thing Geller said it didn’t include was city programs that deal with bicycles -- Oregon Safe Routes to School, for example. Even so, the cost of those activities, stretching back to 2004, could be absorbed in the rounding up from $52 million to $60 million, Geller said. Next up, we needed an estimated cost for a mile of freeway. This is where things get a bit tricky. The cost of a mile of freeway isn’t easy to pin down. The mayor’s office said Adams was referring to a mile of a typical 4-lane urban freeway. That cost, according to the city’s data, ranges between $20 to $80 million depending on various environmental factors. They chose $60 million -- the middle road -- to indicate the average cost. "Of course," Geller wrote in the original e-mail, "it is possible to find examples right here in our region of a single interchange that cost much more than $60 million." Their source for that figure was the Rails to Trails Conservancy. That group published the figure in a 2008 report on transportation. We asked the Conservancy for their original source and they sent us a document that offers a considerably wider price range. According to that document the cost of freeways (in 2006 dollars) breaks down as such: -Rural areas: $3.1 million to $9.1 million per lane mile; $12.4 million to $36.4 million for a four-lane mile. -Urban areas: $4.9 miilion to $19.5 million per lane mile; $19.6 million to $78 million for a four lane mile. -Areas with severe restrictions: $16.8 million to $74.7 million per lane mile; $67.2 million to nearly $300 million for a four-lane mile. We tried to get some official estimates from the U.S. Department of Transportation, but they did not respond to our inquiry. Still, the numbers that the Conservancy reported seem to match other estimates, such as this one from the Michigan Department of Transportation. So, where does that put us with our ruling? It seems to us that Geller’s estimate of the total value of the bike infrastructure is somewhat inflated. When Adams used this statistic he didn’t make clear that he was talking about an urban four-lane freeway. But, certainly, $60 million in bike infrastructure is well above the $12.4 million it would take to make a mile of four-lane rural freeway. That said, Adams is the mayor of an urban area and it makes sense that he would be thinking in terms of the cost of urban freeway construction. When you’re talking about that sort of freeway construction, $60 million falls pretty near the middle of the $20 million to $80 million estimated average cost. The mayor could have been a little more exact, but his statistic -- that Portland has spent on its bikeway infrastructure what it would spend on a mile of freeway -- seems to stand up to scrutiny. We’ll give this one a Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2011-03-19T06:00:00	2011-02-22	['None']
pomt-03420	Says unsuccessful Texas abortion legislation "was supported by a majority of" Texans.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jun/27/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-majority-texans-support-faile/	A Republican official declared that abortion legislation that perished amid shouting from the Texas Senate gallery was nevertheless popular across Texas. After a special legislative session ended without Senate Bill 5 advancing from the Texas Senate to Gov. Rick Perry, Jerry Patterson said in an email blast: "Late last night, a bill supported by a majority of the Texas Legislature and a majority of Texans, was shouted down by a rude, unruly mob who decided that the legislative process is only worthwhile when it produces something they support." Patterson, the state land commissioner, sent the June 26, 2013, blast on behalf of his 2014 campaign for lieutenant governor. Other expected candidates include the incumbent, David Dewhurst, and Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, both Republicans. In the email, Patterson followed up his reference to the legislation’s popularity by suggesting the current lieutenant governor, who typically presides over the Senate, deserves blame for the "breakdown of decorum and procedure." That’s an opinion; we focused the Truth-O-Meter on whether the legislation, which was backed by a majority of the Republican-dominated Legislature, had the support of a majority of Texans. As summarized in a June 24, 2013, Associated Press news article, the measure would require all abortions to take place in surgical centers, facilities designed to cope with major surgeries that could lead to life-threatening complications. As it stands, the story said, the majority of abortions are not surgical procedures, and 37 of the state's 42 abortion clinics do not meet the intended standard. The bill also would require abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they work, the AP said. Finally, the proposal as amended by the Texas House would restrict abortions after 20 weeks, shaving four weeks off current law. By email, Patterson told us that a recent poll by the University of Texas/Texas Tribune showed 62 percent of Texans supporting or strongly supporting the prospect of limiting abortions that occur after the 20th week of pregnancy. According to a June 20, 2013, Tribune news article on the poll, 62 percent said they would support "prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks." The poll, taken from May 30, 2013, through June 13, 2013, with help from California-based YouGov, sampled 1,200 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent. The Tribune reported that nearly half — 47 percent — said they would strongly support those prohibition. Its article continued: "It’s a strongly partisan issue, however, with 85 percent of Republicans in favor of the ban and nearly half of the Democrats against it. Fewer than 10 percent of Republicans oppose the 20-week ban; fewer than two in five Democrats support it." More broadly, the Tribune said, the poll indicated a general divide on abortion that it described as evident in past polls. "Some 46 percent of Texas voters say it should never be permitted or permitted only in cases involving incest, rape or when the woman's life is in danger," the article said, while "49 percent say it should be allowed after the need for an abortion has been clearly established, or that the choice should be completely left to the woman. Within those numbers, 16 percent said abortion should never be allowed, and 36 percent said that a woman should always be able to get an abortion as a matter of personal choice." By telephone, UT’s Jim Henson, the poll’s co-director, said the poll did not ask respondents directly about the proposal that ultimately fell short of final approval in the Senate. Nor, Henson said, were there questions touching on the bill’s provisions for abortion clinics to meet surgical hospital standards and for each provider physician to have admission privileges at a nearby hospital. "There was a lot more in that bill than the 20-week ban," Henson said. We searched for other recent polls of Texans about abortion or the legislation, finding only a survey by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a Washington-based firm whose leaders include Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg. In the poll of 601 registered voters, some 52 percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, the firm said in a June 20, 2013, summary, with 39 percent saying it should be illegal in most or all cases. The survey, taken June 17-19, 2013, had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. And the poll included a query about whether respondents would favor or oppose a proposal described as introduced by Perry and under consideration in the special session. The survey said: "This proposal would put in place new restrictions and regulations on abortion providers that would likely result in the closure of all but five abortion clinics in the state of Texas, all of which are located along the I-35 corridor, and would ban most abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy." In response, 42 percent somewhat or strongly favored the proposal with 51 percent somewhat or strongly opposing it, the firm said, while 7 percent did not know or did not respond. We noticed, though, that the question was preceded by inquiries arguably intended to stir respondents' concerns. For instance, the poll's first opinion question spoke to whether respondents thought women’s access to health care is "being threatened in Texas." The next query asked if the special session should focus on issues like education, jobs and the economy "instead of bringing up social issues like abortion that were already addressed" in the 2013 regular session. Farther along, the questions immediately before the one about the abortion proposal asked if the person trusted or didn’t trust Perry and the Legislature to "make decisions" about women’s health care; 57 percent said not. By email and telephone, Patterson told us he has seen no poll of Texans on anything but the 20-week provision. "The pro-choice folks focus solely on the ‘access’ issue," Patterson said, referring to criticism that the stepped-up medical standards will lead to clinics closing. But, he said, the 20-weeks’ provision became the most salient part of the legislation after it was restored to the measure in the House. "Ask anyone you know if they're ‘comfortable’ with abortions after 20 weeks," he said. He later added that a majority of voters might favor the measure’s required hospital standards. "But that’s conjecture," he said. Our ruling Patterson said the majority of Texans supported the abortion measure that died. Yet he did not offer nor did we find public polls covering every element of the legislation, though the GQR poll stretched to two elements of the legislation, seemingly finding a majority of Texans in opposition--though the poll struck us as laden with phrasing likely to encourage qualms about anti-abortion measures. Patterson’s statement has an element of truth in that 62 percent of respondents in the UT/Texas Tribune poll specifically supported barring abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which the proposal angled to do. But the lack of other backup evidence leaves the overall claim Mostly False.	None	Jerry Patterson	None	None	None	2013-06-27T06:00:00	2013-06-26	['Texas']

pomt-09278	"Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/28/allen-west/west-says-nearly-half-americans-pay-no-taxes/	Allen West, a Republican candidate for Congress for the South Florida seat now held by Democratic Rep. Ron Klein, claims that close to half of Americans aren't paying "any taxes." On a page about the economy on his Web site, West claims, "Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes." That's a strong claim -- that nearly half of Americans aren't paying "any taxes." We wondered, could that be true? First, a look at the context in which West made this claim. He made it in a section that focuses on income taxes -- though he said "any taxes": "If we are serious about restoring the American economy then suspend payroll taxes until the situation improves. I would begin with a 3 month suspension and willingly extend that to 6 months if necessary. In order to inspire investment, innovation, ingenuity, and real growth we must end capital gains, dividend, and death taxes, just abolish immediately. We should begin to redefine our tax code, no more progressive tax system; we need to go to a flat tax system. Currently we have some 40-45% of Americans who are not paying any taxes; a (flat tax) rate of around 15-17% would be adequate. A twist I recommend is to have a flat tax up to an income level of $2 Million, then institute a progressive system. My intent is to inspire Americans to earn and develop their wealth.: The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes federal income tax issues, found the number was actually 36.3 percent based on tax year 2008 filed in 2009. The figure refers to federal income taxes. "We found that out of the 142 million tax returns filed, roughly 51.6 million paid no income taxes or had negative income tax liability,'' said spokesperson Natasha Altamirano in an interview April 26, 2010. That equals 36.3 percent "who paid no income taxes or got additional money through refundable tax credits" and she added the 2008 numbers are actually the record high. Altamirano said that it's important be precise in describing that group. "One of the problems is when people say 'half of everyone, one-third of everyone does not pay taxes' -- that's not true,'' she said, because it omits other types of taxes such as property and sales taxes that those people still pay. "This is just federal income tax. Unless they are saying 'federal income taxes' it's just not true.'' Another measure: According to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, 46.9 percent of Americans paid no federal income taxes for 2009, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. We read him Allen West's quote about 40 to 45 percent of Americans not paying "any taxes," and Williams said: "That's not true at all." People who don't pay income taxes probably pay taxes in many other ways such as state and local sales tax and state and federal taxes on gasoline and alcohol. To avoid paying taxes entirely, "you couldn't drink, you couldn't smoke, you couldn't drive a car, you couldn't live in a house,'' Williams said. "It's hard to avoid them. We are very careful when we say 47 percent pay no federal income tax." West campaign spokeswoman Valentina Weis said West was referring to federal income tax. "This paragraph refers to Allen's position on the federal income tax, and it has been well documented that the mentioned percentage (actually quoted higher in some instances, 47 percent) do not pay any federal income taxes,'' she wrote in an e-mail. We spoke to West, who also told us that his claim referred to federal income taxes. When asked why he didn't state "federal income taxes" rather than "any tax" he said: "I presume people are smart enough to know what I'm talking about because I'm running for federal office,'' he said in an interview. West's campaign provided links to an editorial in USA Today and articles from CNN, the AP and Business Insider which cite the 47 percent figure. West's statement was made within a paragraph in which he discussed taxes, including several aspects of the income tax, but it appeared on a page about the economy that covered a range of financial issues including the "death tax," sub-prime mortgages and foreign aid. If West meant to say 40 to 45 percent of Americans don't pay "federal income taxes," he could have been more specific. As it is currently worded, the sentence is not specific and can lead people to believe he was referring to all types of taxes. So for the lack of important context, we rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09854	AARP is "endorsing" the health care reform bill.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/12/barack-obama/obama-goes-too-far-when-he-says-health-reform-bill/	With polls showing seniors are the most skeptical about the health care reform bills working their way through Congress, President Barack Obama sought to ease some of their concerns during a town hall meeting with a little high-powered name-dropping. The name: AARP. Several times at the town hall in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, Obama specifically mentioned AARP's support for health care reform. It's little wonder why: The AARP is the country's largest and most powerful advocate for seniors. "We have the AARP on board because they know this is a good deal for our seniors," Obama said at one point. And later, in response to a question about whether the health care plan would reduce the availability of medications through Medicare, Obama said, "Well, first of all, another myth that we've been hearing about is this notion that somehow we're going to be cutting your Medicare benefits. We are not. AARP would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining Medicare, okay?" It was that last comment that caught the attention of AARP executives. Not the part that AARP would not support a bill that undermines Medicare benefits. That's true. It was the suggestion that AARP had formally endorsed any particular version of the still-evolving health care plan working its way through Congress. AARP chief operating officer Tom Nelson immediately fired off a press release saying that "indications that we have endorsed any of the major health care reform bills currently under consideration in Congress are inaccurate." The rebuke likely confused a lot of AARP members who have read or heard numerous AARP statements in recent weeks that have supported various aspects of the health care plan. Just a few weeks ago, on July 14, the AARP issued a press release gushing about the introduction of the House health care reform bill saying, "This bill would make great strides for all of our members and their families." The group said it was pleased with the legislation for giving "every American has access to affordable, quality health care choices." Specifically, the release said the bill would make prescription drugs less expensive for seniors, would block insurance companies from denying coverage based on age, and for capping out-of-pocket expenses for some insurance plans. AARP did not explicitly say it was endorsing the bill, but there was not a single negative comment in the statement. In a July 14 ad sponsored by Healthy Economy Now — a coalition including AARP, the American Medical Association and the pharmaceutical industry, among others — the tone was decidedly upbeat. "The president and Congress have a plan to lower costs and stop denials for pre-existing conditions," the ad says. "It's time to act." The following day, AARP released a statement about the version of the bill being debated in the Senate. This time, the group was slightly less complimentary; while it said most parts of the legislation were good, AARP remained concerned about a provision in the bill that would prevent some generic drugs from entering the market faster. Since then, the climate in the health care debate has taken a decided nasty turn, with a deep and clear divide between Republicans and Democrats. But AARP spokesman Jim Dau said AARP was not reacting by tempering its stance. He said AARP supports a lot of changes that both the House and Senate bills would make, such as making drugs cheaper for seniors and ending discriminatory practices against the elderly, but the group has been clear all along that it has not endorsed any of the big bills. "We have endorsed specific measures," Dau said. "We're praising the pieces that we think are good for members." Dau pointed to a statement made by AARP CEO Barry Rand during a July 28 town hall meeting with Obama. "I want to make it clear that AARP has not endorsed any particular bill, any of the bills that are being circulated around Congress today and debated in Congress today," Rand said. "We continue to work with the members on both sides of the aisle, and we continue to work with the administration to achieve what is right for health care reform." Nelson echoed that bipartisan tone in his statement after Obama's town hall this week. "AARP has been working with Democrats and Republicans to fix our broken health care system," Nelson stated. "AARP supports specific measures that would help older Americans and their families – including bipartisan proposals to create a new follow-up care benefit in Medicare that would help prevent hospital readmissions, as well as to address the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the ‘doughnut hole.’ We also support the need for lawmakers and the administration to act this year to fix what doesn’t work in the health care system." So was Obama incorrect to say the AARP had endorsed the bill? The July 14 statement sure sounds to us like an endorsement, even if it didn't specifically contain that word. But in Washington, the word "endorse" means you have put the weight of your name behind an official stamp of approval for a bill, candidate or policy. And the fact is, AARP has not formally endorsed any specific bill. It strongly supports some aspects of the bills. But that's not a formal endorsement. And in fact, Obama was present two weeks ago when AARP's CEO said the group "has not endorsed any particular bill." So we rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09324	"The permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/14/julian-assange/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-tells-colbert-per/	In an April 12, 2010, interview on The Colbert Report, one of the WikiLeaks founders was pressed to explain why "Collateral Murder" was an accurate title for a leaked military video of a 3-year-old deadly encounter between a U.S. Apache helicopter gun crew and a cluster of men on a Baghdad street corner, two of whom were journalists for Reuters. Host Stephen Colbert called the title "emotional manipulation." He noted that while soldiers in the Apache did mistake cameras with long telephoto lenses slung over the shoulders of the two journalists for weapons, there were, in fact, two other men in the group with weapons. "How can you call it 'Collateral Murder?' " Colbert asked guest Julian Assange of Wikileaks, referring to the controversial and widely-viewed video. "So it appears there are possibly two men, one carrying an AK-47 and one carrying a rocket-propelled grenade -- although we're not 100 percent sure of that -- in the crowd," Assange answered. "However, the permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used and before the Reuters cameraman, Namir Noor-Eldeen, ever pulled up his camera and went around the corner." Assange is referring to a moment in the video when a Reuters cameraman peers from behind a wall, pointing a long telephoto lens. A soldier on the Apache yells "He's got an RPG!" According to a military investigation several days later, there were U.S. ground troops less than 100 meters away, and "due to the furtive nature of his movements, the cameraman gave every appearance of preparing to fire an RPG on U.S. soldiers." It's true that that's the first time the word "RPG" is uttered by the Apache crew in the unedited 40-minute version of the video. And it's also true that the permission to engage was given prior to that. But that doesn't mean the group of men on the street was believed to be unarmed prior to that, or that U.S. troops were given permission to shoot at a group of what they believed to be unarmed men. Let's walk through some of the early minutes of the the video, and accompanying audio, that comes via an Apache gun camera, to check Assange's claim. When the soldiers spot the group, the gun camera zeroes in on Noor-Eldeen, with the camera slung over his right shoulder. "There's one, yeah," says one of the crew members on the Apache. "Oh yeah," says another. "That's a weapon," the soldier says. "Yeah." Behind Noor-Eldeen is the other Reuters journalist, also with a camera. But then the cross-hairs in the camera pan to a couple of the other men farther back in the group. "Yep, he's got a weapon too," the soldier says. The soldier radios back, "Have 5 to 6 individuals with AK-47s. Request permission to engage." "Roger that...You are free to engage. Over." At that point, however, the helicopter has apparently circled around, and the group is no longer visible behind a wall. That's when we see the crouching journalist peek around the corner, pointing the camera. "He's got an RPG!" a soldier in the Apache yells. Moments later, the Apache circles back around the building, getting the men in full view, and the shooting begins. An investigative report prepared by the military includes several still photos taken from the gun camera video. One shows the two journalists with the cameras, and the report concludes they "could easily be mistaken for slung AK-47 or AKM rifles, especially since neither cameraman is wearing anything that identifies him as media or press." In addition, the report includes a still photo of the men a little father back, the ones who appeared to have prompted the comments "Yep, he's got a weapon, too." Entered as Exhibit B, the investigator placed red circles around what he concluded was two men "openly displaying an RPG and an AKM, while a third individual carries what appears to be an RPG round." Assange agreed on The Colbert Report that it appears one of the men was carrying an RPG launcher, and another an AK-47, but that the video is not entirely conclusive. The military investigative report states that ground troops later discovered two RPGs, an RPG launcher and a rifle where the group had been clustered, and an RPG round under one of the bodies. In an interview with PolitiFact, Assange correctly pointed out that military investigators state definitively that the Apache soldiers had identified men with weapons, "AK-47s and a RPG," though the crew had not actually said the word RPG prior to asking for permission to engage. The report states that men on the street were observed with "weapons consistent with reports of hostile acts conducted against friendly forces" and that they had "satisfied all requirements to initiate an engagement." The report also mentions that the man peering around the side of the building (with what turned out to be a camera) appeared to be a sign of "hostile intent." Again, that happened after permission to engage had already been granted. Assange called that "retrospective justification." When Assange points out in the context of justifying the title "Collateral Murder" that the word "RPG" was not used until after the permission to engage was given, he leaves the impression that the soldiers were given the okay to open fire on a group of unarmed men, or men believed to be unarmed. But the video and accompanying audio make clear that the soldiers in the helicopter said they spotted "weapons" among those in the group -- later identified by an army investigator as an AK-47 and an RPG -- and that they mistook two cameras with telephoto lenses as weapons as well. Assange said he does not accept that his comment makes that implication, that introductory text in the video clearly states, "Although some of the men appear to have been armed, the behavior of nearly everyone was relaxed." Who can say whether those in the Apache meant RPG when the crosshairs turned to two of the other men in the group -- not journalists -- and they said "he's got a weapon, too." Photographs suggest that it probably was a man with an RPG, and another with an AK-47 rifle. Still, the soldiers in the Apache reported, "Five to six individuals with AK-47s." That's what the permission to engage appears to have been based upon. RPG's were not specifically referred to by that point, but other "weapons" were. And so while Assange's statement is technically accurate, we think it leaves out critical context. And we rule it Half True.	None	Julian Assange	None	None	None	2010-04-14T19:55:17	2010-04-12	['None']

pomt-01114	"There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, ‘If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.’ "	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/08/craig-melvin/msnbc-host/	We admit to feeling like we’ve heard it all before when it comes to debate on long-stalled immigration reform in Congress. Recently, though, we heard something new -- and if true, shocking -- in a little-noticed segment after the winter holidays. NBC News correspondent Craig Melvin was talking about the implications of the House speaker’s race for immigration policy and federal funding of immigration enforcement during the Jan. 5, 2015, edition of The Rundown with Jose Diaz-Balart (Melvin was filling in as host). The border is more secure since President Barack Obama took over, Melvin said, adding that some Republicans have actually conceded that things are going well in that department. "There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, ‘If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.’ Is that not accurate?" Melvin asked his guests. We decided to check if it was. Did GOP members, who have made securing the border a priority over any type of amnesty, actually say they wouldn’t know where to place more Border Patrol agents if they approved the money? Melvin referred us to a Dec. 26 interview he conducted for MSNBC with Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky. Yarmuth is a Democrat, not a Republican, and a member of the House’s "gang" of eight who worked on a bipartisan immigration solution in 2013. The Senate had its own gang of eight; neither resulted in a law. Yarmuth told Melvin that Obama had done much to secure the border, and there were guards aplenty. Key to this fact-check, he relayed what he said were the words of two Texas Republicans. "Illegal border crossings are about half what they were before the Obama administration took over. We have as many Border Patrol people on guard as we can possibly need. I was part of the group of eight in the House, the bipartisan group that worked on immigration reform during the last Congress, and our Texas members basically said we would not know where to put more border guards right now." So Melvin’s comments come from Yarmuth, who says they came from two Texas members serving on the House’s gang of eight -- Republican Reps. John Carter and Sam Johnson. PunditFact reached out to Carter and Johnson several times and heard nothing back from their staff. Yarmuth’s office, meanwhile, didn’t offer us more details behind his comments. So we have very little to go on other than one congressman’s word, which was then repeated by an MSNBC host. But that doesn’t quite put us at a dead end. We can say we found no record of Carter or Johnson making the type of comment Yarmuth said they did in public. In fact, we found evidence of the opposite. Carter and Johnson left the immigration policy group in September 2013, announcing in a joint press release that they had "a lack of faith" in Obama’s enforcement approach and would support their GOP colleagues’ approach that "starts with a genuinely secure border." In an Aug. 11, 2014, interview with Fox Business Network, Carter made the case for additional border patrol agents along the Southern border. "We have to put resources on the border," Carter said. "Fencing, experience along the Rio Grande, is a very difficult issue because that's a very windy river, awfully hard to build. And remember, in Texas, we have private property that borders on our border in Texas. So all that fencing would have to be done on private property. "We need to put the resources, the human resources, out there. I'm proud of our governor for sending our Texas Department of Public Safety down there, and a massive amount, and also, the willingness to use the Texas National Guard, both of which will assist an overwhelmed and very dedicated border patrol." And a month earlier, Johnson issued a July 2014 statement calling on additional border patrol agents. "As it is the responsibility of the federal government to secure our borders, Washington must do so now and send more border patrol agents to Texas. I will continue working to ensure Texas has the resources and manpower it needs to secure the border. It can and must be done." We should note that both of these comments came at a time when many were upset by the influx of children crossing the border from Central America. The comments, however, came months before Yarmuth and then Melvin said the opposite. Victor Manjarrez, associate director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, said he never heard Carter or Johnson say the border didn’t need more manpower. "Quite honestly that would be a little shocking to hear members of Congress from Texas saying that," Manjarrez said. "You typically have members of Congress want to throw resources at you." On the other hand, members of the federal enforcement community deemed a proposal to double the number of Border Patrol agents to about 39,000 unnecessary, said Manjarrez, who retired from the Border Patrol in May 2011 as a sector chief in Tucson, Ariz. After the Sept. 11 attacks, when border enforcement was moved to the newly created Department of Homeland Security, the number of border patrol agents doubled from about 2,000 in the 2002 fiscal year to more than 20,800 as of the 2014 fiscal year (a small decrease from 2013). Another doubling of resources within a year or so would be drastic, he said. "When they talk about doubling the size of Border Patrol last year ... just from my previous experience and my peers that won’t be allowed to talk, that was really overkill," Manjarrez said. Our ruling Melvin said, "There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, ‘If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.’ " Melvin got his information from an interview he conducted with a Democratic congressman who quoted two Texas Republicans as saying as much. But there is no public record of the two Texas Republicans, Reps. Carter and Johnson, saying remarks along those lines that we could find. While it may have transpired behind closed doors, we have no evidence that it did. What we do know is that both Texas congressmen have more recently advocated for additional border patrol agents, a fact that neither Yarmuth or Melvin mentioned. For Melvin, he accurately recounted what he heard. But in this game of telephone, all we get is a busy signal at the other end. Because of a lack of evidence, and the public comments of Carter and Johnson, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03217	Says President Barack Obama could "basically" legalize all immigrants here illegally "by the sign of a pen."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/aug/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-fears-obama-could-basically-legalize-a/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio has a dire message for conservatives who oppose immigration reform: Do something to improve the status quo, or President Barack Obama could make the situation much worse. "I’ve been saying now I believe that this president will be tempted, if nothing happens in Congress, he will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen," Rubio said in a recent interview with Tallahassee talk radio host Preston Scott. Rubio, an author of the immigration proposal that passed the Senate this summer, said such a move could doom GOP immigration priorities of stepped-up border security and E-Verify checks in the Senate proposal. We cannot fact-check the future, but we thought it appropriate to examine whether Rubio’s worst-case scenario could actually happen. Could Obama essentially legalize "11 million people by the sign of a pen" like the DREAM Act population? No blanket citizenship It’s easy to interpret Rubio’s statement as Obama conceivably granting all-out citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants via an executive order. That could not happen. Doing so would violate the country’s separation of powers. Congress determined the laws governing how a person can legally reside in the country, so Obama cannot give out green cards, paths to citizenship or permanent residency en masse, experts told us. He does not have the authority to override laws simply by proclamation. "Executive orders have tended to be quite focused, not open-ended over time," said Kevin Johnson, University of California Davis School of Law dean. "Such an order would likely be subject to quite possibly successful legal challenge, with the claim being that legalization would be contrary to an act of Congress, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act." But all-out citizenship is not exactly what Rubio warned against. Rubio is very familiar with this subject, having tried to craft a proposal similar to the DREAM Act, a law that would have provided legal residency to immigrants brought to the country by their parents. But in June 2012, amid stalled DREAM Act efforts, Obama announced a new administrative policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation and allows them to work in the country. So far, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has approved at least 430,000 people for this form of deferred action. An angry Rubio said Obama made it harder for any legislation to pass. To Rubio, Obama’s policy "basically legalized" this group of illegal immigrants and was improper -- and he’s not alone in this perspective. Giving someone a renewable status with work authorization and other benefits without punishment is de facto legalization, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that opposes the Senate bill and is for stricter immigration control. Others say deferred action does not amount to legal status because the classification is temporary. The action puts an individual in legal limbo while allowing them to possibly apply for a driver’s license and work without fear of immediate deportation, said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a professor at the Pennsylvania State Dickinson School of Law and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights. The Department of Homeland Security justified the policy by saying it was within the "prosecutorial discretion" of the executive branch. Obama: ‘I’m not a king’ We’ve arrived at a significant part of our fact-check: Could Obama grant deferred action to the entire population of illegal immigrants, not just Dreamers? Obama has shot down that possibility, stressing the need for a comprehensive bill. "I’m not a king," Obama said in January to Telemundo. "You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, we’ve got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But we can’t simply ignore the law." Still, the administration has considered the pros and cons of a broad-based legalization program that excludes people who are a security risk, according to a leaked 2010 DHS memo. The draft memo detailed many risks for such a move, including blowback from Congress and the impression the department secretary is abdicating "her charge to enforce immigration laws." Rubio spokesman Alex Conant pointed us to a National Journal piece that examined an idea among immigration activists that involves persuading Obama "to freeze the current undocumented population in place through an administrative order, give them work permits, and hope for a better deal under the next president, with the hope that he or she is a Democrat," according to the story. They want Obama to expand the deferred action program to other immigrants here illegally, such as those who work, are caregivers, or are immigrant parents of children who are citizens. "It’s not an empty threat," Frank Sharry of America’s Voice told POLITICO. "If Republicans block reform with a path to citizenship, immigration reform activists will look at all their options, including broad executive action." Deferred action for all? Experts told us Obama indeed has broad executive power over deportations and granting temporary work permits. But it’s a stretch to say he could legally offer all undocumented immigrants that deal. If he wanted to order a stay of deportations across the board, he would have to provide a strong justification, such as a lack of resources to do the job, said Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas School of Law professor who co-authored an argument against the constitutionality of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. "But he could do that only briefly, and only in what I’d consider pretty extreme circumstances," Delahunty said. On the other hand, the country’s immigration laws grant Obama and the Department of Homeland Security lots of wiggle room in granting temporary work permits and refusing to widely deport people, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. A widespread stay, though, would be "a crazy scenario," he said. Even some of Obama’s loudest critics on immigration policy don’t think he would go that far. "It could be done. Obama’s gotten away with as much, but I don’t think he’d do it," Krikorian said. "That would be a bridge too far even for the pusillanimous appeasers among Republicans in Congress." Experts thought it more conceivable that Obama would chip away at the undocumented immigrant population little by little by building on the deferred action policy for children who came to the country as minors. An expansion would have to come with caveats, such as cut-off dates and clean criminal histories. "It would be the mother of all political battles," said Carl Hampe, a private immigration lawyer who was counsel for the Senate subcommittee on immigration from 1983 to 1991 and worked for the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. "As a purely theoretical legal question, is there a plausible argument that the president has that legal authority? Some would argue yes." There’s also an argument that halting deportations alone would do little to offer relief to the country’s millions of unauthorized immigrants. They would still be in a legal limbo because most of the 400,000 or so people currently being deported are those who’ve committed crimes, said Lynden Melmed, who served as former chief counsel of the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the George W. Bush administration. Our ruling Rubio said that absent immigration reform from Congress, Obama "will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen." Could Obama offer deferred action for the entire population of undocumented immigrants? His executive powers over deportations are strong, but most experts say that’s an extreme scenario and susceptible to legal challenges, not to mention political fallout. More likely is that Obama could extend deferred action to more subsets of the undocumented population, pushing them lower on the priority list and into a deal-with-you-later category. That might be relief for them, but it’s also a legal limbo that falls short of legalization. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02200	Says Al Franken "voted to exempt himself and Congress from enrolling in (the Affordable Care Act marketplaces)."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/24/mike-mcfadden/gop-challenger-says-al-franken-voted-exempt-himsel/	Republican Mike McFadden claims his midterm opponent, incumbent Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., wanted to excuse himself from the health care reform’s requirement to buy insurance on the marketplace. "What’s Minnesota gotten from Al Franken?" the narrator asks in McFadden’s April 17 TV ad "Miss," a $9,800 buy. In the background, a hockey player misses each shot he takes. "Record spending, over 40 votes for higher taxes and Franken voted for Obamacare. Then voted to exempt himself and Congress from enrolling in it. For Minnesota, it was miss after miss after miss." McFadden’s argument gets it wrong and hinges on a technicality. PolitiFact wanted to address the topic of a congressional exemption, one we’ve taken a look at already from other Republican lawmakers. How Congress gets its health plans Prior to the Affordable Care Act, members of Congress chose their plans from the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. They had an employer subsidy, similar to the one an average American usually gets from a large employer. But as the health care reform was drafted, Republicans wanted to make sure Democratic members of Congress would get a taste of their own medicine, so to speak. McFadden’s office pointed us to a 2009 amendment to the Affordable Care Act proposed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that called for members of Congress to buy their insurance on the healthcare.gov marketplaces. Like most Democrats, Franken voted against that amendment. Around the same time, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., put forward a similar provision. The main difference was that Coburn’s didn’t indicate that legislators could put their employer-provided subsidies toward marketplace plans. Franken and other Democrats actually became sponsors on Coburn’s bill. When asked on the Senate floor if he was serious about purchasing insurance on the marketplace, Franken responded: "I talked to my wife, Franni. We have been married 34 years now. I talked to her a couple of weeks ago. I said if this passed, we should do the public option. She said, 'Absolutely.' Yes, I am perfectly serious about this.'' The public option, envisioned as a government-backed insurance plan, didn’t make it into the final law. But Franken’s clear support of it shows he himself favored buying insurance under the new law. When Al Franken and 59 others voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, they approved the following text: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after the effective date of this subtitle, the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are— (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)." In 2013, because Grassley’s exact wording hadn’t all been transferred to the law, there was confusion as to whether members of Congress would still receive their employer-provided subsidies when they switched plans. This is a special case, because most Americans who receive insurance from their employers were not affected by healthcare.gov’s launch. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management cleared things up in August 2013, a couple of months before the online marketplaces opened. They confirmed that legislators would be able to use their subsidies toward their marketplace premiums if they purchased through the District of Columbia’s marketplace. Franken purchased insurance using Minnesota’s state marketplace, MNsure, according to the Star Tribune. In doing so, he declined the employer subsidy the law allotted him and other legislators. Our ruling McFadden’s ad claimed Franken voted to exempt himself from enrolling in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The senator did vote against one amendment. However, he supported a different amendment that required Congress to buy marketplace insurance, and he clearly articulated his support for the idea on the Senate floor. Now he's buying his own insurance through the Minnesota exchange and voluntarily forgoing a subsidy. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10033	The stimulus bill includes "$8 billion for high-speed rail projects, such as a 'magnetic levitation' line from Las Vegas to Disneyland."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/27/bobby-jindal/Jindal-on-high-speed-rail/	Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal used a moment in the national spotlight to claim the stimulus bill was "larded with wasteful spending," including money for what sounded like a theme-park ride. "It includes $300 million to buy new cars for the government, $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, such as a 'magnetic levitation' line from Las Vegas to Disneyland, and $140 million for something called 'volcano monitoring,'" Jindal said of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, responding on national television to President Obama's first speech to Congress on Feb. 24, 2009. Critics questioned the premise that any of these was a waste of money, and some, including a few news organizations , suggested the high-speed rail claim was a well-worn lie. Republicans had been blasting the $8 billion expenditure — and playing fast and loose with the facts at times — ever since the House-Senate conference committee stuck it in the final version of the bill. Neither the House nor Senate versions had anything close to $8 billion for rail funding, and Republicans alleged Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid added the money in conference specifically for a high-speed rail line from Anaheim, Calif., to Las Vegas, in Reid's home state. That proposed project would be powered by magnetic levitation, a technology in which opposing magnetic fields along the track and in the train's undercarriage levitate the train a quarter-inch and propel it forward. "Maglev" trains, currently in use in China and Japan, are frictionless and fast. Proponents say the proposed Anaheim-to-Vegas train would reach 310 mph, zipping passengers between the cities in 80.5 minutes. Reid has backed the project for years, and critics such as Rep. Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan and Sen. John McCain of Arizona alleged that's where all $8 billion was headed. That charge was widely, and appropriately, criticized as false. The money is not an "earmark." Nothing in the bill stipulates that it has to go to the Anaheim-to-Vegas project. In fact, it's all but certain dozens of other projects — such as in the Northeast corridor, where key Republican supporters of the stimulus bill reside, or in the Chicago area, hometown of another influential individual — will compete and win a share of the money. Now back to Jindal. It's not quite fair to lump his comment in with the prior claims. He was more careful than some of the other Republican critics. Though he may have left some listeners with the incorrect impression that the Vegas-Anaheim project would definitely get some or all of the money — and he may have done so intentionally — technicially he did not say that. He said it would go to projects "such as" Reid's project. Indeed, that project is an example of the sort that the $8 billion may fund, as proponents of it have pointed out repeatedly. "It would be great if this was one of those projects that would happen to benefit from it," Reid spokesman Jon Summers said in an interview. (He was vague about Reid's role in getting the $8 billion in the bill, saying "it was something that President Obama wanted and Senator Reid as a conferee supported.") Other boosters of the project also expressed optimism that they'll get some of the $8 billion. Anaheim-to-Vegas is not a federally designated high-speed rail corridor, but that doesn't mean it's out of the running. The Senate version of the bill, which had $2 billion for high speed rail, limited the money to such corridors, but the conference committee removed that requirement. That's not to say that Jindal's claim didn't have some problems. For one, the train would not stop at Disneyland. The plan is for it to stop 2 miles away at a proposed new transportation hub called the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center. Jindal may have said Disneyland rather than Anaheim to make the project sound recreational or frivolous — but in doing so he stretched the truth a tad. We also want to point out that although Jindal and just about everyone else who has talked about the $8 billion has said it's for high-speed rail, it's not just for high-speed rail. It's for high-speed rail and conventional "intercity" rail service. States and agencies all over the country can apply for a share of the money for all sorts of expenses related to city-to-city rail service, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. So Jindal was imprecise on a couple of counts — the train won't go to Disneyland and all $8 billion is not for high-speed rail. But he was not out of bounds in employing the Anaheim-to-Vegas train as an example of the sort of project that may be funded by the $8 billion. We find his claim Half True.

pomt-02286	"EPA officials have commended (Koch Industries) for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/04/charles-koch/epa-koch-brothers-business-environment/	For several weeks now, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has taken to the chamber floor to malign David and Charles Koch, the billionaire brothers who contribute heavily to libertarian causes and bankroll ads critical of Democrats. On April 2, 2014, Charles Koch fired back in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, arguing that Reid’s comments were disrespectful and a bad sign for democracy. And he defended Koch Industries and their subsidiaries against attacks, including claims that they oppose environmental protections. "Koch employees have earned well over 700 awards for environmental, health and safety excellence since 2009, many of them from the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration," Koch wrote. "EPA officials have commended us for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ " Subsidiaries of Koch Industries include manufacturers like paper maker Georgia Pacific and INVISTA, a textile fiber producer. It also owns companies that deal with excavation of natural resources like Flint Hills Resources and Koch Pipeline. As you can imagine, these are industries that are heavily regulated by federal agencies like the EPA. So does the EPA think Koch Industries is a model environmentalist? We decided to explore that claim. Tracking down the quotes Quotes can often be taken out of context, so we thought it would be useful to understand exactly what the EPA said about Koch Industries and their subsidiaries. A spokesman for Koch Industries was able to provide a pair of press releases with the full quotes. So did the EPA call Koch Industries a "model for other companies"? Kinda, but not really. The EPA was complimentary of one specific agreement reached in 2010 with Koch subsidiary Flint Hills Resources after the agency raised concerns about permits for a refinery in Texas. "The process we have agreed to with Flint Hills Resources is an excellent one, and we look forward to working with the company to complete the work to transition their permits," stated Al Armendariz, Regional Administrator for EPA Region 6. "It is our hope that the FHR process will serve as a model for other companies seeking to transition to federally-approved permits." As you can see, they were very complimentary of the process in this one instance for this refinery in Texas. But it wasn’t really a blanket statement of the company or Koch Industries. Let’s move on to whether the EPA has commended Koch Industries for their "commitment to a cleaner environment." This one has more truth to it, but again, in a limited context. In 2009, Georgia Pacific was named a SmartWay Excellence Award recipient by the EPA. SmartWay is a private-public program run by the EPA that links up manufacturers and retailers with transportation services to "improve fuel efficiency and the environmental performance ... of the goods movement supply chains." Georgia Pacific was given the award because the company increased its partnership with SmartWay-approved carriers and grew more efficient in their distribution models. According to a Georgia Pacific press release, here’s the full quote from the EPA official: "I commend Georgia-Pacific for its leadership in promoting sustainable transportation practices through the SmartWay Transport Partnership," said Margo T. Oge, director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA. "These actions demonstrate a commitment to a cleaner environment and more secure energy supply." An EPA spokeswoman told PolitiFact that the statement was solely "about GP’s transportation practices as a member of SmartWay," and not an assessment of the entire company. Interestingly, the EPA used identical language in 2000 after reaching a clean air agreement with Koch Petroleum Group and BP Amoco. But the accord was only finalized after Koch was forced to pay a $4.5 million penalty and spend $80 million to improve emissions in three refineries. "BP Amoco and Koch took the initiative to begin talks with EPA earlier this spring rather than wait for possible EPA enforcement action," the EPA said in a press release. "In return for the company’s cooperation and ambitious commitment to a cleaner environment, EPA has offered a ‘clean slate’ for certain past violations, and greater flexibility and incentives for new technology." So in this case, "commitment to a cleaner environment" only came after the EPA threatened enforcement actions. What else has EPA said about Koch Industries? While those positive quotes about Koch Industries and their subsidies are at least partially accurate, it’s a lopsided picture of the EPA’s dealings with the company in the last two decades. Since the late 1990s, Koch companies have repeatedly found themselves in the crosshairs of the EPA for various environmental violations. On numerous occasions they were forced to pay hefty fines and settlements and change their practices as a result of EPA and Justice Department action. The bulk of the more serious violations occurred years ago, but there have been other actions taken recently as well. Here’s a sampling: In 1999, Koch Industries was found guilty of negligence and malice after two teens in Texas died as a result of an underground pipe leaking butane, according to reports. In January 2000, Koch Industries was forced to pay a $30 million civil penalty, "the largest civil fine ever imposed on a company under any federal environmental law" and $5 million in cleanup efforts to resolve claims of more than 300 spills from oil pipelines in six states. "This record civil penalty sends a clear message to those who transport hazardous materials: You cannot endanger public health or the environment," said Attorney General Janet Reno. "We will not let you foul our water and spoil our land by breaking the law." In March 2000, the Koch Petroleum Group was sentenced to pay $6 million in criminal fines and $2 million in remediation costs — the largest federal fine ever paid in Minnesota at the time — after it was found that one of their refineries polluted waterways and wetlands in Minnesota before 1997. According to a press release, "Koch admitted that it negligently discharged aviation fuel into a wetland and an adjoining waterway. Even though Koch was aware of the problem, it did not develop a comprehensive plan to recover between 200,000-600,000 gallons of released fuel until June 1997." In September 2000, Koch Industries was indicted for environmental crimes at a refinery the company owned in Texas. They eventually paid a $25 million fine after pleading guilty to one criminal charge. "Companies that produce dangerous pollutants simply cannot focus on profit and efficiency at the expense of a community's health," said Lois Schiffer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the environment at the Justice Department. "We will continue to find and prosecute those who would flout our environmental laws." In February 2013, Koch Nitrogen Company paid a $380,000 fine for failing to create a risk management program for facilities producing and storing ammonia products in Iowa and Kansas. In March 2014, Flint Hills Resources paid a $350,000 fine for leaky equipment at a Texas chemical plant that allowed hazardous air pollutants into the atmosphere. Though the EPA also credited the company for implementing what it described as "innovative technologies" in the plant to capture pollutants. Our ruling In his op-ed, Charles Koch wrote that "EPA officials have commended us for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ " Actually, the EPA was focusing on very limited aspects of Koch Industries and not the company as a whole. Further, Koch Industries has a history with the EPA that was completely glossed over, and it includes multiple violations of rules. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11479	"Electrolux, Sweden's largest appliance maker, has just abandoned a $250 million investment in the United States because of the steel tariffs. That is retaliation."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/05/stuart-varney/fox-business-host-makes-2-errors-steel-tariffs-and/	A fair bit of uncertainty surrounds President Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Trump said he wanted a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, but the White House gave no additional details, such as whether any countries might be exempted. It’s also unclear how other countries might respond. Fox Business host Stuart Varney discussed the potential for retaliation, saying American producers of corn or beef might see new tariffs imposed overseas for their products. That all remained to be seen, but Varney ended with one immediate example he had just learned about. "Electrolux, Sweden's largest appliance maker, has just abandoned a $250 million investment in the United States because of the steel tariffs," Varney said. "That is retaliation." We looked at two questions: Did Electrolux cancel plans to expand its plant in Springfield, Tenn.? And does its decision amount to retaliation? Electrolux said Varney got it wrong. It hasn’t canceled anything. "It’s not accurate to say that we have abandoned the investment," said Daniel Frykholm, the top spokesman for Electrolux. "We are concerned about the negative impact, financially and on the overall competitiveness of our U.S. operations. Until we have the final order and can understand the details, we are putting our commitment to invest $250 million in Tennessee on hold." Electrolux buys only American steel for the Frigidaire-brand refrigerators, dishwashers and other home appliances it makes in the United States. The trade experts we reached said they wouldn’t call Electrolux’s move retaliation precisely because its operations are exposed to changes in the price of steel. "If steel in the United States is now much more expensive because of Trump’s national security tariffs, then it would be cheaper to make the appliances in another country," said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade Washington think tank. "That is a business decision, not retaliation." Frederick Abbott, law professor at the Florida State University College of Law, said legally, Electrolux’s announcement doesn’t fit the definition of retaliation. Exactly as Varney was saying before he mentioned Electrolux, nations retaliate, not companies. "Action by a privately owned company would not be considered ‘retaliation’, which would generally be understood to refer to a governmental measure, such as the imposition of tariffs or quotas," Abbott said. The only gray zone in trade law, Abbott said, is in the case of state-owned industry, for example in China. But Electrolux is owned by a broad range of investors, including American retirement funds such as Vanguard and TIAA, and many others. Electrolux doesn’t fall into any gray zone, Abbott said. "The decision by Electrolux would not be considered retaliation by knowledgeable trade lawyers and economists," Abbott said. We reached out to Fox News and did not hear back. Our ruling Varney said that Electrolux had abandoned a $250 million investment in an American plant in "retaliation" for steel tariffs announced by Trump. The statement errs on two points. Electrolux said it had put its plans on hold until it better understood the impact on the price of steel, a key input in the home appliances it makes. Trade experts said that pause is a business decision, not retaliation. In trade, retaliation is the province of governments that might choose to slap their own tariffs on another country’s goods to get even for new tariffs their companies face. Electrolux did put its investment on hold, but beyond that basic fact, Varney was off the mark. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12952	In New York, "Average college debt - $30,000 per student."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jan/05/andrew-cuomo/college-graduates-new-york-owe-about-30000-average/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said high levels of student loan debt motivated his proposal for free tuition at any public university or community college in New York state for students from families earning less than $125,000 a year. "It is incredibly expensive, and the debt is so high it’s like starting a race with an anchor tied to your leg," Cuomo said of paying for college. "Average college debt -- $30,000 per student." The governor’s office projected 210,000 students would seek the benefit. If so, the program would cost the state $163 million annually by 2019. So is Cuomo right about the average student debt load in New York state? The average debt load The Federal Reserve Bank of New York collected 2015 data on student loan debt in the state. The Fed reports 17.9 percent of consumers in New York state have a student loan, and their average college debt is $32,200. That’s higher than the national average of $29,700, the Fed said. The debt steadily increased for a decade. According to a September report from the State Comptroller’s office, the average student debt load in New York State increased by more than 47 percent between 2005 and 2015. The national average grew by 56 percent. Total student debt statewide more than doubled during that time period. The Institute for College Access & Success, an independent, non-profit organization, pegged the average debt of the state’s college graduates in 2015 at $29,320. That ranked 18th highest among the states. Fifty-nine percent of the students graduated with debt, the organization said. The average debt among graduates of State University of New York campuses was generally lower than their private college counterparts. The average debt for University at Buffalo graduates was $26,165, followed by those at Binghamton University, $25,844; SUNY Albany, $25,727; and Stony Brook University, $23,542. The average debt for graduates fluctuated among private colleges in New York state. Among the higher averages were incurred by graduates of Ithaca College, $39,771; Rochester Institute of Technology, $38,198; St. Bonaventure University, $38,073; Fordham University, $37,607; and Syracuse University, $36,500, according to the institute. The average debt was lower - but still significant - for graduates at other private universities: Colgate University, $20,859; Cornell University, $24,394; Clarkson University, $29,000; New York University, $30,480; St. John’s University, $33,179. Our ruling Cuomo said the average college debt for those who borrowed for college in New York state is "$30,000 per student." Cuomo gets it right, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, which analyzed debt for 2015 graduates in New York State. And his claim is about what the Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculates for all New York state consumers with college debt.

pomt-07496	There was "some sort of informal commitment to build a (psychiatric) building in downtown Cleveland."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/12/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-there-was-informal-agreement-/	Gov. John Kasich announced in his State of the State address his decision to not build a psychiatric hospital on Euclid Avenue in the Midtown area of Cleveland. The Ohio Department of Mental Health, he said, would scrap "some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland," and instead would renovate Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare's "dilapidated" facility in Northfield. Kasich said he broke the news to Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson in a phone call and that Jackson responded that he understood. The result, Kasich said, will be reduced operating expenses, money saved on capital improvements and better care for the mentally ill. Jackson subsequently said he did not acquiesce as Kasich implied. Andrea Taylor, a spokeswoman, said Jackson told Kasich he understood the rationale but that he didn’t agree with the decision. Other local officials argue that the project was not intended as a building development for Cleveland but as a service for patients and their families, most of whom are from Cuyahoga County. PolitiFact Ohio is not weighing the merits of the two sites and plans. This item will just consider Kasich's statement about "some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland." We asked the governor's office for supporting details, and got them from Trudy Sharp, communications director for the Department of Mental Health. The mayor's office connected us with Chris Warren, Jackson's chief of regional development. Both sides -- if they can be called sides -- gave essentially the same accounting of events: As far back as 2003, the state began looking to replace Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare's facility on West 25th Street in Cleveland. By 2007, the plan expanded to include replacement of the Northfield facility on a single site in Cuyahoga County. In 2008, without designating a site, the General Assembly budgeted $83.7 million "to replace the Cleveland facility, with consideration for expansion that will allow for the merger of the Cleveland and Northfield facilities." After considering at least 10 sites, the city and state signed a letter of intent in June 2009 to use property on Cleveland’s Euclid Avenue in the Midtown Corridor, with various conditions. Both had the right to end the agreement without penalty. To meet conditions, Warren said, the city spent $4 million assembling and preparing the 14-acre site. The state would have paid the city $2.1 million for it. Sharp said the letter expired at the end of 2009, and the city did not extend it. Warren said the letter did not expire but would have had to be actively terminated. He noted that correspondence and meetings between the city and state continued through 2010, and that the city's work on the hospital site continued. Warren and Taylor said the city learned of Kasich's decision to instead renovate the Northfield facility, without a chance for discussion, 48 hours before it was announced. "Legally they're within their rights," Warren said. He said the city had accepted a risk in acquiring and preparing the property, which now is "very marketable." But developing the property "is not what it (the agreement) was to do," he said. "It was to provide mental health services, to keep services in Cleveland. That was the intent of the appropriation." Of the $83.7 million allocated for construction, $60 million will go to renovation in Northfield, Sharp said. The rest will go to other facilities around the state. She said the department would save money because the projected cost of a new facility in Cleveland had climbed to $100 million. Where does that leave us? It is true that a letter of intent is not a binding, irrevocable agreement. But the letter of intent is also more than just a wink and a nod. A letter of intent is an understanding that often is preliminary to a formal contract. A story March 19 in The Plain Dealer bought into Kasich’s terminology, describing site work Cleveland did as "part of an informal agreement with the state." But is that what an average person would think knowing all the details? Characterizing the arrangement as "some sort of an informal commitment to build a building in downtown Cleveland" suggests vagueness about the plans. That’s not the case. People in Cleveland and Columbus worked for years on this project. We think a listener hearing Kasich's description would be surprised by these details: The evaluation of facilities dated back eight years The General Assembly included $83.7 million in its 2008 budget for a new clinic to replace the antiquated facility in Cleveland The city did lengthy work on site search, acquisition and preparation and a price had been determined for how much the state would pay the city for the property. The city and state put their intentions to use the Midtown site in writing. Given those details, we think characterizing the effort as some sort of an informal commitment is not just misleading, but also inaccurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates as False.

pomt-07185	"We've seen 115,000 jobs created in the American auto industry since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/09/brian-deese/economics-adviser-brian-deese-says-auto-industry-h/	As President Barack Obama prepared to go to Toledo on June 3 to laud the American auto industry’s comeback, the White House as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown were prepping the press. Brian Deese, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, joined Brown, an Ohio Democrat, June 2 on a telephone news conference call to hail the industry’s resurgence following Chrysler’s and General Motors’ bankruptcies and $62 billion worth of government bailouts. "We've seen 115,000 jobs created in the American auto industry since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy," said Deese, a point man on the auto recovery for the Obama administration. "More than 8,000 jobs in Ohio," he continued. "That's the best case of job growth in this country since the late '90s in the auto industry." These numbers made us pause, because of something The Plain Dealer had published that very day: The two automakers employ 16,500 fewer people nationwide than they did in 2009. Just looking at Ohio plants, Chrysler downsized its workforce since 2009 while General Motors had an increase. Put together, these resulted in a net gain of 1,496 jobs in the state. These numbers are very different from what the administration cited. How could that be? Deese said it’s because he was talking about the overall industry -- U.S. workers at Chrysler and General Motors and also at every other company in the industry. That includes auto parts makers and people employed in car dealerships and parts stores, because parts makers often supply multiple manufacturers and each component of the industry relies on the other. Deese said his numbers came from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the White House provided us with the data.. We also went to BLS’ databases independently. Deese’s numbers checked out, both nationally and for Ohio, but his starting point left us with some questions. We found that from June 2009 to April 2011, the most recent month reported, the auto industry rebounded with 115,400 jobs nationwide and 8,200 in Ohio. These were the months Deese used for his measurement.. Why June? Because that’s when Chrysler’s strongest operations emerged from bankruptcy with a new life -- on June 10 -- after filing in April that year. But General Motors didn’t file for bankruptcy until June 1, 2009, and the bankruptcy didn’t end until July 10. What would the rebound look like, then, if we didn’t start counting until July? By waiting to count until the month GM exited bankruptcy, the industry’s nationwide comeback would come to 84,300 jobs, which would put Deese’s claim off by 27 percent nationally. In Ohio, however, he’d still be awfully close, at 7,900. We bring this up not to nit-pick. Calculations for both time frames show a rebound. But Deese specifically said his numbers showed the success "since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy," and "emerge" means to rise from. GM was still engaged in its reorganization when the turnaround started. The dates Deese chose also happen to show the greatest level of rebound. Would it have been more accurate for him to start his counting a month later, when GM exited bankruptcy? We asked the Center for Automotive Research, in Ann Arbor, Mich., which analyzes the auto industry and studies its employment trends closely. We also asked Susan Helper, chair of economics at Case Western Reserve University’s Weatherhead School of Management. Both of these sources looked at the BLS data, too. Kristin Dziczek, director of the Center for Automotive Research labor and research group, told us she thought it was fair for the White House to pick June, even though General Motors didn’t leave bankruptcy until July. "June is the low point," she said, and that’s a good point to start when measuring a comeback. Plant closings and layoffs had spread for months before then, and by June the government was involved heavily in GM’s restructuring. In the three months before June 2009, the number of workers in auto plants had dropped by 20,300, according to the BLS. "I think it’s a fair assessment," Dziczek said of Deese’s statement. Helper, of CWRU, agreed, noting that while Chrysler’s bankruptcy and the government’s role were surrounded by questions about the legality and propriety of such intervention, the GM bankruptcy was swift and it was apparent from the filing in June that the company would emerge quickly. And, she asserted, the phrase "since emerging from bankruptcy" could be interpreted to include not only these government-aided bankruptcies but also the start of the Cash for Clunkers auto buyback program that Congress passed in June 2009; White House economic policies at the time that were aimed at the broader U.S. economy, and general economic conditions that threatened everything from jobs to car sales. Considering the economic risks at the time, she said, "conceivably you could argue that the 115,000 figure is an under-estimate" when measuring the success. Before we give Deese’s claim a rating, we’ll note two last things. First, a day after Deese spoke, BLS updated its data, giving figures for May, 2011. Doing a calculation with these figures, we found that had Deese waited a day, he would have had to say 113,200 instead of 115,000. This difference is so minor, but we include it for the sake of accuracy -- and to note that the White House, too, was aware of this slight change. By the time Obama spoke in Toledo that day, he said, "So far the auto industry has added 113,000 jobs over the past two years." Second, some critics still say the administration overstepped its bounds with the bailouts. Taxpayers are expected to lose $14 billion in the end. That’s less than the $48 billion loss that was projected earlier, and much less than it would have cost in pension bailouts and other economy-wide expenses had the automakers failed. But skeptics say the free market -- and outside companies -- might have picked up the pieces without the government needing to intervene. We’ll never know, although Dziczek and Helper say the bailouts helped avoid economic catastrophe. So we turn to the Truth-O-Meter. Deese was correct if we measure his statement against job figures for June 2009, when Chrysler left bankruptcy. But General Motors didn’t leave bankruptcy until July 2009, and that produces a lower number. The Center for Automotive Research’s Dzieczek says it was nevertheless reasonable to start counting at that date, and so does CRWU’s economics chair, Helper. The Obama administration was heavily involved by then, they said, and it’s fair for it to claim all those job gains. But while the June date may be a reasonable starting point for Deese to have chosen, PolitiFact also is guided by the principles of the Truth-O-Meter. A key one is that words matter. We pay close attention to the specific wording of a claim. So we go back to Deese’s words: "since GM and Chrysler emerged from bankruptcy." GM had not yet climbed out of bankruptcy when Deese starts his count. And that’s important to know because had he started after GM emerged from bankruptcy, the figure for total number of jobs created would have been more than 30,000 fewer. So Deese’s notion is accurate -- but a listener needs that important detail for a full understanding of his claim. That is exactly how the Truth-O-Meter defines Half True.

We don’t have any more money."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/03/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-broke/	Republicans from Washington to Madison have adopted a new expression when it comes to describing the state of government finances: "We’re broke." Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker started using the "broke" description as he unveiled his controversial budget-repair bill, which would force state employees to pay more for health care and pensions and curtail collective bargaining rights for most public employees. "I don't have anything to negotiate," Walker said Feb. 11, 2011, the day he unveiled his budget-repair bill, aimed at closing a $137 million gap in the budget that ends June 30, 2011. "We are broke in this state. We have been broke for years." Since then, he’s repeated the phrase many times. "The bottom line is we are trying to balance our budget and there really is no room to negotiate on that because we’re broke," Walker said Feb. 21, 2011 on ABC’s "Good Morning America." " At a news conference that day, he said: "We’re broke. We don’t have any more money." He added: "We have a $3.6 billion budget deficit (for the next two years). You can’t really negotiate if you don’t have any money to negotiate with." In his March 1, 2011 budget speech, the governor said: "The facts are clear: Wisconsin is broke and it’s time to start paying our bills today – so our kids are not stuck with even bigger bills tomorrow." Walker, of course, has promised not to turn to one conventional tool the state has available to make ends meet -- raising taxes. That’s a political decision and one we are not focused on in this item. Rather, we’re focusing on the language Walker and supporters are using to describe the state’s finances and to persuade taxpayers that his solutions are best. Since the "broke" description has become so common, we decided to look at exactly what it means and whether it is an accurate description of Wisconsin’s financial state. Let’s start with some dictionary definitions: Broke: having no money; bankrupt. Broke: without money; penniless. Broke: Synonyms: bankrupt, beggared, bust, cleaned out, destitute, dirt poor, flat broke , impoverished, in Chapter 11, in debt, indebted, indigent, insolvent, needy, penniless, penurious, poor, ruined, stone broke, strapped, tapped out. We’ll add a more conversational use: "I’m broke. Can you buy this round of beers?" Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor was referring to $58.7 million plus interest owed to Minnesota under a discontinued tax-reciprocity deal and at least $200 million owed to the Patients Compensation Fund after a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision said former Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration illegally tapped into the fund. Werwie also cited the "Medicaid deficit", the "corrections deficit" and "other things out there." The state, he said, has been running "massive structural deficits for years." in earlier items, we found the deficit in the budget ending June 30, 2011, is real and rated False a claim that the $3.6 billion deficit projected for the next two fiscal years is a "bogus" number. Walker wants to close the current deficit with a combination of debt restructuring and changes that would affect most public employees -- including limiting collective bargaining rights to only wages, and then only within limits. The outcry over that provision stirred the huge protests in Madison, the walkout by Democrats in the state Senate, and numerous efforts by Walker and Republicans to explain their position. The Republican explanation has been that Walker’s "budget-repair bill" includes modest requests of state employees and brings their benefit contributions in line with private sector workers. And it’s continued: The state has no choice....because we’re broke. To be sure, some local governments have gone belly up, but not many. The Wall Street Journal’s David Wessel reported in fall of 2010 that fewer than 250 of the nation’s 89,000 government units have filed for bankruptcy since 1980. "Recent close calls in Harrisburg, Pa., and Central Falls, R.I., spark predictions that the next phase of the financial crisis will be a tsunami of municipal bankruptcies and defaults," Wessel wrote. "Muni-bond experts at rating agencies and bankruptcy lawyers assure us that isn't likely." He added: "After Vallejo, Calif., won a federal judge's OK to use Chapter 9 in 2008 to extricate itself from union contracts, there were widespread predictions that other cities would follow. ‘Two and a half years later that hasn't been the case,’ says Robert Kurtter, who oversees state and local government ratings at Moody's Investors Service." In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Kurtter said few municipalities have filed for bankruptcy because it’s a long, complicated and expensive process with uncertain outcomes. In addition, states are prohibited from filing bankruptcy under federal law. A columnist for Governing magazine addressed the issue in fall of 2010. "There may be talk about governments being bankrupt and insolvent when what is meant is, ‘We don't want to raise taxes and don't want to spend so we have to cut.’" Penelope Lemov wrote in the article. Meanwhile, in January 2011, Moody’s issued a national report that combined state debt and pension liabilities. Moody’s studies and rates debt issued by governments and corporations, and its ratings can affect how much those issuing bonds will have to pay in interest. The report says that combining those obligations makes it easier to compare the fiscal health of states. Those with the highest ratings have the most serious debt burdens, which makes them less appealing to investors. Wisconsin’s rating was 37th as measured by the amount of debt per capita, 38th (debt by GDP) 39 (by personal income) and 41 (by revenue). "States’ liability rankings versus revenue or economic measures tend to be indicative of the nature of risks these states carry in funding their obligations over the long term," the report says. So according to the Moody’s debt ranking, Wisconsin fares well when compared with other states. That’s one measure of the state’s fiscal health. We asked a few local experts about the use of the term "broke" to describe the state of Madison’s finances: Andrew Reschovsky, a UW-Madison professor of public affairs and finance, said use of the term didn’t make sense when it comes to the state’s financial situation. "That’s obviously absurd," Reschovsky said. "We obviously aren’t broke. The analogy to a household is really a fallacious one." He said the government has powerful tools at its disposal to make ends meet: taxes or manipulating fees. You could also put off some spending or shift some debt into the next fiscal year -- tricks that state budget offices have routinely used. Walker has taken tax increases off of the table. He proposed in his budget-repair bill to restructure the state’s debt, pushing some payments off into the future. "For the amount of money that we’re talking about there’s a wide range of things that could be done," Reschovsky said. The $137 million deficit in the budget year ending June 30 represents about 0.456 percent of the $30 billion state budget, or less than half of 1 percent. The projected $3.6 billion deficit for the next two-year budget is more serious: about 12 percent of the overall budget. Connie Kilmark, owner of a Madison firm that consults people in financial trouble, said of Walker’s "broke" rhetoric: "It’s just not true. He’s trying to scare us all." The state has taxing power, and revenue is continuing to flow in -- both key factors in making ends meet, she said. As the economic recovery continues, tax revenue is expected to actually rise $1.5 billion in the next two-year period, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Claire Ann Resop, a Madison attorney who handles bankruptcies and reviews other bankruptcy cases filed in that part of the state, said "broke" is measured by whether or not you can pay your bills. Said Resop: "I haven’t heard that they’ve been defaulting." That said, some of the bills are due. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, for instance, has expressed impatience with Wisconsin’s delays on repayment, saying in January that Wisconsin should pay up immediately. Ken King, of the Family Service Association in Sheboygan, which runs a consumer credit counseling center, said, "When you have nothing to draw on anymore, you’re broke." Ralph Anzivino, a Marquette University Law School professor who teaches bankruptcy law, said, "Broke is a lay term, a street term." He said it would be more accurate to say that the state was insolvent but has options at its disposal to put its house in order. They include: raising taxes, laying off workers and cutting costs or finding other savings. Then there is this perspective from within state government itself. "The state is no more broke than it was two, four or 10 years ago," said Frank Hoadley, capital finance director with the state Department of Administration. "There’s always a huge gap" as budget deliberations begin, he said. "And it always gets hammered out." In unveiling his two-year budget, Walker cut aid to local schools and government by about $1 billion. But the proposal, which now goes to the Legislature, included new spending in some areas, including adding $1 million in raises for prosecutors, $993,800 for additional public defenders and $1.04 million to investigate Internet crimes against children. On the opposite side of the ledger, the budget reduced revenue by some $140 million through a variety of tax cuts, including ones aimed at businesses and individuals with Health Savings Accounts. Finally, we took the question to Wall Street and the experts at Moody’s, who are hired by the state to study and rate its debt. A Moody’s panel, including Kurtter, one of the most respected municipal finance experts in the country, discussed Wisconsin’s dilemma and Walker’s assertion and made these observations: The state’s debt has a very high credit rating of AA2 and that has not changed in years. That compares favorably with other states, including Illinois, that face far more severe budget crunches. Wisconsin is in the same boat as numerous other states face unprecedented economic pressures due to the effects of the recession, said Kurtter, who added that budget pressures will continue to mount. "This is not a problem that’s isolated in Wisconsin," said Kimberly Lyons, a Moody’s analyst. Kurtter noted that Wisconsin faces unique challenges because the state does not have a reserve or "rainy day" fund. The state’s "budget stabilization fund" had an average balance of $1.685 million in January, according to Robert Lang, director of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. That supports a budget that has a $14 billion in general fund spending. Kurtter said Wall Street will look at several factors when deciding how much risk Wisconsin presents to future investors. They include: whether or not a budget is adopted, whether it closes the shortfall, and whether it does it in a "structural way," that is long-term. So, let’s review. Walker and other Republicans say the state is broke, so broke that there’s no money, and because there’s no money, they are unwilling to negotiate over the terms of the budget-repair bill. Experts agree the state faces financial challenges in the form of deficits. But they also agree the state isn’t broke. Employees and bills are being paid. Services are continuing to be performed. Revenue continues to roll in. A variety of tools -- taxes, layoffs, spending cuts, debt shifting -- is available to make ends meet. Walker has promised not to increase taxes. That takes one tool off the table. Another tool was never there: declaring bankruptcy. We’re not broke or bankrupt in part because under federal law we can’t be. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-10537	"I want to freeze interest rates for five years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/26/hillary-clinton/clinton-at-times-forgets-major-caveats/	Sen. Hillary Clinton has a detailed plan to deal with the foreclosure crisis in the housing market — so detailed that she sometimes leaves out crucial caveats when she explains it. Most of Clinton's plan centers on subprime loans. A subprime loan is a home loan at a higher-than-normal interest rate to a borrower who is perceived to be a higher credit risk. It is typically issued to homeowners with poor credit, and sometimes to investors who are taking on higher-than-normal debt loads. Clinton's plan has several elements: She wants lenders to freeze foreclosures for 90 days on owner-occupied homes purchased with subprime mortgages. She wants lenders to freeze interest rates on subprime loans for owner-occupied homes for five years, or until homeowners can refinance. She wants to create a $30-billion fund for states to deal with the effects of foreclosures, everything from helping individual homeowners pay their bills to making up lost property tax revenues for police and firefighters. Clinton believes lenders should voluntarily embrace the freezes she suggests as a means of preventing widespread defaults. She would not impose the freezes through the force of law. Got all that? It's a detailed policy, and she has criticized Obama for having a less substantive position. Obama does not advocate the freezes Clinton suggests, but offers a similar fund for states and reforms for the lending process designed to increase transparency for home buyers. The problem Clinton is running into on the campaign trail is that she regularly shorthands her terminology, giving the impression that her plan is broader than it is. Instead of saying she wants to freeze interest rates for subprime loans on owner-occupied homes, she has said only that she wants to freeze interest rates. Anyone with an adjustable rate mortgage might think her plan applies to them, when it doesn't. For example, at a debate on Jan. 31, 2008, in California, Clinton said: "I think it's imperative that we approach this mortgage crisis with the seriousness that it is presenting. There are 95,000 homes in foreclosure in California right now. I want a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days so we can try to work out keeping people in their homes instead of having them lose their homes, and I want to freeze interest rates for five years." Well, lots of homeowners have adjustable rate mortgages, and not all of them are subprime borrowers. Nowhere did Clinton mention that the freezes only apply to owner-occupied homes bought with subprime loans. Some of her direct-mail pieces also elide these caveats; check out examinations from Factcheck.org here and from the Atlantic Monthly here . That vagueness has prompted criticism. Two economists wrote in the New Republic recently that they weren't clear what Clinton was proposing, and that some of her language suggested an interest rate freeze for every adjustable rate mortgage in the country. Such a widespread change to the mortgage industry would be foolhardy, argued economists Richard Thaler and Susan Woodward. "Promising the American people that you can fix things by just lowering their interest rates is dishonest, a fairy tale that won't come true," they wrote. Economist Laura Tyson, who served as Bill Clinton's national economic adviser, responded in defense of Clinton's plan, reiterating its details and saying that Thaler and Woodward distorted Clinton's proposal to make points. "Her recommendations deserve serious discussion, not unsubstantiated attacks by scholars who should read her words more carefully than they apparently have," Tyson said. Thaler and Woodward wrote again, saying that Clinton was the one who needed to be more careful in her public remarks. They also said that Clinton has offered a frustrating lack of specifics on how she would implement a largely voluntary plan. We agree with Thaler and Woodward that Clinton has omitted details of her plan, most notably at the California debate. Yes, it is easier to say "freeze interest rates" than "freeze interest rates in owner-occupied homes purchased with subprime mortgages." But that doesn't mean the short version is accurate. We find her overly broad synopsis of her plan to be Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-02-26T00:00:00	2008-01-31	['None']

pomt-00940	"22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of" anti-deportation "measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’"	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/23/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-22-times-barack-obama-said-he-cou/	After a federal judge in Texas ruled against President Barack Obama’s actions potentially shielding thousands of unauthorized residents from deportation, the Texan who led the court challenge described Obama as a key helper for the states challenging the Democratic president’s authority. Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who in 2014 launched the legal challenge joined by more than 20 other states when he was still the attorney general of Texas, told Sean Hannity of Fox News: "I think we will win all the way for one simple reason, and that is: The man you just had on the screen, Barack Obama, is our star witness." Abbott added in the Feb. 17, 2015, interview: "22 times Barack Obama said he did not have the authority to implement this type of measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’ Those words alone show that he violated the Constitution and violated federal law." We learned of Abbott’s quotation of Obama and his "22 times" count from a Breitbart.com news story, which also noted the president’s exact wording had previously been, "I just took an action to change the law," and that Obama made that comment five days after the adminstration’s action was announced, not the next day. We looked into Abbott’s count of 22 and his quotation, ultimately finding his statement close to completely so. But we started by revisiting recent history. Obama and Abbott announcements In November 2014, Obama declared the administration’s plans to forswear the deportation of unauthorized residents meeting certain conditions, telling the American people: "If you’ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes — you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law." Shortly before Obama detailed his 2014 moves, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found False the Democratic president’s statement that his position hadn’t changed on using executive authority to address immigration. Notably, the administration in June 2012 demonstrated a willingness to apply its discretionary powers by issuing a "deferred action" directive that immigration officials not deport young immigrants who had not otherwise run afoul of the law. The move potentially shielded hundreds of thousands of residents under age 30. Critics called the move an abuse of authority. Proponents said it was in keeping with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act providing a path to citizenship for children brought to the U.S. by immigrants not legally permitted to live here. Fast-forward to Dec. 3, 2014; that’s when Abbott announced Texas and other states were challenging the latest Obama move in federal court. And what the state filed that day included a version of the Obama quotation we’re looking into: "What you’re not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law." Speaking to reporters, Abbott commented: "The president’s job is to execute the laws, not de facto make law by suspending parts of laws that are passed by Congress." We asked Abbott to elaborate on his claim to Fox News and didn’t hear back. But we recognized he’d echoed another Texan’s criticism. In December 2014, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, drew a Mostly True from us after saying Obama had previously "said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority" to act as he did on immigration. McCaul had relied on a list of Obama quotations posted online by House Speaker John Boehner, which we found partly flawed, making McCaul’s count too high. In the end, still, we confirmed nearly 15 instances from 2010 into 2014 of Obama saying he couldn’t do more to spare immigrants from deportation absent congressional action. White House response Asked about McCaul's claim at the time, White House spokesman Eric Schultz responded by email, pointing out a Nov. 19, 2014, memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating the president’s actions fit within the government’s discretionary powers. The office, in the Justice Department, is responsible for providing authoritative legal advice to the president and executive-branch agencies. It’s a challenge to characterize the president’s remarks. For instance, Abbott’s legal filing included Obama’s Sept. 28, 2011, response to a law student’s request that he do his part to enable students who immigrated to the U.S. with their parents to become legal residents. As noted in the legal filing, Obama replied: "I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true. We are doing everything we can administratively. But the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce." The legal filing ends the quotation there, yet Obama continued talking and said he retained enforcement discretion. "Now, what we can do is to prioritize enforcement," the president said, "since there are limited enforcement resources, and say we’re not going to go chasing after this young man or anybody else who’s been acting responsibly and would otherwise qualify for legal status," if laws were changed. We counted 15 Obama quotations--not 22--in the Texas-led legal filing supportive of Abbott’s point, with nearly all of them previously tick-tocked in our check of McCaul. For more analysis of relevant details, see our rundown here. Did Obama say he personally ‘changed the law?’ Next, we searched the White House website and isolated what Obama said in a Chicago speech Nov. 25, 2014 after at least one audience member interrupted his remarks to urge a complete end to deportations. Here’s what Obama replied, according to the government transcript: "I've heard you. But you’ve got to listen to me, too. All right? (Applause.) And I understand you may disagree. I understand you may disagree. But we've got to be able to talk honestly about these issues. All right? Now, you're absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That's true. But what you're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law. (Applause.) So that's point, number one." Obama went on: "Point number two, the way the change in the law works is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration laws generally. So not everybody qualifies for being able to sign up and register, but the change in priorities applies to everybody." Our ruling Abbott said that 22 times, Obama "said he did not have the authority to implement this type of" anti-deportation "measure. And then the day after he signed this into law, he said, quote, ‘I just changed the law.’" Like McCaul, Abbott overstates the number of confirmed instances of Obama indicating he couldn’t independently do more to prevent deportations. He also left out some of what Obama said about changing the law and was slightly off on the president’s timing. With these clarifications, though, Abbott’s statement is spot-on. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-02031	"Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/04/rick-scott/charlie-crist-allowed-college-tuition-increase-15-/	Education spending is a weapon of choice for both sides of the battle lines in this year’s Florida gubernatorial election. This time around, Gov. Rick Scott is again lobbing an incendiary charge at his presumptive Democratic challenger. "Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year," Scott’s political committee Let’s Get to Work said in a statewide campaign ad, which launched June 2, 2014. It then goes on to say Scott repealed the increase. This attack is worded a bit differently from a claim we checked a couple months ago and found Mostly False. Let’s check the report card on this one again. Calculating costs Scott for Florida told us the commercial refers to the 2009 plan to set tuition rates for Florida universities. Before Crist took office in 2007, the state Legislature set undergraduate rates with no cap on how much the price could go up. The university system’s Board of Governors set graduate and out-of-state rates, capped at 15 percent. That system changed later that year, when the Legislature let the largest state research universities raise rates up 15 percent per year. Crist opposed raising tuition in 2007, and vetoed a 5 percent increase set by lawmakers. He reversed himself later that year, and the 5 percent hike took effect. The Legislature’s increase was 6 percent in 2008, with the state’s five largest universities getting additional tuition bumps. Crist signed that year’s budget without challenging the changes. But in 2009, the Legislature approved a new plan that allowed the Board of Governors to raise undergraduate tuition rates past whatever the Legislature approved. As long as the total increase didn’t exceed 15 percent per year, they were allowed to do this until tuition reached the national average, which was $8,893 in 2012-13. Crist advocated for this plan, and signed off on it when the Legislature approved it. That’s the basis of the ad’s attack. At the time, universities argued the system needed to raise tuition to pay for scholarships, keep top professors and compete with other states. (Florida was 45th in tuition costs in 2011, and 43rd by 2013.) The need only increased after the Legislature starting slashing post-secondary education funding following the Great Recession, some university officials argued. How did the process work? Stick with us here. It’s a little complicated, because under tuition differential rules, both the Legislature and the Board of Governors had a role in raising tuition. The Legislature set its base tuition increase each year (it would go up by the rate of inflation if no budget action was taken). Then individual universities would ask the Board of Governors for another increase, called tuition differential. Those two numbers, the base increase and the differential, couldn’t add up to more than 15 percent. It can be less, but has been 15 percent a few times -- notably when both Crist and Scott were governor. The governor could veto the Legislature's increase, but not the Board of Governors increase. He appoints the Board’s members, but has no official say in their decisions. Here’s how the tuition increases played out under both Crist and Scott: Year (Governor in office) Legislative increase Board of Governors increase Total 2007 (Crist) 5 percent N/A 5 percent 2008 (Crist) 6 percent N/A 6 percent 2009 (Crist)* 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2010 (Crist) 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2011 (Scott) 8 percent 7 percent 15 percent 2012 (Scott) 0 percent Varied by university Varied by university 2013 (Scott) 3 percent (vetoed) 0 percent 1.7 percent (indexed to inflation) * Tuition differential law takes effect Scott definitely used his veto power to stop the Legislature in 2013, but it was his influence on the Board of Governors that kept last year’s hike so low. The governor may not be able to veto the board, but he certainly can express an opinion to its members, which he did. Now that we’ve gone through all this for purposes of fact-checking the ad, you can forget about it for future tuition increases: The entire tuition differential process was scrapped by the Legislature during the 2014 session as part of a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition. Now automatic tuition increases are gone, even for inflation; the Legislature can vote for one, and only the University of Florida and Florida State can lobby the Board for a differential increase, up to a maximum of 6 percent. Our ruling Scott for Florida’s new ad about education costs said, "Charlie Crist allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year." Tuition did go up 15 percent in 2009 and 2010. But the ad downplays the fact that tuition increased 5 and 6 percent the two years prior to that. (It also neglects to mention it went up 15 percent under Gov. Scott one year, as well.) We should also note that Crist wasn’t the only actor here. The Legislature approved increases, as did the state Board of Governors. Still, tuition did go up each year, and as high as 15 percent for two years. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-06-04T16:23:09	2014-06-02	['Charlie_Crist']
pomt-09652	"We're going to have more troops (in Afghanistan) . . . than the Russians had."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/04/john-murtha/murtha-claims-us-will-have-more-troops-afghanistan/	Rep. John Murtha, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who chairs its defense subcommittee, is one of the Democrats concerned about President Barack Obama's plan to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. On Hardball With Chris Matthew s on Dec. 2, 2009, Murtha said he was worried about the cost and complexity of Obama's strategy. "This is a very complicated thing and very costly operation," said Murtha, D-Pa. "So you know, we got a lot of problems facing us, 104,000 contractors already in Afghanistan, in addition to the 68,000 troops. We're going to have more troops, Chris, than the Russians had in Afghanistan." Murtha said "Russians," but it was clear that he was referring to the Soviet Union, which was still intact when its troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Murtha's comments got us wondering whether the United States would have more troops stationed in the country than the Soviet Union did after it invaded. First, Murtha's claim deserves a little background on Afghanistan's stormy relationship with the Soviet Union. It all started in April 1978, when Afghanistan's communist People's Democratic Party staged a coup and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In the following months, the U.S.S.R. sent troops to Afghanistan to help fend off Islamic insurgents there. What started out as an aid operation turned into a full-scale invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. The Soviet-Afghan war lasted nine years. Estimates of the Soviet troops vary. In 1989, when the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan, the New York Times reported that there had been 115,000 troops at the height of the war. Other estimates peg the number at 118,000 and 120,000. Currently, the United States has approximately 68,000 troops in Afghanistan, and is planning to send 30,000 more, bringing the total number to about 100,000. So, Murtha is off by at least 15,000 troops. The Soviets had more. We asked Murtha's office about his statement, and his spokesman, Matt Mazonkey, said the congressman is right if NATO allies are included. Indeed, including foreign troops would bring the number up to 140,000. Murtha did not make this clear on Hardball; we believe most viewers would interpret his "we" to mean the United States. But since the United States is directing the effort, it's conceivable that some might include the total force with NATO allies, in which case Murtha would be correct. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

A similar issue came up Aug. 28 during the last half-hour of the 90-minute Providence Journal - WPRI-TV debate between Democrats Anthony Gemma and David Cicilline. The two will face off in the Sept. 11 primary as Gemma tries to take over Cicilline's seat in the 1st Congressional District. When the candidates were asked whether they would consider an increased tax on Chinese imports, Cicilline went in another direction, expressing outrage over the foreign-made Olympic garments. He had jumped on the issue when the controversy broke out, staging a photo-op at Northwest Woolen Mills in Woonsocket, which already makes berets for the U.S. military. The Olympic berets, he argued, could have easily been made there. Then it was Gemma's turn. "Mr. Cicilline refers to the Olympic clothing that happened, but how about uniforms?" he said. "How about our servicemen and women's uniforms that are manufactured in China?" Just the thought of that happening put our knickers in a twist, so we set out on a not-so-covert mission to find out if it was true. We e-mailed Gemma spokesman Alex Morash Thursday morning. When we didn't hear from him for several hours, we called him; the voicemail said he wasn't accepting calls or messages. We e-mailed him again Friday afternoon. We also called the Pentagon and heard back from two other agencies. One was the Air Force, whose spokeswoman Capt. Shannon Stoneking said in an e-mail, "All of our AF uniforms are made in the USA." The other was the Defense Logistics Agency, which is responsible for procuring dress and utility uniforms, along with footwear, headgear, medals and insignia for all four branches of the U.S. military and the Coast Guard. Spokeswoman Mikia Muhammad told us that "DLA is mandated to buy 100-percent domestic material with all manufacturing completed in the United States." It's not a policy. It's federal law. The source is the Berry Amendment, USC, Title 10, Section 2533a, originally passed in 1941 to require a buy-American policy for the military. The latest version, which took effect Nov. 16, 2006, prohibits the Department of Defense from buying items of clothing "unless they are wholly of U.S. origin." There are exceptions for small purchases and for cases in which supplies are urgently needed for troops in the field -- uniforms are unlikely to fall into that category. But even in such cases, it must be demonstrated that the items cannot be acquired in sufficient quantity from U.S. manufacturers. One reason for the amendment: If the military were to use manufacturers in a foreign country, supplies could be cut off if problems arose between the two nations. The Air Force addressed the issue in a 2009 news release examining why the United States didn't save money by letting major clothing companies provide uniforms. It quotes Maj. Michael Perry, clothing program manager for the Air Force: "All of the uniform items -- service dress, PT, utility, flight suits -- must be manufactured in the U.S. The [Berry] amendment holds us to this in order to preserve not only American business, but national security." The only exception we could find in searching the Internet came in the wake of a 2000 decision to make black berets standard headgear for the Army. To issue them by the fall of 2001, a waiver was granted to allow several foreign firms, including some with facilities in China, to make 4.7 million berets. (But the first contract went to an Arkansas-based company that, according to a Congressional Research Service report, had been making military headgear since World War I.) Because of the controversy that erupted, the Department of Defense decided not to distribute 618,000 berets made by a United Kingdom company operating in China, according to an undated story in Army Times. But 240,000 berets made in Sri Lanka were shipped. The Gemma campaign never did respond to our inquiry. Our ruling Anthony Gemma, raising a question during an Aug. 28 debate appearance, said uniforms for U.S. soldiers "are manufactured in China." But federal law prohibits the military from buying foreign-made uniforms without special authorization, stemming from the Berry Amendment of more than 70 years ago. We could find no evidence that any U.S. military uniforms are currently being made outside the United States. Even a search of the Internet, where you can usually find "support" for just about any idea, uncovered only one instance, involving the Army berets, and that was more than a decade ago. Perhaps some knockoff uniforms sold to the public come from foreign countries. But those aren't uniforms for our soldiers. We don't know where Gemma buys his clothing, but regardless of its origin, we hope he has flame-retardant undies because the Truth-O-Meter rules this ridiculous claim a Pants On Fire!

pomt-01237	"Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/18/barack-obama/obama-us-has-put-more-people-back-work-all-other-a/	By key measures, America’s labor market has crept back to pre-recession levels, leading President Barack Obama to repeat a talking point in recent days -- that the American economy has outperformed that of other advanced countries. On Nov. 16, 2014, Obama spoke with reporters in Brisbane, Australia, following the ninth G20 summit -- a gathering of leaders from 20 of the world’s major economies. The G20 summit followed a high-profile tour to meet leaders of major Asian countries. Obama said the gatherings "came against the backdrop of America’s renewed economic strength." "The United States is in the longest stretch of uninterrupted private-sector job growth in its history," he said. "Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined." We previously rated a similar statement by Obama, giving him a Half True for the claim that "we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office." The new version Obama offered at the G20 summit was slightly better, since it uses a more flexible time frame -- "over the last few years" -- rather than the more specific "since I came into office." If you start counting the day he came into office -- a period when the United States economy was still several months away from hitting rock bottom -- the statement is incorrect. At the G20, Obama changed his language from "created more jobs" to "we’ve put more people back to work." This makes it sound as if the specific people put out of work by the recession (or at least, the general types of people who lost their jobs in the recession) are now working again. It would seem like the evidence for this is equivocal at best. How does the U.S. compare to the other advanced economies? First, we’ll recap what we found out about job creation in advanced economies in our previous fact-check, using International Monetary Fund data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as "advanced economies" and seven of those as "major advanced economies." We looked at total average annual employment from 2009 -- Obama’s first year in office -- through 2014. (This counts the number of payroll positions, meaning one person who works two jobs would be counted twice.) Country or group 2009 employment 2014 employment, estimated Absolute growth Percent growth United States 139.9 million 145.9 million 5.98 million 4.27 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.5 million 332.8 million 6.28 million 1.92 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.1 million 200.8 million 4.72 million 2.41 percent (For the full data, check out this Google spreadsheet.) According to the IMF, then, the net number of people employed in the United States has grown by just shy of 6 million people. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the figure at about 5.7 million.) Obama had said this number was more than all advanced economies combined, but that’s not the case -- the 35 advanced economies outside of the United States expanded by 6.28 million. That does make it fairly close, and it’s clearly more than what happened in the smaller group of other G7 countries (the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom). Still, the United States is the most populous of the advanced economies by far -- it has more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy. (China, Russia and India are not considered advanced economies.) So it’s logical that there will, in general, be more employment growth in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations. Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by this measurement, the United States is not on top. The United States’ percentage growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on this list, including: Australia, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The country with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of more than 18 percent. Is the U.S. putting 'more people back to work'? So if you look at net job creation, the White House claim is close, but not exact. What about if you change the wording to putting "more people back to work," as Obama said? To support its claim, the White House cited an internal analysis -- one we weren’t able to access for independent verification. The White House press office said the analysis used IMF data for the 36 advanced economies. They told PolitiFact that the analysis "finds that 14.9 million people have returned to work in advanced economies since the beginning of 2010. Just over half—or 7.5 million—are in the United States. In other words, the number of people put back to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined (7.4 million)." The White House said it’s notable that the United States accounts for the majority of these jobs since the U.S. population only accounts for about 31 percent of the population in advanced economies. The White House added that within the narrower group of G7 nations the U.S. share "vastly exceeds the rest of the G7 (7.5 million vs. 4.6 million)." However, the White House is using net employment gain, which doesn’t necessarily refer to people who became unemployed and went back to work -- the clearest definition of putting people "back to work," as Obama said. It’s possible that it could include people entering the workforce for the first time. We were unable to find other research to corroborate Obama’s claim. On the question of putting people back to work, we found that the Obama administration does have some data on its side. Statistics for the long-term unemployed have fallen consistently from their recession peak, both measured by the number of long-term unemployed Americans and the median duration of unemployment. The following Bureau of Labor Statistics chart shows the median duration of unemployment, in weeks, since January 2009. Still, the median length of unemployment is 13.7 weeks now, which is higher than it was in January 2009 (10.7 weeks). More importantly, the labor force participation rate -- that is, the percentage of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that is either working or looking actively for work -- has fallen consistently since Obama took office, from 65.7 to 62.8 percent. This graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the falling rate of labor participation since January 2009, when Obama took office. If these two data points sound paradoxical, they’re not. On the one hand, among the pool of people still looking for work, fewer have been looking for more than 27 weeks. On the other hand, that pool of people looking for work has shrunk, because many workers have simply dropped out of the labor market, rather than finding a job. The idea that long-term unemployed Americans are increasingly leaving the labor force is supported by an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by FiveThirtyEight.com’s Ben Casselman. The data led him to conclude that "the share of the long-term jobless who are giving up their job searches has been rising steadily, even as the job-finding rate has remained largely flat." This puts a damper on the notion, stated by Obama, that "we’ve put more people back to work" in recent years. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, added a word of caution. She noted that presidents are far from the only factor in economic growth, so it would be unrealistic for Obama to claim too much credit for these numbers. Indeed, the United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 -- meaning there was a lot of room to grow. "Is it a good thing to just put people back to work?" Sinclair said. "This mostly means we had a terribly bad recession and have finally recovered from it. That's not necessarily something to consider a policy triumph." Our ruling Obama said, "Over the last few years, we’ve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined." From publicly available data, we know that since 2009, the United States has created roughly the same number of jobs as the 35 other advanced economies combined, and more than the other six biggest economies. However, it’s not as clear cut that this recovery involves putting "more people back to work," as Obama suggests. The labor force participation rate has consistently declined during this period, suggesting that more and more unemployed Americans are dropping out of the workforce, rather than taking new jobs. On balance, we rate Obama's claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-11-18T11:00:20	2014-11-16	['None']

pomt-05380	Says Ohio law gives tax breaks "to rich people who own private jets."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/08/mike-foley/mike-foley-says-ohio-gives-tax-breaks-rich-people-/	Ohio law contains 128 tax breaks that cost the state about $7 billion per year in lost revenue it otherwise would collect, according to the Department of Taxation. State Rep. Mike Foley, a Democrat from Cleveland, wants to close some of these loopholes so the state has more money for schools, safety forces and other local government services. Foley co-sponsored a bill in February to establish a committee that would review the state’s tax exemptions every two years. More recently, he tried to get approval for his plan by adding it to a broadly supported general tax bill, House Bill 508, under consideration in the House of Representatives on April 25. Foley said during a floor speech that tax exemptions need to be reviewed because some of them are "fairly silly," such as a sales tax exemption related to private jets. "I don’t think we need to be giving exemptions to rich people who own private jets," Foley said. "We’re giving tax breaks to guys that own private jets – that doesn’t make any sense." Foley’s statement hits on individual tax burdens, a frequently discussed political topic that resonates with many voters. So PolitiFact Ohio decided dig into Foley’s claim. Foley’s office provided us with a handful of documents to back up his claim, including a tax expenditure report presented in March 2011 by the Ohio Department of Taxation. But before we examine the report and whether it supports Foley’s claim, let’s look into how these tax breaks work. Here is the Taxation Department’s explanation: "Tax expenditures represent tax dollars that are foregone through deductions, exemptions, credits, and other provisions in tax laws," the tax expenditure report says. "Tax expenditures result in a loss of tax revenue to state government, thereby reducing the funds available for other government programs. In essence, a tax expenditure has the same fiscal impact as a direct government expenditure." Among the tax exemptions in the report is one for people who buy a share of a private jet, or what is called a "fractionally-owned aircraft." This particular tax break was passed in 2003 as part of the state budget. It does have some limitations. It was crafted to apply only to those who do business with qualified companies that provide fractional ownership of private jets. Qualified companies would operate at least 100 aircraft and meet other criteria. The tax break does not apply to individuals who buy their own private jet. Foley did mention fractional ownership at another point during his floor speech: "If you won a fractional or some other sort of ownership of a private jet, then we’re giving you an exemption on your taxes." The tax loophole caps sales tax at $800 for the sum of shares of a fractionally owned jet. Fractional owners are charged a fraction of the $800 that corresponds with their ownership stake. So if somebody owns one-eighth of the jet, he would pay $100 in sales tax. There are only two companies in Ohio that fit the requirements as a qualified company for this exemption, according to the Department of Taxation. That means only people who buy their fractional ownership from one of these two companies qualify for the tax break. The department, however, would not disclose those companies because "the law prohibits disclosure of almost all information on specific taxpayers," taxation department spokesman Gary Gudmundson said in an e-mail. Although the state would not say which two companies qualify for the exemption, NetJets and Flight Options are two prominent fractionally owned aircraft companies based in Ohio. When lawmakers debated the merits of the tax break in 2003, a fractional-ownership company reported that its average share cost was $1.2 million, according to a Department of Taxation analysis of this tax expenditure produced in Jan. 2011. The analysis did not name the company. The taxation department last year estimated in its tax expenditure report that the tax break for fractionally owned aircraft costs the state about $1 million a year. So what does all this mean for Foley’s claim? There is no doubt that a tax loophole exists for people who buy a stake in a private jet. A listener hearing Foley’s quip about tax breaks for rich people buying private jets could believe he was referring to anyone who buys a private plane. The tax break, however, only applies to fractional ownership programs. That’s additional information that provides clarity. And to his credit, Foley did mention fractional ownership at a different point in his speech on the House floor. And the average share price previously reported -- $1.2 million – suggests the tax exemption would be available wealthy people, just as Foley claimed. On the Truth-O-Meter, Foley’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Mike Foley	None	None	None	2012-05-08T06:00:00	2012-04-25	['Ohio']

pomt-08173	"Over half of the foreign-born population in Rhode Island is white."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/01/steven-brown/ri-aclu-director-says-more-half-states-foreign-bor/	Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee's promise to rescind the executive order on immigration enacted by his predecessor, Donald Carcieri, has brought Rhode Island's simmering immigration debate back to life. Supporters of the 2008 order say it has given the state new tools to curb illegal immigration, but critics, the Rhode Island affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union among them, say it hasn't worked and has marginalized the Hispanic community. One of the order's eight directives requires the state police to work with federal authorities to help enforce immigration laws. In a Nov. 20 Providence Journal story and in a subsequent letter to Chafee, ACLU Director Steven Brown decried the fact that 77 percent of the people investigated by the state police for suspected immigration violations were born in Latin American countries, despite the fact that "over half of the foreign-born population in Rhode Island is white." That statistic about the foreign-born population caught our attention, so we decided to put it to the Truth-O-Meter. Brown directed us to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 2006-2008, which includes three-year estimates of foreign-born populations in the United States. Specifically, he said he was citing the figures showing that 45.2 percent of foreign-born Rhode Islanders are white. That's not more than half. The ACLU director conceded that he misread the data and meant to say "'almost half' not ''over half.' " Fair enough. But things get more complicated when you dig deeper into census figures to examine the point behind Brown's statement -- that Hispanics are being investigated more often than non-Hispanics. The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey is an ongoing statistical analysis that's conducted through questionnaires on various demographic topics mailed monthly to homes; the bureau produces reports as often as once a year. The survey asks respondents to identify their race. Among the choices: white, black or African American, Asian, American Indian and Alaska native, native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander. There is no option to select Hispanic. That's because, according to the U.S. Census, "Hispanic" is an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics and Latinos have the option of checking off one of the above races or a final box labeled "some other race," according to Arthur Bakis, information services specialist at the bureau's Boston regional office. The race standards are defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget and have been in place for decades, according to Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington, D.C. Typically, about half of foreign-born Hispanic respondents across the United States identify themselves as white and about 40 percent answer "some other race," said Charles A. Gallagher, chairman of the sociology department at La Salle University in Philadelphia. The 45.2 percent statistic that Brown cited for Rhode Island was the total percentage of foreign-born people here who identified their race as white. So on its face, Brown's "more than half" statement was not too far off. But there is a broader context to consider. The more relevant statistic to Brown's point comes from the previous question on the same survey. It asks respondents whether they are of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin, or not. Drawing from data in the 2006-2008 survey, the census said that 32 percent of foreign-born people, about one third, are white alone, not Hispanic or Latino. Bakis of the Census Bureau and Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center agree that is the data that Brown should have used if he wanted to properly quantify the size of Rhode Island's foreign born, non-Hispanic white population. "It's a mistake that people who are not familiar with the data might make," said Passel. (It's worth noting that Brown cites figures from the 2006-2008, three-year American Community Survey. A one-year report from 2009 showed that 30 percent of Rhode Island respondents identified themselves as "white alone, not Hispanic or Latino." But Census officials say the three-year survey is more accurate, so that's the one we relied on.) In the end, Brown's underlying claim that the state police investigate Hispanics more often than non-Hispanics for immigration violations is supported by the department's own numbers. Of the 92 people investigated, 71 were from Latin American countries. But that's not what we were checking. Instead, we examined the assertion Brown made to support his argument: that more than half of foreign-born Rhode Islanders are white. And in that claim, he misstated the percentage -- by a small amount if you count all who said they were white, but a larger amount if you count those who consider themselves white alone, not Hispanic or Latino. We rate this Half True.	None	Steven Brown	None	None	None	2010-12-01T00:01:00	2010-11-20	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-08791	"Mark Sharpe has lowered property taxes by 17 percent."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/19/mark-sharpe/hillsborough-commission-candidate-mark-sharpe-clai/	The District 7 at-large Republican primary race for Hillsborough County commissioner has focused a great deal on taxes, mostly a proposed sales tax increase. That’s because challenger Josh Burgin has consistently bashed incumbent Mark Sharpe for backing a ballot question that asks voters if they support raising the sales tax by 1 cent. The proceeds would pay for new commuter rail, expanded bus service and roads. Sharpe has tried to shore up his image as a fiscal conservative, claiming in a July 20 mailer that he’s a tax cutter. "Mark Sharpe has lowered property taxes by 17 percent," his piece claims. His number seemed a bit generous to the skeptical eye, so PolitiFact Florida dusted off its copies of Hillsborough County’s budget. First, we parsed his word choice and immediately puckered. Sharpe claims he lowered property taxes. That struck us as overly boastful, since it takes a majority vote of commissioners to approve county spending plans. Sharpe has voted on five final annual budgets, and each vote was unanimous. If property taxes were indeed cut, Sharpe can’t take all the credit. We also immediately seized on the assertion that he cut property taxes, period. We wondered if he meant that he supported cutting the tax rate. It’s an important distinction. Hillsborough commissioners regularly brag about the number of consecutive years they have lowered the tax rate. But, as the St. Petersburg Times has shown in the past, tax revenue soared in the early and middle part of this decade at a pace that far outstripped population growth and inflation. (See "The Money Vat" here.) That’s because the generally modest annual tax rate cuts didn’t come close to offsetting the money brought in by escalating property values and a building boom. If you didn’t own a house with a homestead exemption that capped annual tax increase in those years, your property tax bill skyrocketed. Of course, the market has tanked since then. So perhaps it’s possible that Sharpe can claim commissioners cut the tax rate — and taxes. We checked with Sharpe’s campaign, which said it got the base numbers from one of his aides. The aide provided the figures used and a percentage-change calculation. As suspected, his calculation was based on tax-rate figures, not actual tax bills or county tax revenues. The aide compared only the portion of the tax rate that applies to all county property owners, not the extra amount tacked on in unincorporated areas for such things as police and fire protection. Fair enough, perhaps, as long as he was using consistent figures. However, the aide used the wrong budget figure from the year before Sharpe took office. If he had used the correct starting number and year, his boss might have legitimately claimed a role in reducing the countywide property tax rate by 20 percent. PolitiFact decided to start from scratch, comparing the combined rate for all property taxes commissioners control from the time Sharpe took office until now. Then we looked at how much money that brought in annually through the same time period. Sharpe took office in November 2004. The county’s fiscal year runs from October through September. That means Sharpe began working in fiscal year 2005, and his first budget vote in September 2005 set spending levels for fiscal year 2006. When he took office, the county’s overall tax rate was 13.0164 mills. That means that for every $1,000 of property owned, Hillsborough County taxes were roughly $13.02. Commissioners voted each year since to lower the millage. It currently stands at 10.7614 mills. Do the math, and it turns out that the tax rate is indeed currently 17 percent lower than when Sharpe took office. Yet there’s still one problem with that. In 2007, the state legislature took action forcing most local governments across Florida to sharply roll back their property tax rates to compensate for their failure to do so aggressively in the boom years. While the tax rate has fallen by 2.2550 mills while Sharpe has been in office, well more than half of that — nearly 1.5 mills — came in the budget that immediately followed the state order. In other words, it was a direct response to what the legislature did. Legislators gave local governments the option of ignoring their edict if commissioners could muster a super-majority vote of five of the seven commissioners. While Hillsborough commissioners opted not to do that, the impetus for the 2007 tax cut further undermines Sharpe’s assertion that he reduced taxes by 17 percent. Then there is the question of whether, in fact, taxes have fallen that much. The county’s combined property taxes brought in $610.8 million during Sharpe’s first year in office, budget records show. They are projected to bring in $659.8 million this year. That’s an 8 percent increase. A good part of that is new construction. But it’s also a reflection that tax rate cuts, combined with plummeting property values, still haven’t quite offset the boom years that included the early part of Sharpe’s tenure. It’s why your tax bill may still be higher than when you purchased in 2005, despite politicians’ claims of tax cuts. With another modest tax reduction tentatively approved for next year and property values still falling, tax receipts are finally projected to be 4 percent less than when Sharpe got elected. Sharpe told PolitiFact that it’s difficult to capture all the nuances in a short sentence aimed at grabbing voters’ attention. We understand that. But with a couple of slight word adjustments — Mark Sharpe supported a 17 percent cut in the tax rate — he could have easily earned a better rating. There is obviously a grain of truth in Sharpe’s claim. But he claimed full responsibility for cuts enabled by others and largely mandated by the state. And those cuts still have not produced an overall drop in tax revenues. So we must rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Mark Sharpe	None	None	None	2010-08-19T18:13:01	2010-07-20	['None']
pomt-10250	Three years ago, John McCain said, "Afghanistan — we don't read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/28/joe-biden/biden-digs-back-on-afghanistan-to-dig-mccain/	Speaking to the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 27, 2008, vice presidential nominee Joe Biden questioned John McCain's judgment on U.S. progress in Afghanistan — cherry-picking a comment McCain made three years ago. Biden used McCain's assessment to nip at the Republican on his decisionmaking compared to Barack Obama's. "Should you trust the judgment of John McCain, when he said only three years ago, 'Afghanistan — we don't read about it anymore in papers because it succeeded?' " Biden said. The McCain comment stems from an Oct. 31, 2005, appearance on the Charlie Rose talk show on PBS. He was asked about winning in Iraq. After discussing issues confronting that country, McCain concluded: "Afghanistan, we don't read about anymore, because it's succeeded. And by the way, there's several reasons, including NATO participation and other reasons, why Afghanistan is doing as well as it is." It wasn't the first time that year McCain lauded "success" in Afghanistan — but it was more unqualified than other assessments. A couple of weeks later, on Nov. 10, 2005, McCain told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute, "One of the reasons why we don't see a lot about Afghanistan is because many of the successes — although we still have a long way to go through — that we have." He added he would "love to see more troops there." In February 2005, McCain suggested permanent military bases were needed, according to the Associated Press. His office later clarified that permanent bases were not necessarily required, but noted America had to remain in the country to remove the "last vestiges" of the Taliban and al-Qaida. This year, McCain said he would support adding more U.S. and Afghan soldiers, strengthening the government there. He promised it would "turn around the war in Afghanistan," where the Taliban have expanded attacks recently and American troops in July rose to 36,000, their highest level. Although Biden was selective in his choice of McCain's words, he correctly quotes what McCain said three years ago. We rule his statement True.

pomt-12880	"A poll just came out on my inauguration speech. … People loved it. Loved and liked."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/26/donald-trump/donald-trumps-inaugural-speech-polled-well-not-wel/	During an interview with ABC News’ David Muir, President Donald Trump -- as he has been known to do -- took the opportunity to tout some of his poll numbers. "A poll just came out on my inauguration speech which was extraordinary that people loved it," Trump said Jan. 25, 2017. "Loved and liked. And it was an extraordinary poll." So, is he right? We took a closer look. When we contacted the White House, they told us that the poll in question was the Politico/Morning Consult poll released on Jan. 25, five days after the inauguration. The poll surveyed 1,922 registered voters, with a sampling margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. The relevant question was, "Based on what you have seen, read or heard recently about Donald Trump’s inauguration speech, would you say it was excellent, good, only fair or poor?" The question was only asked of the 1,762 people who said they watched the address, which the pollster said was "a sample that’s slightly more Republican than the overall poll, although (it) still skews Democratic." The results? A plurality -- 49 percent -- thought Trump’s speech was "excellent" or "good." By comparison, 39 percent thought the speech was either fair or poor. So, Trump has a point: In isolation, at least, that’s a pretty good score. It’s also a similar result to another poll that asked essentially the same question. Gallup asked, "Based on what you have heard or read, how would you rate Donald Trump's inauguration speech? Would you rate it as -- excellent, good, just okay, poor or terrible?" Gallup surveyed 508 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. The poll found that 53 percent thought the speech was "excellent" or "good," while 42 percent thought it was "just okay," "poor," or "terrible." So both surveys found positive responses outpacing negative responses by about 10 percentage points, with positive responses accounting for either a majority or nearly a majority. The one caveat we’ll mention is that Trump’s showing wasn’t as positive as that of other recent presidents. Gallup has asked this question for the previous three inaugural addresses -- George W. Bush’s in 2005 and Barack Obama’s in 2009 and 2013. Trump’s "excellent plus good" score of 53 percent trailed all three. The score for Bush in 2005 was 62 percent, while Obama received 81 percent in 2009 and 65 percent in 2013. In addition, Trump got the worst-ever "terrible" score -- 14 percent, which was twice as high as the previous record, for Obama’s second inaugural speech. Our ruling Trump said, "A poll just came out on my inauguration speech. … People loved it. Loved and liked." He has a point that in both the Politico/Morning Consult poll and the Gallup poll, favorable opinions outpaced unfavorable opinions by double-digit margins. However, it’s worth noting that Trump’s positive score in the Gallup poll was between 9 and 28 points lower than the scores in the previous three inaugural addresses.

pomt-02039	"Qataris don't really work."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/02/jeremy-schaap/espns-schaap-qataris-dont-need-work/	File this under the category of be careful what you wish for. Four years ago, Qatar emerged triumphant when the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, better known as FIFA, voted to hold the 2022 World Cup in the oil and gas rich emirate. Qatar’s bid involved massive construction plans for new stadiums, rail lines and virtually an entire new city. It would be the marquee event for a country that aims to transform itself into an intercontinental crossroads. But controversy followed almost as soon as the decision was announced. With daytime temperatures hitting 120 degrees there has been talk of shifting the games from the summer to the winter. Then last year, a newspaper exposé led to an official investigation that Qatar paid million dollar bribes to win FIFA approval. A member of the FIFA Executive Committee called the Qatar pick a "blatant mistake." Qatar’s treatment of foreign workers also has come into the spotlight. Amnesty International and other human rights groups report rampant abuse in the construction industry. ESPN host Jeremy Schaap went to Doha to investigate allegations of laborers from India, Nepal and elsewhere who find themselves toiling in brutal heat, dying in accidents and locked into jobs with no way to get back home because their passports had been confiscated. "We're talking about a country that can afford to do better," Schaap said on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes. Schaap noted that per capita, Qatar is the richest nation in the world. "Qataris don't really work. They don't have to work," Schaap said, claiming that the Qatari government offers generous benefits for the unemployed. Schaap’s statement that Qataris "don’t really work" struck us as worth learning more about. We asked Schaap to clarify. In his response, he dialed down his rhetoric. "I should have said as laborers on construction sites," Schaap told PunditFact. He added that 94 percent of those workers are foreign -- a fact that came up during his MSNBC interview. This led to a further qualification of the more sweeping statement he made on air. "It's not quite ‘no Qataris’," he said. Indeed, official statistics show that most Qataris 15 years old and up are employed. According to the CIA’s World Factbook, the country has the second lowest unemployment rate in the world, about 0.3 percent. (Definitions of employment might matter here. Cambodia comes in first and its economy is hardly as robust as Qatar’s.) According to the latest figures from the government of Qatar itself, a total of 82,000 Qataris are working out of a total population estimated at 278,000. (Oddly, the government doesn’t provide population data by nationality.) That represents 68 percent of men over the age of 15 and 35 percent of women. A large fraction of women are listed as "homemakers" and thus not employed. The most common job for men is clerk. The most common job for women is professional. Schaap does have a point that the government takes good care of its ciitizens. In 2008, nearly 90 percent of Qataris worked in public-sector jobs. A huge factor here is the state-owned petroleum industry. Oil exports netted the government over $55 billion in 2012 and hydrocarbons represent about 60 percent of the nation's GDP. A new college graduate with no experience can expect a job paying $65,000 or more. The country has more than 1.25 million foreign workers. About 700,000 of them are men working in trades or industrial facilities. On average, they work about 50 hours per week. That’s 10 hours more each week than the average Qatari worker. All this in a country the size of Connecticut. Following a tough assessment from the UN’s International Labor Organization, Qatari officials proposed a number of labor reforms. There would be higher penalties for employers who confiscate the passports of foreign workers and an end to a system of exit permits that gave employers control over who could leave the country. International advocacy groups called this a step in the right direction but said the proposed changes didn’t go far enough and violators might never be punished. Our ruling Schaap said Qataris "don’t really work." Schaap later clarified his statement, saying he should have specified that he was thinking of work on construction sites, and even with that caveat, his claim went a bit too far. We rate statements based on what was said on air. In that regard, official reports show that most Qataris of working age do work and hold a variety of jobs. In one way or another, the government provides nearly all these jobs but people still need to show up to get paid. A small fraction of the construction workforce is Qatari. The risks for foreign workers are real, but that is separate from Schaap’s assertion. We rate the claim False.	None	Jeremy Schaap	None	None	None	2014-06-02T11:45:38	2014-05-28	['None']

pomt-14779	"There is a federal criminal law that says it's a crime to transport dentures across state lines."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/dec/07/bob-goodlatte/goodlattes-says-clim/	Our jaws dropped when U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte called for the repeal of a federal law banning the transport of dentures across state lines. Does such a law really exist? Goodlatte, R-6th, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, made the statement during a Nov. 24 radio interview on "The John Fredericks Show" in Portsmouth. He was touting a bill his committee passed Nov. 18 that would strike a number of what he considers to be superfluous laws. "There is a federal criminal law that says it’s a crime to transport dentures across state lines," he said. "So we’re getting rid of that." Seeking more information, we contacted Beth Breeding, Goodlatte’s communications director. She pointed us to a section of the U.S. code called the Federal Denture Act of 1942. It’s a murky law, and we had trouble finding experts who know about it. It turns out that some states have laws that only dentures provided by licensed dentists can be sold within their borders, and other states don’t have that mandate. The federal law says its purpose is to protect the integrity of state laws requiring dentist-made false teeth and to promote good oral health. Those who violate the law can be charged criminally or reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We wondered how often people have been charged with the federal crime. Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, told us his department looked back over the past decade, starting in 2004, and could not find records of any charges being filed under the provision. If no one is being prosecuted, is there still any value in having the law? The answer depends on who makes the dentures. Maria Lopez Howell, a consumer adviser with the American Dental Association, said the law protects people by making sure their dentures are provided by someone "who has been trained to do this very customized work." On the other side of the fence are denturists - technicians who have been trained in making dentures but do not have medical degrees. Paul M. Levasseur, secretary of the National Denturist Association, called the restriction on interstate transport of false teeth "a strange law." "While I've never heard of anyone being prosecuted, it is probably a case of protectionism by organized dentistry," Levasseur said in an email. The New York Times documented the dispute between dentists and denturists in 2007. Denturists said they were highly trained and sometimes work under the supervision of a dentist. The ADA said the technicians aren’t trained to diagnose mouth diseases or to spot broken roots of teeth, which can cause harm if not corrected before dentures are inserted. All of this debate, however, ignores a more basic question: Can grandpa wear his false teeth across state lines without the risk of prosecution? The answer is yes. "If you have a family member who has dentures, they can still travel across the United States without any consequences," Howell said. Levasseur told us, "I believe this deals with commerce not individuals." Our ruling Goodlatte said it’s a federal crime "to transport dentures across state lines." He made the statement while promoting a bill that would repeal what he considers to be unnecessary laws. A 73-year-old federal law does make it a crime for non-dentists who make false teeth to ship their wares out of state. But it doesn’t restrict citizens from wearing their dentures wherever they go. The congressman didn’t mention that. So Goodlatte’s claim is accurate but needs a clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2015-12-07T00:00:00	2015-11-24	['None']

mpws-00008	For some Minnesota poultry farmers this year’s massive avian flu outbreak is  the worst they’ve ever seen. Nearly 3.8 million birds have died from the virus or were killed to prevent it from spreading. It’s hit the state’s $800 million turkey farming industry the hardest. In the midst of the crisis, legislators have discussed emergency funding to help poultry farmers deal with the outbreak, and have made a point to promote consumption of Minnesota turkeys. But one DFL legislator took to the House floor to give a bizarre speech about why he’s worried about the risk of humans getting avian flu. Rep. Ron Erhardt, DFL-Edina said that after eating turkey over the weekend “he was all flu-ed out” and referred to eating turkeys as “possible poison,” saying that there has been transference of avian flu to humans in the past. 	false	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/05/poligraph-erhardts-bird-flu-claims-are-false/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Erhardt’s bird flu claim is false	May 6, 2015, 2:28 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Ron_Erhardt_(politician)']
pomt-14336	Says Barack Obama was happily photographed holding a T-shirt with revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara’s face on it.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/mar/25/sid-miller/miller-posts-fake-photo-obama-holding-che-guevara-/	During President Barack Obama’s historic trip to Cuba, he took in a baseball game, met with leader Raul Castro and attended a wreath ceremony for a Cuban journalist and poet. In the background of the ceremony was a mural of Marxist revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara several stories high on the side of a building. Guevara, who met exiled brothers Fidel and Raul Castro in Mexico in 1955, and was a key figure in the Cuban Revolution that overthrew the dictator Fulgencio Batista. Obama’s photo in front of the mural drew criticism, but according to one Republican politician, it wasn’t the only such picture. Back in Texas, Sid Miller, the state’s agriculture commissioner, posted a photo to his Facebook fan page that provided a rare, if unseen, glimpse into Obama’s Havana trip from 1,000 miles away. In a March 22, 2016 post on his Facebook fan page, Miller shared a photo of the president holding a blue T-shirt adorned with the face of Guevara, with the caption: "President Obama refuses to return to the United States in order to meet with European leaders to discuss a response to today's terror attacks in Brussels -- attacks that severely injured a number of Americans. Instead, he remains in Cuba holding a shirt depicting the image of Che Guevara--one of the most reviled terrorists of the modern age -- a murdering thug who was responsible for thousands of innocent deaths. President Obama is laughing at us. He understands the symbolism of this picture and yet he doesn't care. I believe his actions are disgraceful. Do you agree?" First, a little background. As Texas' agriculture commissioner, Miller is charged with running the national school breakfast and lunch programs, protecting crops from pests and disease and regulating all fuel pumps in the state, among other duties. He also has a flair for newsworthy behavior. In his first act as commissioner, he granted amnesty to cupcakes as an approved dessert and got national attention for lifting a ban to allow deep fat fryers back in public schools. His Facebook presence shares headline-grabbing material. In one example, a photo on his Facebook page showed a detonated atom bomb with a caption that read, "Japan has been at peace with the US since August 9, 1945. It’s time we made peace with the Muslim world." The photo was taken down less than 24 hours later. Miller’s team said a staffer posted the photo, not him. Recently, he’s drawn attention for taking a taxpayer-funded trip to Oklahoma to get a supposed cure-all injection known as the "Jesus Shot." Back to the images. It’s clear a photo captured Obama in front of a Guevara mural. But Miller claimed he went further and picked up a shirt on his oft-criticized Cuba trip. Standing in front of an image that’s permanently there and voluntarily holding up that same image are different things. We had to know if the leader of the free world knowingly posed with an image of the revolutionary, as Miller claimed. We called Miller’s office and emailed the White House; neither immediately replied. But we quickly came across several news articles declaring the photo a fake -- including a Houston Chronicle story that found an image believed to be the original from a 2009 presidential visit to a lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the original photo, Obama is holding a T-shirt emblazoned with lengthy equations, which an online thread describes as the "Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the conservation-of-mass equation." Next, we did a reverse Google image search to determine if similar images exist. The Chronicle article read through comments on Miller’s Facebook post alleging the photo was fake, and found a Reddit thread from 2009 that explained the science on the original T-shirt in question. Our results brought up "visually similar images" of Obama holding up a blue T-shirt with a series of equations on them, as well as links to pages that included matching images. Most links were from Getty Images, showing Obama in 2009 also wearing the same pink dotted tie. Another link went to a San Antonio Current article debunking the photo. The photo caption: "US President Barack Obama holds a T-shirt given to him as he toured a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), an institution that has been developing cutting-edge clean energy technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 23, 2009." Even in the background of the Miller Facebook photo, behind Obama’s head, there is a poster labeled "Center for Excitonics." In the Getty image picture, the poster is in the same position. An online search for the center landed us on the center’s MIT web page. So, we wondered, did Obama drop in at some time and did he smile while holding a blue T shirt? We called and emailed the lab to ask if the supposed original Getty image was taken there, and if Obama visited in 2009. Kimberly Allen, MIT’s media relations director, replied to our email and confirmed the Getty image link we included in the email was in fact taken in their lab, and the president visited in October 2009. Allen said MIT did not own the original photo of Obama holding up the T-shirt, but she provided a web link to a photo of the president dressed in the same suit exploring a lab with a poster in the background reading "Center for Excitonics." Also, in the reverse Google image search, some of the "visually similar images" showed Obama holding the T-shirt in the lab with a man with a beard in a colorful printed shirt. In the link Allen sent over, the header image showed Obama watching the same man, Professor Alex Slocum, do a demonstration. As of March 25, the post and photo remained on Miller's Facebook page despite several comments below it linking to news articles such as the Chronicle’s claiming the picture is fake. Our ruling Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller posted a picture on Facebook showing President Obama holding a T-shirt with Marxist revolutionary figure Che Guevara’s face on it. The photo accompanies a mini-rant from Miller complaining that the president was rubbing elbows with Cuba’s communist leaders instead of flying back to Washington in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Brussels. The pic is a doctored version of a photo from Obama’s 2009 visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Excitonics Lab. The T-shirt in the original photo read "And Moses said " followed by equations that govern the flow of fluids, concluding "and the waters parted." Get it? (A lot of nerds weren’t impressed either, questioning why Moses saying the equations out loud would cause the Red Sea to part, a scene more reminiscent of witchcraft than the invisible hand of God.) Any suggestion the president picked up an inappropriate souvenir on his Cuban trip was based on Photoshop, not fact. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-07231	"Some neighborhood schools are closing."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/02/texas-house-democratic-caucus/house-democrats-say-neighborhood-schools-are-closi/	Urging fellow lawmakers to tap the state’s so-called rainy day fund to give more money to public schools, a press release distributed by the Texas House Democratic Caucus paints a gloomy picture of the future of education in Texas. "Make no mistake," says the May 18 statement, attributed to six House members, including caucus leader Jessica Farrar of Houston. "Some neighborhood schools are closing. Pre-kindergarten for 100,000 kids, programs that teach kids music and art, Advanced Placement courses in math and science — they’re all under threat. Voting for a budget that leaves out the rainy day fund is a vote to kill these programs." It’s been widely reported that school districts across the state have been making plans to lay off teachers, trim programs and take other measures in anticipation of expected cuts in state education aid. But are districts also shuttering campuses? Texas has more than 8,000 public schools. To our request for specifics on neighborhood school closures, the executive director of the caucus, Roger Garza, sent us a list of more than 90 schools categorized in various ways, including "grade realignment," "announced closure" and "possible closure/consolidation." We sought clarification on some of the entries but received no response. And when we asked the Texas Education Agency for information on schools being closed, spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that the agency’s database only shows actual — not anticipated — closures, which are typically reported to the state in the summer. "That’s when I would expect any school closed for budget reasons to show up," she said. So we went ahead with our own research, combing through the list sent by the caucus, reading news reports and talking to school districts to find neighborhood schools that are being shuttered because of the coming reductions in state funding. We found seven in all: ** Four elementary schools (serving a total of 1,300 students) in the Houston district. District spokesman Jason Spencer told us that because of proposed state budget cuts, the administration determined that these small schools could no longer afford to provide some key services — for example, have a librarian or a nurse — so they will not open in the fall, saving the district $1.6 million. The Democrats’ list of possible closures includes dozens of other Houston schools that are not facing imminent closure. That may be because in December, the district superintendent, Terry Grier, initiated a review of 66 underutilized campuses, all with low student enrollment. However, he ultimately recommended closing only the four schools. ** An elementary school (490 students) in the Hutto district north of Austin. According to a March 23 Austin American-Statesman article, Superintendent Doug Killian said, "Our hope was that if we closed the school and reduced our overhead, that we could keep more jobs overall." District spokeswoman Emily Boswell told us that the closure of Veterans’ Hill Elementary will save the district $1 million next year. ** An elementary school (500 students) in San Antonio’s Edgewood district. An April 19 San Antonio Express-News story describes the school board’s vote to shutter Coronado/Escobar Elementary as "the first school closure in Bexar County related to anticipated state budget cuts." In an April 18 story on KSAT-TV’s website, Superintendent Elizabeth Garza is quoted as saying: "We had to come up with different options to cut our budget by about 10 percent." The closure is projected to save $1.5 million in operating costs, district spokesman Maclovio Perez said. ** An intermediate school (340 students) in the Cedar Hill district, southwest of Dallas. District Chief Financial Officer Mike McSwain told us that the school board voted to close Beltline Intermediate School because of the upcoming reductions in state funding, saving the district $550,000. We also identified four other schools — two in Abilene and two in Little Elm, north of Dallas — that are set to close. However, we did not include them on this list because officials from those districts told us that the closures were in the works before the districts began to plan for the state budget reductions. Finally, we found at least five other districts that have discussed shuttering schools to help solve their budget problems and either decided against it or have yet to make a final decision. Among them is the Austin school district, with more than a dozen campuses identified as "possible" closures on the caucus’s list. According to American-Statesman articles, district officials are now developing a proposal that will take into consideration a task force report recommending that nine schools be closed over the next several years. The school board is not expected to take action on closures until the fall. To the Truth-O-Meter: In their statement, the Democratic legislators indicated that some neighborhood schools would close as a result of state budget cuts. Guess that depends on your definition of "some." The House Democratic caucus sent us a list of more than 90 schools, but we could find only seven — out of thousands across the state — that will shut their doors because the Legislature is reducing education aid.

pomt-05680	Obama's secretary of energy, Dr. Steven Chu, "has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels (for gasoline), and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/14/newt-gingrich/gingrich-said-energy-secretary-advocated-raising-g/	Newt Gingrich, who has promised gasoline at $2.50 a gallon if he’s elected president, frequently blames the Obama administration for rising prices at the pump. He recently called President Barack Obama’s energy plan "outrageously anti-American." And in an interview on Fox News Sunday on March 11, 2012, Gingrich said Obama is leading the nation toward "greater dependency and much more expensive gasoline, maybe ultimately as high as $9 or $10 a gallon, which is what his secretary of energy, Dr. Chu, says he wants it to be. "He has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels, and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon." That sounds like it could ruin a lot of road trips. We decided to check that claim about Steven Chu, and while we’re at it -- are Europeans really paying that much to fuel their Fiats? What Chu said Chu is a a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who served as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a federal energy research center. His quote about European gas prices has become somewhat notorious since he uttered it almost four years ago. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in late 2008 -- before Obama was elected and at a point when Chu had no ties to Obama -- Chu told the newspaper that he favored raising gasoline taxes gradually over 15 years to coax consumers into buying fuel-efficient cars and discouraging sprawl. "Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe," Chu said in an interview with the Journal in September 2008. The quote did not appear in print until December, when the Journal ran a story after news emerged that Chu was being tapped as energy secretary. It has been a target of criticism numerous times since then. "The popularity of Chu’s now-infamous quotation tends to track the rise and fall of gas prices: It enjoyed a huge surge of attention last spring and summer (2011) before largely vanishing from view in the fall, leading up to this month’s renaissance," reporter Bob King wrote in a story in POLITICO. As it happens, after Gingrich's comment, Chu backed away from what he said. At a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on March 13, 2012, Chu said, "Since I walked in the door as secretary of Energy I’ve been doing everything in my powers to do what we can to … reduce those prices." Chu added, according to POLITICO, that the "most important tool in DOE’s tool chest is moving off oil." "So are you saying you no longer share the view that we need to figure out how to boost gasoline prices in America?" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked him. "I no longer share that view," Chu said. "When I became secretary of Energy, I represented the U.S. government," Chu added. "Of course we don’t want the price of gasoline to go up, we want it to go down." Getting back to Gingrich’s portrayal of Chu’s 2008 remark -- that he "has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels" -- Chu’s statement was indeed public. He said it to a newspaper. And he did express a desire to raise domestic gas prices closer to those in Europe. About that $10 gas Gingrich pegged the cost of a gallon of gasoline in Europe at between $9 and $10. We contacted the European Union, which provided this chart showing gasoline prices in various countries as of March 5, 2012. The chart (on page 2 of the document) shows prices in Euros per liter. We converted that into dollars per gallon and came up with these figures: France: $7.07 per gallon Portugal: $7.24 per gallon Italy came in highest at $8.48 per gallon. We also received information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to the chart on page 3 of this document, which shows prices in January 2012, a gallon of gasoline cost $7.54 per gallon in France, $8.07 in Germany and $6.68 in the United Kingdom. The travel website mytravelcost.com reports even higher prices. The site, which says it updates prices monthly, puts a liter of unleaded in France at 1.64 euros. Converted to dollars per gallon, that’s $8.10 per gallon. In Spain, it’s $7.06 per gallon, and in the Netherlands it’s $8.90, according to the website. Our ruling Gingrich said that Chu, the energy secretary, "has said publicly he wants us to pay European levels [for gasoline] and that would be $9 or $10 a gallon." Chu’s statement, made to the the Wall Street Journal in 2008, was "somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe." Gingrich’s paraphrase was accurate. As for the price, he aimed a little high. We found examples of gasoline near $9 a gallon in Europe, but none approaching $10. Gasoline prices fluctuate, however, and so does the exchange rate between dollars and euros. But, because of the discrepancy, we rate his statement Mostly True. This story originally provided an incorrect date for the Fox News Sunday program on which Gingrich appeared. It has been corrected to say March 11, 2012. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cab7a2a-1eab-49c8-8bf0-54f9628d4bf2	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-03-14T14:08:36	2012-03-11	['Europe', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-01702	Says George Soros and Bill Gates are funding a bioweapons lab in Sierra Leone that caused the Ebola outbreak.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/11/blog-posting/bloggers-bill-and-melinda-gates-george-soros-funde/	The underbelly of the Internet is no place to find credible information about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Last week we brought you example No. 1. Example No. 2 is as follows: Several conspiracy websites have raised questions lately about a "bioweapons lab" in Sierra Leone being the source of the virus. Questions like, "What's behind the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone? Could it possibly be a U.S. bioweapons project gone amuck?" Some of the websites tie the "bioweapons lab" to billionaires George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. "At the epicentre of the current Ebola epidemic is the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, which houses a U.S. a (sic) biosecurity level 2 bioweapons research lab with links to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Soros Foundation," reads an excerpt shared on sites like RumorMillsNews.com and BeforeItsNews.com. We wanted to set the record straight. Soros and Gates There’s no proof of Soros and Gates funding a bioweapons lab in Kenema, one of the largest cities in Sierra Leone with a population of about 150,000. And there’s really no case that a bioweapons lab in Kenema is behind the outbreak. "The assertion is absurd," said Chris Williams, spokesman for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation did provide a $1 million Ebola-related grant to support emergency efforts in West Africa by UNICEF, he said. A spokeswoman for Soros’ Open Society Foundations also said it does not fund any labs, much less a bioweapons lab, in West Africa. We can’t exactly pinpoint the reason people are connecting Soros and the Gateses to the Ebola outbreak, our best guess is people are trying to insinuate they had something to do with creating the current crisis. One blogger who invoked the Soros/Gates connection, Dublinsmick, referenced the website of the "viral fever bioweapons lab inside Kenema Government Hospital," saying it "read like a roll call of New World Order organizations." The New World Order is a popular conspiracy theory whereby a group of wealthy elites plan to take over the world. Here’s the list, which does not include Soros or Gates: The Consortium is a collaboration between Tulane, Scripps Research Institute, Broad Institute, Harvard University, University of California at San Diego, University of Texas Medical Branch, Autoimmune Technologies LLC, Corgenix Medical Corporation, Kenema Government Hospital (Sierra Leone), Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (Nigeria) and various other partners in West Africa. …The Consortium intends to expand this program to include other important infectious agents such as Ebola, Marburg and other Arenaviruses that are of great concern to public health and bioterrorism," states the bioweapons lab website. This text matches a list of partners of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium, which conducts research at Kenema. No, it does not describe itself as a bioweapons lab. And the program director said there is no financial connection to Gates or Soros. We did find one very, very loose Soros-Gates link. One of the Broad Institute researchers who is part of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium is a Harvard University computational geneticist who earned her medical degree from Harvard Medical School as a Soros Fellow, and her work is supported by awards from groups that include the Gates Foundation. Of course, she was also a Rhodes scholar, won a Packard Foundation award in science and engineering, and was recognized by the National Institutes of Health with an Innovator Award. A spokeswoman for the Broad Institute, Haley Bridger, said the institute has not received money from Soros. She said it has received money from the Gates Foundation, but it was for research on tuberculosis, not Ebola. The consortium Before the current Ebola outbreak, members of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium focused their work on a bigger concern in West Africa: Lassa fever, a viral disease with symptoms that resemble Ebola but is more common than Ebola in that area. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded a five-year, $15 million contract to Tulane to continue researching Lassa fever, and the consortium was created in 2010. Tulane University researchers have worked in the area for about a decade to better understand Lassa fever and develop modern diagnostic assays, or tests to see if a person has the fever, and treatments. Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone is a major partner of the research scientists from Tulane and other universities. The multi-facility hospital contains a laboratory and ward dedicated to Lassa fever research and isolating Lassa fever patients. When the first Ebola case was diagnosed in Guinea, about three hours from the Kenema site in in early 2014, a team from the consortium went to Kenema to help the site switch gears. "We were there working 10 years and then Ebola came here," said Dr. Robert Garry, a Tulane University professor and program manager of the consortium. "We’re not here to turn Lassa and Ebola into a kind of superweapon. It can do that on its own." The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases also sometimes works in the facility, Garry said. Part of its mission is to prevent viruses like Ebola and Lassa fever from being used deliberately as bioterrorism agents against soldiers and civilians. It did not respond to our inquiry by our deadline. Ebola infections have cropped up over the years, but the latest spell is the deadliest, with 961 deaths and 1,779 infections reported by the World Health Organization. The first case was reported in Gueckedou, Guinea, in early 2014 before it spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, some of the poorest parts of Africa with limited access to medical care (and in some cases, a deep mistrust among some residents of medical professionals spreading the disease). So, no, it did not start at the country-owned hospital in Kenema, though the city is a major player in a very dispersed outbreak. The hospital’s medical staff is in the thick of treating patients infected with the Ebola virus, and several nurses and doctors have died in the course of treating patients. That includes Dr. Sheik Umar Kahn, a worldwide pioneer of Ebola research from Sierra Leone who died July 28. Kahn was the physician in charge of the Lassa Fever Program at the Kenema hospital, so he worked with researchers from Tulane and elsewhere. "The conspiracy theories really just kind of, wow," Garry said. "Our teammates are dying, and you’re talking this trash about us." Our ruling Bloggers worried about the New World Order connected the bank accounts of Soros and Gates to a facility responding to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone -- a facility they strongly suggest is responsible for the outbreak. A direct link to the billionaires is unproven. One researcher who received education and research grants from their foundations does not warrant the much-hyped connection. Moreover, the virus did not start from a research lab in Kenema, giving the bloggers’ incendiary claims even less credibility. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-00948	"200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/feb/20/marjorie-sanfilippo/florida-legislature-weighs-allowing-guns-college-c/	A shooting incident at Florida State University late last year has re-opened a debate in the Florida Legislature about whether to allow guns on college campuses. Gunman Myron May, a former FSU student, wounded two students and a library employee before he was killed by police on Nov. 20, 2014. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Florida is one of 20 states that specifically ban firearms on campuses; seven others specifically allow them under state law. The rest leave the decision up to the university. In January, a Florida House panel voted to advance a bill that would allow concealed-weapon permit holders to carry their guns on campuses. Then, on Feb. 16, a Senate panel approved the bill. Both votes broke along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition. The bill in question would allow concealed carry permit holders, who must be 21, to carry their firearms into any college or university facility. About 1.3 million people have Florida concealed-carry permits, including about 250,000 between the ages of 21 to 35. During the Senate hearing, college professors and students were among those who testified -- and they came armed with loads of statistics. Marjorie Sanfilippo, an Eckerd College psychology professor who has researched youth access to firearms, expressed concern about allowing guns on campuses. One issue, she said, is that some college students have mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. In fact, college is sometimes the time of life when major illnesses, such as bipolar mood disorder and schizophrenia, first appear. (May, a 31-year-old lawyer who returned to the FSU campus with a gun, suffered from mental health problems.) "What proponents of this bill won’t tell you is that 200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses -- an all too common event. Is it a stretch to speculate that more of these suicide attempts would be lethal if students had firearms?" Are suicide attempts that widespread on college campuses? We took a closer look at the available statistics. Statistics on attempted suicide and colleges Sanfilippo told PolitiFact Florida that she took her data from an assessment by the American College Health Association, an advocacy organization for colleges and universities. The association has been collecting health data about college students since 2000. About 76,000 students at 157 colleges and universities took part in the spring of 2012. (The survey included Florida institutions but the association doesn’t release the names of those who participated.) The survey published in 2014 found that about 1.2 percent of college students reported attempting suicide within the past 12 months. There are approximately 20 million college and university students; doing the arithmetic, this translates into about 200,000 suicide attempts. (The association has found similar rates in other years.) Mary Hoban, who oversees the assessment, told PolitiFact Florida there are two caveats. First, the data is self-reported from studies, and second, the schools self-select to participate, "so our data are not truly generalizable." We searched for additional data on suicide attempts by college students. Researchers at the University of Texas found that 1 percent of undergraduates had attempted suicide within the past year. That data, from a paper published in 2009, came from a survey of students at 70 colleges and universities. Meanwhile, the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State University released a study based on data from 140 colleges and universities and 100,000 students for the 2013-14 year. Unlike other studies which reflect the overall student body, the Penn State study is based on data provided by students when they receive mental health services. It also reflects students who have made a suicide attempt within their lifetime -- not just the past year. Over this longer period, the study found, 9 percent of students had made a suicide attempt. Because this survey looked at a specific population that has received mental-health care, the rates will naturally be higher, said Ben Locke, executive director for the center. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not collected data on suicide attempts by colleges students specifically. However it does have emergency-department data on nonfatal suicide attempts by age. The rate for 20- to 24-year-olds in 2010 was about 300 per 100,000, while the rate for 15- to 19-year-olds was 381 per 100,000. That rate is a lot lower than the one Sanfilippo relied on. However, the use of emergency department visits doesn’t capture people who attempted suicide but didn’t then go to the hospital. "The actual number presented for care -- especially in an emergency department -- is going to be dramatically lower than people who self-disclose if they had an attempt in the last year," said Bill Schmitz, president of the American Association of Suicidology. For example, someone might have tried to overdose on Tylenol but then woke up without serious ill effects. Our ruling Sanfilippo said "200,000 students attempt suicide every year on college campuses." That statistic is extrapolated from the American College Health Association’s most recent annual survey, which found that 1.2 percent of college and university students had attempted suicide within the past year. There are approximately 20 million students overall, which translates to about 200,000 suicide attempts. But the study’s author says there are two important caveats: their data is self-reported and the schools self-select to participate. In addition, a different type of survey conducted by the CDC -- one that looked at emergency data -- found a lower rate of suicide in similar age groups, but experts said that’s to be expected because emergency data doesn’t capture attempts that don’t lead to a hospital visit. On balance, we rate it Half True.	None	Marjorie Sanfilippo	None	None	None	2015-02-20T12:36:40	2015-02-16	['None']
pomt-06706	Says that when President Obama visited El Paso, he "pronounced that the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/02/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-boasted-crimes-border-towns-/	At a Greenland, N.H., house party on Aug. 13, Texas Gov. Rick Perry answered questions ranging from illegal immigration to health care. Asked about the status of the U.S. border with Mexico, Perry challenged President Barack Obama’s claim about its safety: "We've got a President of the United States who came to El Paso some … 4 weeks ago and pronounced that the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history." For this item, we're not evaluating whether the border is safer, but whether Perry is accurately characterizing what Obama said. To check that claim, we contacted Perry's campaign but got no reply. We checked White House records of the president’s schedule and found the El Paso trip was actually May 10, which was three months earlier, not four weeks. So Perry's timing is off. As for the president's remarks, they were focused on immigration reform and border issues. Obama said America is a "nation of immigrants," and welcomed "those willing to embrace America’s ideals and America’s precepts." But he said the country’s "broken" immigration system needs reform to ensure everyone achieves the "American Dream." Here's what he said about border safety: "Over the last two years, thanks to the outstanding work of Janet (Napolitano, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security) and Alan (Bersin, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection) and everybody who's down here working at the border, we've answered those concerns. Under their leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible. They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. "The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004. It's a build-up that began under President Bush and that we've continued, and I had a chance to meet some of these outstanding agents, and actually saw some of them on horseback who looked pretty tough. (Laughter.) So we put the agents here. Referring to Republicans who had called for tougher border protections, he said, "They wanted a fence. Well, the fence is…The fence is now basically complete. "We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we've done. But even though we've answered these concerns, I've got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. "You know, they said we needed to triple the Border Patrol. Or now they're going to say we need to quadruple the Border Patrol. Or they'll want a higher fence. Maybe they'll need a moat. (Laughter.) Maybe they want alligators in the moat. (Laughter.) They'll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That's politics. "But the truth is the measures we've put in place are getting results. Over the past two and a half years, we've seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago. That means far fewer people are attempting to cross the border illegally. "And also, despite a lot of breathless reports that have tagged places like El Paso as dangerous, violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. (Applause.) Of course, we shouldn't accept any violence or crime. And we've always got more work to do. But this progress is important and it's not getting reported on." So did Obama actually say the border with Mexico and the United States is now "safer than it ever way in history"? Let's review Obama's words: He said there is more border enforcement than ever: "They wanted more agents at the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history." He said seizures and apprehensions are up: "Over the past two and a half years, we've seized 31 percent more drugs, 75 percent more currency, 64 percent more weapons than ever before. (Applause.) And even as we have stepped up patrols, apprehensions along the border have been cut by nearly 40 percent from two years ago." He said violent crime is down: "Violent crime in southwest border counties has dropped by a third." He said El Paso and other border cities are safe compared with other U.S. cities: "El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation." Perry is exaggerating. Obama did not actually "pronounce that the border with Mexico and the United States was safer than it ever was in history." His time references were primarily for recent years. Still, Obama's tone and his examples definitely supported the overall point that the border is safer now than it was before. We rate Perry's claim Mostly True.

pomt-06047	On the accuracy of state jobs numbers.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/12/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-states-jobs-data-u/	The November jobs report, released Dec. 15, 2011by the state Department of Workforce Development, brought a mixture of disappointment and surprise. The disappointment was the news that the state lost 11,700 jobs in November, the worst monthly decline in more than two years. The surprise was how Gov. Scott Walker’s response: He attacked the figures as unreliable. Of course, this is the same monthly data Walker heralded in the first six months of his administration, when it showed job increases. In his campaign for governor, Walker’s top promise was that the state would add 250,000 private sector jobs by the end of his four year term. (We track progress each month on the Walk-O-Meter. The December numbers are due to be released January 26, 2012.) So, has Walker changed his view on the accuracy of the numbers? Time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter and with it our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change in position is good politics or good policy, but simply whether a political figure has changed his or her position. The numbers are compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and released by the state agency. They are based on a survey of a sample of state employers and are routinely expressed as estimates. Each month, they are released as a preliminary number that is then "finalized" the next month. The state jobs tally started out in an encouraging fashion for Walker, beginning with the report on January 2011 job growth, issued on March 9, 2011, that showed the state added a total of 11,300 jobs that month. Walker took credit. "The number one goal of my Administration is to get government out of the way so that the private sector can create 250,000 jobs by 2015," Walker said. "Adding over 10,000 private sector jobs in January shows that Wisconsin is on the right track toward fulfilling that important goal." Manny Perez, then secretary of the Department of Workforce Development, said: "The numbers further reaffirm the importance of Gov. Walker’s approach to support policies that not only allow the private sector to create jobs in Wisconsin, but also accelerate job growth in our state." Perez urged job seekers to polish their resumes so they wouldn’t be left out in the hiring. "The economy is on the mend," he said. So, the administration clearly viewed the numbers as reliable and meaningful. Five months of job increases followed, concluding with a report for June, issued July 21, 2011, that showed another sharp increase, this time of 12,900 jobs. It was the largest single month increase in jobs since 2003. Instead of issuing a news release from the department secretary, Walker came to Milwaukee to highlight the release of the June report. The state was in the midst of unprecedented state Senate recall elections that could have cost Walker’s party control of that chamber. "To have 9,500 net new jobs in the state at a time when the country saw just 18,000 net new jobs all across the country is incredibly good news, and it's driven by the rebirth of tourism in the state," Walker said. Workforce Development Secretary Scott Baumbach -- Walker’s second appointee to that post -- added that job-seekers and employers were "reaping the economic benefits of the business-friendly environment that Gov. Walker is advancing." At the time the June jobs report was issued, the reports had shown a net increase of 39,300 private-sector jobs. Then things changed. The July report said the state lost 12,500 jobs -- wiping out much of the gain reported for the previous month. In the months that followed, the administration reported small monthly job losses. Then on Dec. 15, 2011, the state report said Wisconsin lost 11,700 jobs in November, the steepest decline in more than two years. The administration didn’t comment about the factors that contributed to the jobs loss. Instead, for the first time, Walker’s team criticized the quality of the data gathered by the feds. Workforce development secretary Reggie Newson (Walker’s third appointee to the position) noted that the final October numbers had been revised from a loss of 9,300 jobs to a loss of only 1,400 -- a swing of 7,900. That monthly correction in the data was the largest this year -- an 85 percent change, compared an average correction of about 23 percent for the previous seven months of the year. We previously rated a statement by Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch that the monthly jobs numbers have a "margin of error of 75%" and were consistently "way off" Half True. Although there was a significant correction to the October data, there has been no change in the way the data is collected. The approach state has not changed since Walker took office. What’s the bottom line? Walker took credit for gains in state jobs for six months of 2011, as the monthly reports showed steady progress toward his promise of creating 250,000 jobs. In the second half of the year, the numbers began to decline and the governor’s approach shifted, with Walker in December criticizing the quality of the data. But nothing had changed in how the data was collected. Only Walker’s pronouncements on their accuracy. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-01165	"The United States right now incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/11/nicholas-kristof/kristof-us-imprisons-blacks-rates-higher-south-afr/	The primary debate over race in this country seems to be whether the country needs to have a debate at all. Polls show white and black Americans have markedly different views of where the problems lie. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has written a series of articles called "When whites just don’t get it." Kristof applauded the progress in race equality America has achieved, but he basically argued that whites don’t know what life is like for blacks, and he presented many stats to show that great inequality remains. Comedy Central’s The Daily Show aired video of Kristof making his case Dec. 4. "The United States right now incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did," Kristof said in the clip. Numbers on the American side are easier to come by and are straightforward. Kristof cited an Aspen Institute report that said, "The United States imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid." The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that, in 2010, the incarceration rate for black men in all of the country’s jails and prisons was 4,347 people per 100,000. For whites, the rate was 678 people per 100,000. America imprisons people far more in general than comparable countries. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, the United States is the clear leader with an incarceration rate about two and half times higher than the second place country, Chile. Precise numbers from South Africa during the apartheid years are more elusive. As a refresher, apartheid was South Africa’s policy of strict segregation and differential treatment of people according to their race. It became fully part of South African law in 1950 with passage of the Population Registration Act. That law dovetailed with other bills to anchor race-based controls. For instance, the Lands Act set aside about 87 percent of property for whites, and the Group Areas Act forbid nonwhites from living in white-designated zones. The 1950 legislation involved a set of "pass laws," so called because they created an internal passport system that supported the forced segregation. The apartheid era lasted more than 40 years, ending in 1991 with the repeal of the apartheid laws. William Worger, professor of history at the University of California-Los Angeles, is a longtime researcher of the apartheid era. Worger said the pass laws did much to fill the prisons. "Most of the arrests and imprisonment in South Africa were for pass laws offences," Worger told PunditFact. "The incarceration rate in South Africa in 1984 -- the midst of apartheid -- was 440 persons imprisoned per 100,000 population. Blacks comprised around 94 percent of those incarcerated." Based on Worger’s numbers, that would translate to an imprisonment rate of 612 per 100,000 for blacks in 1984. A report from the advocacy group The Sentencing Project found an incarceration rate of 851 black South Africans per 100,000 in 1993 (two years after the end of apartheid). The figure tracks back to a 1993 report of the South African Correctional Services. The report combined the categories of "black" and "colored" to produce the black male rate of incarceration. That’s two snapshots over a span of a decade, but it’s the best we have. In both cases, the numbers don’t begin to approach the current U.S. incarceration rate of African-American males. Whatever the limits in these data, the relative numbers for South Africa and the United States hold up, simply based on the number of beds in the South African prison system. In 1992, according to a report by University of Cape Town researchers, the country housed about 109,000 inmates in space designed for about 88,000. While overcrowding was known to have been worse before 1992, the black imprisonment rate could not have come close to today’s American rate simply due to limited room. There’s something of an international theme in countries comparing themselves to apartheid South Africa. We found Australian journalists drawing the same contrast relative to rates of imprisonment in their country. Our ruling Kristof said that America puts African-Americans behind bars at a higher rate than South Africa did under apartheid. Based on the known evidence, that appears to be correct. In 2010, the black male incarceration rate in the United States was 4,347 people per 100,000 in the United States. That comes nowhere close to reported incarceration rates of blacks in South Africa during and immediately after the apartheid era. We rate the claim True.

pomt-06241	Says his 9-9-9 tax reform plan is not "regressive."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/02/herman-cain/Cain-says-999-plan-not-regressive/	The recent debut of GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain’s "9-9-9 the Movie -- Slaying the Tax Monster" had PolitiFact Georgia waxing nostalgic over days gone by. Once upon a time -- about a month and a half ago -- Cain was surging to the top of the polls. He was the toast of the talk show circuit, and his 9-9-9 tax reform plan was the talk of the town. Cain repeated over and again that his plan was not "regressive." "[I]t is not regressive on the poor," he told the hosts of ABC’s "The View " Oct. 4. "It's not regressive," he told CNN Oct 13. "[T]hey try to say -- ‘Well, it’s going to be regressive on the poor.’ No, it’s not," he told a crowd in Las Vegas on Oct. 19. Cain’s "9-9-9 the Movie," a breezy five-minute cartoon released Monday, brings up the fate of the poor again. "Americans in lower tax brackets right now will have even more opportunities to move up as the economy takes off," it says. So, we wondered, is 9-9-9 "regressive"? There’s a bit of ideological dispute on what counts as a regressive tax. Some see it as one that taxes people at lower income levels at a higher rate than those who are wealthier. The Internal Revenue Service describes it as "a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups." And most economists agree that a regressive tax forces lower-earning taxpayers to pay a greater percentage of their income than higher earners. Some cite a national sales tax as an example. Because low- and middle-income households consume more of their income than higher-income households do, proportionally speaking, they have a greater tax burden. We looked at our past 9-9-9 coverage and other analysis. We found that while in most cases, personal tax rates will be the same regardless of how much money a person makes, it will change the lives of individuals on opposite ends of the income spectrum in very different ways. Our sister site PolitiFact National examined the plan. Based on the campaign’s statements, income tax exemptions will be for charitable deductions and "empowerment" zones that aim to encourage inner-city development. Cain’s 9 percent income tax would replace payroll taxes, which are paid by all workers toward Medicare and Social Security benefits. It would also end the estate tax. The 9 percent sales tax would apply to new goods, but not used goods. Payroll taxes on workers would go away. And if you’re like about half of the country and pay no income tax, there’s a good chance you’d start doing so under 9-9-9. An Oct. 18 analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center offers perhaps the most detailed look at the plan. The group, which is made up of tax experts from Republican and Democratic administrations, found that Americans with top incomes would fare far better than the rest of us. Or, as Tax Policy Center analyst Howard Gleckman wrote, "Herman Cain’s 9-9-9 tax plan would result in a massive tax cut for nearly all of the highest-earning Americans and a steep average tax hike for everyone else." They looked at 9-9-9 based on income level and found nearly 84 percent of tax filers would get a tax increase under Cain’s plan, compared with current tax policy. More than 95 percent of those who make more than $1 million would get a tax cut. PolitiFact National posted data for filers who make $75,000 or less on its site. Now, there are a few caveats. After the Tax Policy Center released its analysis, Cain’s camp said households below the poverty level could claim a deduction. The center asked several times for more details on this deduction, but the campaign "did not define clearly how that deduction would work," they wrote. Their analysis therefore does not take into account this deduction. The center also had to fill in a few blanks about 9-9-9 to analyze the plan according to its standard economic model. Cain may release more details that could cause these estimates to change, but we found none so far. His cartoon says that 9-9-9 turns the entire country into an "opportunity zone," creates exemptions for people "starting at the poverty line," and creates incentives for "the most economically distressed areas." But beyond that, there are few additional details on his website or in any other statement we reviewed. Other analyses have come up with similar results as the Tax Policy Center. Before the Tax Policy Center released its results, PolitiFact Florida asked three tax accountants to take a look at a claim that under 9-9-9, taxes for filers that make $50,000 would fare better. They found the claim is only correct in certain instances and that Cain was cherry-picking his numbers. Bruce Bartlett was once a senior policy analyst to Ronald Reagan, but now is critical of the president’s approach to economics. He said that "The poor would pay more while the rich would have their taxes cut, with no guarantee that economic growth will increase and good reason to believe that the budget deficit will increase." Incidentally, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants did rough calculations for Yahoo News and concluded that billionaire business mogul Warren Buffett would likely pay no income taxes. We were unable to find any independent analysis that said 9-9-9 would have the same consequences for lower-income Americans as higher-income ones. Cain says the personal income flat tax is not "regressive," and technically speaking, all but the poor will be taxed at the same rate. (How he’ll handle the poor remains unclear.) Still, under Cain’s 9-9-9 plan, low- and middle-income taxpayers will pay a greater share of their income on taxes than their wealthier counterparts. This fits the definition of "regressive." We rate Cain’s claim False.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-12-02T06:00:00	2011-10-19	['None']

pomt-13045	"We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/nov/28/don-beyer/don-beyer-wrongly-says-us-has-surpluses-its-trade-/	U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, made a pitch for free-trade agreements early on election night, a few hours before Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential race put those pacts in jeopardy. Beyer was interviewed by PJ Media, a conservative online news outlet and blog. If Democrat Hillary Clinton won the presidency, he was asked, what would Democrats do to gain the support of those who voted for Trump "specifically on the trade issue?" "First, I don’t think we can abandon our trade agenda," Beyer said. "We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20." Beyer offered a far rosier view of free-trade agreements than Trump, whose unrelenting criticism of them is credited with helping him to attract critical blue-collar votes. Trump says the agreements have encouraged U.S. manufacturers to move plants and jobs to countries that offer cheaper labor. He’s vowed to renegotiate - and possibly pull out of - the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. And he promised not to enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Barack Obama negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim nations. So we wondered whether Beyer has it right when he says the U.S. has a surplus with all of its partners in existing trade deals. Uncle Sam, indeed, has trade agreements with 20 nations, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Mexico and Canada, as we mentioned, are part of NAFTA, which became effective in 1994. Six nations joined the U.S. in 2004 in the Central American Free Trade Agreement: Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The U.S. has independent trade agreements with 12 nations: Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, South Korea, Morocco, Oman, Panama, Peru and Singapore. Census Bureau records show that during the first nine months of 2016, the U.S. was running overall trade deficits with seven of its agreement partners. Here are those nations and the U.S. negative trade balance with them: •Canada, $5.8 billion; •Colombia, $642 million; •Israel, $7 billion; •Jordan, $197 million; •South Korea, $22.8 billion; •Mexico, $46.8 billion; and •Nicaragua, $1.4 billion. When you add up the balances of all 20 nations with pacts, the U.S. was running a $54.5 billion trade deficit for the first nine months of this year. We examined the numbers for 2015 and found a similar result. The U.S. had trade deficits with six of the countries; only Colombia fell off the list. The U.S. had a composite $64 billion trade deficit with its 20 trade-agreement nations. All told, the U.S. ran up a $546 billion global trade deficit during the first nine months of this year and a $746 billion deficit in 2015. About half of the U.S. deficit both years came from its trade with China. We finally should note that we made two efforts to contact Beyer’s office for this article and did not get a reply. Our ruling Beyer said, "We have trade agreements with 20 countries, and we have trade surpluses with each one of those 20." Data show the U.S. is running trade deficits with seven of those trade-agreement nations through the first nine months of this year and ran deficits with six of those countries in 2015.

pomt-14982	"Paul Ryan is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/15/erick-erickson/paul-ryan-one-few-gop-house-members-have-voted-eve/	In the frenzy that followed the surprise decision by California Republican Kevin McCarthy to drop his bid for Speaker of the House, all eyes turned to Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan. And the knives came out. The left-wing website Salon slammed Ryan as too conservative, saying he "is just as much a wild-eyed right-wing nut as the rest of them, even if he can occasionally look a bit calmer on the TV." But even as it appeared that Ryan -- the Ways and Means chairman and 2012 GOP vice-presidential nominee -- was the consensus choice for speaker, he was attacked as not being conservative enough. Ryan "is a dangerous pick for conservatives," RedState.com editor-in-chief Erick Erickson wrote in a Oct. 9, 2015 blog post. "While in Congress, he voted for No Child Left Behind, the Prescription Drug Benefit, TARP, caps on CEO pay, the AIG bill, the GM bailout, the debt ceiling, and now the fiscal cliff. "In fact, Ryan is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress." Let's see if the bailout claim against Ryan -- who continues to be wooed, even though he has continued to say he's not going to run for speaker -- is on target. Ryan’s conservativeness Ryan is widely considered a conservative; indeed, he would be the most conservative House speaker in generations, as measured by a congressional rating system widely used by political scientists. Of course -- just like it is on the other end of the political spectrum -- there is right wing and then there is more right wing. Since 1971, the American Conservative Union has rated members of Congress based on legislation the group says is important. On a scale of zero to 100, Ryan, who has been in the House since 1999, has a lifetime rating of 90. On the other hand, his annual rating hit a career-low of 80 in 2011 and again in 2014. Meanwhile, the Conservative Review, headed by nationally syndicated radio talk show host Mark Levin, gives Ryan a "liberty score" of 58 percent on votes taken over the past six years -- a rating which it equates to a grade of F. Defining bailout It’s not clear from Erickson’s blog post what he regards as a bailout. He did not reply to our requests to provide information to back up his statement. Bailout, of course, is not a precise term. But there were at least three votes taken by the House on bailouts -- one on the giant bailout known as TARP, one on a separate measure for the auto industry, and one for the federal enterprises known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. TARP and the Freddie Mac and Fannie May rescues are the bailouts followed by Bailout Tracker, a feature of ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative news site. 1. TARP In October 2008, the Democratically controlled Congress approved a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, primarily to rescue banks in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. It was aimed at rescuing banks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America. Later, a bailout of the auto industry also was part of TARP, primarily to Chrysler, General Motors and GM’s financial subsidiary, GMAC. (The total amount was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank law in 2010. About $245 billion went to banks and about $80 billion to the auto industry.) It’s worth noting that the measure, known as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, was signed into law by a Republican president, George W. Bush. But it was also backed and continued by Bush’s Democratic successor, Barack Obama. TARP passed by a margin of 263-171 in the House. Ryan was among 91 Republicans who voted yes. Ryan’s vote earned him a demerit from the American Conservative Union. He said on the House floor at the time: "This bill offends my principles, but I’m going to vote for this bill in order to preserve my principles, in order to preserve this free enterprise system." 2. Auto bailout bill In December 2008, the House approved a related auto bailout bill by a vote of 237-170. Only a third as many Republican voted for the auto measure as voted for TARP. Ryan, whose district was home to a sprawling General Motors plant that closed the same month as the vote, was among 32 Republicans who voted yes. He said in a statement at the time that "because no additional taxpayer dollars were appropriated, I was able to support this legislation." By our tally, Ryan was one of 20 Republicans who voted for both TARP and the separate auto bailout measure, which did not become law. That's not less than a dozen, the figure Erickson used. But Ryan is among only five of the 20 who are still in the House. 3. Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae Freddie Mac (officially, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) and Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) are government-sponsored enterprises that help increase the money available for home loans. They were placed under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency in September 2008. Some $187.5 billion in federal funds have been invested in the two companies, according to ProPublica. Those funds were authorized by a law known as the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which passed the House more than a year earlier, in August 2007. But Ryan voted against it. Before we close, we’ll note there was also a bailout of AIG, the insurance company, in 2008. But that $182 billion rescue was done with loans from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, not through an act of Congress. And Erickson’s claim was limited to those acted on by Congress. Our rating Erickson said Ryan "is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress." Ryan was one of 20 GOP House members who voted for TARP and for a related auto industry bailout measure that did not become law, although he is only one of only five of those members who are still in the House. On the other hand, Ryan voted against the bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. For a statement that contains an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-13100	"(Deborah) Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/nov/05/senate-leadership-fund/did-deborah-ross-defend-right-burn-american-flag-a/	Deborah Ross, a former executive director of the North Carolina ACLU, has taken some flak for the positions that group took and legal decisions it made with her at the helm. Now that Ross, a Democrat, is running against Republican Sen. Richard Burr, some of those past decisions are coming up in attack ads targeting her. One ad, released last month by the GOP group Senate Leadership Fund, attempts to paint Ross as unpatriotic. "Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag," the ad states. There are three parts to this claim, so we examined each one individually to see how accurate the ad is. Defended flag-burning The first part of the claim is that "Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag." In a way, this is both right and wrong, depending on how someone who hears the ad interprets it. Ross has defended people’s right to burn the flag, although she has said she does not defend the act itself. "Flag burning is plain wrong, and I’ll stand up for free speech – even speech I don’t like," she told McClatchy in an interview last month. Her stance is in keeping with nearly three decades of Supreme Court precedent that Americans cannot be punished by the government for burning the U.S. flag. Doing so is a valid form of protest and free speech that’s protected by the First Amendment, the court ruled in its 1989 case Texas v. Johnson. That 5-4 decision came about in large part thanks to conservative justice Antonin Scalia, who was the swing vote. The 1989 case applied only to Texas, but in 1990 Congress passed a law banning flag-burning – and the Supreme Court then struck it down as unconstitutional, applying the standard nationwide. So Ross did defend flag-burning, taking the side of the Supreme Court. Derided efforts to ban flag-burning Next is the claim that Ross called attempts to ban flag-burning "ridiculous." Seeing as she sided with the Supreme Court precedent on defending flag-burning, it’s not too surprising that this part of the claim is correct as well. "We have a First Amendment right to burn the flag as symbolic speech," Ross said in 1995, while leading the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, regarding a proposal to circumvent the Supreme Court rulings by passing a new constitutional amendment. "The Constitution protects that right. To spend time and effort on this is ridiculous." Refused to help a veteran This is the part that gets tricky. In 2001, a veteran living in Caldwell County wrote the North Carolina ACLU for help in a neighborhood dispute. Robert McClure, a former sergeant in the U.S. Army, had been flying an American flag at his home. But the company that owned the mobile home park where he lived asked him to take it down; a neighborhood covenant said that, among other rules, flag poles weren’t allowed. McClure wrote to the ACLU asking for a lawyer to fight the company and win him the right to fly the flag. The ACLU declined. Ross didn’t personally write the letter declining to take his case, but she was the boss at the time, so the claim seems to be accurate on its face. However, it ignores a few key facts. The Constitution protects people from the government infringing on their rights. It doesn’t apply to interactions with private companies. That’s why you don’t have a First Amendment right to cuss out your boss, and why businesses are allowed to ban firearms on their premises. And McClure was not just trying to bring a constitutional claim against a private company. According to the company, he had actually agreed to the covenants that banned flag poles when he purchased his property. The letter from the ACLU turning him down said that the group received more requests every year than it could possibly handle, and thus "we can offer legal assistance in only a small number of cases with the maximum possibility of success." According to news reports, the veteran’s dispute was nevertheless settled quickly, and he was allowed to fly the flag. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund’s anti-Ross ad said she "defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag." The first part of the claim, about defending flag-burning, is a bit vague. Ross has said she does not support the act of flag-burning but does defend people’s right to do so. The ad is right that she said it was ridiculous to try to ban flag-burning. But where the ad diverges further from the truth is on the matter of the ACLU declining to represent a veteran when Ross was in charge. While technically correct, the group refused because the man was attempting to bring a claim that was not the type of legal battle the ACLU typically fights. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08455	Says Tom Ganley has been "sued over 400 times, for fraud, discrimination and more," and "a judge called Tom Ganley's business practices "deceptive and unconscionable."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/15/betty-sutton/rep-betty-sutton-cries-buyer-beware-ad-against-gop/	Tom Ganley's success in selling cars helped make him Ohio's largest dealer. It made him rich enough to put more than $3.4 million into financing his Republican congressional campaign against Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton in the 13th Congressional District. Sutton has less than a quarter of his war chest. She and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are countering by challenging the practices that Ganley used to build his wealth and automotive empire. Sutton’s TV ad "Buyer," posted on YouTube Sept. 21, uses the theme "buyer beware" and says: Ganley has been "sued over 400 times, for fraud, discrimination and more." A judge called Tom Ganley's business practices "deceptive" and "unconscionable." Sutton makes the claim that Ganley is a "dishonest car sales­man." That’s a statement of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can’t rate. But we can check her numbers and try to put them in perspective. We did find that Ganley was named in well over 400 suits in Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage and Summit counties, dating back to 1979. That number, though, when weighted for volume and time in operation, appeared to be comparable with the record of four other large auto groups we examined. A Plain Dealer story before last spring’s primary election reported that Ganley dealerships face suits from employees for age, racial and sex discrimination. Ganley’s campaign characterized them as disgruntled employees. Many of the dozens of lawsuits from customers were filed under the Ohio Lemon Law. Lemon Law cases involve manufacturing and repair problems and do not necessarily reflect on the way a dealer does business. But most Lemon Law cases are filed against dealers, in addition to manufacturers, though the law does not require it. Ganley dealerships have been sued for selling damaged cars as new and lending a potential buyer a car that had been reported stolen. Some of the consumer lawsuits involve the dealer practice of offering a "conditional delivery agreement" or "spot delivery agreement," which permits a consumer to take a new vehicle home before financing has been approved. Buyers Jeffrey and Stacy Felix claim they took home a new SUV, at Ganley’s insistence, after being told they were approved for zero percent financing. More than a month later, the couple said, they were told the rate was being moved to 9.44 percent. Their suit, and others, additionally claimed that Ganley violated Ohio's Consumer Sales Practices Act with a purchase contract containing a mandatory arbitration clause. That clause required any dispute between the buyer and dealer to be resolved by binding arbitration. The judge in Felix vs. Ganley Chevrolet, agreed that the clause was misleading, unfair and deceptive enough to be classified under Ohio law as "unconscionable," and therefore unenforceable. Ganley’s campaign spokeswoman Meghan Snyder noted -- accurately -- that Ganley or Ganley Automotive was named as the plaintiff and not the defendant in some suits. She said that "90 cases were dismissed without prejudice," and that 98 of the cases against Ganley also named a manufacturer and related to the Ohio Lemon Law. "Over his 42 years in business, Mr. Ganley has sold 585,211 cars, served 1,501,715 service, parts and body customers, and had a total of 5,486 employees," Snyder said. "He stands proudly behind his record of serving and employing Northeast Ohioans over the past six decades." We repeat: We are not rating the ad’s statement about Ganley’s honesty. But Sutton’s claim that he has been "sued over 400 times" and that a judge described his business practices "deceptive and unconscionable" checks out. Recognizing that he has been in business more than four decades and is Ohio’s largest car dealer are additional pieces of information not in the ad that help put the numbers into perspective. We rate her ad claim as Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Betty Sutton	None	None	None	2010-10-15T06:00:00	2010-09-21	['None']

Soldiers court-martialed for their Christian faith? PolitiFact readers wanted to know if headlines across websites such as Breitbart.com and MrConservative.com last week were true. "Pentagon May Court Martial Soldiers Who Share Christian Faith," said Breitbart.com, claiming that "the Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted." It could "effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military," the post said. "Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith," said MrConservative.com, explaining that "the Pentagon has released an official statement affirming that it will court martial 'proselytization.’" So, did the Pentagon confirm it might "court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith"? Welcome to the latest battle for soldiers’ hearts and minds. Pentagon meeting The recent hubbub has roots in the early 2000s, when a man named Mikey Weinstein watched his sons follow in his footsteps at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The Jewish students both faced Christian proselytizing, the family says, and in some cases, anti-Semitic slurs. An Air Force task force investigated accusations that the academy created a discriminatory climate, after a 2004 survey showed cadets complained that evangelical Christians had pressured Jews and other Christians. It found a need for policy guidance for commanders and supervisors regarding religious expression, not just at the academy, but across the Air Force. In 2005, Weinstein — a former Air Force attorney who worked in President Ronald Reagan's administration — unsuccessfully sued the Air Force for failing to prevent proselytizing. In 2006, he turned his attention full-time to his nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, saying he was fighting off "far-right militant radical evangelical religious fundamentalists." (He also writes about "fundamentalist Christian monsters" who unite around "horrific hatred and blinding bigotry," which doesn’t exactly endear him to groups he targets, such as the Family Research Council.) Fast-forward to a Washington Post blog in late April. Sally Quinn, who writes about religion for the Washington Post's On Faith blog, spoke with Weinstein and others on their way to meet with "several generals and a military chaplain." Weinstein had asked for months for the April 23 sit-down, which included his board members Larry Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Colin Powell, and Joe Wilson, a former ambassador. The three planned to exhort the military to punish proselytizing. They pointed Quinn to examples such as a chaplain telling troops — including Afghan soldiers — to "get right with Jesus," Marine officers changing the name of their attack squadron to the "Crusaders" (Weinstein’s group got them to change it back) and a military contractor putting references to the New Testament on gun sights (again, Weinstein fought to have them removed). "It’s a workplace violation," Wilson said. "This is a national security threat," Weinstein said. Weinstein also got an officer to remove an atheist bumper sticker from his car because it bothered an evangelical Christian. But, the men argued, the military itself needed to do more to protect troops who feel their religious freedom is undermined. Quinn quoted Wilson: "You need half a dozen court-martials real quick." Quinn’s post, published Friday, April 26, caught the attention of Fox News Radio commentator Todd Starnes. Monday, April 29, he asked the Pentagon: Is there a plan to court-martial chaplains who proselytize? Here’s what the Defense Department spokesman Nate Christensen told him: "The Department of Defense places a high value on the rights of members of the Military Services to observe the tenets of their respective religions and respects (and supports by its policy) the rights of others to their own religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs. The Department does not endorse any one religion or religious organization, and provides free access of religion for all members of the military services. "Court martials and non-judicial punishment are decided on case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases. "However, religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense." Starnes wrote: The Pentagon confirmed to Fox News that Christian evangelism is against regulations. "Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense, LCDR Nate Christensen said in a written statement. He declined to say if any chaplains or service members had been prosecuted for such an offense. "Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases," he said. The Internet took over from there. Weinstein had been "hired by the Pentagon" to "help shape policy on … religious tolerance," said Investor’s Business Daily. (Not true.) President Barack Obama’s Defense Department was "promising to bring criminal charges against any military personnel who express or share their faith," said a PA Pundits blogger. (Also not true.) And an anonymous blogger at MrConservative.com, citing Breitbart.com, declared, "Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith." PolitiFact reached out to Nate Christensen at the Defense Department, who said his statement "was grossly taken out of context." On May 2, he clarified: "Service members can share their faith (evangelize), but must not force unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others of any faith or no faith to one's beliefs (proselytization). "If a service member harasses another member on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or disability, then the commander takes action based on the gravity of the occurrence. Likewise, when religious harassment complaints are reported, commanders take action based on the gravity of the occurrence on a case by case basis. "... We work to ensure that all service members are free to exercise their Constitutional right to practice their religion in a manner that is respectful of other individuals' rights to follow their own belief systems; and in ways that are conducive to good order and discipline; and that do not detract from accomplishing the military mission." Weinstein, he said, wasn’t part of any Defense Department advisory group or committee, nor was he a consultant on religious issues. ‘There’s a line there’ The military has grappled for years with how to balance the rights of people exercising different religious beliefs, or no beliefs. Weinstein’s group had urged the Pentagon to enforce a recent Air Force policy on "government neutrality regarding religion." He wants to see courts-martial under the Uniform Military Code of Justice’s Article 92, "Failure to Obey Order or Regulation," for those who don’t follow orders not to proselytize. Rules in place since last year say that Air Force leaders "must avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates or to extend preferential treatment for any religion." Meanwhile, "all airmen are able to choose to practice their particular religion, or subscribe to no religious belief at all. You should confidently practice your own beliefs while respecting others whose viewpoints differ from your own." Rules for military chaplains already reflect this tightrope act. They’re affiliated with outside religious organizations, but must support troops of all faiths. "They're very careful about how they offer advice," said Lori Bogle, an associate history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who writes about religion and the military. "They are more like counselors. And if a person expresses a religious interest, they might go there." That’s been the general policy as long as she knows — even back to the 1940s. But in times of "stress," the military has briefly embraced evangelism, such as during the early Cold War, when "character guidance" programs and seminars took on an overtly Christian cast in response to an atheist enemy. But that stopped by the mid 1960s, she said. So, it’s not necessarily new or surprising the Pentagon would say proselytizing isn’t permitted. But groups such as the Family Research Council argue the policy outlined by the Defense Department spokesman last week is "incoherent," asking how the military will distinguish between "evangelizing" and "proselytizing." It has launched a petition to urge the defense secretary from censoring "the full solace of the gospel." Meanwhile, a Coast Guard rear admiral, William Lee, spoke last week of his discomfort with current rules — he wants to be able to hand Bibles to suicidal servicemen. Ken Klukowski, director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the Family Research Council, says millions of Christians, including "evangelicals, devout Catholics and observant Mormons," believe they are required by the New Testament to share their faith with others. "This is to be done respectfully and peacefully, at appropriate times and in an appropriate manner, but it must be done when such opportunities present themselves," he wrote. "To say that sharing the gospel is a crime under military law … is to say that tens of millions of Americans are not allowed to serve in our military." So, to some, to "hold Christian faith" is synonymous with promoting that faith to co-workers and subordinates. Under that interpretation, they could theoretically face court-martial if others found their attempts intrusive or harassing. But so far, Weinstein’s urging hasn’t resulted in such a court-martial. Our ruling Recent headlines and articles offered versions of the claim that the "Pentagon confirms they may court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith." Instead, a Defense Department spokesman had explained that proselytizing — "unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others" — wasn’t permitted and that punishment for breaking military rules is decided "case by case." Conservative religious groups argue this means "sharing the gospel" would become a crime. But no policy we saw suggests that the Pentagon would court-martial soldiers "who hold Christian faith." Quite the opposite — much of the language from the Defense Department reinforces the right of military members to practice their religion, as long as it’s in a way that respects others’ belief systems. Chaplains already follow such rules. Still, there’s a sliver of truth — if you believe your Christian faith compels you to try to convert others in a way people find harassing, it’s possible you could face court-martial, though such a thing has yet to happen. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2013-05-06T16:35:49	2013-05-01	['None']

pomt-05470	"The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president’s term."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-annual-new-business-startups-have/	When Mitt Romney was in Rhode Island April 11 to campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he said that President Obama’s policies were hurting the economy. To demonstrate that point during his speech in Warwick, Romney pointed to the rate of new business start-ups around the nation. "The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president’s term," Romney said. Romney has made this claim in other speeches. In Colorado in February, he was more detailed, saying, "Last year, under President Obama, there were almost 100,000 fewer new business start-ups than there were three years before." Start-up businesses are a crucial part of the nation’s economy. One recent study found that they account for only 3 percent of employment but almost 20 percent of gross job creation. So it stands to reason that one explanation for the slow pace of recovery is a lack of start-up activity. In that context, we were interested to see if Romney’s claim was accurate. A spokeswoman for Romney’s campaign refused to comment for this piece, so we did our own research. We started with an item written March 23, 2010, by our friends at PolitiFact Ohio checking a claim by House Speaker John Boehner that "new business start-ups are at the lowest levels in 30 years." Boehner’s statement was rated True, because the rate of start-ups per thousand people and the total number of start-ups per year were lower than in 1977 -- the date cited by Boehner’s office. But that item was not directly attributing the rate to Obama, as Romney did. We called Scott Shane, an expert on entrepreneurship who was a source for the PolitiFact Ohio Item. Shane is chairman of the economics department and professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He sent us a spreadsheet of Census Bureau data compiled by the U.S. Small Business Administration. His chart included the number of new firms created annually from 2005 to 2009, the most recent year that data is available. The number of new firms increased from 2005 to 2006 but fell steadily each year afterward, going from 556,899 in 2006 to 403,765 in 2009. The difference between 2008 -- George W. Bush’s last year in office -- and 2009 -- Obama’s first year -- was 84,499 fewer new businesses. Although it’s close, that’s not the drop-off of 100,000 new businesses that Romney claimed in his statement. But the available SBA data doesn’t cover Obama’s subsequent years in office, so it’s impossible to use it to make a conclusive ruling on Romney’s claim. So we turned to another source of information that has data for more recent years -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for labor figures. The bureau also tracks the creation of new businesses, but its numbers are different from the SBA data. While the SBA only includes start-ups, the BLS includes all new establishments. As Shane explained, if McDonald’s opens a new branch somewhere, then that branch is included in the BLS numbers but not in the SBA numbers. So the more-inclusive BLS number is generally larger than the SBA number for any given year. Although the BLS number doesn’t correlate perfectly to the number of new start-up businesses, we believe it’s still relevant. Romney’s claim was made as a part of a broader criticism of Obama’s economic policies and the slow rate of recovery. Whether a new establishment is a completely new business or a branch of an existing one, it still creates jobs and contributes to economic growth. According to the bureau’s Business Employment Dynamics statistics, the number of new establishments rose until 2006, when it was 667,341. It fell every year afterward up to 2010 by an average of 40,053 -- but then rose again in 2011 by 29,316. Despite the recent increase, however, the overall decrease since Obama became president is close to 100,000. In 2008, the number of new establishments was 626,771. In 2011, it was 536,445 -- 90,326 less. Because Romney’s campaign would not give us a source for his claim, we can only make an educated guess that he used the BLS number and rounded it up to 100,000. That may be reasonable, but there are still problems with Romney’s statement. By saying that the number of new businesses dropped during "this president’s term," he is clearly implying that Obama is responsible. Later in the speech he gave in Warwick, Romney was more emphatic. "This has not been a good time to start new enterprises," he said. "This president’s policies are responsible for the fact that this recovery has been postponed..." In a past speech, Romney called Obama’s presidency a "war on enterprise." At PolitiFact, we treat these types of blame/credit statements in two parts. We examine whether the numbers are right and how much experts say the person being blamed is responsible. But the number of new business start-ups had been declining before Obama took office. The numbers tracked by both the Small Business Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were down in 2007 and 2008, President George W. Bush’s last two years in office. The trend continued under President Obama. The decline coincided with the onset of the global economic recession. Not surprisingly, the biggest year-on-year drop-off in new businesses -- 17 percent according to the SBA and 12.5 percent according to the BLS -- occurred from 2008 to 2009, when the recession was at its worst. Obama took office in January 2009. In general, because of the complexities involved, PolitiFact has been leery of attributing the health of the economy to the policies of a president. We’ll borrow a quote from a recent PolitiFact National item to explain. "A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new office holder," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. (Burtless has provided advice to the campaign of Republican John McCain and contributed money to Obama.) "The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office." So what are some reasons for the drop in new business start-ups? In testimony to the House Committee on Small Business, Martin Neil Baily, another economist at Brookings, said that a reduction in home equity -- an important source of funds for start-ups -- and a tightening of banks’ lending standards are partly to blame. It’s important to note that the recession didn’t just affect start-ups in the United States. A 2010 World Bank study of 95 countries found that "nearly all experienced a sharp drop in business entry during the crisis." We should also add that it is extremely difficult to accurately measure the rate of business start-ups. We found one study that showed entrepreneurship rising in 2009 before falling in subsequent years. Another showed the rate rising in 2009 and 2010 before falling last year. "No single measure captures entrepreneurial activity perfectly," Shane wrote in a commentary last year. Finally, it’s telling that in 2011, as the United States started moving toward a recovery, the rate of new establishments tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics increased for the first time since 2006. Romney didn’t mention that in his speech. Our ruling Mitt Romney said: "The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president’s term." Many studies have found that fewer businesses have been created during the recession than in previous years. But we couldn’t find any that attributed a drop-off to Obama’s policies or, for that matter, Bush’s policies. There is some truth in Romney’s claim, but he neglected to say that the rate of new business start-ups was dropping before Obama took office. Or that by one measurement it has increased recently. Because Romney "leaves out important details or takes things out of context," we rate his statement Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-11307	"Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!"	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/18/scott-walker/record-low-unemployment-and-record-high-number-peo/	Two favorite boasts of Republican Scott Walker in his bid for a third term as governor are about unemployment and the number of people working in Wisconsin. He doubled down in this April 4, 2018 tweet, declaring: Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH! We’ll check the two statistics. But more importantly, as voters begin to ponder the November 2018 election, we’ll also examine Walker’s insistence that both are due to his reforms. The figures Wisconsin’s estimated unemployment rate dipped to 2.9 percent in February 2018, the lowest ever, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, citing the latest figures available when Walker posted his tweet. The article noted that the figures came from a state Department of Workforce Development report that was based on preliminary estimates from a monthly survey with sparse sample sizes and was subject to revision. The same Journal Sentinel article reported that in February 2018, the state also set a record for the total number of people employed, with 3.07 million. It’s worth noting that when Walker previously claimed, in June 2016, that more people were employed in Wisconsin than ever before, we rated his statement Mostly True, noting it didn’t take into account population growth. Now to the role of Walker’s reforms. Walker’s argument Walker’s campaign cited a number of policies that it links to the two statistics, including these. Tax, regulation cuts: In 2015, roughly midway into Walker’s time as governor, University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Noah Williams credited Walker’s reductions in taxes and regulations for the favorable unemployment labor participation rates. Williams was described at the time as an informal adviser to Walker’s 2016 presidential campaign. Manufacturing/agriculture credit: An April 2017 study by the same economist argued that the credit, which took effect in 2013, has "accounted for a total gain" of 42,000 jobs. Food stamp change: More than 25,000 people, according to Walker’s Department of Health Services, gained employment after completing job training that was required under new rules imposed by the Walker administration. To be sure, Wisconsin hasn’t always had high marks during Walker’s tenure. In comparison to other states, Wisconsin hasn’t fared well in rankings for job creation and new business creation. And the job growth wasn’t enough to meet Walker’s promise to create 250,000 jobs during his first term. A governor’s limited role As we’ve noted repeatedly in previous fact checks, the economy is affected by many factors, including national ones, and a governor plays an important -- but only limited -- role in a state’s economy. Marquette University economics professor James McGibany reiterated that to us in assessing Walker’s claim. McGibany said it’s very difficult to tease out how many jobs were created solely because of a policy change, or changes. For example, he said some of the increase in Wisconsin manufacturing jobs during Walker’s tenure is likely due to the overall economy recovering from the 2008-’09 recession. Similarly, some people who had been on food stamps and later found work likely did so because of the overall improvement in the economy, not specifically because of job training requirements. Moreover, McGibany said, low unemployment and high labor participation are being seen in most of the Midwest, including in states governed by Democrats as well as Republicans. "The point is," he said, "what is going on in Wisconsin is not the exception, but the rule for most of our neighboring states." Indeed, even Walker himself has acknowledged there are multiple factors at work. For example, when asked about a week before his tweet why Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is so low, he said it is "a combination of things -- the biggest thanks for that are to the hard-working employers of the state, because I understand that government doesn’t create jobs, people do … what we did was help create a better business climate." Our rating Walker says: "Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!" Walker is correct on the two statistics. But his various reforms can only be considered to be a contributing factor, at most, given many factors that affect the state’s economy. We rate Walker’s statement Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2018-04-18T06:00:00	2018-04-04	['None']

pomt-07839	Says Milwaukee County elected officials drive around in luxury cars "on your dime."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/14/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/	A major theme of philanthropist Chris Abele’s campaign for Milwaukee County executive has been a promise to crack down on the perks of taxpayer-paid cell phones and cars by "politicians and bureaucrats." The candidate has repeated the pledge in a television ad and -- most prominently -- in a direct mail piece to voters. That piece features two large photos of a Lincoln Town Car, bearing the license plate "U-PAY", parked in front of the county courthouse. The words above the cover photo: "They’re driving on your dime." Inside, there is this statement: "Milwaukee County politicians and bureaucrats think they can drive and run up cell phone bills on your dime while our county suffers. I don’t. It’s time to cut the perks and change business as usual." That statement is presented as a direct quote from Abele. To underline the pledge, Abele’s name is listed below it (albeit with his first name misspelled). With the direct mail piece coming on top of the ad, it got us wondering about the perks, especially the snazzy cars. (A second piece echoes the first, but features a cell phone with the words "They are dialing on your dime.") Just how many politicians are driving around in them? We asked Abele spokesman Brandon Lorenz which officials have their car on the chopping block. "The county executive has a car," said Lorenz. "If elected, Chris will cut it." He’s referring to a 2006 Chevy Impala that’s kept at the Courthouse Annex for use by the county executive. Latest records show it has about 23,000 miles on it. Under former County Executive Scott Walker, now the governor, some 2,032 miles were put on it from June of 2009 to June of 2010. How much is it worth? Edmunds.com, a car pricing service, pegs the trade-in value of that make and model at $9,400 -- assuming it’s in good condition and has a better than average option package. But what about all the other cars? After all, the ad and fliers suggest there is plenty of money to be saved by cutting them. We located a Nov. 19, 2010 report to the County Board that lists all county passenger vehicles used by employees, other than those within the Sheriff’s Department. Aside from the county executive’s car, the only other one for an elected official on the list is a 2003 Ford Crown Victoria assigned to the district attorney. The DA is allowed to keep the Crown Vic -- another model frequently used as a squad car -- at his home to respond to crime scenes. The list also includes a variety of delivery vans, SUVs and so forth, including about 10 vehicles that workers use to cart critters around at the zoo. No Lincoln Town Cars were listed. At Milwaukee City Hall, aldermen receive a monthly "car allowance." But county supervisors (as well as judges, and most other elected county officials) receive no such perk. Let’s complete our visit to the motor pool. Abele has promised to slash perks enjoyed by county politicians and bureaucrats. Outside of the Sheriff’s Department, two elected officials have county-funded cars; one, the top prosecutor, has his for emergency use and is not targeted by Abele.That narrows Abele’s car-cutting target to one vehicle: a five year old Impala that’s worth less than $10,000. That’s a drop in the billion dollar budget. There’s a bit of truth here … Of the more than 75 county elected officials, at least two have access to a car that’s paid for by taxpayers. But the argument Abele is making -- that he’ll cut lavish perks to save hardworking taxpayers a bunch of money -- comes up flat. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08423	"Mark Kirk: Lied about going to war. Opposed middle class tax cuts. And said unemployment’s not that big an issue."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/19/alexi-giannoulias/alexi-giannoulias-attacks-mark-kirk-oon-issue-tax-/	In the Illinois Senate race between Democrat Alexi Giannoulias and five-term Republican Congressman Mark Kirk, negative attacks have been flying from the get-go. The intensity and frequency of those attacks has only increased as the election moves into the home stretch. In his latest ad called "My Left Foot," Giannoulias makes three quick claims about his opponent, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk. According to the voice-over, "Mark Kirk: Lied about going to war. Opposed middle-class tax cuts. And said unemployment’s not that big an issue." The ad then features a parade of man-on-the-street comments disparaging Kirk, ending with a woman who says of Kirk, "I would not trust him with my left shoe." So that's how the ad got its name. We'll go over each of the claims in order. "Mark Kirk lied about going to war." Mark Kirk's misstatements about his military record have been a campaign issue for months. Kirk has admitted to being "careless" with facts about his military record on a number of occasions, and we have checked several of them out at PolitiFact. But it's also true that Kirk has had a fairly distinguished military record. He has served in the Naval Reserve for 21 years as an intelligence officer and currently holds the rank of commander. In 1999, Kirk was called into active duty and deployed to Aviano, Italy, in support of Operation Allied Force, the war in Kosovo. He was the team leader for an ad-hoc intelligence team used to support air combat operations during Kosovo. Commanding officers raved about his "phenomenal performance" and described Kirk as "a natural and charismatic leader" and "head and shoulders above any intelligence officer I have ever met." Elected to Congress in 2001, Kirk has continued his military service, which included two two-week training stints in Afghanistan, in late 2008 and 2009. According to Navy records, Kirk has been awarded two Navy Marine Corps Commendation Medals, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation, a National Defense Service Medal, a Navy E Ribbon and a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. But Kirk first drew scrutiny when he claimed he was the Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year. It turns out he didn't win that award. Rather, in 2000, the National Military Intelligence Association awarded the intelligence unit led by Kirk the Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Navy Reserve Intelligence Award, which honors exceptional achievement by outstanding intelligence professionals. And Kirk was tapped to physically accept the award at the National Military Intelligence Association’s annual awards banquet. Kirk has since acknowledged that he incorrectly referred to himself as the "Intelligence Officer of the Year." "Most importantly, I wasn't thinking," Kirk said in a press conference. "This was a carelessness that did not reflect well upon me." At other times, Kirk and his campaign literature have described him as "a veteran of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Enduring Freedom." He actually served as an intelligence officer stateside in Maryland as a reservist during both operations. The Kirk campaign later changed his record to read that he served "during" the operations. His service in Afghanistan consisted of two two-week training sessions. Giannoulias also has repeatedly criticized Kirk for once claiming, "The last time I was in Iraq, I was in uniform flying, and the Iraqi air defense network was shooting at us." In 2000, Kirk trained with a squadron based in Turkey and flew over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch, enforcing a no-fly zone in the northern part of the country. In a June 4, 2010, interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Kirk later clarified "that while he heard reports of enemy fire, he cannot be sure his plane was ever fired on in Iraq or Kosovo." "I want to be very contrite and say there is a casualness with which I sometimes describe military details," Kirk told the Sun-Times. "And if it gave the impression that my military record is larger than it was, I want to apologize." Okay, but what about the claim in the latest Giannoulias ad, that Kirk "lied about going to war." In the background, an out-of-focus Mark Kirk appears to be saluting a crowd. On the screen, it states, "Mark Kirk 'lied' about going to war" and sources it to a June 2, 2010, story in Newsweek. We checked out the Newsweek story and it does, indeed, allege that Kirk "lied." But the story doesn't claim Kirk lied "about going to war." Rather, it calls Kirk out for "explicitly, officially, and falsely claiming to have won the U.S. Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year award for service during NATO's conflict with Serbia." Misspeaking about an award you won is different that lying about going to war (a la Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat running for the Senate in Connecticut, who repeatedly said he served "in Vietnam" instead of "during Vietnam"). One could make a strong case that Kirk has been too loose with the facts about having served in Iraq and Afghanistan -- he did two two-week training stints in Afghanistan -- but he has served during combat, in Kosovo. More importantly, when the ad puts "lied" in quotes, and prominently cites a specific Newsweek story, the implication is that the story claims -- as the ad says -- that Kirk "lied about going to war." The article says Kirk lied about being the Intelligence Officer of the year. That's different. And so we rate the claim Barely True. The second claim in the ad is that Kirk "opposed middle-class tax cuts." In case you missed the small print in the ad, it reads "Vote 70, Feb. 13, 2009." What is Vote 70 in the 111th Congress? The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, aka the economic stimulus package. Republicans criticizing the stimulus often ignore the fact that nearly a third of it -- $288 billion -- was for various tax cuts. And one of the biggest tax cuts was aimed squarely at the middle class. The Making Work Pay provision provided a refundable credit of 6.2 percent of earned income, up to $400 for individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns in 2009 and 2010. Making Work Pay was estimated to benefit about 110 million working Americans -- most of them middle class -- at a cost of about $116 billion. And Kirk voted against the stimulus. So does that mean Kirk opposed middle-class tax cuts? We think that's misleading. The stimulus was, of course, not just an up or down vote on Making Work Pay tax credits. The Making Work Pay tax credits made up less than a fifth of the overall, $787 billion cost of the massive economic stimulus bill, which included $275 billion on spending projects such as new roads, bridges and high-speed rail and $224 billion worth of payments to state governments for things such as hiring teachers and police officers and for services such as extended unemployment insurance and health coverage. On Kirk's campaign website, it notes that "Congressman Kirk voted against the stimulus because it wasted money on big government spending programs." The campaign website also claims Kirk has voted to cut taxes more than 40 times. We're not going to get into all those votes, but there's no evidence that Kirk opposed the middle-class tax cuts; he opposed the overall stimulus. And so we rate this claim Barely True. Last is the claim that Kirk "said unemployment’s not that big an issue." That seems an odd claim given that Kirk has a whole section in the "Issues" section of his campaign website called "Getting Illinois Working Again." The page outlines Kirk's philosophy of lowering taxes, reducing borrowing and investing in things like alternative energy to "spur job creation." Agree or not with his ideas, the positions suggest that Kirk believes unemployment is a serious issue. So where does the Giannoulias ad's claim come from? The print in the background of the ad states, "Mark Kirk: Unemployment is not a 'big issue'." And then in small print, the ad sources a Roll Call story on June 16, 2008. The story was about a battle between Democrats and Republicans over a plan to extend unemployment benefits. Although the bill received some Republican support -- particularly from GOP senators in states hardest-hit by unemployment -- the plan was opposed by the Republican leadership and enough rank-and-file Republicans so that the bill did not have enough votes to override a veto from then President George W. Bush. Republican leaders said they favored an extension of unemployment benefits only in states with high unemployment and only for people who had worked for at least 20 weeks before being laid off. Here's the part of the Roll Call story that includes Kirk, who opposed the Democrats' plan: "I want to make sure that when you get extended unemployment benefits, you've been working for more than two weeks," he said. Kirk said the issue just isn't that big a deal in his district, where he said the unemployment rate is about 5.5 percent -- the same as the national rate. "I know that others think this is a big issue, but I've heard very little," he said. "I have a very high-income district." On its website, the Kirk campaign responded to a similar claim made by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee -- that Kirk had callously claimed unemployment wasn't a big issue -- by pointing out that the article is more than two years old, and that the comment came when unemployment stood at 5.5 percent (it's now at 9.6 percent). The Kirk campaign also noted that Kirk voted to extend unemployment benefits numerous times between 2002 and 2010, and "Mark Kirk has said he would vote to extend unemployment benefits again if the legislation did not add to the debt or raise taxes." This past July, however, Kirk again voted against a bill to extend unemployment benefits, saying, "I opposed the last one because there was no effort to offset the cost. It just added $30 billion straight to the deficit." The Giannoulias campaign contends Kirk's comment in Roll Call was that unemployment isn't a big issue, but we think the fuller context of the article makes clear that Kirk is saying that extending unemployment benefits -- at that time -- was not "that big a deal" in his district. That's different than saying unemployment is not a big deal. We rate the claim Barely True. And that's how we rate the ad overall -- Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02460	"Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/24/matt-bevin/republican-challenger-matt-bevin-attacks-senate-mi/	Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell may have the backing of the National Rifle Association in his quest for a sixth term as Kentucky’s U.S. Senator, but his Republican primary opponent insists McConnell is weak on Second Amendment issues. Businessman Matt Bevin released a 15-second TV ad on Feb. 19, 2014, that not only attacked McConnell’s record on guns, but claimed McConnell’s positions were closely aligned with his Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. "Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights," the ad said. "Matt Bevin always support the Second Amendment. The choice is clear." We were surprised to see McConnell attacked on his support of the Second Amendment, having just won the "Defender of Freedom" award from the NRA. So we took a deeper dive into this ad to see what it’s getting at. Dissecting the 1991 crime bill The ad isn’t referencing the gun debate of the last two years — or even of the last two decades. Instead, Bevin’s campaign points to a Senate vote from 1991, when McConnell was just starting his second term in office, to support the claim. Back then, President George H.W. Bush sent an anti-crime bill to Congress that would "toughen a number of laws to cover more violent crimes and would impose the death penalty for certain federal offenses," according to a Boston Globe report from the time. Democrats, who controlled both chambers of Congress, were critical of the bill for not addressing ownership of assault weapons and other gun control measures. And though Bush called for the bill to be passed within 100 days, a contentious showdown ensued. The Senate version of the bill, called the Violent Crime Control Act of 1991 and proposed by then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., included an assault weapons ban from the outset and a seven-day waiting period to purchase handguns. The sprawling bill also sent $1 billion to local law enforcement agencies and courts, and expanded mandatory minimum sentencing and use of the death penalty. Senators filed hundreds of amendments to the legislation. Two of the most controversial dealt with gun ownership. A compromise measure shrunk the waiting period to purchase a handgun to five days and laid out parameters for a speedy federal background check. It passed with significant Republican support. But not from McConnell, who opposed any wait period on background checks, his campaign said. The Kentucky senator joined 23 Republicans and eight Democrats to vote against the five-day waiting period. (Reid voted for the measure). The other notable amendment was an NRA-backed measure that would have completely eliminated the waiting period to buy handguns. Before the vote, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a proponent of the amendment, told his colleagues, "Everybody here better understand this is the key vote" that will tell whether "you're either for or against the Second Amendment right to buy arms." McConnell voted for the NRA’s amendment. Reid did as well. But it did not pass, only mustering 44 votes. The vote that Bevin’s ad singled out was neither of those, but a vote on final passage of the Senate version of the omnibus crime bill, which passed 71-36. McConnell joined Reid in voting for the measure. McConnell also voted to invoke cloture and end debate on the bill earlier in the day. McConnell’s campaign said he only backed the bill because he supported the tougher sentences and money for local police, and to push the bill into a conference committee with the House, where he hoped the gun measures would be removed. Bevin’s campaign said that "is the classic Washington way of pretending you are against something in your state, but support the measure in Washington" and he should have worked to defeat the measure entirely. Killing the bill But in fact, McConnell did work to defeat the final bill. Though the Senate crime bill had support from President Bush, House and Senate Democrats and Republicans couldn’t agree to a comprehensive measure in the conference committee. Instead, the Democratic majority forced through a bill that had less bipartisan support. The conference bill passed the House by two votes but stalled in the Senate for the rest of 1991 and 1992 under the threat of veto from Bush. With a filibuster in place, Senate Democrats couldn’t reach the 60 votes needed to pass the bill, despite three attempts, in part because the compromise bill had tighter gun restrictions. All three times the bill came up for a cloture vote to end debate, McConnell voted against it. Reid, however, voted to invoke cloture twice and once did not vote at all. So that was 1991. In 2013, McConnell held his caucus firmly together against attempts to restrict and regulate gun purchases after the December 2012 Connecticut school shooting at Newtown. The Senate failed to reach the 60 votes needed on measures to expand background checks on gun purchases, to ban assault weapons and to restrict high capacity magazines. McConnell voted no each time and under his stewardship, Republicans blocked the bills from passing. Reid voted in favor of the assault weapon and high capacity magazine bans. He voted against the expanded background checks, a procedural move that allowed him to bring the amendment up for vote again in the future. Our ruling Bevin’s ad says "Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights." The ad focuses on a vote McConnell took more than 22 years ago on a massive crime bill that included dozens of votes and amendments and didn’t even pass Congress. The law failed, with McConnell voting against it, and Reid voting for it. On amendments, McConnell sided with firearm lobbyists when a closely watched provision came up for a vote. The only evidence the Bevin campaign offered was that McConnell voted to advance the bill to a conference committee (as did Reid), but that was a brief point in the legislative process. To hang this attack on a handful of long-ago votes — when he much more recently helped kill gun control legislation — is absurd. So overall, Bevin’s add goes back to 1991 to cherry-pick votes and make it seem like McConnell and Reid were on the same side. Actually, McConnell repeatedly voted against the 1991 bill, on both its gun restrictions and the overall measure. The claim that McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe gun rights is contradicted by many other votes, both then and now. The claim is not only wrong, but ridiculous, and we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Matt Bevin	None	None	None	2014-02-24T14:53:50	2014-02-19	['Harry_Reid', 'Mitch_McConnell']
pomt-01227	Keystone XL allows "Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/20/barack-obama/obama-says-keystone-xl-exporting-oil-experts-disag/	President Barack Obama and many other Democrats think there’s little to be gained by building the Keystone XL pipeline. On Nov. 18, Senate Democrats voted down a proposal to build the oil pipeline -- which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to Texas' coast.. But the issue isn’t going anywhere. When the new Republican-led Senate takes over in January, it will likely be at the top of their priorities list. Obama and other Keystone critics have argued that the pipeline would have a negative environmental impact, while having little benefit for the United States. For example, constructing the pipeline would result in few permanent American jobs. "Understand what this project is," Obama said at a Nov. 14 press conference in Burma. "It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else. That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices." Two days later, in Brisbane, Australia, Obama described Keystone XL as "a pipeline shipping Canadian oil to world markets, not to the United States." Predicting the effect of the pipeline on gas prices is a little tricky. Experts tend to agree that it could impact gas prices, but the effect would be indirect and minimal. But in this fact check, we’re going to focus on the export question -- whether or not, as Obama said, Keystone XL’s primary destination is beyond the United States. We found that Obama’s off the mark. Crude oil In recent years, the United States has become a net-exporter of refined oil products, like gasoline, jet fuel and asphalt (meaning it exports more products than it imports), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, it is a net-importer of the crude oil it uses to make those products. Keystone XL would transport crude oil from Canada’s tar sands through the Midwestern United States down to the Gulf Coast, and there are refineries all along the proposed route. (The map is from TransCanada, the pipeline operator.) America gets more crude oil from Canada than any other country. Nearly all of Canada’s exports go to the United States, and this accounts for about a third of America’s total crude oil imports. Much of its oil already makes it to the United States by rail and existing pipelines. We asked several energy economics experts, and they believe that quite a bit -- if not most -- of the Keystone XL crude oil will be bought and used by American refineries. "It’s difficult to say with any certainty, but it is most likely that most would be refined in the U.S.," said Kenneth Medlock, an expert in energy economics at Rice University in Texas. A recent State Department report argues that it would not be "economically justified" for Canada to primarily export its Keystone XL oil to countries other than the United States, when there are plenty of American refineries to consume it. Some independent refineries -- particularly those in the upper Midwest, but also in Texas -- are in desperate need of crude oil, said Charles Ebinger, a senior fellow in energy security at the Brookings Institution. Currently, the refineries have to import crude from places like Venezuela and Mexico -- though it would be cheaper and better for overall energy security to buy from a North American source, rather than pay high transport costs. On Nov. 17, TransCanada told Reuters, it "makes no business sense for our customers to transport oil down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, pay to export it overseas but then pay to transport millions of barrels of higher-priced oil back to the U.S. refineries to create the products we rely on." Ebinger added that many American refineries are geared to use heavy crude, which is what Keystone would transport from Canada’s tar sands. There would, though, likely be oil coming through the Keystone XL pipeline in excess of what the American refineries would be able to use, noted Eric Smith, an energy economist at Tulane University. This excess oil could go to other countries capable of refining it. Still, most Keystone oil would stay in North America. Refined products Some Keystone XL critics have focused on the fact that American refineries could export some of the products they make with the Canadian crude oil, such as gasoline, diesel fuel or asphalt. They argue that because products made in the United States, using Keystone XL oil, will leave the country, the pipeline wouldn’t improve domestic energy security or independence. Anti-Keystone XL environmental group Tar Sands Action (part of the larger 350.org) said in a Keystone XL fact sheet, that American refineries will process the oil but, "much of the fuel refined from the pipeline’s heavy crude oil will never reach U.S. drivers’ tanks." However, American oil refineries’ product exports are "not sensitive" to the addition of a new pipeline, the State Department study says. Export trends are more dependent on demand -- both domestically and abroad -- as well as the cost of natural gas and foreign refining capacity. American oil refineries are already increasing their exports, and that trend could continue independent of Keystone XL. "Refined product export levels have already increased and some of the crude used is from foreign sources," the report says. "As this may already be occurring, it may continue with or without (Keystone XL)." Further, the report says, "The economic viability of exports does increase the demand for crudes in the United States," but, "this demand does not depend on the proposed project." Even if exports are increasing, the majority of oil products refined in the United States stay in the United States. For example, in 2013, Gulf Coast area refineries produced about 946,000 barrels of finished motor gasoline per day. They exported about one-third of that -- 323,000 barrels per day. In January, Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker looked at an ad by liberal PAC NextGen Climate that said, "(China is) counting on the U.S. to approve TransCanada’s pipeline to ship oil through America’s heartland and out to foreign countries like theirs." A spokesman for NextGen told Fact Checker that they were referring to refined product exports, rather than crude oil. Fact Checker gave the ad its lowest rating of Four Pinocchios. Even if Keystone XL isn’t built, experts said Canada will find other ways to transport their oil to the United States. Canada already sends crude from the oil sands into the United States by rail and other pipelines. "I have no doubt that Canada will develop alternate means of monetizing its crude oil, whether that be via expanded rail shipments or by building pipelines to one or both of its coasts," Smith said. The longer that politicians debate Keystone XL, the more time Canada has to figure out these alternate means. "Keystone XL is rapidly becoming irrelevant," said Michelle Foss, energy economist at the University of Texas’ Bureau of Economic Geology. Our ruling Obama said, Keystone XL allows "Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else." The general consensus among experts, as well as the State Department, is that American refineries would be the primary buyers of crude oil transported through the Keystone XL pipeline, by a vast margin. Some Keystone XL critics have a point that American refineries would likely export some of the products that they make with crude oil transported by the pipeline. The State Department says, however, that product exports are already increasing, and that trend would likely continue independent of a new pipeline. Additionally, American refineries tend to keep more products in the country than they export. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-07048	"Protesters caused $7.5 million in damage to the Wisconsin State House"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/30/dan-kapanke/wisconsin-sen-dan-kapanke-says-protesters-caused-7/	As the unprecedented nine Senate recall elections approach, the red alert has been sounded by state Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse) Facing a challenge from state Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), Kapanke issued an appeal June 28, 2011to subscribers to the National Tea Party Alert email service, seeking support and contributions. In the email appeal, which came from his campaign office under his signature, Kapanke warns "if we do not win here, liberals will be emboldened to try this recall tactic in states across the country." The email says "The unprecedented damage and intimidation union protesters caused in Wisconsin this year isn’t over." It lays out four "facts you may not know about the impact unions have had in Wisconsin." Among them, this headline: "Protesters caused $7.5 million in damage to the Wisconsin State House." Beneath it: "Union protesters who swarmed the State House and climbed through windows in an attempt to disrupt the people’s business caused millions in damage in the process." We’ve been down this path before. Since the protests began, PolitiFact Wisconsin has rated seven statements about the conduct of protesters and claims of damage at the Capitol. One was Half True, one Barely True, one False, and four were Pants on Fire. The Pants on Fire category included one from Kapanke, in which he claimed protesters damaged the windshield of his car. Madison police said it was likely due to a pebble on the highway. And it also includes a March 3, 2011 claim by Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch who said protesters caused $7.5 million damage to the Capitol. That’s the same claim Kapanke is making now. The evidence for Huebsch’s claim -- which was almost immediately retracted -- was a single page, handwritten estimate. The state later paid $13,800 to historic preservation architect Charles Quagliana to assess the impact of weeks of protests on the Capitol and its grounds. His report said the damages resulted in $270,000 in wear and tear to the building. He cited unintended damage such as nicks and chips to stone, as well as stains to stone from skin oils (such as from hands), residue from tape used to hang signs and a few marker stains. "Essentially the building experienced three to five years of wear within a two-week period," Quagliana wrote. We asked Kapanke’s campaign about the $7.5 million claim. "We issued a correction on that," said campaign manager Jennifer Harrington, adding the campaign staff dug up a March 3, 2011 JSOnline blog post based on the original claim. But later blog posts and the March 4, 2011 Journal Sentinel article shot down the estimate. The March 4 story included a tour of the Capitol with state officials who said they saw very little obvious damage. They estimated that a cleanup would cost $347,000 if outside specialists were not needed -- an estimate that also turned out to be high. "Our guys were referencing the original article," Harrington said. "For whatever reason, nobody caught it." Kapanke did not respond to requests for comment. The campaign said an emailed correction had been sent to the tea party group, which sent the original solicitation to its members. Here’s what the Kapanke campaign posted on its website in an attempt to straighten it all out: "The estimated costs, including security, are in the millions of dollars but are not expected to reach the estimate referenced in the Journal Sentinel. Any costs to the taxpayers that are unnecessary such as damages to public property or recall elections hurt Wisconsin." But that statement mixes apples (damages) with oranges (the cost of security) and strawberries (the cost of the recalls, which include three led by Republicans against Democratic senators). A May 13, 2011 estimate said it cost $7.8 million to bring in police officers from around the state to handle the Capitol protests. The report says that figure is expected to grow because the estimate does not include overtime. But Kapanke’s original solicitation never mentioned security costs. So where does that leave us ... again? Kapanke’s campaign staff cited a March news account with a wildly inflated estimate of damage to the Capitol. That estimate was almost immediately withdrawn, and then reduced to $272,000 -- a fraction of the original estimate. The campaign acknowledged its mistake. Yet its revised statement changed the nature of the claim, broadening it from a claim solely about physical damage to the building. It’s starting to smell like a whole bunch of grills on a holiday weekend. We rated an earlier $7.5 million Capitol damage claim Pants on Fire. This one, too.

pomt-02438	Says "by 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/28/louise-slaughter/louise-slaughter-tweets-four-five-black-and-hispan/	President Barack Obama recently announced a new initiative that was close to his heart: a national effort to close achievement gaps and create opportunities for minority boys. "My Brothers Keeper," unveiled at the White House on Feb. 27, 2014, combines philanthropy and research to help move young men of color from the streets into schools and the workforce. "I'm going to pen this presidential memorandum directing the federal government not to spend more money, but to do things smarter, to determine what we can do right now to improve the odds for boys and young men of color, and make sure our agencies are working more effectively with each other, with those businesses, with those philanthropies and with local communities to implement proven solutions," Obama said at the White House launch event. Many Democrats in Congress voiced their support for Obama’s push to help young minorities. Among them was Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who joined the cause on Twitter. "By 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels," she tweeted. It’s an eye-opening statistic, and one that spoke to Obama’s new effort. But is it accurate? The Nation’s Report Card When we contacted Slaughter’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a White House fact sheet with an almost identical claim: "Large disparities remain in reading proficiency, with 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys reading below proficiency levels by the fourth grade – compared to 58 percent of white boys reading below proficiency levels." In turn, the White House said the numbers came from The Nation’s Report Card, a federal assessment conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress has tracked student achievement in such subjects as reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, and by a variety of demographics, including race. Broadly, proficiency is defined by the government as students being "able to integrate and interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text to draw conclusions and make evaluations." According to the 2013 report card, there is a significant disparity between white and minority students in math and reading scores at the fourth-grade level. While 46 percent of white students were proficient in reading, just 18 percent of black students and 20 percent of Hispanics meet the same benchmark. For each group, those numbers have risen quite a bit since 1990, when 16 percent of white fourth-graders were reading at a proficient level, compared to just 1 percent of blacks and 5 percent of Hispanics. Gaps in mathematic scores have been similar. Meanwhile, Asian/Pacific Islanders outpace all races and ethnicities in both reading and math in the fourth grade. It’s also worth noting that there’s no improvement in proficiency levels by the time students finish the eighth grade. Similar numbers of students start behind and stay behind. But Slaughter’s tweet specified black boys in particular. To get those statistics, we had to dive deeper into the report. Using the government’s data, we found that 14 percent of black boys and 18 percent of Hispanic boys read at a proficient level in the fourth grade. This means that 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys were not proficient. So Slaughter’s numbers are right on. By contrast, about 58 percent of white boys are considered proficient. And what about girls? They perform slightly better across all races than boys. Our ruling Slaughter said that "by 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency level." Government data backs up that depressing statistic, though it’s worth noting that the U.S. has at least seen improvements across all races since the early 1990s. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12811	"Just last year, alone, 710 police officers" were assaulted in New York state.	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/feb/11/martin-golden/police-assaults-new-york-have-decreased-recent-yea/	A bipartisan push in Albany would classify offenses against first responders and law enforcement officers as hate crimes. The Community Heroes Protection Act would also toughen the sentences for those convicted. State Sen. Martin J. Golden, a Republican from Brooklyn and co-sponsor of the bill, said the number of assaults on police officers in New York state should convince his colleagues to support the effort. "The numbers show this law is definitely needed," Golden said. "Just last year, alone, 710 police officers - this is just police officers - were assaulted in this state." Is Golden right? Were that many police officers assaulted last year? Data from the FBI The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported the number of law enforcement officers killed and assaulted in the United States since 1972. The FBI defines a law enforcement officer as a local, state, and federal public authority who ordinarily carries a badge and a firearm. The report does not include attacks on correctional officers or emergency responders, though they are included in the proposed legislation. The bureau reported 710 assaults on New York state law enforcement officers in 2015, the latest data available. That’s the lowest number since 2007, when 656 officers were assaulted. The FBI's New York state number, however, is not a statewide figure. It only includes assaults on law enforcement officers outside New York City. The agency said it does not have data for reported assaults on law enforcement officers in New York City. Data from the NYPD The New York City Police Department reports its own data on police assaults, but it defines officers more broadly. The Police Department tracks assaults on police officers, peace officers, prosecutors, nurses, sanitation workers, firefighters, paramedics, city marshals, school crossing guards, traffic agents and emergency responders. The department said it does not report solely the number of assaults on law enforcement officers. Last year the department reported 1,632 assaults on people within the department's definition. That’s down from 2015, when 1,738 assaults were reported. Our ruling Golden said, "Just last year alone, 710 police officers … were assaulted in this state." Golden relied on FBI data that does not include assaults on officers from New York City. Golden undercounted, but his point is not lost: The number of reported assaults on law enforcement officers is significant. His statement needs clarification and additional information.

The decades have done little to ease those concerns. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office reported that in the year before, oil and gas companies took in revenues of $66 billion and paid $10 billion to the government. Onshore leases in particular have not kept pace with the times, according to the GAO. The conservation group Center for Western Priorities took up this banner with an intriguing comparison on its website. "Oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac," the center wrote. The going price for a Big Mac, without the fries and the drink, is $3.99. We decided to check whether you can lease an acre of federal land for less than that. Greg Zimmerman, the policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, sent us a link to a September 2014 sales report from the Nevada office of the Bureau of Land Management. The numbers back up Zimmerman’s claim. Texas-based Appaloosa Energy paid $6,426 for the rights to drill on 3,212 acres. Buena Vista Holdings out of Colorado paid $11,392 for the rights to 5,693 acres. That comes out to $2 per acre, and even the mathematically challenged can see that is about half the price of a Big Mac. Under BLM regulations, $2 per acre is the minimum possible bid. Just to be clear, the company pays this money each year for the right to pump oil or gas from the land over a 10-year period. It doesn’t actually own the land, but it has locked down the oil and gas rights. Zimmerman acknowledges that there is another wrinkle here. There’s an additional $1.50 per acre fee for the first five years. Zimmerman described it as the cost to hold the land while the company assesses what to do with it. A BLM spokesman told PunditFact that the bidder would pay $1.50 per year for the first five years and then $2.00 a year for the next five. "Nevertheless, even if you add the $1.50 per acre rent to the $2.00 per acre bid, it would still be less than a Big Mac," Zimmerman said. If the land ever starts producing oil or gas, the company starts paying royalties to the government on top of the $2 per acre leasing fee. It’s important to note that the statement simply said oil companies can obtain an acre for very little money. It doesn’t say this happens a lot. When we ran the numbers for all of 2014, we found that the average price per acre nationwide was $220. That was for parcels leased through a competitive auction. If a parcel finds no takers through competitive bidding, the government can offer it non-competitively. One time, that led to a winning bid of about $1.50 per acre. From what we could find, the lowest lease prices were all in Nevada. Brad Posey is a managing director for Appaloosa Energy, a company that successfully secured the right to a few thousand acres at a cost of $2 each. Posey said the property comes with many hurdles before any wells can be drilled. "That land has so many restrictions on it," Posey said. "There are the prairie chickens, and habitat. A very limited portion can be explored on." Posey is correct about the land. A proposed resource management plan for the entire area puts a number of conditions on development. It protects municipal water supplies, grazing areas and trails for off-road trail riding. And animals. "These areas contain some of the most important habitat remaining for sage-grouse and other at-risk wildlife," the plan said. Posey called the venture "pure wildcat speculation." This raises the question, if it’s such a long shot, why is the land worth even $2 an acre? Because, as another Appaloosa managing director Martin Shields explained, sometimes an unpromising bit of land surprises you. "Many years ago, I was with a company that paid the $2 minimum and it paid off," Shields said. We asked Zimmerman if he knew of any land that went for $2 an acre that ever produced oil or gas. Zimmerman said he did not know of any case when it did. Our ruling The Center for Western Priorities said that oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac. A Big Mac goes for $3.99. Thousands of acres of land in Nevada were leased for $2 per acre in 2014. We found one case where federal land went for about $1.50 an acre. The track record on land leased at those low rates ever producing oil or gas is quite poor and the average leasing price nationwide is $220 per acre. The claim is accurate but it downplays that companies pay a hundred times as much for land that is more likely to be productive. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-00059	"If Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida. He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/nov/02/priorities-usa-action/democrats-cherry-pick-attack-gov-rick-scotts-immig/	An attack ad on Facebook features a Hispanic family sitting around the dinner table, bemoaning Gov. Rick Scott’s immigration policies. "This is our family, but if Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida," said the narrator. "He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S. Families belong together. Rick Scott turned his back on ours." Two Democratic groups, Priorities USA Action and the Senate Majority PAC, paid for the ad and placed it on a Facebook page, Nuestra Florida, which translates to Our Florida. Scott, a Republican two-term governor, is challenging Democrat U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. The lead-in text above the video offers a hint that the reference was to past statements by Scott (emphasis ours): "Rick Scott vowed to implement racial profiling laws in Florida and wanted to exclude Dreamers from citizenship." But this attack amounts to cherry-picking. Scott softened his stance on illegal immigration years ago and does not have those positions anymore. Did Scott encourage racial profiling of immigrants? This attack is misleading. The fine print shows it is in reference to a position Scott took during a GOP primary in 2010. The video cites a sentence from a 2010 TIME magazine article about the Florida 2010 governor’s race. It says, "Scott favors Arizona’s draconian anti-illegal-immigration law." Scott did promise then to bring a law similar to Arizona’s SB 1070 to Florida. The 2010 Arizona law made being an undocumented immigrant a state crime and required legal immigrants to carry papers to confirm their legal status. Critics said it would lead to racial profiling, prompting state officials to add to the law that police "may not consider race, color or national origin." Scott argued in 2010 that the law wasn’t racial profiling and said, "I clearly don't believe in racial profiling." But Scott never pushed for such a law after he was elected, breaking his promise. A spokesman for Priorities USA Action said the result shouldn’t matter to people who saw the Facebook post. "We say that he vowed to implement laws like Arizona," Priorities USA Action spokesman Josh Schwerin said. "Just because he didn’t get it done doesn’t mean he didn’t pledge to do it." In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court found parts of the Arizona law unconstitutional but upheld the central requirement calling on officers to check the status of people they suspect were undocumented immigrants. Exclude Dreamers from citizenship? This attack zeroes in on Scott’s statements against Dreamers early in his tenure. It, too, ignores that his more recent position is more favorable to this group of immigrants. Dreamers are immigrants brought over to the U.S. illegally by their parents when they were children. Just weeks before he took office, Scott spoke against a DREAM Act bill in Congress. "I'm against the Dream Act," he said in December 2010. "Why? I don't believe in amnesty." In 2013, Scott vetoed a bill to let Dreamers get driver’s licenses. Scott criticized the Obama administration’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals as a policy "absent congressional direction." (DACA allowed these illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status — Trump later rescinded it.) Scott also argued that the Florida driver’s license bill was unnecessary because those with a federal employment authorization card could already obtain a temporary driver license. But in 2014 as he was seeking re-election, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition. "Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition," he said. That was a Full Flop from 2011 when he said "with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants I completely oppose it." In September 2017, when Trump was deciding whether to dismantle DACA, Scott issued a statement saying, "I do not favor punishing children for the actions of their parents." "These kids must be allowed to pursue the American Dream, and Congress must act on this immediately," he said. He elaborated on his point in a January 2018 USA Today calling for Congress to "secure the immigration status of Dreamers," a reference to Trump saying he would extend protections to Dreamers. Scott called on Congress to "do the right thing for these kids by removing the uncertainty hanging over their future goals and dreams." While an extension of deferred action is not the same as citizenship, it is clear that Scott moderated his view and became more open to Dreamers having a way to legally stay in the United States. Our ruling A Facebook ad by Democratic groups said, "If Rick Scott had his way he would encourage racially profiling immigrant communities here in Florida. He also opposed allowing Dreamers to remain in the U.S." This ad leaves viewers with the misleading impression that these are current Scott policies. Neither is true. Scott did promise in 2010 to bring Arizona’s immigration law to Florida. Immigration advocates feared the law would lead to racial profiling. Once Scott was elected, he never pursued the idea. Scott was a bit more active in his earlier opposition to allowing Dreamers to stay in the country, but that has also changed. He publicly objected to Obama’s deferred action program for people who came into the country illegally as children, saying Obama bypassed Congress. Scott also vetoed a bill to give Dreamers driver’s licenses. But in 2014, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition and in the past year he has spoken in favor of helping Dreamers. In total, the ad creates a misleading impression that Scott is anti-immigrant by only drawing on part of his record. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12926	"I have never lobbied against sanctions personally... to my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/12/rex-tillerson/tillerson-misleads-russian-sanctions-opposition/	U.S. senators grilled former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson about his past dealings with Russia at his recent confirmation hearing to become secretary of state. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked Tillerson whether he thought Vladimir Putin was a war criminal (Tillerson's answer: "I would not use that term"), while Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., pressed him on Exxon opposing sanctions against Russia. Senators have taken a hardline on Russia, both for its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine and its likely interference in the 2016 elections. Some, including Rubio, were keen supporters of economic sanctions against Russia in 2014. At that time, Exxon, with Tillerson at the helm, had struck joint venture deals with the Russian petro giant Rosneft to explore for oil across the country. Exxon estimated its exposure on those deals at $1 billion. Sanctions presented big problems for those investments. At his confirmation hearing on Jan. 11, 2017, Tillerson rejected the assertion that he ever tried to scuttle sanctions. "I have never lobbied against sanctions personally," Tillerson said. "To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions." That’s an artfully crafted answer that’s pretty misleading Government lobbying records show that in 2014 and 2015, Exxon paid the Nickles Group over $193,000 to press "issues related to Russian sanctions impacting the energy sector," along with a number of other matters. It paid another $120,000 in 2014 and 2015 to Avenue Solutions for work on a range of issues, including "energy sanctions in the Ukraine and Russia." In the same time frame, according to public logs, Tillerson visited the White House five times to see Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council. The meetings started about a week after President Barack Obama authorized the first of three rounds of sanctions. Bloomberg reported that Tillerson saw Treasury Secretary Jack Lew seven times in the second half of 2014. The Treasury Department oversees how sanctions are carried out. That seems to directly contradict Tillerson’s statement, but Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers told us it didn’t. "Exxon Mobil regularly engages with lawmakers and others to discuss the potential impact of sanctions and to express our view that sanctions should treat American companies fairly," Jeffers said. "We do not express an opinion as to whether or not sanctions should be imposed; that is a decision for policy makers." But at Exxon’s May 2014 shareholder meeting, Tillerson offered a more negative take on sanctions overall. He told reporters that sanctions are "imprecise and ineffective." and that "our views are being heard at the highest levels," he said, according to the Associated Press. Oil industry experts told us it’s hard to believe that Exxon wouldn’t have opposed the sanctions. Tadeusz Patzek is a professor and petroleum industry analyst at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Patzek thinks Tillerson is a good choice for secretary of state, but he also said Exxon’s interests in Russia were quite clear. "Russia is the last global frontier with big untapped oil resources that could be made available to Exxon," Patzek said. "From this point of view, Exxon must have viewed the sanctions as unhelpful to the corporation." Tim LaPira, a political scientist who studies lobbying at James Madison University, told us Tillerson’s claim is "implausible." "The message of what sanctions would do would necessarily communicate that they were taking a clear position against them," LaPira said. "If Exxon Mobil hired expensive lobbyists to communicate about sanctions, but not the corporation's position against them, then it seems to me they used shareholders' money to accomplish exactly nothing." Government ethics advocate Jordan Libowitz with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said, "I doubt they would lobby for a bill that essentially cost them $1 billion." Our ruling Tillerson said that he never lobbied against sanctions that targeted the Russian energy industry, nor to his knowledge had Exxon. But lobbying records show Exxon spent over $300,000 to argue its case on sanctions. Visitor records for the White House and the Treasury Department show Tillerson was a visitor when sanctions were being considered. An Exxon spokesperson said the company simply offered information on sanctions. But in 2014 Tillerson told reporters that he thought sanctions generally were ineffective and that he had let top government officials know what he thought of them.

pomt-03529	Says, "Oregon has the third largest class size in the nation."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/may/31/oregon-pta/does-oregon-have-third-largest-class-size-nation/	Advocates for school funding love to use statistics to draw attention to their cause and the Oregon PTA caught PolitiFact Oregon’s eye earlier this month with a juicy stat. In the group’s May 2013 newsletter, the PTA wrote that "Oregon has the third largest class size in the nation." With teacher layoffs in the headlines, we figured the state’s classrooms were probably experiencing some crowding, but third in the nation? We wanted to check that out. We asked Otto Schell, legislative director for the Oregon PTA, where the ranking came from. He said a 2013 report compiled by the National Education Association, the country’s largest teacher union, ranked Oregon third. "It’s a dubious honor to be in that top tier," Schell said. We looked it up and there was Oregon, ranked behind California and Utah. The NEA looked at the ratio of students to teachers to figure out the ranking. This isn’t the same as class size, which is different from the student-teacher ratio and is harder to measure. The average class size is always bigger than the pupil-teacher ratio, mainly because some teachers have planning periods and others work with small groups of students who have special needs, forcing the typical teacher to take on larger classes. A national headcount classroom to classroom would be a daunting data collection effort. Instead, researchers rely on staffing ratios to compare states since there’s a direct relationship between the student-teacher ratio and class size. Because of that, the two are often bandied around interchangeably. Oregon’s student-teacher ratio in the fall of 2011, according to the NEA, was 20.2. OK, so Oregon ranked third on the list according to data collected by the NEA. We wondered what other sources of data say about Oregon’s student-teacher ratio. The state of Oregon calculates student-teacher ratios a little differently, using an average of full-time-equivalent teaching positions and student enrollment across the school year. The state number is higher, with 21.3 students per teacher. That would still rank Oregon behind Utah and California in the NEA rankings. We wondered if the state calculation was consistently higher. Turns out it was, but not by much. Going back to the 2008-2009 school year, the statewide average student-teacher ratio was 19.1. The NEA pegged Oregon at 18.9. We also checked in on the United States Department of Education’s database of school statistics. The measure for the 2011-2012 school year isn’t available until June, so we looked at past data from the feds to see how it measured up against the NEA’s Oregon numbers. Historical federal data lined up closely -- but not exactly -- with the state numbers we found. Oregon fared poorly in the federal ranking. In the 2008-09 school year, the state had the fifth-largest student-teacher ratio. That ranking rose to third in 2009-10 and dropped back to fourth in the 2010-11 school year. So overall, three data sets produced very similar results about Oregon’s student-teacher ratios, all of which say the state has one of the highest student-teacher ratios in the United States.

pomt-12245	Says two of U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/13/blog-posting/fake-news-saga-wrongly-says-nancy-pelosis-daughter/	A series of fake news posts appearing across several websites said U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs, but the articles are so inaccurate, they don’t even bother to consistently use the same fake names. The bogus saga of the House minority leader’s children is widespread and convoluted: Facebook users flagged a string of stories starting on July 6, 2017, appearing on wazanews.tk, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The posts all invoked Pelosi’s name, but details from story to story did not agree. Essentially, the articles said two of the California Democrat’s adult daughters had been arrested for smuggling cocaine. But the details of what happened after that premise was asserted varied wildly in the following days. At first the women were said to be caught in Berkeley, Calif., with more than 200 pounds of cocaine in their Winnebago. Later stories claimed they were apprehended at the Mexican border. The yarn went on and on, across several posts. The gist is that the women ran a drug ring out of a pool house, and agreed to turn on their mother after they were caught. Somehow Nancy Pelosi faced charges for ethical violations, breaking federal drug laws and committing treason. (It’s never really specified how.) Eventually Hillary Clinton was implicated, and the women were in protective custody when the cabin in which they were staying burned down. They turned up alive in Buffalo, N.Y., however, so all was well. Wazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam, but the stories appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com, FreedomCrossroads.us or TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site run by Christopher Blair. He writes absurd stories about Democrats with the goal of tricking conservative readers into believing they (and his website) are real. OurLandOfTheFree.com said it "makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality." FreedomCrossroads.us has an About Us page that claims the site "uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth." The posts don’t align very well, with details varying from story to story, such as the women’s ages or even names, which change constantly. Sometimes the pair are called Heather and Nicole. Or maybe Julie Marie and Nicole Lynn. Or Jillian and Veronica. Or Amber and Carly. Or Louanne and Marissa. For the record, Pelosi’s five children are daughters Christine, Alexandra, Jacqueline and Nancy, and one son named Paul. At least a couple of images used on posts were actually of two women arrested for smuggling drugs. But those photos were of a pair of Scots arrested in Peru for trying to sneak cocaine to Spain in 2013. The grand finale is a July 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org under the headline, "Liberal troll paid $100K for Nancy Pelosi drug bust hoax." The post said George Soros paid the author to fool people for his own amusement, but that "in the end, everyone knows Pelosi is guilty and (Hillary) Clinton is behind everything." Don’t be fooled by tales of Pelosi’s daughters being busted for drugs. It’s a fictional soap opera created to amuse trolls. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-15037	Says after leaving the White House, Hillary Clinton "was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House china, furniture and artwork that she had stolen."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/01/viral-image/viral-image-wrongly-accuses-clinton-stealing/	An old complaint about Hillary Clinton, stemming from her days as first lady, is making a comeback during her run for the presidency. When the Clintons left Washington in 2001 at the end of President Bill Clinton’s second term, they took a lot of things with them. The problem was, they took some things they should have left behind. A conservative website called Radix News posted this graphic on its Facebook page: "After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House china, furniture and artwork that she had stolen." There is a grain of truth to this claim, but we found multiple problems -- the amount is off, and "stolen" is an inaccurate word to describe Clinton’s actions. Also, despite the graphic's use of the word "force," it’s important to note that law enforcement did not come into play in this episode. When Bill and Hillary left town Federal rules strictly limit gifts for nearly every member of the executive branch, but the exceptions include the president and vice president. They may accept gifts, due to the needs of protocol and etiquette. There are some limits, but for the most part, if you want to show your appreciation for the occupant of the White House, you can. This courtesy extends to the entire first family -- and, importantly for this fact-check, if they want to keep those gifts when they leave, they can. The president must report gifts over a certain value; during most of the Clinton years, the amount was $250, though today it is $350. When Bill Clinton completed his term, he submitted a final disclosure form that listed roughly $190,000 in gifts. Clinton’s itemized list caught the eye of the Washington Post and provided plenty of fodder for the curious. People gave the president a notable quantity of golf clubs. Movie star Sylvester Stallone gave him a pair of boxing gloves. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg sent him china. And one Steve Mittman from New York gave him two sofas, an easy chair and ottoman worth $19,900. The problem was, Mittman and a few others included on the list said they never intended their gifts to go to the Clintons. They thought they were donating to the White House itself as part a major remodeling project in 1993. This is where the questions of provenance get muddy. Some gifts are intended for the government, and must stay in the government’s hands, while some are intended for the person living in the White House. But it’s not always as simple as "this is mine" and "that is Uncle Sam’s." Within about two weeks of the publication of the Post article, public criticism escalated, and the Clintons announced that they would pay the government nearly $86,000 for items that were actually government property. A few days after that, they also returned about $48,000 worth of furniture (including the sofas, chair and ottoman from Mittman). Add that up and the government got back $134,000 out of the $190,000 the Clinton’s had declared as gifts. But as an indication of how hard it is to determine ownership, the National Park Service, which oversees the White House property, later returned a chair and an ottoman to the Clintons. The House investigates The House Committee on Government Reform looked into the fracas over the Clintons’ gifts. While its report never accused the former first family of criminal wrongdoing, it noted shortcomings in how gifts were processed, saying there was no independent assessment of gifts and that some had likely been undervalued. For example, lawmakers were skeptical of the estimated value of $240 for a John Quincy Adams-signed original land grant from 1826. There was also a large Coach leather travel bag, which the White House estimated at $200 but which investigators found priced at $498 to $698, and a Tiffany necklace valued at $150 but that Tiffany's valued at $450 to $1,000. There were instances of a twisted paper trail in which the National Park Service thanked donors for certain items but never formally added them to the permanent White House collection, which meant the Clintons could take them for themselves or for the Clinton Library. The committee found that giving things to the White House and its occupants was governed by several laws and six federal offices and agencies. Its overall conclusion was that the system was too complicated and left the government vulnerable. "Since the current system is subject to abuse and political interference, there is a need for centralized accountability in one agency staffed by career employees," it said. Among the aspects of the case that lawmakers found troubling was the apparent violation of the ban on soliciting gifts. It’s fine under the law to accept someone’s generosity, but you can’t tell them what you want. This came up in regards to a portion of the goods the Clintons kept -- about $38,000 worth of goods given to Hillary Clinton in December 2000. That was after she won her Senate race in New York, but before she took office, at which point accepting such gifts would have violated Senate rules. Clinton had created a gift registry at Borsheim’s Fine Jewelry and Gifts. This yielded 16 rimmed soup bowls worth $2,352 and a soup tureen worth $1,365, among other items. Even before the registry episode, the White House had retained an interior decorator who, according to the report, coordinated 43 of the 45 furniture gifts received over the Clintons’ eight years. Kathleen Clark focuses on government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis. For her, that interior decorator raised a flag. "I don’t know how you coordinate gifts without soliciting them," Clark said. Ultimately, the first family retained 227 of 14,770 gifts given over the eight years. The accusation of theft The viral image accuses the Clintons of theft. However, their public declaration of all the things they were taking makes it harder to call what they did "stealing." "Calling the Clintons’ actions ‘stealing’ or ‘theft’ is hyperbolic," Clark said. "It’s hard to take that language seriously in this context." Richard Painter served as the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. He now teaches at the University of Minnesota Law School. Painter said the paper trail is "strange." "Perhaps it was stuff that was given to them and they turned it over to the government and then changed their mind and treated it as a gift to them and put it on the 278 (disclosure form) and took it with them," Painter said. "That is more debatable, depending on the intent of the donor." The congressional report notes that there were some instances in which donor wishes were disregarded, but it also describes confusion in defining ownership and disposing of the gifts. To the extent that the Clintons were forced to pay for or return certain items, that was not under penalty of law. It would be more accurate to say that they quickly bowed to public pressure. The Reagans had issues too As an aside, we’ll note that the problem of gifts to the first family was not a new one. For instance, the IRS investigated President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan in 1989. At issue were gowns worth as much as $25,000 and diamond jewelry that had been loaned to Nancy Reagan. A year before, the White House Ethics Office found that the president could accept a $2.5 million home in Bel Air, Calif., purchased on his behalf by undisclosed friends. However, the Reagans ultimately repaid the donors. Our ruling A viral graphic said that Hillary Clinton was forced to return about $200,000 worth of furniture, artwork and china that she had stolen from the White House. The statement contains several inaccuracies. The Clintons returned about $48,000 in furniture, and they paid the government about $86,000 for other items. Any way you count it, the $200,000 figure is too high. According to top ethics lawyers, it’s at least debatable -- and at worst hyperbolic -- to say the Clintons "stole" the items. A congressional investigation found poor tracking of ownership and final disposition of gifts, which makes it hard to speak definitively of wrongdoing. In fact, two items the Clintons returned were ultimately sent back to them. Finally, it’s worth making clear that the "force" they responded to was political pressure, not legal jeopardy. Accusations of stealing are serious and require a high threshold of evidence, unmet by the charges in this over-the-top graphic. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-12360	"Trump Removing Marines From the Navy."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/07/vet-tv/idea-donald-trump-will-split-marines-navy-unfounde/	The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps have a long and intertwined history. While the Marines are considered a separate branch of the military, and while the Commandant of the Marine Corps is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Marine commandant formally answers to the Secretary of the Navy, and the corps has been considered part of the Department of the Navy since 1834. The United States Naval Academy commissions officers for both. So it would be a pretty big deal if President Donald Trump acted to officially separate the two military branches from each other. That’s what a widely shared item on the website Vet TV said. Is it true? The short answer: No. Facebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to fight fake news in users’ social media feeds. An article on the website is headlined, "Trump Removing Marines From the Navy." The article claims, "President Trump will sign executive order 13801 this November 10th on the 242nd birthday of the Marine Corps, freeing the Marines from the Department of The Navy. The Marines will now fall under the newly created Department of Expeditionary Warfare." Setting aside the tiny likelihood that the administration knows in detail what executive orders Trump will be signing on a specific date six months down the road, there is no evidence to support the notion that he will be splitting the two branches. "We have not heard anything about that. Semper Fidelis," said Marine Capt. Ryan Elizabeth Alvis, a public-affairs official at the Marine Corps headquarters. The Navy referred PolitiFact to the office of the Secretary of Defense, which referred us to the White House. The White House declined to comment on the record. As it happens, there may be an explanation for why the article ran. Vet TV bills itself as an entertainment and humor site for veterans -- though it would be hard to know that from the web page in question. All the way down at the bottom of the article, past the lengthy reader comment section, is this description of Vet TV: "The first television network created by and for post 9/11 veterans without civilian influence. Hollywood wouldn't make this for us, so we did it ourselves. Get ready to laugh at everything the DoD leadership doesn't want you to laugh at. This network is sure to offend p------, liberals, and probably our parents." Vet TV was founded by Donny O’Malley, a humorist and YouTube celebrity. According to his bio, O’Malley was a Marine infantry officer for almost six years, serving in Asia and Afghanistan and reaching the rank of captain. Vet TV was launched as a Kickstarter campaign, setting a goal of $250,000 and securing a total of $296,331 from 3,609 donors. The idea is to create a app and a website for irreverent videos that can be streamed across all devices. "Imagine the ‘Netflix of the military,’ but with all original content," as O’Malley describes it. The project is set to launch later this month and dubs itself "the Comedy Central of the military." However, the article about the Navy-Marines split does not include a prominent "satire" label, and much of the text of the article itself rather mundane. As a result, it would be easy for social media users to think that word of the inter-branch split was legitimate news. With the Navy-Marines article, "the first part of the piece isn’t very humorous at all," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Only deeper in the article does the satire become more obvious, he said, such as this passage: " ‘The Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that can’t get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia,’ Sgt. Major Garrett explained." Janda said that the article does draw on a deep well of competition, and even tension, between the two branches. "The U.S. Marines were modeled on the Royal Marines in the same way that the early U.S. Navy modeled itself on the Royal Navy," he said. "Marines served on every ship, just like today. They fought as sharp-shooters or with bayonets in ship-to-ship encounters, made up landing parties, guarded the captain, and enforced discipline when needed. In mutinous situations they almost always stayed loyal to the captain, and for that reason, and because they enforced ship discipline such as executions and floggings, they were usually hated by sailors. Some of that mutual enmity, driven by rivalry and respect, endures today." O’Malley did not reply to an inquiry sent through his website. We rate the Vet TV statement that Trump is removing the Marines from the Navy as Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Vet TV	None	None	None	2017-06-07T11:35:27	2017-05-23	['None']

pomt-09118	"Ninety-four percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/17/jim-demint/demint-says-94-percent-bills-are-passed-unanimousl/	EDITOR'S NOTE: On June 17, 2010, we rated the statement by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., that "94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure, and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office." We said that the actual percentage was 27.9 and called it a Pants on Fire. (We've archived our original item here.) We soon received a number of letters from readers critical of the math we had used to come up with the percentage. We also received criticism from DeMint's office, for our math as well as for other issues. As a result, we decided to assign a new reporter to the item in order to take a fresh look. Below is our new analysis. On May 26, 2010, Sen. Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, posted a video of one of his speeches on YouTube. Speaking about legislative openness, DeMint said that Congress is plagued with secrecy and lack of debate on important issues: "At this point in the Senate, 94 percent of all the bills are passed unanimous consent -- 94 percent. So this is hardly a lack of productivity. And what this means is 94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate, no vote, no amendments, no reading of the bill, no online disclosure, and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office." DeMint's number seemed high to us, so we decided to investigate. We see two broad areas to analyze. One is whether the percentage DeMint cites is accurate. The other is whether DeMint's percentage says anything valuable about how the Senate handles legislation. We asked DeMint's office for the source of his claim and were told it comes from a July 2008 report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm for Congress. The report, which DeMint's office had originally asked CRS to prepare, notes that as of June 30, 2008, the Senate had passed 911 measures of various kinds during the 110th Congress. Of these measures, 855 were passed via unanimous consent -- an expedited process by which bills are passed unless a senator objects. This is the source of DeMint's 94 percent figure -- 855 bills passed by unanimous consent out of 911 total measures taken up. DeMint in his speech referred to all of these measures as "bills." But the CRS report broke them down more precisely. Some were formal bills or joint resolutions, both of which are binding. Others were simple resolutions or concurrent resolutions, which do not have the force of a law and do not require the president's signature. Of the 911 total measures, only 376 were legally binding bills and joint resolutions, according to the CRS report. The rest were simple and concurrent resolutions. Occasionally these non-binding resolutions inspire some controversy, but a look through the full list provided by CRS confirms that the vast majority are ceremonial or symbolic in nature. An example is a resolution "congratulating Charles County, Maryland, on the occasion of its 350th anniversary." Others from the CRS report include: • A resolution commending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln women's volleyball team for winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Women's Volleyball Championship. • A concurrent resolution honoring the memory of Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi. • A concurrent resolution authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run. In making his calculation, the senator decided to include all measures, regardless of whether they were binding. But there's another way to do it: Remove from the calculation the measures that most people would agree don't require debate. DeMint spokesman Wesley Denton argues that DeMint was on solid ground calculating the numbers his way. "Nowhere in DeMint’s speech does he ever say that all 94 percent of these bills are controversial, or that all 94 percent need a roll call vote," Denton said. "DeMint is criticizing the process, not every bill passed by that flawed process. So to try to whittle down the number by focusing on only the bills PolitiFact finds controversial is a disingenuous attempt to discredit DeMint’s factual statement." We disagree. We think the fairer test is to focus on the bills that include some element of substance that demands debate. Doing it DeMint's way, in our view, essentially stacks the deck by enlarging the pool of undebated measures to include simple and concurrent resolutions. The CRS report does not consider them bills, and no one seriously expects the Senate to spend time debating the merits of whether to honor a college volleyball team or to praise the life of a late vintner through non-binding resolutions. So why should we pretend that all 911 measures deserve official debate -- which is what would be required to produce the 94 percent figure DeMint cites? We'll take the alternate approach. We started with the 376 legally binding measures (that is, the bills and joint resolutions). Then we looked closer. Of the 376, 88 were naming bills for U.S. Postal Service facilities -- legislation that, while legally binding, is almost always non-controversial and treated as pro-forma business by the House and the Senate. According to CRS, all of the naming bills passed by unanimous consent. Because these bills are not the kinds of measures requiring substantive debate, we'll subtract them. That gets us down to 288 bills. Another 30 passed by unanimous consent re-named a federal building, park, office or highway after someone -- another common category of bill that rarely if ever inspires debate. And four additional bills that were passed by unanimous consent addressed what seem to be non-controversial issues involving U.S. coins. That leaves 254 bills. We could scrutinize the CRS list for other non-controversial bills passed by unanimous consent, but we'll stop there; once you get beyond common categories like building namings, it gets tricky to determine whether a bill addresses a major, debatable issue just by its title, which is all that CRS lists. So, stopping here would define our universe of legally binding, non-naming, non-coinage bills at 254. The CRS study says (and DeMint's original math concurs) that 46 roll call votes and three voice votes were subject to debate in the chamber. If you subtract these 49 bills from the total number of non-trivial, binding bills (254), you get 206 bills passed by unanimous consent. We now have a couple ways to crunch the numbers. One is to say that 81 percent of non-trivial, binding bills (206 out of 254) were passed by unanimous consent. Alternately, you could separate out the 64 binding resolutions that CRS said were passed by unanimous consent but which received some debate. Doing this would mean that 56 percent of non-trivial, binding bills, received absolutely no debate. (DeMint's office argues that the "debate" on these bills cited by CRS was cursory and thus shouldn't be counted as debate.) Either figure would be lower than what DeMint said on the floor, and one of the percentages is quite a bit lower. They're also higher than the 27.9 percent we had in our previous article, which we now acknowledge is incorrect. However, we think what's wrong with DeMint's statement is actually broader than the arithmetic. We arrived at the percentages above after first excluding as ceremonial or symbolic 657 measures the senator had counted. These largely non-substantive measures that DeMint included accounted for more than 70 percent of the measures he used in his calculation. This significantly skews the picture of what kinds of measures were taken up in the Senate. As any veteran Congress-watcher can tell you, the Senate, with its byzantine rules and back-room wheeling-dealing, can be a maddening institution. DeMint's call for reforming procedures and increasing openness likely has merit. His bipartisan efforts with Sens. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to ensure that legislation is disclosed and easily reviewable online prior to passage, and that it be pre-scrutinized for conflicts of interest and budgetary impact, among other things, are the kinds of goals that should be able to garner broad, bipartisan support. At the very least, one can question the wisdom of spending taxpayer money to pass hundreds of symbolic resolutions every two years, rather than debating the great issues at stake. Indeed, those unfamiliar with Senate procedures might be shocked to learn that even 56 percent of legally binding bills passed the chamber without debate. But DeMint wasn't content to limit himself to such evidence. In making his point, he ran up the score. Ultimately, we find that DeMint's goals, laudable though they may be, are undercut -- not strengthened -- by the math he chose to present in his floor speech. We'll own up to our own mathematical error, but we stand by our overall judgment from the initial article: Pants on Fire!	None	Jim DeMint	None	None	None	2010-06-17T16:47:05	2010-05-26	['None']

pomt-06751	"Over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/24/donna-brazile/brazile-said-53-percent-black-wealth-has-disappear/	If some of President Barack Obama's supporters are irritated with him about jobs, it's understandable because the times are so hard, said Democratic strategist Donna Brazile on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. Brazile was responding to a question about harsh words for Obama from Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. "The president has to do more than just run against Congress. He has to tell the American people that his administration has used every tool at their disposal to get job creation back on track," Brazile said. "But over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared. The average -- for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000, $5,000. It has dropped. "So these families are hurting. They want help. They want relief. They don't want to hear about Congress. They don't want to hear about the tea party. They don't want to hear another plan. They want jobs," she said. We decided to fact-check Brazile's statement that "over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared." We'll also explain her comment that "for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000, $5,000," which actually has a critical slip of the tongue. She should have repeated the word "wealth" in place of "income." More on that in a bit. Brazile's first number comes from a recent study by the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan "fact tank" that provides information on demographic trends but does not take policy positions. A study from Pew's Social & Demographic Trends project released a report about racial disparities in family wealth on July 26, 2011. That report analyzed data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), an economic survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Pew report analyzed household wealth, a very different measurement than income. "Household wealth is the accumulated sum of assets (houses, cars, savings and checking accounts, stocks and mutual funds, retirement accounts, etc.) minus the sum of debt (mortgages, auto loans, credit card debt, etc.)," the report states. "It is different from household income, which measures the annual inflow of wages, interest, profits and other sources of earning. Wealth gaps between whites, blacks and Hispanics have always been much greater than income gaps." As you might be able to guess from that definition, home values are a critical component of household wealth, and plummeting home values were responsible for wiping out a good deal of household wealth. The Pew report specifically compared the data from the 2005 survey with a 2009 survey, the most recent data available. From the Pew report: "The Pew Research Center analysis finds that, in percentage terms, the bursting of the housing market bubble in 2006 and the recession that followed from late 2007 to mid-2009 took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites. From 2005 to 2009, inflation-adjusted median wealth fell by 66% among Hispanic households and 53% among black households, compared with just 16% among white households. As a result of these declines, the typical black household had just $5,677 in wealth (assets minus debts) in 2009, the typical Hispanic household had $6,325 in wealth and the typical white household had $113,149." For comparison, in 2005 the median black household wealth was $12,124; Hispanic household wealth was $18,359; and white household wealth was $134,992. Brazile said that, "Over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared." The Pew report wasn't for the most recent four years, as Brazile's words imply, but for the period between 2005 and 2009. However, as we already noted, that is the most recently available data from the Census. We're doing a fact-check on the 53 percent loss of black wealth claim, but we should point out that Brazile went wrong in her second statement -- "for white families, the median income is $113,000. For black families, $5,000" -- when she said "income." She should have simply repeated the word "wealth." We're rating Brazile's statement, "Over the last four years, 53 percent of black wealth has just disappeared." That is the percentage that the Pew report found, based on data collected by the U.S. Census. But the years in question were 2005 to 2009. So we deduct one notch off the Truth-O-Meter and rate Brazile's statement Mostly True.	None	Donna Brazile	None	None	None	2011-08-24T10:21:39	2011-08-21	['None']
pomt-11003	On assault weapons, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s position is "way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/11/chris-murphy/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-gun-control-second/	Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a vocal advocate of tighter gun laws, called out President Donald Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court for the nominee’s position on the Second Amendment. "Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical," Murphy tweeted July 9. "He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether Kavanaugh, who will replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy if confirmed, on the issue of assault weapons indeed stands to the right of Scalia, who as a young man would tote his rifle on the New York City subway. After reading the relevant court decisions, experts told us both Kavanaugh and Scalia hold that assault weapons are protected under the Second Amendment. Assault weapons encompass a series of semi-automatic firearms, mostly rifles. Semi-automatic weapons are those where one trigger pulled equals one bullet shot. The Heller case One of the defining cases on gun rights in recent years is D.C. vs. Heller. Alongside five others, Richard Heller, a special police officer for the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit in 2003 challenging the constitutionality of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, which restricted D.C. residents from owning handguns. The suit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in Heller’s favor. The majority decision was written by Scalia. Scalia argued that handguns have not traditionally been banned and are in common use. He also pointed out, however, that the right granted by the Second Amendment "is not unlimited," and upholds "laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms." The question of assault weapons never came up. Instead, rifles came up in a later legal challenge between Heller and Washington, when Heller questioned the constitutionality of the district’s Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008, created in response to the Supreme Court decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit favored the district two to one, but Kavanaugh dissented. "There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles," Kavanaugh wrote. "Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses." Scalia’s opinion When the question of whether assault weapons bans are unconstitutional was raised of the Supreme Court, Scalia was unable to answer because the court rejected the case. The case in question was Friedman vs. Highland Park, a challenge to a Chicago suburb’s ordinance banning semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines. However, Justice Clarence Thomas voiced a similar opinion to Kavanaugh’s in the rejection, which Scalia joined. Scalia and Thomas wrote that in accepting the ban, the court was not complying with the precedent set by Heller. "The city’s ban is thus highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semi-automatic firearms used for lawful purposes," Thomas wrote. "Roughly five million Americans own AR-style semi-automatic rifles. The overwhelming majority of citizens who own and use such rifles do so for lawful purposes, including self-defense and target shooting. Under our precedents, that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons." "In the Highland Park case, we should say Kavanaugh was on the same page as Scalia," said Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Murphy’s office pointed out that Scalia’s opinion explicitly allowed for regulations, which some lower courts found included assault weapons bans. But the rulings are not unanimous. "You have more courts upholding the bans than finding them unconstitutional, but there’s definitely a split of opinion on this," said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst at the Independence Institute. Our ruling Murphy said that on assault weapons, Kavanaugh’s position is "way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia." Kavanaugh stated that assault weapons bans were unconstitutional in the circuit court case Heller vs. District of Columbia. Scalia’s opinion on the Supreme Court allowed for some regulations in District of Columbia vs. Heller, which some courts have interpreted to rule in favor of assault weapons bans. But the decision was not about assault weapons. We found at least one instance where Scalia signed off on saying an assault weapons ban would be unconstitutional. So Kavanaugh’s position and Scalia’s are substantially similar. Leaving room for legal interpretation, we rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13855	"Sanctuary cities such as Philadelphia refuse to cooperate with the federal government in locating suspected terrorists who are in their custody and are in the country illegally."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jul/08/pat-toomey/kenney-blasts-pat-toomeys-fearmongering-around-san/	Sen. Pat Toomey lost a major battle on the Senate floor this week when Democrats blocked his attempts to advance a bill that would have stripped millions of dollars in funding from so-called "sanctuary cities," including Philadelphia. In a statement before the vote, Toomey, who’s in a bitter fight for re-election this year, said "Sanctuary cities such as Philadelphia refuse to cooperate with the federal government in locating suspected terrorists who are in their custody and are in the country illegally." Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney disagreed. The Democrat in his first year as mayor released a statement this week excoriating Toomey, a Republican, saying the senator’s "inaccurate" statements "are nothing more than fearmongering" and were "pulled straight from Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant playbook." He said the city does cooperate with federal investigators in cases related to suspected terrorism. So who’s right? We decided to check the claim. Philadelphia’s immigration policy and terrorism When Kenney entered office earlier this year, one of his first moves as mayor was to reinstate Philadelphia’s status as a "sanctuary city." In this case, that means the city will not comply with Department of Homeland Security requests for Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds, a tactic used by federal officials to detain undocumented immigrants who otherwise would have been released from police custody. Dozens of jurisdictions across the nation have "sanctuary" policies. Proponents argue DHS uses ICE holds to arbitrarily detain undocumented immigrants accused of petty crimes. Philadelphia’s executive order stipulates that a detainer request will not be followed, nor will notification of a person’s pending release go out to DHS, unless the person is being released "after conviction for a first or second degree felony involving violence and the detainer is supported by a judicial warrant." Toomey’s office points to this as the problem. There’s nothing in Kenney’s executive order that explicitly allows officials in Philadelphia to communicate the pending release of a suspected terrorist who was not convicted of a violent crime with federal investigators. Toomey’s spokeswoman E.R. Anderson pointed out the "vast majority of suspected terrorists would not fit into Mayor Kenney’s narrow category." "Philadelphia police are forbidden to share information or otherwise cooperate to apprehend those terror suspects who have not yet been convicted of a violent first or second degree felony — a category that encompasses Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsaernev [sic], the San Bernardino shooters, and the Orlando shooter," she wrote in a prepared statement. However, if any of those attacks had taken place in Philadelphia, police would have communicated with federal investigators because none of those examples are undocumented immigrants. Tsarnaev’s citizenship was approved. One San Bernardino shooter was in America on a visa, the other was born in Chicago. The Orlando shooter was born in New York. Toomey’s office said it used these only as examples to illustrate that most terrorists had not been convicted of violent crimes prior to committing an act of terrorism. And they’re right. Nine out of 10 individuals on the terror watch list who tried to buy a gun last year were approved and passed a background check that would have flagged them had they been convicted of a felony. But when asked if the city would cooperate with a DHS detainer request in the case of a suspected terrorist who was an undocumented immigrant convicted of a minor offense, Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said: "The City of Philadelphia does cooperate with the federal government in the case of suspected terrorism." She said the city complies with federal criminal complaints "so that someone who is accused of a crime, like terrorism, would be detained pursuant to the complaint." Cooperating with the feds Kenney’s sanctuary city law was put into effect largely to curb federal overreach and to protect undocumented immigrants from being deported after being accused of a minor offense. Paula Meninato, the civic engagement coordinator for the Philadelphia-based Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition, said Toomey’s concerns about suspected terrorists going free in Philadelphia and other sanctuary cities are misplaced. "Most of the people that are targeted by these policies… are people that either got arrested for petty crimes or people that haven’t done anything at all," she said, "that get targeted by police who are just regular people trying to make a living." However, Philadelphia says it does cooperate with DHS related to those convicted of violent crimes. Of the thousands of undocumented immigrants deported last year, DHS reported that more than 1,000 were suspected gang members. But it didn’t report that any were suspected terrorists. A DHS official told PolitiFact that the city’s existing executive order "does not appear" to allow the city to honor ICE detainers or requests for notification of pending release with respect to any individuals in the custody of the City of Philadelphia. "With the implementation of the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) more than a year ago, many law enforcement agencies that had previous(ly) declined to cooperate with ICE, including some large jurisdictions, are now once again working with the agency," ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said in a prepared statement. To support Toomey’s claim that sanctuary cities don’t cooperate with federal investigators in cases of suspected terrorism, his office pointed to Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who traveled to Philadelphia this year to urge Kenney to comply with the department’s Priority Enforcement Program which prioritizes the deportation of violent criminals. After his meeting with Kenney, Johnson told The Philadelphia Inquirer: "The mayor and I had a good dialogue," though Kenney wouldn’t budge on his policy. In testimony before a senate committee last week, Johnson specifically called out Philadelphia for not complying. "I will note that I have had conversations with city officials in Philadelphia and in Cook County, Illinois without success so far," he said. "And I have urged a number of cities and counties that it’s for the benefit of public safety that dangerous criminals not be released." Kenney’s also been urged by both Toomey and his Democratic opponent for Senate Katie McGinty, both of whom said Kenney should reconsider the city’s level of cooperation with federal investigators looking to gain information about undocumented immigrants in the city’s custody. Toomey’s bill, which was defeated in a procedural vote on Wednesday, would strip Community Development Block Grants from sanctuary cities like Philadelphia who refuse to comply with certain DHS detainer requests. This year, Philadelphia received $40 million from such grants, leading local officials and PA Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, to oppose Toomey’s legislation. The incumbent Republican Senator has made sanctuary cities a critical issue in his campaign against McGinty. She hasn’t come out in full support of Kenney’s policy, but she also hasn’t outright rejected it. Our Ruling In order to support his sanctuary city legislation, Toomey said "Sanctuary cities such as Philadelphia refuse to cooperate with the federal government in locating suspected terrorists who are in their custody and are in the country illegally." Philadelphia officials unequivocally deny that, saying they have and will work with federal investigators in cases of suspected terrorism. They reject Toomey’s statements that imply officials in the city don’t work with the feds in cases of terrorism, as Kenney’s sanctuary city policy applies only in cases involving undocumented immigrants not convicted of violent crimes. Last year, DHS didn’t report bringing any suspected terrorists into custody solely based on his or her immigration status. But there isn’t anything in Philadelphia’s existing executive order carving out an exception for suspected terrorists who haven’t been charged with a violent crime, and the Obama administration has urged the city to reconsider that stance. It’s the city’s word vs. language in the order. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Pat Toomey	None	None	None	2016-07-08T11:19:12	2016-06-27	['Philadelphia']

pomt-10764	"Mitt Romney opposed the gun lobby, even Ronald Reagan."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/24/log-cabin-republicans/romney-supported-gun-control-in-previous-runs/	Mitt Romney portrays himself now as a supporter of gun rights and a fan of Ronald Reagan. But Romney took positions favorable to gun control in previous races in Massachusetts, a state with strict gun control laws. In 1994, Romney ran for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat stalwart Ted Kennedy. During that campaign, Romney supported two gun control measures: the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. In 2002, Romney ran for governor, successfully beating Shannon P. O'Brien. During that campaign Romney said, "We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them. … I won't chip away at them." Also during the 1994 race, Kennedy attacked Romney as a conservative similar to Ronald Reagan. (He didn't mean it as a compliment.) That's when Romney responded, "I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Romney made his most detailed defenses to these apparent flip-flops in an interview with Bob Schieffer on CBS News' Face the Nation on Oct. 21, 2007. On the gun issue, Romney said, "I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. ... But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. I sought the support of the NRA when I ran for governor, and I got it." On his Reagan comment: "Well, when I was running in '94 I wasn't trying to return to Reagan-Bush because that was characterized as a very different posture than what I was running for. … And Senator Kennedy in the debate was saying, `Oh, you're just turning yourself into Reagan-Bush.' I said, `No, I'm my own person.'" Romney's explanations not withstanding, the sly TV from the Log Cabin Republicans accurately portrays his positions from previous races. Could the group have made it clear that Romney's statements today have a different tenor? Yes. But we still find the substance of their statements correct, so we give them a Mostly True.

pomt-03567	"We are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/may/20/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-sticking-altered-700000-jobs-promis/	To hear Gov. Rick Scott tell it, his memorable campaign pledge to create 700,000 jobs in seven years is going right along schedule. The novice politician, almost two and a half years into his first term, says things are looking bright for the Sunshine State as a result of investments in economic development and public education. "Our unemployment rate has now dropped to 7.2 percent – well below the national average, and we are already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years," Scott wrote in a letter explaining line-item vetoes in the 2013-14 state budget. As much as we love belting Bon Jovi anthems -- WHOAAAAA, we’re halfway there! -- it’s premature to sing Scott’s praises for fulfilling half of the jobs he promised in the centerpiece of his 2010 campaign. Our qualm with this claim comes down to details about his pledge that he has since abandoned. These details that may not fit in a zippy campaign ad, but they do come straight from Scott’s mouth. The promise at hand is rated Stalled on the Scott-O-Meter despite the state adding 302,500 net jobs since December 2010. This factors in Scott’s first month in office, January 2011. Excluding that month puts the jobs total at 285,100. The size of the state’s employment pool in April 2013 is about the same as it was in July 2004, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Why is it Stalled? Because Scott told us in a debate and in press accounts that his 700,000 jobs would come on top of Florida’s normal growth as it added jobs lost during the recession. State economists expected the state to add about 1 million jobs by 2017. "It's on top of that," he told a reporter in 2010. "If you do these things, we're going to grow 700,000 more jobs." So Scott needs about 1.4 million more jobs by 2017 to fulfill his original promise of 1.7 million jobs. Through 28 months in office, the state has added less than 20 percent of the jobs he needs to meet that mark. Scott’s press office has consistently disagreed with our analysis, saying Scott’s campaign materials never qualified that 700,000 jobs would be on top of normal growth projections. In a response to our inquiry about this claim, spokeswoman Jackie Schutz asked us to note the state’s unemployment rate of 7.2 percent is below the national average of 7.5 percent for the second straight month. That, for the record, is correct. Our ruling Scott said the state is "already almost halfway to our 2010 goal of creating 700,000 new jobs in seven years." By his preferred measure since taking office -- 700,000 jobs regardless of normal growth -- he’s in the ballpark. By the measure he asked Floridians to hold him accountable to -- 700,000 jobs on top of 1 million jobs in normal growth -- he still has quite a long ways to go. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-05164	The Americans for Tax Reform pledge "relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/18/nathan-deal/deals-defense-tax-pledge-fails-truth-test/	PolitiFact Georgia switched on its Flip-O-Meter recently to discover Gov. Nathan Deal flip-flopped on his commitment to oppose tax increases. Now Deal is countering. During his campaign for governor, Deal signed a pledge created by the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform saying that he "will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." Two years later, the fiscal conservative is backing a tax referendum that would raise $7.2 billion for road and transit projects, and as much as $8.5 billion after inflation, to build transportation projects across metro Atlanta. Full Flop, we ruled. Days after our story was published, Deal denied that he violated the pledge. The pledge "relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action," Deal told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog Wednesday. This argument drew our attention. One of the reasons we gave Deal a Full Flop was that Grover Norquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform, said for our June 8 article that "it does violate the pledge." "It’s a rather significant tax increase," Norquist said. Who’s right? Did the pledge Deal signed cover only "new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action?" Sounds like a job for the Truth-O-Meter. Deal, the leader of state government, has been open about his support for the proposed 10-year, 1 percent sales tax -- also know as the T-SPLOST -- that would fund 157 transportation projects across the Atlanta region. Voters decide on the measure July 31. The governor says the projects are needed to ease traffic congestion in metro Atlanta and will help attract and keep businesses throughout the state. Deal has spoken at a Buckhead fundraiser for the referendum and voiced his support to several large audiences in recent months, such as at the Atlanta Press Club, the Greater North Fulton Chamber of Commerce and at an event in Savannah. The Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform believes any new legislation or changes to an existing tax structure that results in a new tax increase on individuals is a violation of the pledge by lawmakers who have signed it. Thanks to the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, ATR has become a major player in Republican Party politics. More than half the members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed the federal version of the pledge, and nearly half the U.S. Senate has joined them. But the pledge is strict, and even self-avowed fiscal conservatives are starting to break ranks. Just last week, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said lawmakers should be able to use money the federal government saves by eliminating tax loopholes to pay down the national debt. "We’re so far in debt that if you don’t give up some ideological ground, the country sinks," Graham said in an ABC-Yahoo interview. On the state level, there’s transportation tax supporter Amos Amerson, a Republican who is leaving the House of Representatives after 12 years. He decided the pledge isn’t always practical and asked in a 2002 letter to be removed from ATR’s list. Amerson said he never received a response. There are two versions of the pledge: one for federal politicians and another for the state level. The federal pledge asks signers to oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal tax rate on individuals and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions or tax credits "unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing taxes." The state version is brief. Politicians fill in the blanks of a single-sentence pledge: "I ____ pledge to the taxpayers of the state of ____ that I will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." It makes no mention of taxes that are initiated by legislative action. Or anything else, for that matter. Deal signed the state version May 10, 2010, during his campaign for governor. Our Flip-O-Meter ruling quoted Deal spokesman Brian Robinson, who said it was unfair to say the governor flip-flopped on his commitment to oppose tax increases. But Deal earned a Full Flop just the same. The T-SPLOST is an increase in the sales tax. There are no cuts to make it revenue-neutral. Now, back to our Truth-O-Meter check. After our story ran, the AJC’s Political Insider blog reported Deal said he has an out because the pledge "relates to new taxes that were going to be initiated by legislative action." How does he fare? The governor’s office declined to comment for this fact-check, so we used some of Deal’s comments to reporters Wednesday to allow him to explain himself. "I am advocating for it because this is not a legislatively imposed tax," he said. "It is a tax increase that the people themselves will decide about. And for those who say otherwise, it seems to me that they would take away the right of the people to express their opinions of this importance." ATR’s state government affairs manager, Joshua Culling, told us that Deal is wrong about his interpretation of what he signed. "The governor’s pledge is to ‘oppose and veto’ all taxes," Culling said. "By vocally supporting T-SPLOST, he certainly isn’t holding up the first half of his commitment." ATR knows the meaning of the pledge better than anyone. It says Deal is wrong about his interpretation. We agree. Our rating: False.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-06-18T06:00:00	2012-06-13	['United_States']
pomt-07055	Says President Barack Obama said that if he doesn’t turn the economy around after three years in office, he’ll be a one-term president.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/29/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-uses-barack-obamas-one-term-presi/	It’s becoming a staple of Michele Bachmann’s interviews and stump speeches: The notion of just one term for President Barack Obama … suggested by none other than President Barack Obama himself. But is it accurate? During the roll-out of her presidential campaign on June 27 and June 28, 2011, Bachmann -- a three-term Republican congresswoman from Minnesota -- used a variation on the line several times. Presidential campaign announcement, Waterloo, Iowa, June 27: "We're practical people. We know our country can work; we just want it to work again. It's a very powerful coalition that the left fears; and they should, because, make no mistake about it, Barack Obama will be a one-term president. In February 2009, President Obama was very confident that his economic policies would turn the country around within a year. He said, and I quote, 'A year from now, I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition.' Well, Mr. President, your policies haven't worked. Spending our way out of the recession hasn't worked. And so Mr. President, we take you at your word." Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, June 27: "The president has not delivered as he said that he would. I gave a quote in my announcement speech today, Sean. It was from February 2009. And the president of himself said, if he wasn't able to turn the economy around by the third year of his presidency that in all likelihood, he would be a one-term president. And what I said today in my speech today, is that I take the president at his word. And I think the American people are all too eager to make him a one-term president." Interview with Rebecca Jarvis of CBS News, June 28: "Remember, President Obama said in February of 2009, if he wasn't able to turn the economy around by the third year of his presidency, that he should only be entitled to one term in office. I think the American people agree with that." Backyard event in Raymond, N.H., June 28: "In February 2009, the president gave an interview, and in that interview he said, 'If I failed to turn the economy around by the third year, then we will have a precedent for being a one-term president.' ... Do you think we should take him at his word? I do, too." Each of these comments by Bachmann is slightly different, but the gist is always the same: In the interview -- with NBC’s Matt Lauer on Feb. 1, 2009, just days after his presidency began -- Obama said it was up to him to turn the economy around in three years, and if not, he doesn’t deserve a second term. So we looked back at the original interview. Here’s the transcript of the relevant portion: Lauer: "At some point will you say, `Wait a minute. We've spent this amount of money, we're not seeing the results. We've got to change course dramatically.’ " Obama: "Yeah, look, I'm at the start of my administration. One nice thing about the situation I find myself in is that I will be held accountable. You know, I've got four years and... Lauer: "You're going to know quickly how people feel about what's happened." Obama: "That's exactly right. And you know, a year from now I think people are going to see that we're starting to make some progress. But there's still going to be some pain out there. If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." Obama’s last phrase -- "there's going to be a one-term proposition" -- is a little awkward, but we don’t think there’s much doubt about his meaning. We understand his comment to mean that if the economy isn’t better in three years, the voters might make him a one-term president. So is Bachmann correctly framing Obama’s comment? In her announcement speech, she did remove one sentence from what she described as a direct quote -- "But there's still going to be some pain out there." Taking it out does eliminate one indication that Obama acknowledged that even an improved economy would inflict some pain on Americans. This isn’t a trivial omission, but it’s not a major one. More important, we're not convinced that the president said he actually would be a one-term president if the economy has not improved in three years -- just that he raised the possibility that voters would make that call. Each of the phrasings we cited above is slightly different, but we think that she is justified in pointing out that Obama offered a three-year framework for turning the economy around and that he acknowledged that Americans might not support a second term if he didn’t deliver. So we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-06-29T14:51:28	2011-06-27	['None']

pomt-13459	"If Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations."	false	/texas/statements/2016/sep/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrect-about-obama-giving-control-inte/	Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says the federal government is about to give away control of the internet. Really? A shift has been in motion, we found, yet not a handoff of all things web. As of October 2016, that is, contractual federal oversight of the California nonprofit that’s managed website domains since 1998--the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers--is set to end in what proponents including ICANN and administration officials describe as a long-planned shift to the greater world community. The transition plans accelerated, according to a March 2014 New York Times news story, in the wake of revelations in documents made public by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. had been intercepting internet traffic as part of global spying efforts. This summer, Cruz and a fellow Republican, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act to bar any handoff of the internet-related duties unless Congress gives approval. Talking up the proposal, Cruz said in Sept. 8, 2016, floor remarks: "In 22 short days, if Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations." Cruz went on to say the administration is "pushing through a radical proposal to take control of internet domain names and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries." Cruz warned too that this will empower countries such as Russia, China and Iran to censor speech on the web. Cruz’s backup We sought the basis of Cruz’s statement about the administration giving away control of the internet. By email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack noted ICANN is slated to no longer be under contract with the federal government. His email said that under the slated-to-go arrangement, "only the United States can authorize any changes to the authoritative root zone file, which is used to operate the internet and is essentially the master address book. By giving up those contracts, the United States is, in a very real sense, giving up control of the internet." By "root zone file," Novack was referring to the nonprofit’s coordination of the domain name system, meaning a text file of the top-level domains that form part of web addresses. Contrary to Novack's characterization, though, the root zone file is not the "master address book" of the Internet, Milton Mueller, a professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Public Policy and author of a book on ICANN’s creation, cautioned when we asked. Rather, Mueller said by email, the root zone file "is just a list of top level domain names (like .COM, .ORG or .EDU)." Mueller presents a longer description in this September 2015 blog post. Mueller told us the domain name system solely ensures "that the domain names we use for websites and emails are globally consistent – if you type in an Iranian domain your browser knows where to find it. A lot of other aspects of Internet operations, such as routing, are completely separate from this." And generally, Mueller said, the internet consists of about 50,000 different private networks worldwide that use the Internet protocols to interconnect. "All of them operate their part of the Internet," Mueller wrote. "All of them could bypass ICANN if they needed to or wanted to. They all use a common domain name root because it makes the system globally compatible." Novack further excerpted a 1998 agreement reached by the U.S. Department of Commerce stating, in part, that written direction from a government official shall be requested before "making or rejecting any modifications, additions or deletions to the root zone file." By the government giving up that authority, Novack suggested, free speech on the web is at risk. Advocates declare flaws in claim Experts supportive of the pending changes told us there’s a lot wrong in Cruz's claim. First, we connected with ICANN officials who told us the plan is to sever the corporation from its Commerce Department contract as of October 2016, leaving the "global multistakeholder community"--meaning the private sector, in consultation with technical and intellectual property experts and government representatives--to guide and handle established duties, without a particular country holding oversight. Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of Homeland Security supportive of the shift, wrote in June 2016 that the federal "stewardship has greatly diminished as the organization (ICANN) has matured from a small operation on a shoestring budget to a large, professional corporation with more than 350 employees in seven offices around the globe. Global stakeholders, including U.S. businesses, end users, technical experts, public interest organizations and academics, oversee ICANN," Chertoff wrote. We inquired into the countries that, with the U.S., advise the corporation’s 20-member board, which was chaired as of September 2016 by Steve Crocker, the CEO and co-founder of Shinkuro, Inc., a start-up; he’s also one of the originators of the internet. Samantha Eisner, an ICANN lawyer, confirmed that the 171 countries advising the board include Russia, China and Iran as well as the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. ICANN spokesman James Cole emailed us the full list of participating countries. When we checked, the chair of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee was from Switzerland, its vice chairs from Argentina, Spain, Namibia, Thailand and Turkey. GAC membership, per the web page, stretched to include national governments "and distinct economies recognized in international fora; and, usually in an observer capacity, multinational governmental and treaty organisations and public authorities (including all the U.N. agencies with a direct interest in global Internet governance such as the ITU, UNESCO and WIPO)." And according to an advisory committee web page, the panel’s advice must be taken into account by ICANN’s board, which includes a single non-voting Governmental Advisory Committee liaison, "and where the board proposes actions inconsistent with GAC advice it must give reasons for doing so and attempt to reach a mutually acceptable solution." So, we asked, might the advisory panel add up to a kind of United Nations? David Conrad, ICANN’s chief technology officer, told us the advisory panel isn’t a mini-UN in part because it’s not a ruling body and any recommendation it makes must be unanimous--meaning any country can stop movement--though the committee can offer information or make suggestions to the board without a consensus. More broadly, Conrad and other ICANN officials stressed, it doesn’t make sense to suggest a country controls the internet which, Conrad said, "is comprised of a set of privately operated networks which agree to exchange traffic using a common set of protocols. There is no central point of control of the internet at all. So, the idea that the U.S. is somehow giving up control through a contract that its entire purpose is to allow the administration of a set of identifiers is just sort of ludicrous." Mueller, asked if Cruz’s claim holds up, said by phone: "There’s no legitimate way for him to get to that conclusion. What he’s doing is fear-mongering and trying to create a bogeyman, which is the United Nations." Mueller said the whole point of the approaching shift is to keep domain names’ governance away from direct government oversight. Daniel J. Weitzner, an MIT official who told us he worked on the ICANN transition as an Obama administration adviser in the White House and Commerce Department, also responded to our inquiry by phone, saying the push for years has to been to ensure that no one country land the power to oversee the internet. Weitzner called Cruz’s claim "completely off base. There is no turnover to some nefarious organization." Separately, Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor expert on ICANN, said by phone the U.S. government can’t give away what it doesn’t own--the internet--and Cruz’s invocation of the U.N. seemed "rather grandiose" in that the duties at issue will continue to be overseen by the nonprofit whose board is advised only occasionally, Froomkin said, by the GAC. That said, he noted, the U.S. government will no longer independently contract with ICANN and so it will have less influence that way. Cruz's recommended authorities Novack, apprised that the experts we reached found Cruz’s claim short of factual, urged us to consult others including Phil Kerpen, who heads the conservative American Commitment advocacy group and chairs the Internet Freedom Coalition, which opposes any UN attempts to manage the internet. By email, Kerpen said that in context, Cruz’s claim is accurate; he said Cruz’s reference to control of the internet refers to the about-to-go federal oversight and the UN mention reflects on the GAC which, Kerpen said, can only be overruled by a supermajority of the ICANN board. That’s correct: ICANN’s Cole told us that under revised bylaws, it’ll take 10 (rather than the current nine) of 16 voting board members to spurn GAC advice while, Cole noted, it’ll take even more votes to reject advice from the corporation’s private sector policymaking body, the Generic Names Supporting Organization. Novack also pointed us to Brett Schaefer, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation. By email, Schaefer suggested that while the intended transition wouldn’t lead to "government ‘control’ of ICANN as would be the case in a UN body, governments will have more authority in ICANN than they do currently." Schaefer and others said in a Sept. 8, 2016, white paper that governments will also be voting members of the new Empowered Community, which is vested with the power to dismiss the board or individual directors or reject or approve individual bylaw changes. "Governments have not had a say in these matters before," the paper says. By email, ICANN spokeswoman Emily Crane Pimentel confirmed the fresh role for government representatives. Then again, she pointed out, other interest groups also will play new roles per a February 2016 document adopted by the "multistakeholder community" and, she said, governments won't end up with more power than other stakeholders. Our ruling Cruz said: "If Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations." As of October 2016, the U.S. government is set to no longer have a contract to oversee certain internet-related duties having to do with all of us finding websites. The tasks will continue to be handled through a California nonprofit that’s been in place since 1998. Upshot: There’s no pending government handoff of control of the internet that we can see. Also, the member-countries of an advisory panel to the nonprofit’s board can only make a recommendation if every nation agrees; that’s not U.N.-like. We rate this statement False.

pomt-14922	A Texas police department bought an ad telling drug dealers, "We can take your competition off the streets for FREE."	true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/30/facebook-posts/texas-police-department-places-ad-urging-drug-deal/	Snopes.com, which evaluates the accuracy of varied claims, declared in an October 2015 tweet that a Texas newspaper ran an ad purchased by the local police department encouraging drug dealers to turn in other dealers. "Is your drug dealing competition costing you money?" the described ad said. "Would you like to eliminate that problem? We can help! We can take your competition off the streets for FREE. Report your competition to us." Snopes.com’s Oct. 26, 2015 analysis said a person at the Lumberton Police Department, whom it did not identify, confirmed that the ad ran, though didn’t recall when. Snopes.com said it spotted the ad in an August 2015 Facebook post. Did police in the Southeast Texas town really place an ad encouraging drug dealers to nark each other out? We were curious enough to check it out on our own. By phone, David Lisenby, editor of the weekly Lumberton Ledger, confirmed that the Lumberton Police Department placed the ad. Lisenby added that the department subsequently purchased another direct appeal about dealers. Lisenby said he suggested the ads in hopes of encouraging community involvement. Lisenby emailed us copies of the first ad, which appeared in the paper’s Aug. 5, 2015, edition, and the follow-up ad, published Sept. 2, 2015. The second ad showed a marijuana leaf over a message directed to "drug users:" "Has your drug dealer ripped you off?" the second ad says. "Do you want justice? We can help! We can enact justice for you … for FREE." Wondering if the ads touched off a wave of snitching, we unsuccessfully tried to connect with Chief Danny Sullins of the Lumberton Police Department. Separately, a clerk for the county attorney in Hardin County, Telisha Green, told us by phone that police reports submitted to the office as backup for misdemeanor drug cases had yet to mention an instance of the ads leading to arrests. Prosecutors otherwise have no way of knowing, Green said, if the ads fueled investigations. But David Sheffield, Hardin County’s district attorney, said he’s heard the ads touched off calls to law enforcement. Sheffield said, though, it’s too early to judge results; investigations take time. Such an ad, he said, "gets your attention and it generates talk. Maybe it prompts somebody to do something they’d just been thinking about doing." Our ruling A Facebook post spotted by Snopes.com said Lumberton police placed an ad encouraging drug dealers to turn in other dealers. Actually, the Lumberton Police Department this year purchased two such ads in the local weekly. We didn’t pin down if the ads led to fresh snitching. We rate the claim True.

Among them was this figure: "African-American children are 500 percent — 500 percent — more likely to die from asthma than white kids." Clinton claimed that it hit particularly close to home, as it reminded her of her time in the early 1970s working for the Children’s Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group for poor and minority children. That number surprised us, so we decided to see if it was true and, if so, why. Clinton may have underestimated Asthma is a chronic lung disease — an inflammation of the airways that causes coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Around 25 million Americans have asthma, and the rate of asthmatics has been steadily increasing since the early 1980s. While most asthmatics function normally, often using inhalers to aid them in their breathing, asthma attacks can present a serious danger, especially in young children. A 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on childhood asthma data from 1980 to 2005 confirms Clinton’s claim almost verbatim: "Compared with white children, black children have a 260 percent higher ED (Emergency Department) visit rate, a 250 percent higher hospitalization rate, and a 500 percent higher death rate from asthma." (Clinton’s campaign confirmed that this was the source she had used.) The report also notes that even though mortality rates from asthma have decreased since 1999 for children in general, no corresponding drop has been seen in the mortality rate of African-American children. There’s also more recent data available that further confirms Clinton’s claim, and even suggests she may have understated the problem. One study from 2014 examines rates of childhood asthma in black and white children, with the most recent data from 2010. Despite making up a much smaller portion of the population, 106 black children died of asthma in 2010, compared to 68 white children. The corresponding rates of death for black and white children respectively are 8.6 per million and 1.2 per million — that means a black child is about 7.2 times more likely to die of asthma than a white child. Even among those children of each race who already had asthma, black children had a mortality rate about 3.5 times higher than white children. Notably, the study also shows that the racial disparity is not as severe for other problems with asthma; while black children have higher rates of asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations, the difference in those cases is not as large as it is with the death rate. Using CDC Wonder, a database of public health information, PolitiFact also checked the data for 2013, the last available year. In that time, 123 black children died of asthma compared to 83 white children. That corresponds to a death rate of 10.1 per million for black children and 1.5 per million for white children, which just about matches the 2010 numbers. The disparity for 2011 and 2012 was actually even greater, with the difference just about ten-fold. Why the racial disparity? According to the CDC, nobody is quite sure. "Reasons for disparities are not well understood and are the subject of research by numerous investigators in university research centers," says a statement from the agency’s Air Pollution and Respiratory Health Branch. However, there are studies that provide a couple of clues. For example, one examination of trends in preventive asthma medication use from 1988 to 2008 found that black and Mexican-American children were less likely to use the medication than white children. Another study from 1997 found that inner-city children are more likely to develop allergies as a result of prolonged exposure to cockroach allergens. Since minorities are more likely to live in urban areas, this may go some way toward explaining higher rates of asthma morbidity and mortality. Our ruling Clinton said, "African-American children are 500 percent — 500 percent — more likely to die from asthma than white kids." According to a 2006 study from the CDC, she’s right. According to more recent data, she’s slightly off, but only because she has underestimated the gap: In reality, it appears that black children are seven to eight times as likely to die of asthma as white children. We rate her claim True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-11T13:18:59	2015-07-31	['None']

pomt-00042	Says he didn't support the lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/05/mike-braun/does-mike-braun-support-lawsuit-end-obamacare/	Throughout the country, Democratic candidates are singing a common tune, warning that their Republican opponents want to end protections for pre-existing conditions. In Indiana, incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly recently accused his Republican challenger, Mike Bruan, of supporting the Texas lawsuit that aims to cancel Obamacare. This isn’t the first time Donnelly has made the claim, but this time, Braun had a chance to respond to it. In the second and final Indiana Senate debate, the three candidates — Donnelly, Braun, and Libertarian Lucy Brenton — said what they intended to do in order to keep health care insurance premiums affordable for middle- and lower-income families. In his response, Braun criticized the Affordable Care Act, saying that it was "doomed to fail, because you had big government get in cahoots with big health care, specifically big health insurance." He stressed that he was opposed to any replacement of Obamacare that does not cover pre-existing conditions. Donnelly responded by saying, "What he said is not true. Mike supports a lawsuit that would end the Affordable Care Act, that would end pre-existing conditions. So all of you watching out there tonight, if you have someone in your family with diabetes, with arthritis, with asthma — their coverage goes away of Mike’s lawsuit is successful. As I said, that’s how important this is, those are the facts, and he can’t deny that." Braun, however, did deny that, and said, "As a Republican, you get swept into the fact that you would support that lawsuit. That is not the case." He then pointed to his experience in the private sector, saying, "We have done things like health savings accounts, telemedicine where you can actually get healthcare when you’re on the road, transparency, consumer-driven. That’ll knock the cost down, because my policy costs one fourth of what his Obamacare policy costs. There’s no disputing that, and I’ve done that in the real world, he’s crafted something with big health care doomed to fail." Did Donnelly falsely assume that Braun, as a Republican, would support the lawsuit to end Obamacare? The lawsuit and what it might mean Donnelly was referring to a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Texas in February 2018 and backed by 18 attorney generals and two governors, all of whom are Republican. The basis for the Texas lawsuit is the individual mandate. While Obamacare essentially forced insurance companies to cover everyone, it also contained a mechanism to incentivize everyone to get coverage by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who were not insured. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to purchase health care, precisely because it was backed by a tax penalty. However, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the penalty on not having coverage to zero. This led a group of 20 states to challenge Obamacare in court again, arguing that as the individual mandate could not be enforced, the entire law had become unconstitutional. If the lawsuit is successful and the ACA is repealed, the regulations protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions will also be affected. Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, had previously told us, "There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome." Where Braun stands on the lawsuit Braun, who is not currently in office, has not made a lot of statements relating to the Texas lawsuit. When asked about the lawsuit in an interview to Politico, Braun said: "Sure, anything that’s going to actually get rid of it," he said of the ACA. "And then be ready to come back and talk about what you’re ready to do about pre-existing conditions and no limit coverage. That’s where you don’t hear much conservative talk." This quote essentially sums up Braun’s rather consistent position on health care: He supports coverage for pre-existing conditions, but maintains that they should guaranteed through market-based solutions, not government intervention. Politico, RTV (an Indianapolis ABC affiliate), Joe Donnelly and we here at PolitiFact have cited the Politico interview as a source on Braun’s position regarding the lawsuit. It seems that the candidate hasn’t made any other comments in support of it, but he hasn’t said anything to the contrary, either. Braun’s office told us that "Mike Braun supports covering pre-existing conditions, and believes plans that work for Hoosiers will come from market-driven solutions, not more of what big government and the insurance industry force upon them." While stressing Braun’s commitment for the maintaining protections for pre-existing conditions, his office did not address his position on the lawsuit. Our ruling Braun said, "As a Republican, you get swept into the fact that you would support that lawsuit. That is not the case." Braun only seems to have made one comment with regard to the lawsuit to repeal the ACA, in which he said he supported it, but stressed his commitment to maintain protections for pre-existing conditions through other means. Those other means, though, are unspecified vague, so it’s hard to give him much credit. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Mike Braun	None	None	None	2018-11-05T11:16:46	2018-10-30	['None']
pomt-11310	"Singer Celine Dion Says: ‘I Can’t Even Look At An American Flag Any More, I Hate This Country.’"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/blog-posting/did-celine-dion-say-she-hates-country-no/	Canadian singer Celine Dion did not say she hates America, despite a hoax you might have seen online. An April 11 headline falsely quoted Dion as saying, "I Can’t Even Look At An American Flag Any More, I Hate This Country." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Dion said either of these things. The rumor originated on a clickbait website in September 2017, according to Snopes. The story doesn’t support the headline. Instead, it talks about how Dion turned down an offer to sing at President Donald Trump’s inauguration. In January 2017, news outlets such as TMZ reported that Dion passed up the opportunity, but not because she hates America. Dion was actually scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration, which we were able to confirm with an archived version of her 2017 schedule. After a few paragraphs repeating the same information, the story cuts to a YouTube video with a thumbnail of Dion. The 59-second video shares the same title as the blog post, but instead of Dion speaking, it’s actually just a computer voiceover, saying, "I can’t even look at an American flag anymore, I hate this country." Right after the "quote," however, the voice-over contradicts the previous statement. It says that Dion is one of the most talented vocalists that "ever existed." And although she is from Canada, her performance of God Bless America proves her "true appreciation of our amazing country." We rate this headline Pants on Fire!

pomt-06027	Federal law prohibits the growing of industrial hemp in the United States.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/14/suzanne-bonamici/cant-grow-hemp-united-states/	In response to a viewer question about marijuana, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici said: "Industrial hemp is something that right now is used in products and people with businesses right here in Oregon have to buy it from Canada because there’s a federal law that says it can’t be grown." We know that industrial hemp has been an issue in the Oregon Legislature. Didn’t the Senate pass something allowing farmers to grow hemp for food, health care products and clothing? Our hunch was right. In 2009, state lawmakers approved Senate Bill 676, which authorizes farmers to grow hemp, subject to regulation by the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Oregon became the seventh state to do so, joining Maine and Hawaii. But we can’t grow industrial hemp yet because the federal government has yet to authorize it. "Until there is some change at the federal level, we are poised to begin the process of establishing rules for production," said Bruce Pokarney, spokesman for Oregon’s Agriculture Department. The federal government does not allow the growing of industrial hemp in the United States. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12733	Wisconsin children are crossing "condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/03/kathleen-vinehout/are-kids-rural-wisconsin-crossing-condemned-bridge/	Saying Wisconsin’s transportation needs are urgent, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, a potential candidate for governor in 2018, made an alarming claim. "We have bridges in my own county that have been condemned," the Alma Democrat said Feb. 24, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Television. "And we still have school children that are crossing those condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus." An unsettling image for rural Buffalo County, which is three hours northwest of Madison. We found there are two bridges in the county so badly damaged that they are closed to vehicle traffic, though only one of them is traversed by children to get to and from their school bus. And the word "condemned," while accurate in a colloquial sense, exaggerates the danger to kids. Bridge worries The need for improvements on Wisconsin’s bridges has gained attention in the past couple of years, even if the terms used to describe their condition might mean less than they seem. In October 2015, we rated Mostly True a claim by La Crosse Democrat Jennifer Shilling, the state Senate minority leader, that 71 percent of Wisconsin’s roads were in poor or mediocre condition and 14 percent of its bridges were "structurally deficient or functionally obsolete." Structurally deficient means suffering from deterioration to at least one major component, but not unsafe. Functionally obsolete means built using outdated standards, such as older design features. Wisconsin’s figure has risen to 15 percent, according to a 2017 report by the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, with 1,232 bridges deficient and 783 obsolete. How to pay for bridge work has been a persistent issue. A January 2017 audit by the nonpartisan state Legislative Audit Bureau noted that in a 2015 survey done by the bureau, only 50 percent of county highway commissioners said money for routine maintenance on bridges was adequate. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-majority Legislature, as they work on Walker’s state budget proposal for 2017-’19, are debating about new taxes or other ways of funding road and bridge work. Buffalo County To check Vinehout’s claim, we called Buffalo County Highway Commissioner Bob Platteter. He said flooding caused by an August 2016 storm damaged the 125-foot Schoepps Valley Bridge, which spans Waumandee Creek, beyond repair. "It’s scrap," he said. The bridge was closed to vehicle traffic, so in that sense it could be considered "condemned," Platteter told us -- but it was judged safe for pedestrian crossing, which continued until demolition began nearly seven months later, in March 2017. Nearby residents would drive their children to the bridge and the kids walked over it to catch the school bus, he said. And to avoid a detour of up to 20 miles, some residents with multiple vehicles parked one on the road on one side of the bridge and one on the other side. Platteter said a new timber bridge is expected to be installed by the end of April 2017. The Highway U bridge in Buffalo County partially collapsed one evening in February 2017, causing accidents two accidents that injured both drivers, though neither needed treatment. The collapse likely was also because of flood damage, Platterer said. That bridge is also now open only to pedestrians. But school buses use other county roads to pick up and drop off children in that area, he said. Our rating Vinehout says Wisconsin children are crossing "condemned bridges in the middle of the winter to get to the school bus." Two bridges in Vinehout’s home county of Buffalo have been "condemned" in that they are too badly damaged for any vehicle traffic. But officials have determined that they remain safe for pedestrians, and children do use one of the bridges to get to and from their school bus. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Kathleen Vinehout	None	None	None	2017-03-03T05:00:00	2017-02-24	['None']
pomt-05232	Under Gov. Mitt Romney, Massachusetts ranked "47th in job creation."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/05/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-repeats-claim-massachusetts-under-mi/	Over the weekend, the Obama campaign repeated a talking point it’s been making for at least a year. Obama adviser David Axelrod said on the June 3, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation that Massachusetts ranked 47th in job creation during Romney’s tenure as governor. He said something similar a year earlier during a CNN interview -- that "people have a right to say, why is it that your state was 47th in the country in job creation when you were governor?" Separately, we're checking the Romney camp’s rebuttal to Axelrod -- that year by year under Romney, the job growth rate in Massachusetts improved, from 51st in his first year in office to 30th in his final year. Who’s right? For both fact-checks, we'll follow our usual approach of looking at the claim in two parts: First, are the numbers correct, and second, how much is the change because of Romney's policies? We used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. We used figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, we used the data for December of each year as a baseline. We found that from December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth. (We calculated that by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states.) Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse. So the number is correct. Does Romney deserve credit for the job situation? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy. Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state, warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Our rating It’s correct that Massachusetts ranked 47th of 50 in job creation on Romney’s watch. However, the Obama camp -- like the Romney camp in its rebuttal -- exaggerates Romney’s influence on the state job market. We rated Axelrod Half True a year ago, and today, we still think it merits a Half True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2012-06-05T18:17:20	2012-06-03	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-07104	"Most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things. ... 85 percent of the state budget is transferred to local communities for delivery of service."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/22/ron-amstutz/state-rep-ron-amstutz-says-most-state-budget-spent/	Gov. John Kasich aimed to plug a projected $8 billion budget shortfall when he announced a two-year spending proposal including big cuts to education and local government. The budget cuts drew criticism from angry school officials, among others. The cuts and the anger also concerned state Rep. Ron Amstutz. As chairman of the House Finance and Appropriations Committee, the Wooster Republican had the job of steering the budget through the House. He called local governments "our partners," and he said changes would be made in the controversial blueprint for funding schools. But the veteran lawmaker said that cutting the size of state government was not an alternative that would cover the budget gap. "Most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things," he told a public forum at the Idea Center on Playhouse Square. Most of the budget, he said, goes to such recipients as school districts, local governments, school districts, hospitals, nursing homes and libraries. "The state doesn't do much direct service," Amstutz said. "Eighty-five percent of the state budget is transferred to local communities for delivery of service." That's a hefty percentage. We asked Amstutz how it was figured. His office provided a budget overview for fiscal 2010 that was prepared by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission. A breakdown of spending shows that 85.6 percent of the spending in the General Revenue Fund, the primary operating fund of the state, goes to the category of "subsidies." The total for subsidies is about $20.7 billion of a total $24.1 billion. The Legislative Service Commission then provided us with a breakdown of that spending. Two departments account for nearly $17 billion. The Department of Job and Family Services, which handles Medicaid and unemployment compensation, tops the list with about $9.2 billion. The Department of Education, for grades K-12, is budgeted at $7.6 billion. Amstutz told us he was referring to the General Revenue Fund because it’s money over which the General Assembly has control. In the larger all funds budget, which is less discretionary and includes agencies funded completely by fees and federal money, subsidies account for 66 percent of spending, Amstutz said. A breakdown of the all-funds budget in the Legislative Service Commission report puts subsidies at 66.6 percent of the $55.87 billion in spending for Fiscal 2010. That's still two-thirds of the total, or most of it. So how does Amstutz’ claim fare on the Truth-O-Meter? Amstutz said that most of the state budget isn't for state government doing things and that 85 percent of the money goes back to local communities for services. When we talked to Amstutz and he mentioned the 85 percent figure and specifically referred to the general revenue fund. The budget overview prepared by the Ohio Legislative Service Commission shows he’s right on the money with that figure. So Amstutz’ statement is essentially accurate. Also to be considered is the all-funds budget. The percentage of money that goes back to communities is smaller, about 67 percent, but it still matches the description of "most" that he used at the Ideastream forum. That’s a piece of additional information that provides full understanding. On the Truth-O-Meter, Amstutz' statement rates as Mostly True.

pomt-08959	House Republicans who complained they didn't have enough time to consider a constitutional ban against oil drilling "shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/21/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-house-gop-rushed-through-pro-oil-dr/	The July 20, 2010, special session to consider a constitutional amendment banning oil drilling in state-controlled waters was full of drama and political theatrics, but ultimately little action. The session came and went in about two hours with the Republican-controlled House and Senate failing to even consider adding anti-drilling language to the November ballot. The House voted along party lines 67-44 to adjourn the session without action. The Senate voted 18-16 to adjourn. None of it, however, stopped political leaders from both major parties, and independent Gov. Charlie Crist, from trying to score political points. Among the near-constant volleys of accusations, name-calling and bickering, we found a statement from Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink particularly interesting. Speaking to reporters before the Legislature convened the noon session, Sink launched a pre-emptive attack against GOP legislators. "Today at noon, I expect to see the culmination of the complete failure of the Florida Legislature to be in tune with what's going on the real world of Florida," said Sink, a Democrat who is running for governor. "In the same chamber, where House Republicans shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling, those same Republicans will stand at their desks to claim they don't have enough time." During the 51 minutes of House debate before legislators adjourned, we heard from several Republicans about the need to deliberately and methodically consider the impacts of an oil drilling ban. House Speaker Larry Cretul, for instance, suggested the Legislature should consider whether to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2012 -- in the calm after the crisis. "The fact remains that (Crist) has called us here at the last possible moment to consider a constitutional amendment for which he never proposed any language, and permitted far too little time for reflection and review," Cretul said. "This is a terrible way to propose constitutional changes." Was, as Sink suggested, that same line-of-thinking absent when legislators considered a proposal to allow drilling in state waters? Sink spokeswoman Kyra Jennings pointed us to the House's oil drilling legislation in 2009 as proof. That year, state Rep. Dean Cannon -- who is set to become Speaker -- filed a bill that would allow the governor and cabinet to award oil and natural gas leases in state waters between three and 10 miles offshore. The bill passed the House 70-43 but stalled in the Senate. From soup to nuts, how long did it take House legislators to consider and approve the measure? The state keeps a thorough log that follows the progress of legislation. PolitiFact Florida went back to track HB 1219, the Cannon oil drilling bill. The bill originally was filed on Feb. 26, 2009, but that's misleading. The original bill only asked the Department of Environmental Protection to develop a plan for the implementation of an oil and natural gas drilling program. Cannon, of Winter Park, didn't unveil the final oil drilling language until April 20 (a Monday night), hours before it was scheduled to be considered by a House Policy Council. The Orlando Sentinel called Cannon's language a "surprise," when it was introduced. The Pensacola News-Journal reported that it "caught opponents off guard." In an editorial, the St. Petersburg Times called the act a "shameful" oil drilling ploy. The language, which was supported by oil drilling proponents such as the Associated Industries of Florida, passed out of the Policy Council 17-7. It was sent to the House floor the next day, a Wednesday. From the Times editorial: "Cannon sprang the radical idea to allow oil rigs within 3 miles of the coast in the eighth week of a nine-week legislative session. And he did it even as the House has failed to consider the governor's plan to foster renewable energy. Florida needs more than 10 days to consider changing a law that has protected its shores for decades, and the Senate and governor should reject it. "Clearly, Associated Industries of Florida has been working with Cannon for weeks to try to reverse a 20-year drilling ban -- though Cannon unveiled it just 12 hours before it passed a House council Tuesday. A pollster hired to do a survey, an industry expert from Texas and an Orlando economist touting potential revenue all testified. Cannon contended HB 1219 is merely an attempt 'to have a mature, thoughtful conversation about what we want to do about this.' So why is the public just now hearing about it?" Once on the House floor, HB 1219 was read three times as required. The first reading came on April 22 (a Wednesday), the second on April 24 (a Friday). The bill was read a third time, and amendments were considered on April 27 (the following Monday). The bill passed at 4:40 p.m. We should make clear that the Cannon legislation didn't directly allow oil and natural gas exploration in Florida waters; rather, it permitted the governor and cabinet to allow drilling. Another step would have been required. Regardless, the bill language was first made public on a Monday night and initially looked at by legislators the next morning. It passed the the following Monday. Total time in the hopper: Five working days. The special session to consider the oil drilling constitutional amendment was scheduled to last four days. Of course, it lasted just a few hours. In chastising Republican lawmakers, state CFO Alex Sink said the House "shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling."

pomt-08580	A defense bill "includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions on demand."	false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/27/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-annual-defense-authorization-/	Republican senators, including John Cornyn of Texas, last week charged Democrats with tacking politically-loaded amendments onto a defense bill. In a Sept. 21 press release announcing his decision to vote against a motion to take up the bill, Cornyn accused the body's majority party of attaching "language to the bill that represents a blatant attempt to score last-minute votes just weeks before an election. The bill includes language that would require military hospitals to provide abortions on demand." The motion failed after a 56-43 vote that same day. We wondered later if indeed language attached by Democrats would require military hospitals to provide abortions "on demand." First, some background: The Department of Defense is barred from spending federal funds to perform abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger. The only other instances that abortions can be performed in military facilities are in cases of rape or incest, though the woman must pay for the procedure herself. In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed a memorandum allowing abortions at military facilities if they were paid for with private funds, according to a 2002 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. In 1996, Republicans, who then controlled Congress, imposed the current limits, in that year's version of the defense authorization bill. It has stood ever since. The law affects some 200,000 active-duty female personnel, according to the nonpartisan Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. Heather Boonstra, a senior policy analyst at the Institute, told us that about 50,000 servicewomen are stationed overseas. How did the new language per the abortion limits emerge? In May, Sen. Roland Burris, D-Ill., introduced an amendment to the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2011. Burris' amendment, adopted by a Senate committee, would repeal the restrictions on privately-funded abortions in military facilities. Burris said in a May 27 press release: "It is critical that we provide the highest quality care for our service members while they are serving our nation overseas, and that includes allowing women and their families the right to choose at facilities operated under the Department of Defense." Jim O'Connor, a spokesman for Burris, told us the amendment "removes language prohibiting these health services from being offered on military bases, nothing more," he said. "It does not compel doctors to perform these procedures." Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, applauded the amendment at the time, saying: "The (committee) vote repealing this discriminatory and dangerous ban is the first step to ensuring that servicewomen can use their own private money for abortion care when they are serving overseas." So, under the amendment, it appears military hospitals would be permitted to perform abortions in more cases than currently allowed. But Boonstra objected to Cornyn's statement that the amendment "requires" military hospitals to provide abortions. "What it does is lift a ban on military hospitals to perform abortions," she said. "Nothing compels a military hospital or facility to do that. ... The idea that military hospitals would have to set up special mechanisms to provide these abortions just isn't the case." Kevin McLaughlin, Cornyn's spokesman, pointed to a White House statement supporting the amendment, which it said "would restore a policy to ensure that servicewomen and military dependents — including nearly 50,000 servicewomen stationed overseas — have the ability to obtain abortion services using their own, private funds." However, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich told us that the amendment "does not require military facilities to provide abortions." The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service states that the changes that Clinton ordered allowing abortions in military hospitals "did not necessarily have the effect of greatly increasing access to abortion services. Abortions are generally not performed at military medical facilities in the continental United States." Further, the report notes that few abortions had been performed abroad because the "military follows the prevailing laws and rules of foreign countries regarding abortion" and because "the military has had a difficult time finding health care professional in uniform willing to perform the procedure." Next, we turned to the second part of Cornyn's statement. Would servicewomen get abortions "on demand," as Cornyn puts it? McLaughlin said the senator means there would be "no questions asked" as opposed to current policy which restricts abortion procedures to women who are pregnant as a result of rape, incest or if her life would be endangered if she carried the pregnancy to term. Others have suggested that if the amendment passes into law, abortions wouldn't always be available. In a September article published in the Guttmacher Policy Review, Rachel Natelson, the legal and policy adviser at Service Women's Action Network, which advocates for military women, is quoted saying: "Even if the amendment were adopted, the longstanding ban on the use of federal funds for abortion at military facilities would remain. And for military women stationed overseas who rely on the government for their health care, access to abortion services would remain significantly challenged." Boonstra, who wrote the article, told us the military has a "conscience clause" that allows physicians to refuse to perform abortions if they have a moral objection. In late 2008, the Bush administration issued a rule stating that federally-funded health workers could decline to perform an abortion or any health care practice that encroaches on that person's "religious belief or moral conviction." Opponents said the regulation was so broad that doctors could refuse any treatment. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a May 28 news conference that the Burris amendment means abortions "have got to be prepaid" out of pocket and would be "only done on a voluntary basis by a doctor. There is no requirement, in other words, that doctors in military hospitals perform the abortions." Where does that leave us? The defense bill stalled before the Senate includes language allowing military hospitals to provide abortions in cases beyond the existing permissible instances of rape, incest or when the mother's life is endangered. But allowing is not the same as requiring. Contrary to Cornyn's claim, we see no mandate in the proposed change. As for military hospitals performing abortions "on demand," there are so many conditions on availability — even with the amendment — that Cornyn's description goes too far. We find the statement False.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2010-09-27T06:00:00	2010-09-21	['None']
pomt-03930	If the sequester hits, "hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequester-would-cut-vaccinations/	In a recent speech, President Barack Obama said that key health programs will be cut if the sequester -- an across-the-board federal spending cut -- takes effect as scheduled on March 1, 2013. "Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings," Obama said. We wondered if his dire claim was accurate. First, let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.) The uniform cuts must be applied to any "program, project or activity" that isn’t otherwise exempted. However, within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. They have discretion to move money around within a program. When we asked about looming cuts to immunization and cancer screening, administration officials pointed us to a report released by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies. The report sought to quantify cuts in a variety of programs overseen by the committee. We should note that the report was released by the subcommittee’s Democratic majority, chaired by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is generally an ally of the president. The report addresses possible cuts to two programs relevant to Obama’s claim. One, the Section 317 immunization program, is a grant program to states and cities, providing vaccines to underinsured children and adults. According to the subcommittee, it would serve 211,958 fewer children if the sequester takes effect. The other is the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, which aids underserved women nationwide. A sequester would leave 33,816 fewer women screened for breast and cervical cancer, according to the subcommittee’s estimate. So, combined, these two programs by themselves would affect nearly 246,000 people. But it's important to note that Obama's language was imprecise enough to suggest that people may lose their access to primary care doctors outright, which would be a much broader hit than cutbacks to flu shots and cancer screenings. There is no indication that Americans will lose their insurance coverage or access to all primary care because of the sequester; Medicaid, to cite just one example, is spared from cuts entirely. But Obama's phrasing could leave a different impression. Meanwhile, a few factors could make the estimate for immunization and cervical screening too high. The subcommittee’s report was issued in July 2012 using an estimated 7.8 percent cut, a bigger reduction than the 5.3 percent cut now envisioned for domestic discretionary programs. In addition, a CDC spokesman confirmed that the vaccine and cancer-screening programs are counted as individual "programs," meaning that each will each need to be cut by the uniform amount. However, federal managers will have some room for juggling spending priorities within each program -- moves that could decrease the number of people affected. In addition, these two programs are grants to states, and state (or local) officials would have a say in how to spend the money. Still, the room for either federal, state or local officials to maneuver would likely be pretty limited. And there’s also reason to believe the numbers of people affected could be even higher, since this estimate doesn’t include additional programs at risk of cuts, such as the CDC’s Colorectal Cancer Control Program. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said he has a problem with all "doomsday scenarios" like the one that Obama (and Harkin) are promoting, because they amount to a "straw man" that "fails to point to the simple solution -- to give agencies flexibility but keep the cuts in place." Still, Ellis said he considers the subcommittee’s calculations reasonable given the information Harkin had available. Our ruling Obama said that if the sequester hits, "hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings." Obama's words could have left the impression that primary care services overall will be lost, rather than flu shots or cancer screenings alone. Still, we found that one widely cited estimate found that sequester cuts to two programs alone would leave 246,000 people without the types of services Obama mentioned. There’s a lot of uncertainty about these numbers for a variety of reasons, meaning the actual number could be lower or higher. But even at the low end, it’s pretty close to "hundreds of thousands." So we rate the claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-02-21T16:56:19	2013-02-19	['United_States']
pomt-05875	A bill delaying the start of classes until Labor Day would permit school districts "to shave 5 full weeks off the school year."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/09/marc-schare/could-ohio-schools-really-cut-five-weeks-classes-u/	Imagine if Ohio's lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer lasted longer. Now imagine that a vote of the General Assembly could make it happen. That, in a sense, is the idea behind House Bill 191 -- at least for Ohio schools. The legislation would delay the start of the school year until Labor Day and end it before Memorial Day. It also would change the formula for figuring a minimum school year. Now districts are required to schedule 182 days. The legislation would change that to require schools be in session 910 hours, for kindergarten through grade 6, and 1,001 hours for grades 7 through 12. Rep. Bill Patmon, a Cleveland Democrat, co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Bill Hayes, a Republican from Licking County, east of Columbus. Hayes told The Columbus Dispatch the primary intent of a longer summer break was to help tourism and recreation, the state's third-largest industry -- "and also generate revenue for the state, part of which gets passed down to the school." Representatives of the Ohio School Boards Association, the Ohio Association of School Business Officials and a local school district testified against HB 191 before the House Education Committee on Feb. 1. Marc Schare of the Worthington Board of Education, which passed a resolution asking the General Assembly and Gov. Kasich to reject the bill, said it would "cause a significant reduction to the quality of education" in Ohio. He said that would allow Worthington schools to reduce the number of days to 151 from the current 178. "You are essentially allowing us to shave five full weeks off the school year," Schare said. PolitiFact Ohio feared for the integrity of the space-time continuum. We wondered how starting classes after Labor Day would trim the school year more than a month -- especially after Hayes claimed the bill could lengthen the year in "many districts." We called Schare. He explained his reasoning and pointed us to the more detailed testimony posted on his website. First, he noted, HB 191 converts the minimum school year from days to hours using a 5.5 hours for a standard secondary-school day, excluding lunch. That works out to a minimum school year of 979 hours, or 178 days. (The minimum year of 182 days -- or 1,001 hours at 5.5 hours per day -- includes days when classes aren't in session because of parent-teacher conferences or professional programs.) In his district of Worthington, Schare said, the school day at the secondary level is 6.5 hours. A chart from The Columbus Dispatch that he posted online with his testimony shows that most of the districts in Central Ohio have similar school days. "This means that in a typical year, under this legislation, we would be in school 178 hours above the minimum, which works out to around 27 days," he said. "In other words, this legislation is giving Worthington carte blanche to reduce the number of days in our school district calendar from 178 to 151 days. "Running the calculation another way for clarity, if we take the minimum number of hours -- 979 -- and divide it by our school day length of 6.5, we get 150 and change. "You are," he concluded, "essentially permitting us to shave 5 full weeks off the school year." Schare said his larger concern is that districts would start dropping days off the school year. "Virtually every district is at the minimum days now," he told the committee. "Eventually they would get there (to a new, shorter minimum) through collective bargaining or because of financial constraints." He pointed to the experience of Michigan, which in 2003 replaced a 180-day minimum school year with a 1,098-hour requirement. Even though that level is nearly 10 percent higher than the one in HB 191, 98 percent of Michigan's districts shortened the school year within three years. To stop the erosion, Michigan's legislature last year set a new minimum -- of just 165 days. We won’t speculate whether that would indeed happen in Ohio. HB 191 has not yet even cleared the Ohio House, let alone win Senate passage and the governor’s signature. And knowing how schools would then react would require the ability to predict the future. As for Schare's claim about what the bill would allow, his calculations check out. While the numbers he used apply specifically to his Worthington district, he shows in his posted testimony that most districts in central Ohio would feel similar results. Regardless, in the statement we're checking, Schare said only that HB 191 would permit the 5-week shorter year, not require it. On the Truth-O-Meter, Schare's statement rates True.

pomt-03020	Amanda Murphy has "two vacation homes around the world."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/12/citizens-fairness/campaign-mailer-says-amanda-murphy-has-two-vacatio/	The race to succeed Mike Fasano in the state House is producing a glut of attack ads, including two recent mailers that stand out. One claims that Democrat Amanda Murphy is out of touch with average voters and wouldn't be available, literally, because she'll be at her "Cancun vacation home." The other says Republican Bill Gunter would "drain millions" from public education and give the money to for-profit schools. With the House District 36 election set for Oct. 15, 2013, PolitiFact Florida decided to test the accuracy of these noteworthy mailers. Here, we'll examine the ad claiming that Murphy has two vacation homes. (We'll look at the attack on Gunter's views on public education in a separate fact-check.) The ad attacking Murphy is personal in tone. Above a picture of a beach dotted with cabanas overlooking crystal-blue water, it says: "Amanda Murphy: Out to lunch — at her Cancun vacation home." It continues: "It's bad enough we can't trust Amanda Murphy with our money, but with two vacation homes around the world, can Amanda Murphy really relate to the challenges we face?" Like the other ad, it showed up in mailboxes a couple of weeks ago. Citizens for Fairness, an electioneering communications organization based in Melbourne, produced the ad. Efforts to reach the group's chairperson, Carmella K. Falcone, were unsuccessful. We can't rate whether Murphy is trustworthy "with our money" on the Truth-O-Meter, but voters may find her financial disclosures informative. State Division of Elections reports indicate she earned $176,047 last year as an investment adviser at Raymond James Financial. She earns well more than the average Pasco resident. Her income is roughly three times higher than the $51,000 median family income in Pasco, according to U.S. Census data. Her biggest asset is her house in New Port Richey, valued at $157,480. Based on August sales data, her home is worth about 65 percent more than the average New Port Richey home valued at about $95,000. Here's where the ad veers from the truth: Murphy's net worth is listed as $243,817 and includes a $12,900 timeshare in a Cocoa Beach condominium and half a timeshare worth $7,362 in a condo in Cabo San Lucas on Mexico's Baja California peninsula. A time share — which typically entitles the owner to a week or two of use of the space each year — is hardly comparable to owning a second (or third) home in a pricey vacation spot. So the claim she has "two vacation homes around the world," including in Cancun, is misleading. It suggests Murphy owns the homes when in fact she owns a time share in a Florida condo and half a share in a condo in Cabo San Lucas — not in Cancun, which is on the Yucatán Peninsula about 1,480 miles to the east. Elsewhere, the ad calls Murphy a "Wall Street broker," suggesting she works among the financial giants far removed the problems of Pasco voters. It's true Raymond James is a brokerage, but it's a regional brokerage based in St. Petersburg, not in New York City. Murphy works out of the company's Tampa office. The ad attempts to portray Murphy as an out-of-touch millionaire but uses flimsy evidence to support that picture. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13753	"I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, ‘I will not raise taxes on the middle class.’"	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/23/hillary-clinton/clinton-wrongly-says-she-was-only-one-primaries-ni/	Hillary Clinton came to Virginia recently, promising to expand early childhood education programs, make community colleges free and ensure that students can go to universities without assuming debt. "People say to me, ‘OK, well how are you going to pay for it?’" she said during a July 14 rally at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale. "Well, we’re going to go where the money is. That means we’re going to raise taxes on the wealthy and those who can afford to pay." " ... But I’ll tell you this," she added. "I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, ‘I will not raise taxes on the middle class.’ And I mean that, and I won’t do it." Clinton began making that promise last fall, saying she would not raise taxes on those earning less than $250,000 a year. We wondered whether she was, in fact, the only candidate in the heavily populated Democratic and Republican presidential primary fields to make a no-tax-hike pledge to the middle class. We found that 13 of the 17 GOP candidates made promises last year that were far more encompassing than Clinton’s. They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone - including the middle class. Twelve of them last year signed no-tax pledges with Americans for Tax Reform, a fiscally conservative group founded by Grover Norquist. They promised to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses" and "any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." Last year’s 12 signers were Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Jim Gilmore, George Pataki and Rick Perry. A 13th GOP candidate, Mike Huckabee, signed a personal oath last year to oppose all tax increases. Two other Republican candidates had signed an Americans for Tax Reform’s no-tax pledge before last year: Lindsey Graham and Scott Walker. So contrary to Clinton’s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges - not just the middle class but everyone. Who were the two resisters? •Donald Trump, the ultimate GOP nominee, who said last year he didn’t want to sign the Americans for Tax Reform pledge because he "may want to switch taxes around." The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington says that Trump’s proposals would cut federal levies on the middle one-fifth of taxpayers by 4.9 percent. •Jeb Bush, who said he objects to written pledges. We searched debate transcripts and a variety of websites for any specific promises by Trump or Bush to shield the middle class from tax hikes, but we came up empty. We made similar searches for the four Democrats who opposed Clinton during the primaries. While each of them spoke about the hardships facing the middle class, we found no evidence of them specifically promising to oppose tax increases on the middle class. We asked Clinton’s for an explanation of Clinton’s claim and got a generic response. "Hillary Clinton’s policies, including her pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, would build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top," Josh Schwerin, a campaign spokesman, replied in an email. Our ruling Clinton said, "I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, ‘I will not raise taxes on the middle class.’" Fifteen of the 17 Republican presidential candidates signed pledges not to raise taxes on anyone, which includes the middle class. Thirteen of those candidates signed the vow last year; the other three inked such a pledge earlier in their careers.

pomt-04091	The state budget proposal has been submitted "on time and [it's] the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/18/lincoln-chafee/rhode-island-gov-lincoln-chafee-says-he-submitted-/	Just 16 days into the new year, Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee went before the General Assembly to offer his third State of the State address and talk about his proposed $8.2-billion 2013-2014 budget. Earlier in the day he released details of his budget package to the media and by the next day, his complete budget had been posted online. During his Jan. 16 speech to members of the House and Senate, Chafee declared, "I submit this budget to the General Assembly on Jan. 16th – on time and the earliest that a governor has done so in over two decades." State law requires governors to submit their budgets to the legislature by the third Thursday in January (or the first Thursday in February if it's their first year in office). Chafee beat that deadline by one day. Submitting a budget early sounds like a good thing. At a briefing for reporters, Chafee’s director of administration, Richard Licht, said the early submittal reflected the discipline the governor has tried to bring to the whole budget process. And it will give the General Assembly more time to analyze it properly. We wondered whether Chafee's claim that his budget is the earliest to be submitted in more than two decades was true. We called his office to ask for their evidence. Meanwhile, we turned to the always-helpful Thomas Evans, the state librarian. Evans doesn't keep track of when a governor's budget is released, but he had data for when governors gave their State of the State/budget addresses and when their proposed budgets were submitted as legislation. It turns out, there can be a big gap between the two. For example, in 1989, the second year on Evans' list, Gov. Edward DiPrete addressed the General Assembly on Jan. 4, yet his budget bill wasn't introduced until March 1. In the previous 25 years, no governor has submitted a budget bill by the original deadline set by state law, according to Evans' data. (Extensions were written into the law for budgets submitted from 2005-2007 and for 2011 and 2012). Usually submission comes sometime in February. In eight years it was in March and in one year -- 1991 when Gov. Bruce Sundlun was dealing with the banking crisis -- it came April 9. We confirmed Evans’ dates using The Journal's archives and found that details of the budget are usually released a day or two before the budget bill is introduced. "The earliest the budget bill itself has been submitted in the last 25 years is Feb. 1," said Evans. That was in 2005 and 2007 (during the administration of Gov. Donald Carcieri) and 2012 (Chafee's second year). Chafee's budget bill is on his website and Chafee spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger said it has been sent to the House. However, it has not been officially introduced and referred to a committee for analysis. Said Hunsinger: "We hope they will introduce it Tuesday," That would be Jan. 22, still ten days earlier than the previous record. We rate Chafee's claim True.

Alan Grayson -- the man who described the Republican Party's health care plan as "die quickly" and who later equated the health care system to an American holocaust, who suggested former vice president Dick Cheney was a vampire who could turn into a bat and fly away at a moment's notice, and who said putting Republicans in charge of government was akin to making members of al-Qaida pilots -- is making another series of eye-catching claims. Grayson, an Orlando-area Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight against former Florida House speaker Daniel Webster, launched a stinging television attack Sept. 25, 2010.

Female narrator: "Daniel Webster wants to impose his radical fundamentalism on us." Background type: Daniel Webster wants to MAKE DIVORCE ILLEGAL. Webster: "You should submit to me. That's in the Bible." Female narrator: "Webster tried to deny battered women medical care and the right to divorce their abusers." Webster: "Submit to me." Female narrator: "He wants to force raped women to bear the child." Webster: "Submit to me." Female narrator: "Taliban Daniel Webster. Hands off our bodies. And our laws." The ad is fertile ground for fact-checkers. In an earlier item, we found that Grayson used some heavy-handed editing to take Webster's words out of context. We rated a claim that "Daniel Webster thinks wives should submit to their husbands" as False. In this item, we wanted to examine two other sweeping allegations in the ad -- that Webster wants to make divorce illegal and that he tried to deny battered women the right to divorce their abusers. Both claims in the Grayson ad come with an attached footnote: "SOURCE: House Bill 1586 (1990)." So that's where we'll start. The Florida Legislature maintains an excellent online bill database, but only back to 1998. For House records from 1990, we turned to the State Archives of Florida. Researchers there told us that Grayson cites the wrong bill. Webster, who was a deputy minority whip in the state House in 1990, filed another bill, HB 1585. It deals with marriage, researchers said. But the State Archives didn't have a copy. The Capitol Branch Library did. Researchers there provided PolitiFact Florida with a copy of the original filed version of HB 1585. The bill, according to the House summary, "creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery." Florida law currently allows married couples to divorce if a court finds that the marriage is "irretrievably broken." It's a common standard throughout the country. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Enter Webster and his 1990 legislation creating a voluntary "covenant marriage." Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring: "I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me." The covenant marriage agreement "may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery," according to the bill Webster filed. "A divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery if the defendant has been guilty of adultery, but if it appears that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties with the intent to procure a divorce, or if it appears that both parties have been guilty of adultery, a divorce shall not be granted," HB 1585 reads. The bill includes no mention of physical abuse. It also discusses alimony, noting that "no alimony shall be granted to an adulterous wife," but makes no mention about the alimony rights of an adulterous man. Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote, researchers at the State Archives and the Capitol Branch Library said. But Webster's proposal helped launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. Hawkins said Webster's proposal was the "original" covenant marriage bill, though it never went anywhere in the legislative process. Three states have since adopted some form of voluntary covenant marriage, Hawkins said, but all are demonstrably different than what Webster proposed for Florida. In 1997, Louisiana became the first state to offer covenant marriage. Under the Louisiana law, couples who select a covenant marriage can divorce 180 days after being legally separated, if either spouse has committed a felony, or for adultery. Arizona followed in 1998 with an even broader covenant marriage law. Besides adultery and committing a crime, couples can divorce over drug or alcohol abuse, over sexual or physical abuse, and if, simply, both spouses agree to a divorce. In Arkansas, which passed its law in 2001, couples who participate in covenant marriage can divorce for a variety of reasons -- adultery, physical or sexual abuse, or if someone in the marriage committed a felony. On top of that, married couples can divorce after a period of separation (between 12 and 30 months, depending on the case). Webster's proposal was "significantly more restrictive and less sensitive to other 'justifiable' reasons for divorce such as abuse, addiction, imprisonment, abandonment, etc.," Hawkins said. What has been the outcome of covenant marriages in the states where they are allowed? We asked John W. Senner at the Health Statistics Branch of the Arkansas Department of Health. From 2002-2007, 1,358 couples have agreed to enter covenant marriage, compared to almost 218,000 who haven't. That means about .6 percent of all marriages in Arkansas are covenant marriages. (Old marriages that were converted to covenant marriage aren't tracked by the state, Senner said.) And though the sample size is small, couples who enter into covenant marriage are less likely to divorce. From 2002-2007, 4.4 percent of couples who enter covenant marriage wound up divorced compared with 6.5 percent for those who don't. Back to Grayson's claim. In his ad "Taliban Dan Webster," Grayson says that Webster wants to make divorce illegal, even for abused wives. Here are the facts. When Webster was a member of the Florida House, he introduced a bill that would have created something called covenant marriage. This special form of marriage was entirely voluntary, but if couples agreed to it, they would not be able to divorce under state law except in the case of adultery. The bill did not list physical or sexual abuse as grounds for divorce. Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. It wouldn't even make divorce for all people who chose covenant marriage entirely illegal. There's a small window out for adultery. But Grayson is right that there was no protection in Webster's marriage bill for abused wives. So, in theory, someone who chose covenant marriage and was being abused might not be granted a divorce. Because all of that context is critical to understanding Grayson's claim, we rate it Half True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2010-09-28T14:39:26	2010-09-25	['None']

pomt-06534	Say water fluoridation started in Nazi Germany ghettos and death camps to pacify the Jews.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/oct/06/critics-water-fluoridation/truth-about-fluoride-doesnt-include-nazi-myth/	Here's a reason to support a Florida county's decision to cut fluoride out of its drinking water: The idea came from the Nazis. The Nazis put fluoride in water to pacify Jews during World War II, a local resident told members of the Pinellas County Commission on Oct. 4, 2011, before the commission voted 4-3 vote to stop fluoridating water for about 700,000 residents. "History shows, actually, that in Nazi Germany, one of the first things that they did was add fluoride to the water in the ghettos where the Jews stayed," Matt Leffler of Clearwater said. Once the St. Petersburg Times published its story about the decision — similar, anonymous comments on the Web piled up: "Do you guys know where water fluoridation started? In the death camps in WWII." "There have been many links to cancer going back to the original tests on fluoride done by the Nazis on the Jews." "It IS what they used to dull their brains!! They used it in the concentration camps. It was in the concentration camps that they also developed many anti-psychotics." One reader declared the Nazi-fluoride connection "an absolute historical fact." Several readers linked to sources on the Web. Certainly Nazis, who killed millions of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, were known for chemical tests and inhumane medical experiments. So PolitiFact Florida had to know: Did that include adding fluoride to water? We tracked down roots of these claims on the Web, reached out to Holocaust historians, contacted well-known critics of water fluoridation, and read book excerpts and magazine articles and news stories. And we can tell you: There's no teeth to this claim. This fact-check won't explore the pros and cons of fluoride in your drinking water — though we will note the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the practice one of the greatest public health achievements of the century. And also that groups of citizens, scientists among them, have been wary of the practice since the 1950s. We'll focus instead on an Internet meme that's crept into the local public debate over drinking water — one that well-known fluoridation critics would like to see washed away. "We have done our level best to discourage opponents of fluoridation from using this emotive argument," said Paul Connett, a chemist who directs the anti-fluoridation group Fluoride Action Network and recently co-authored a book called The Case Against Fluoride. "The historical evidence for this assertion is extremely weak. It is sad that the U.S. media has done such a bad job of educating the public on this issue that it is so easy for crazy ideas to fill the vacuum." • • • So where does the story come from? Andy Hollinger, who handles media relations at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, tried not to laugh as we explained our fact-check. "I can almost guarantee you that is indeed an urban myth," he said. "... That sounds like Conspiracy Theory 101." But he humored us, putting historian Patricia Heberer on the phone. Her expertise is the German medical community, including Holocaust-era experimentation. Most Nazi medical experiments, she said, had two themes: new drugs and treatments for common battlefield ailments, from war wounds to typhus, or the more infamous effort to underpin Nazi racial ideas, such as Josef Mengele's twin studies. None of the experimentation that she knows of involved fluoride — for mind control or for healthy teeth. Meanwhile, in the concentration camp system, as in the ghettos, it would have been surprising if fluoride delivery was a focus — in the final few days before liberation, water lines scarcely delivered water. So, water treated just for the Jews? "I can't see it," she said. But she had heard a similar Cold War-era theory. It wasn't about the Nazis fluoridating water. It was the Communists. • • • Still, do an Internet search for "fluoride" and "Nazis," and you'll find articles such as "Nazi Connections to Fluoride in America's Drinking Water." The text appears on various sites, and includes the citations "Stephen 1995," and "Bryson 2004." "Stephen 1995" is likely Ian E. Stephens, author of a 1987 self-published booklet, an extract of which was published in Nexus Magazine in 1995. We tracked down a copy of the article from the magazine's website, an alternative Australian publication covering "health breakthroughs, future science and technology, suppressed news, free energy, religious revisionism, conspiracy, the environment, history and ancient mysteries, the mind, UFOs, paranormal and the unexplained." It's called "Fluoridation: Mind Control of the Masses?" And in it we meet government research worker Charles Eliot Perkins, who at the end of World War II purportedly learned from a big German chemical producer that it had developed a plan to fluoridate occupied countries. "Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him," says a document quoted in the excerpt. "Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile." "Bryson 2004" is Christopher Bryson, an investigative reporter and television producer who reported on Guatemalan human rights abuses for the BBC World Service, National Public Radio and the Atlanta Journal Constitution in the 1980s, and later wrote a book called The Fluoride Deception. It delves into murky connections between military-industrial fluoride polluters and the early push for public water fluoridation. His book mentions Nazis or Nazism less than 10 times, and none of the references discuss water fluoridation. We contacted him. "I never came across any documentation or credible information showing that fluoride was used in Nazi death camps," he said. • • • In 2009, two scientists published a book called The Fluoride Wars: How a Modest Public Health Measure Became America's Longest Running Political Melodrama. The hydrologists dedicate more than 30 pages to conspiracy theories and their origins. We contacted one of them. "The World War II death camp statement is an absurd lie," said Jay Lehr, who has authored or co-authored more than 30 books, most of them self-described "boring science books for scientists." The Fluoride Wars instead presents a lively social history of the fluoridation debate in the United States. And it starts with the first large-scale fluoridation in history, not in Europe, but in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1945. • • • Given the topic, it seems appropriate to conclude with Wikipedia, where we found mention of Nazis and fluoride — in an article listing conspiracy theories: Fluoridation is alternately part of a "Communist, Fascist or New World Order or Illuminati plot to take over the world." It was "pioneered by a German chemical company to make people submissive to those in power." It was "used in Russian prison camps and produces schizophrenia." Our Holocaust historian knew of no such project. Two book authors who researched the topic, one a journalist, the other a hydrologist, found no credible evidence of such a connection. A leading anti-fluoridation activist repudiates the story. The most commonly cited Web source for the story was a 16-year-old extract in a fringe Australian publication.

pomt-13183	"We have almost 68,000 Georgia students who are required by law to attend a chronically failing school."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2016/oct/26/nathan-deal/deal-close-numbers-about-failing-schools/	With early voting already underway, Georgia voters have an important decision to make besides president. A proposal, called Amendment 1, would allow the state to take over schools considered "chronically failing." Gov. Nathan Deal has led the charge to pass the statewide proposal, which has drawn criticism from community leaders and professional educators. At a recent education conference in Atlanta, Deal said, "We have almost 68,000 Georgia students who are required by law to attend a chronically failing school." PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. We found the numbers are a little more complicated than they may seem. The Data An October poll showed likely voters siding nearly 2-1 against Amendment 1. Last month, a class-action lawsuit was filed against proponents of the bill, including Deal, over the language in the "Opportunity School District" ballot question. We reached out to Deal’s office and his spokesperson, Jen Talaber Ryan, sent us a PDF with the schools included on the chronically failing list, with the majority of the schools in the metro Atlanta area. Thing is, several of the schools included on the list, which was last updated in May, have closed or been consolidated this school year for a number of reasons. Deal says 68,000 students are required by law to attend a failing school. Students are in fact zoned for these schools, but options for private schools, charter schools and homeschooling exist. The 68,000 number is a sum of the enrollment at the near 130 schools eligible, as of May, to be taken over by the state if the amendment passes. (The maximum number of schools that could be in the district is 100.) The number is based off of last school year’s enrollment, but fails to account for about a dozen schools that closed or consolidated at the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year. In an email, GOSA spokesperson Martha Ann Todd said the total number of schools and enrollment for this school year would not be available until December. The amendment will be voted on in the Nov. 8 general election. A rough comparison of numbers by PolitiFact Georgia suggests a few thousand students would be unaffected by the takeover because their schools no longer exist. The issue Georgia schools have long been a contentious issue. About 60 percent of Georgia public school students are eligible for free and reduced lunch, a poverty measure used by the state department of education. This proposal would affect about 4 percent of Georgia public school students. Most OSD-eligible schools have more than 35 percent of students living in poverty. Deal has set out to reform poorly performing schools through this new district headed by a governor-appointed superintendent. Last year, the Republican-led Georgia Assembly passed a bill outlining the takeover of schools if they score below a number set by GOSA on a scale. Georgia uses the College & Career-Ready Performance Index, a 0-110 rating scale, to measure school performance. CCRPI uses standardized test scores, attendance, graduation rates and other measures to gauge academic proficiency. GOSA said scoring below a 60 is failing. Schools scoring below 60 three years in a row are "chronically failing," and therefore could be taken over by the state if the amendment passes. The lawsuit, filed by a parent, a reverend and a teacher, against Deal, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp calls the language in the ballot question is "misleading" and alleges there is no research to back up creation of a state-run district. Though some of these gains are limited, the opponents’ suit also says, "the language describes the targeted schools as ‘failing’ while many of them have made as much or more progress on state school assessments as traditionally high performing schools." Our Ruling Deal said there are, "almost 68,000 Georgia students who are required by law to attend a chronically failing school." We ran the numbers -- and he’s right. There are about 68,000 students in these failing schools. But his administration sets the standard, its numbers are out of date and there are other options. Opponents also claim some of these "chronically failing" schools have made gains in recent years. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06273	"We have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-hezbollah-latin-america-poses-imm/	Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, asked during a Republican presidential debate in Washington to suggest an important national security issue that isn't getting enough attention, said Islamic terror group Hezbollah is "working throughout Latin America," including Mexico, "which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America." He wasn't the only one raising concern about the radical Shiite Muslim group's activity in Latin America at the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN debate. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum talked about "radical Islamists" joining with "militant socialists" in Central and South America. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said, "We know that Hamas and Hezbollah are working in Mexico, as well as Iran, with their ploy to come into the United States." We wondered: Was Romney right? Is the Lebanon-based group linked to the bombing of U.S. Marine barracks in 1983 networking just south of our border? The issue came up with a question from a visiting fellow from the American Enterprise Institute, one of the sponsors of the debate. "My question has to do with the unexpected," he said. "During the 2000 presidential debates, Gov. George W. Bush was never asked about the threat from al-Qaida, yet the battle with al-Qaida dominated his presidency. What national security issue do you worry about that nobody is asking about, either here or in any of the debates so far?" When it was Romney's turn to answer, he said: "Rick (Santorum), in my view, is right with regards to long-term security interests, and that's -- and that's China, although that's very much on our agenda. "Immediately, the most significant threat is, of course, Iran becoming nuclear. "But I happen to think Sen. Santorum is right with regards to the issue that doesn't get enough attention. That's the one that may come up that we haven't thought about, which is Latin America. Because, in fact, congressman, we have been attacked. We were attacked on 9/11. There have been dozens of attacks that have been thwarted by our -- by our security forces. And we have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America." Romney and Perry's campaigns each gave us the same source for their comments: An eight-page American Enterprise Institute paper from October 2011, "The Mounting Hezbollah Threat in Latin America." It begins: "Over the last several years Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran have greatly expanded their operations in Latin America to the detriment of inter-American security and U.S. strategic interests. Today, Hezbollah is using the Western Hemisphere as a staging ground, fundraising center, and operational base to wage asymmetric warfare against the United States. Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and other anti-American governments in the region have facilitated this expansion by rolling out the welcome mats for Hezbollah and Iran." But we spent a day digging into the claim and found the support was pretty flimsy. The paper actually provides little evidence that operational cells for Hezbollah are truly active in Mexico and Latin America. It says Hezbollah uses the region to raise money that is channeled back to Lebanon. The strongest evidence for Hezbollah fundraising, money-laundering and other "terrorist-related" activities in Latin America dates from the mid 1980s, when the group began using as a haven the tri-border area beween Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. A March 2010 Congressional Research Service report has also noted Hezbollah's presence there — where it reportedly profited from music piracy operations — along with groups such as Hamas, the Chinese Triads and Korean and Taiwanese syndicates. But the report, "International Terrorism and Transnational Crime: Security Threats, U.S. Policy, and Considerations for Congress," focuses primarily on the group's fundraising in the Western hemisphere — not operational support for the group. While millions of dollars are channeled back to Lebanon every year by criminal enterprises, those operations aren't typically owned or operated by Hezbollah members, the report says. Instead, the criminals are donors who support the group for religious, ideological or personal reasons. But activity that "poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America," as Romney said? On that point, the report is significantly more measured: "It is important to note that while these criminal sympathizers do not directly participate in or provide operational support for Hezbollah’s terrorist activity, that potential exists, security experts believe. If the organization decided to attack U.S. or Israeli interests in West Africa or South America, it is possible that these sympathizers could play a concrete role." Romney wasn't just talking about Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. In fact, he singled out Venezuela and Mexico. On Venezuela, the AEI paper sounds a stronger alarm -- even though it offers relatively little solid evidence to justify the strong language. Discussing the "mounting Hezbollah threat," it says that Hezbollah acts as a proxy for Iran, and thus a developing alliance between Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez has meant a new safe haven for the Islamic group. Research by the paper's authors, Roger Noriega and Jose Cardenas, identify "at least two parallel yet collaborative terrorist networks" growing in Latin America, primarily in Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina and Chile. They cite "open sources, subject-matter experts, and sensitive sources within various governments," but don't footnote this section of the paper. One is "operated by Hezbollah and aided by its collaborators" and the other "is managed by the Qods Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps." One pair of Lebanese brothers, the Nessereddines, reportedly launders money and has business dealings with Hezbollah and operates a paramilitary training camp on Margarita Island. A parallel recruiting network is overseen by Hojjat al-Eslam Mohsen Rabban, "the Terrorist Professor," described as the mastermind behind two attacks on Jewish targets in Buenos Aires in the early '90s that killed 144 people. "Despite being the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, Rabbani reportedly still operates in the region, traveling under false papers and connecting with his former disciples," the paper says. Then there's Mexico. "The immediate U.S. national security concern related to Hezbollah activity in Latin America is Mexico, where the terrorist group has ready access to the U.S. border," the paper says. "Principal Hezbollah activities there include human smuggling and narcotics trafficking. ... While there certainly have been no reported cases of Hezbollah smuggling operatives across the border to carry out terrorist attacks in the United States, it is neither 'sensationalist' nor 'alarmist' to be concerned about it and respond with appropriate policy measures." We reached out to Roger Noriega, one of the paper's authors and a former assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs under the Bush administration. Did Romney accurate characterize his work? "I think he and Rick Santorum had it right," he said. But he acknowledged the Mexico evidence was thin. "You will see that we focus on South America, not on Mexico, so references that others made to 'Hezbollah in Mexico' are more speculative and not yet confirmed," he said. Indeed, evidence in the Mexico section of the paper includes Hezbollah supporters picked up in the United States after traveling through Mexico and a Washington Times article from March 2009 that relied largely on unnamed sources. Then it ventures into the realm of a Tuscon (Arizona) Police Department memo "leaked by an Internet hacker group," that itself relies on secondary sources including the Examiner and Wikipedia. We looked for additional support for the idea of a "significant and imminent threat" to the United States posed by Hezbollah in Latin America. In 2008 speeches, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff mentioned Hezbollah's "presence" and "tentacles" that "reach across the globe," including in South America. "It also has a presence elsewhere in the world, including in South America, our own western hemisphere, where you'll remember some time back they actually carried out an operation against a Jewish facility in South America," he told the National Press Club. But his language wasn't as pointed as Romney's. A more recent report from the State Department report on the subject, "Country Reports on Terrorism 2010," published in August 2011, doesn't support Romney's claim. It says Islamic terror groups' Latin American involvement focuses on fundraising, not carrying out terrorist plots. "There were no known operational cells of either al-Qaida- or Hezbollah-related groups in the hemisphere," the report says, "although ideological sympathizers in South America and the Caribbean continued to provide financial and moral support to these and other terrorist groups in the Middle East and South Asia." We found other experts who have studied terrorism in the region who say the talk of Hezbollah in Latin America is overblown. Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution, who testified in 2009 for the House subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs on illicit economies, organized crime, and their impact on U.S. and global security, said, "Allegations of al-Qaida, Hamas, and Hezbollah contacts with the FARC or these groups' penetration of the Latin American drug trade have not proven robust." Another Brookings scholar, senior fellow on foreign policy Kevin Casas-Zamora, told PolitiFact, "Hezbollah roaming free in Latin America — that's a gross exaggeration." "Hugo Chavez does have close links to Iran, but I doubt it that they present a danger for U.S. national security," said Casas-Zamora, the former vice president of Costa Rica. "If Venezuela was indeed harboring a serious Hezbollah operation we would surely know it by now. The U.S. has had for years an official policy of toning down the confrontation with Chavez, but a serious terrorist threat is the one thing that the U.S. would not countenance." "My impression is that the Republican candidates are trying to crank up the volume of the confrontation with Chavez by accusing him of promoting terrorism as part of a more 'muscular' foreign policy. And they are also trying to blend the threat of drug trafficking with terrorism to justify continuation of an assistance program in Mexico, the results of which are rather debatable. Mixing up the issues of drug trafficking, Chavez and terrorism makes for good soundbites but it is both dangerous and sloppy from the policy standpoint." Our ruling Romney warned during the Republican presidential debate in Washington that "We have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America." While there's some evidence of Hezbollah sympathizers and fundraisers working in the tri-border area between Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay and perhaps even recruiters and trainers in Chavez-led Venezuela, there's little evidence for the group "working" in Mexico. Even less publicly supported is the idea of that presence amounting to a "very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America." The State Department confirms there are no known terror cells of al-Qaida or Hezbollah groups in our hemisphere. Romney was asked to recite a national security issue he worries "nobody is asking about." In this case, there might be a good reason. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-13863	Says Patrick Murphy has "taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jul/07/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-calls-out-patrick-murphy-wall-street-/	In the race for Marco Rubio’s Senate seat, Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson warned that Rep. Patrick Murphy’s campaign contributions from Wall Street make him far less progressive than what Democrats need in the upper chamber. Grayson made the comment during an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board June 30 when probed about why he doesn’t see eye-to-eye with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Grayson cited Schumer’s long history of Wall Street support to explain why their ideologies don’t connect. Then he hypothesized why Schumer backed Murphy over him. "Guess who has taken more money than any Democrat from Wall Street?" Grayson said, adding that the person was a "certain second-term congressman from Florida who serves in the financial services committee and has no standing in the committee other than the simple right to vote." He continued: "His name is Patrick Murphy, and he's taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader." Murphy, of Jupiter, has only been in Congress since 2013, after he switched his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat. We wondered if it was really possible that Murphy received so much money from Wall Street, and why. For this fact-check we’re only looking at direct contributions made to Murphy’s campaign committee, not super PACs or other organizations that can accept unlimited contributions on his behalf. 2016 contributions check out When looking at just the House, Grayson’s point checks out. But technically, Grayson’s statement to the editorial board said Murphy received more money than anyone else in Congress — which comprises two chambers. When you add senators into the mix, Murphy’s contributions from Wall Street-types rank No. 19 overall. (Not bad for 535 members, but still not No. 3) That said, it’s pretty clear from context that Grayson was limiting his statement to members of the House, and for some, the House is "Congress" and the Senate is the Senate. "​While Congress can — and probably should — mean both chambers, many people use ‘Congress’ to refer to the House, and Senate to refer to the Senate," said Christopher Mann, an associate professor in the political science department at Skidmore College. Senators typically receive more Wall Street money because there are fewer of them, so they have more impact on legislation. In addition, senators have more expensive races and therefore ask for more money. Let’s go back to the House. Grayson was referencing a study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that analyzes campaign donations, that showed Murphy received $1.41 million from the "finance, insurance and real estate" sector in the 2016 election cycle. That amount placed Murphy third among all members of the House, with Speaker Paul Ryan at No. 1 with nearly $2 million, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., at No. 2 with $1.58 million. For similar fact-checks, the Center for Responsive Politics has said the best method to find how much money is being donated by Wall Street workers is to look at a subset of this category, called the "securities and investment" sector. This subcategory captures the greatest number of companies associated with Wall Street, without the other fields under the "finance, insurance and real estate" umbrella. Even if you look at it this way, Murphy still places third for those kind of contributions among members of the House. Murphy received $352,500 from the securities and investment sector, according to a 2016 analysis from the Center for Responsive Politics. Ahead of Murphy is Ryan with $831,272 and McCarthy with $497,850. Murphy’s money from Wall Street-related industries amounts to about 4.5 percent of the $7.71 million he’s received so far. Why all the love? So why does Wall Street support Murphy so much? A couple of reasons. As Grayson said, Murphy is a member of the House Committee on Financial Services. Even though he is not a ranking member, he is on two subcommittees that deal with laws related to capital markets and another on monetary policy and trade. These industries want to be on Murphy’s "good side," Mann said. The bigger reason probably has more to do with Murphy’s goal and its location: The U.S. Senate, representing Florida. Florida is an "expensive state" for political races, Mann said, and Murphy is going to the industries he knows. Murphy has raised more money from three other sectors than Wall Street in his 2015-16 campaign. Murphy raised $721,969 from employees of law firms and lawyers, $595,238 from retirees, and $474,600 from the real estate industry. Also keep in mind that Grayson’s talking point only works for the 2015-16 election cycle. He didn’t specify a point in time for the donations. In his first bid for office in 2012, Murphy received $100,600 from the securities and investment sector. In his 2014 race, Murphy received $255,880 from the securities and investment sector, making him No. 22 among all House members. For the curious, the majority of Grayson’s $2.5 million in contributions comes from retirees, law firms and lawyers, miscellaneous issues, which includes a variety of groups that focus on a single-issue, non-profit institutions and real estate. Our ruling Grayson said Murphy has "taken more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress other than the speaker and the majority leader." Grayson is right that in the 2015-16 cycle, Murphy raised more money from employees of Wall Street-related fields than any other House member after the House speaker and majority leader. Murphy did not raise as much in his previous two congressional bids, but in context it is clear that Grayson was talking about their current race for the Senate.

pomt-06542	Says that to drive the length of the newly drawn 15th District "you’d find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/05/chris-redfern/ohio-dems-chair-chris-redfern-says-driving-new-15t/	Democratic Party chief Chris Redfern gets paid to take shots at Republicans. On Sept.15, Redfern had a juicy new target for his barbs -- a new congressional map that Republicans had rolled out the day before. It showed several sprawling districts winding through multiple counties to create solid GOP majorities. Prepared by Republicans staffers, the congressional map redrew Ohio’s 18 congressional districts into 16 districts — 12 Republican and four Democratic districts. It was attacked by Redfern (and other Democrats) who said the serpentine districts were mapped out purely for GOP partisan advantage. As he mocked the lines drawn by Republicans, Redfern highlighted the district that many independent observers found to be the clearest example of gerrymandering — the 15th Congressional District, which winds through portions of 13 counties and has a circumference of 934 miles. Now represented by Republican Steve Stivers, the district is shaped like the open jaws of a crocodile or a "reverse Pac-man," in Redfern’s words. "To drive from northern Union County to Athens to Hillsboro without leaving Steve’s district you’d find yourself on the road as long as it would take to drive from Columbus to Niagara Falls," Redfern told reporters at his news conference. Sure, the district is a sprawling one — but a greater drive time than to the Canadian border? PolitiFact Ohio gassed up the Ford Factfinder and see where the facts met the road. Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman shared the Google mapping he did to back up Redfern’s assertion. He forwarded a route which began in Essex in northern Union County winding through Madison, Franklin, Fairfield, and Perry Counties as it headed east. Heading due south into Athens County, the route then swung westward traveling though Vinton and Ross counties to end in Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County. Google maps spit out a total distance of 259 miles and said it would take nearly 6 hours — 5 hours and 58 minutes to traverse it. Meanwhile, Columbus to Niagara Falls, N.Y., is 349 miles -- mostly via freeway -- and a traveling time of six hours and one minute, according to Google Maps. PolitiFact Ohio scrutinized the Democratic route and it does follow the contours of Stivers’ new district. However, the Democrats did fudge one tiny part of their route — they took state routes through southern Franklin County that are near, but not actually in Stivers’ district. But they had to. Or you’d have to swim. "It’s so skinny at the southern edge of Franklin County that no road passes through it," The Columbus Dispatch reported Sept. 18, 2011. "He would have to swim across the Scioto River near the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant to travel from one end of his district to the other." Bringman acknowledged that the map was more of "an interpretation" of driving through the proposed district than actually doing it. "To navigate the Southern end of Franklin County in the proposed 15th District, one would need to drive off-road for about 5 km between Lynnbrook and Lockbourne and ford the Scioto River Oregon Trail-style," he wrote in an e-mail. "Depending on the vehicle being used, this could add some time to the trip. After passing Lockbourne, the driver may need to borrow a runway at Rickenbacker International Airport, assuming FAA approval." Additionally, it bears pointing out that the Democratic route is an attempt to get around Stivers district by staying wholly in the district at all times — it’s not how someone would actually travel to get from one point to another. For example, Stivers district includes only portions of U.S. 33, so you can’t use it to travel from Columbus to Athens even though it’s a direct link between the two cities. "He will be taking direct routes not only traveling within the lines of his district," said Courtney Whetstone, a staffer with Stivers’ Columbus congressional office. "There isn’t any part of his district farther than an hour and a half from his house." Redfern’s statement does include the phrase "without leaving Stivers’ district" but the twists and turns of the road embodied in that statement are not made clear. So after all this ramblin’ through Ohio, where do we end up? Google maps estimates Redfern’s route plotted through the "reverse Pac-man" district would take six hours to drive and that matches the estimated drive time from Columbus to Niagara Falls. The claim has to take a detour, though, because it’s not possible to drive through the new Ohio 15th in southern Franklin County. But then again, we can award points for context because the claim supports Redfern’s larger point -- that the boundaries for this sprawling district were drawn to achieve a political purpose. Lastly, it needs to be said that Redfern’s route is not the way that Stivers or anyone would travel from one part of the district to another. Rather, they would choose a direct route that crosses district boundaries and would be a much shorter drive. That’s a point that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Redfern’s claim Mostly True.	None	Chris Redfern	None	None	None	2011-10-05T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['Columbus,_Ohio', 'Niagara_Falls']

pomt-11766	The Senate GOP plan does not raise taxes for Americans earning less than $70,000.	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/nov/30/thom-tillis/nc-sen-tillis-says-plan-wont-raise-taxes-americans/	North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis says some in the media are twisting the truth about the Senate’s plan to change the tax code. Tillis held a news conference Wednesday morning with fellow Republican Sens. David Perdue of Georgia and Dean Heller of Nevada to tout and explain the Senate’s efforts. There, he said the plan will help most Americans who earn less than $70,000 a year – contrary to what a reporter suggested to him. "A reporter came up to me and said ‘Senator, how do you respond to the fact that people making $30,000, $50,000, $70,000 are going to be paying more in taxes?’ I said that’s patently untrue on the whole," Tillis told the crowd of reporters. He added that there may be outliers, and that he’s willing to address them at a later time. "You know, if you look at some sort of detailed circumstance, maybe there’s something that we need to work out once we see the implementation of the tax plan," he said. Tillis continued, saying he responded to the reporter’s follow-up by saying, "You need to understand tax policy, and I know that you don’t because you’ve never done it." A video is posted on Senate Republicans’ Facebook page. How does the Senate plan affect Americans who earn less than $70,000 a year? Does it help them, as Tillis suggests? First, a reminder. There are two tax plans being considered right now: a Senate plan and a House plan. PolitiFact recently published an explanation of both here. We’ll focus on the Senate plan, since that’s what Tillis was referring to. $450 tax cut Tillis may have expressed criticism of the media, but when we asked him to explain the changes the Senate plan promises, his office referred us to a fact-check published by The Washington Post on Nov. 2. The Post awarded "Four Pinocchios" – the worst possible rating – to Senate Democrats for claiming that the Senate plan would raise income taxes for those who earn less than $86,000 a year. Tillis’ assistant emailed only a link to the story, and sections of it where Post fact-checkers scolded Democrats. The Post found that the average tax cut for the lowest four quintiles of taxpayers -- that is, the bottom 80 percent of the income spectrum, or about 97 million households -- would be $450. However, a report by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee (which was the source of confusion for some critics) found that about 8 million households earning less than $86,100 would receive an average tax increase of $794. The Post found that the Democrats mangled their claim. We wanted to look specifically at whether Tillis's claim is accurate. Tax cuts for most – initially For starters, we should note that the Post’s fact-check relied on a "framework" assembled before the bills were finalized, so it’s not an analysis based on the most up-to-date versions of the bills. The Senate plan, like the House plan, breaks annual income into separate income ranges, so it’s hard to pinpoint how the plan would affect someone earning approximately $70,000. But analyses by various groups suggest that most Americans in the group Tillis described – those earning $30,000 to $70,000 a year – would get tax cuts over the next five to eight years. One of the most recent studies of the plan was conducted by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress that is comprised of expert economists, attorneys, and accountants who assist the majority and minority parties in both houses of Congress on tax legislation. The report, compiled on Nov. 27, shows that the plan would cut taxes for most taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $75,000 starting in 2019. That year, the JCT estimated 60 percent of people earning $30,000-$40,000 a year would get a tax cut. About 71 percent of the $40,000-$50,000 bracket would get a tax decrease and 80 percent of people earning $50,000-$75,000 would get a cut. The nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center arrived at similar estimates. In 2019, taxpayers with income between about $50,000 and $87,000 would receive an average tax cut of about $900, or 1.4 percent of after-tax income. Another group, the Tax Foundation, found that the Senate plan would reduce income tax rates for most single and joint filers earning less than $100,000 a year. For joint filers who earn between $19,050 and $77,400, the rate would fall from 15 percent to 12 percent. "The bottom 80 percent of taxpayers (those in the bottom four quintiles) would see an average increase in after-tax income ranging from 1.1 to 1.9 percent," the Tax Foundation reported. Changes in 2027 So Tillis has a point that many lower-and moderate-income taxpayers will see tax cuts from the bill – at least at first. What he leaves out is that many of the middle-class tax cuts in the bill are temporary. So by 2027, according to the JCT, most Americans earning between $30,000 and $75,000 would see their taxes change by less than $100 compared to today’s rates. In each of those income ranges, the JCT reports that fewer than 15 percent of households would get a tax cut and more than 20 percent would see their taxes rise. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office yielded a similar prediction: the Senate plan would leave Americans earning $40,000 or less as "net losers" by 2021 and most people earning less than $75,000 a year would be worse off by 2027. The Tax Foundation reported a more specific prediction: that "the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would see an average increase in after-tax income ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 percent." The top 1 percent, meanwhile, might still see tax cuts of up to 4.5 percent. "Because many of the provisions phase-out over five years, there are large differences in incidences between year 1 and year 6," said Michael Walden, William Neal Reynolds distinguished professor and extension economist at N.C. State University. "I have heard some analysts say the phase-out was only done to meet the budget requirements of passing the Senate bill by a simple majority, and that if passed, Congress would likely change the provisions in the future to eliminate the phase-outs," Walden said. "But that is a lot of ‘ifs.’" Daniel Keylin, an assistant to Tillis, took a different approach. He said it’s safer to assume that Congress will act to keep or reduce the tax rate than it is to assume they’ll let taxes rise. "It’s hard to imagine Congress electing to effectively raise taxes on the nation 10 years from now, especially once the economic benefits of tax reform become clear," Keylin said. Other considerations The Senate plan, unlike the House plan, would scrap the federal tax penalty for Americans who do not sign up for health insurance – a burden that falls disproportionately on lower- and moderate-income households. The mandate was introduced in the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Some could save money if the mandate is lifted. But, if too many go without insurance, health insurance costs could rise across the board for those who opt to keep buying coverage. In addition, anyone without insurance would be responsible for their own medical costs, which would eat into any tax savings. The New York Times reported that the Senate plan might increase taxes for roughly one-quarter of middle-class families that itemize their deductions. The Senate bill would eliminate some popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes, according to the Times. North Carolina ranks 23rd – or about average – among U.S. states in itemizing tax deductions, says Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato, Wagoner Assistant Professor of Economics at Duke University. "In N.C., only 29% of filers itemize their deductions," Serrato wrote in an email. "This tells me N.C. taxpayer will be hurt by eliminating the (state and local tax) deduction, but only itemizers, who are usually higher income, and that the cost of the deduction is not especially high for North Carolinians." Our ruling Tillis scolded a reporter for suggesting that Americans earning less than $70,000 would pay more in income taxes under the Senate’s plan to change the tax code. Initially, most – though not all – Americans in that income range would pay less in taxes. But after a few years, there would be more clear losers than clear winners in tax payments among members of that income group. Tillis is doing some selective presentation of the data.

pomt-13889	David Jolly "has used money and power to try to … drill off our beaches."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/jun/30/charlie-crist/us-rep-david-jolly-worked-drill-our-beaches-crist-/	Only hours after U.S. Rep. David Jolly announced he would drop his Senate bid and instead seek re-election to Congress, his Democratic opponent Charlie Crist sent out a fundraising email attacking the incumbent. "We are now being challenged by a well-funded former Washington lobbyist," former Gov. Crist’s June 17, 2016, email stated. "This is a man who has used money and power to try to take away women’s rights, drill off our beaches and block common sense gun control." Jolly had been vying for the U.S. Senate seat Marco Rubio was vacating after his presidential campaign, but Rubio decided he wanted to run for re-election after all. Now Jolly is competing against Crist in a redrawn district that leans heavily Democratic. There’s plenty of accusations packed into that sentence, but Jolly’s record on oil drilling struck us as particularly Florida-centric. Was Jolly an advocate for offshore drilling, as Crist said? Crist has a point about Jolly’s past work, which we’ve previously researched. But his claim ignores Jolly’s record of pushing back against offshore drilling in Congress. Not off our shore Jolly, a former lobbyist and aide to longtime U.S. House Rep C.W. "Bill" Young, replaced the congressman after Young died in office in 2013. He’s been in office since winning a 2014 special election. Offshore drilling, for the most part, is not allowed off Florida shores. The 2006 Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act prohibits drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle. The law expires in 2022. Crist is making it sound as if Jolly clearly favors more drilling off the coast of Florida. Jolly’s actions recent actions haven’t shown that at all. As a congressman, Jolly voiced opposition in July 2014 to expanded exploration off Florida’s Atlantic coast using sound waves, out of concern for the same process being used in the Gulf of Mexico. He signed a bipartisan letter to President Barack Obama opposing so-called seismic testing. (The Atlantic drilling was later called off.) He introduced legislation in June 2015 that was co-sponsored by Democratic Reps. Gwen Graham and Patrick Murphy to extend the ban on drilling in the eastern Gulf another five years, until 2027. The following month, he introduced an amendment heading off a Senate plan that would have potentially expanded drilling off Florida’s Gulf coast. This is not to say that Jolly is against drilling for oil as a practice. In an editorial that coincided with his bipartisan bill, he said Florida didn’t need to risk its beaches simply to increase oil production. "In the eastern region off Florida's coast, there are zero producing leases, and none are needed," he wrote in a Tampa Bay Times op-ed on June 3, 2015. "Gulf drilling activities in the western and central Gulf meet today's energy demands and are capable of meeting tomorrow's." Jolly makes no secret his strategy is based on keeping Florida waters free of oil platforms while relying on drilling elsewhere. "I've been pretty clear I support the current administration plan for continued drilling in the western and central Gulf, while strengthening the ban in the eastern Gulf," Jolly told us in an email statement through his spokesman. So where is Crist getting the idea that Jolly worked to open up more drilling? His campaign’s single piece of evidence was one of our own fact-checks from 2014. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee accused the then-candidate of working to expand the practice in the Gulf, but Jolly claimed he "never lobbied for offshore oil drilling." We rated Jolly’s statement Mostly False. While at his firm Three Bridges Advisors, Jolly had listed on a March 3, 2011, lobbying disclosure form that he had discussed H.R. 909, an energy independence proposal known as the Roadmap for America’s Energy Future. The bill in part called for expanded offshore drilling and was supported by Jolly’s client, an anti-regulation advocacy group called Free Enterprise Nation. Jolly admitted he had listed the bill on the form because he was at a meeting in which his client discussed it, but he "did not lobby on its behalf." Lobbying experts we spoke to at the time said it was unlikely Jolly would have listed the bill if he hadn’t discussed it, although there was no way to verify that. More importantly, according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, even being in a meeting in which it was discussed was technically a form of lobbying. We decided that Jolly couldn’t claim to having never lobbied on the subject, because he said he had. But we think a single instance of lobbying on a broad energy plan years ago is very different than implying Jolly did (and still) wants to expand drilling entirely. Our ruling Crist said Jolly "has used money and power to try to … drill off our beaches." His campaign’s argument is that Jolly technically lobbied on a failed 2011 bill that would have potentially expanded offshore drilling. But that was several years ago, and about a claim Jolly made during his House campaign concerning one event in his years as a lobbyist. Crist is ignoring Jolly the congressman’s efforts while in office — however nuanced — to keep drilling away from Florida’s shores. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c29ba169-b094-41c3-b660-bfcb9bb12d57	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2016-06-30T12:18:01	2016-06-17	['None']
pomt-03163	An account of attacks in Benghazi written by former White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers shows that the body of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was "dragged through the streets" and abused.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-dee-dee-myers-says-amb-chris-st/	A reader recently forwarded us a chain email about the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. Similar emails have been circulating for months, speculating about how U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed by Islamic extremists in the attack. But this email caught our eye because it was purportedly written by Dee Dee Myers, who once served as White House spokeswoman for President Bill Clinton. The email played up the significance of a well-known Democrat breaking with President Barack Obama over what had happened in Benghazi. The reader wondered if it was actually written by Myers, and so did we. Moments after we contacted Myers’ office, she emailed us back, saying she had nothing to do with the account. "No, I didn't write it, don't have any relatives in the Benghazi Guard, didn't have any of the conversations or meetings described in the letter," she told PolitiFact. "There is no truth to it whatsoever." What the email said The email opens by falsely claiming that the account is directly from Myers and that one of her cousins was guarding the ambassador on the night he died. (Read the full text of the email.) The email then purports to tell a disturbing story about what happened that night. In the email's version of events, the cousin dies as well: "... Ambassador Stevens was brutally murdered. His genitals were cut off, he was sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned. He was dragged thru the streets and left for dead. This is eyewitness testimony of a local Dr. who found the Ambassador in a ditch and tried to save his life. He had no idea who he was. The other 3 men, including my cousin, met similar fates. "Death due to smoke inhalation is a 100% fabricated LIE. ... The next week I drove my aunt and uncle and 2 others to DC to receive his body. We met with Hillary, whom I remain friends with, Panetta, and Susan Rice. All apologized saying it was a protest gone bad over a video and exited the area. Next Obama entered with the same story and made no apology and offered little sympathy." The email ends with a lament for the Clinton years: "The leadership of our country has reduced to lies and deception.......what has happened to us? How I long for President Clinton." Myers herself told us she was not the author of the email and that its details concerning her or supposed relatives are fabricated. We still wondered whether there was any other evidence to support the email’s claims about how Stevens died. Was he "sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned"? What we know about the night of the attacks After the attacks, the administration empowered an Accountability Review Board headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering. In its unclassified final report, the board said the scene was chaotic on the night of Stevens’ death. Officials lost track of Stevens around 11:30 p.m., until he arrived at the Benghazi Medical Center around 1:15 a.m. But the report makes no mention of any kind abuse to Stevens. Instead, it says he was brought to the emergency room by "six civilians .. but to the best knowledge of the Board these were ‘good Samaritans’ among the hordes of looters and bystanders" who arrived on the scene after the American personnel had left. The death, the report said, was due to "apparent smoke inhalation." Another group that reviewed the attack and its aftermath, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- controlled by Republicans -- made no mention of abuse either. Their report concluded that "local Libyans found the remains of Ambassador Stevens in the main diplomatic building at the Benghazi Mission and transported him to the hospital. The Libyans apparently did not realize who the Ambassador was, but they alerted the State Department of his location by using the cell phone that was in the Ambassador’s pocket. Libyan doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ambassador Stevens upon his arrival at the hospital." These accounts also track with contemporary reporting. An Associated Press report included an interview with Ziad Abu Zeid, a Libyan doctor who treated Stevens. Abu Zeid told the AP that Stevens was unresponsive when he arrived at the hospital, but that "we tried to revive him for an hour and a half but with no success." Abu Zeid said Stevens had bleeding in his stomach because of the asphyxiation but no other injuries. A CNN reporter was told by Libyans that they found Stevens and brought him to the hospital. That report too made no mention of any kind of abuse, and a doctor said Stevens was covered in soot when he arrived. The CNN report includes amateur video that shows rescuers pulling Stevens through a window, a detail that tracks with what the Accountability Review Board concluded. Meanwhile, the rare published reports that supposedly back up the chain email have been the subject of strong pushback. A Lebanese news outlet, Tayyar.org, published a report soon after the attack that cited Agence France Press reporting that Stevens was raped before being murdered. However, the AFP subsequently released a statement saying that the Tayyar.org report "falsely quoted our news agency and has no truth whatsover to it. AFP promptly sent a strongly worded complaint to that website and they removed the report and published a denial, saying that AFP did not report such a thing." One key piece of evidence has not yet been made public: autopsy results. The FBI was charged with investigating the attack, but it has not yet produced a final report, which would presumably include an autopsy report. A call to the FBI on Sept. 6, 2013, confirmed that no report has been released yet. We will update this report when that information is publicly released. Our ruling The chain email forwarded an account purportedly written by Dee Dee Myers of how her cousin and Ambassador Chris Stevens were killed in the Benghazi attack, including being "sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned." Myers told PolitiFact that she had nothing to do with the email, and that anything it said about her was false. As for the email’s claims about Stevens’ being violently attacked and violated rather than killed by smoke inhalation, two government reports and several contemporary journalistic accounts cast strong doubt.

pomt-09041	Says Republican lieutenants to House Speaker Joe Straus “aired radio ads supporting Democrat(ic state Rep.) Mark Homer... helping the Democrat to a narrow win.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/05/david-barton/gop-activist-says-three-republican-house-members-d/	All wasn’t back slaps and hugs at the Republican State Convention in Dallas last month. Party delegates switched to a new chairman in Houston lawyer Steve Munisteri. And a critic of House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio distributed a letter the morning of June 12 all but indicting Straus and his closest GOP House allies as dangerously beholden to Democrats. The letter from David Barton of Aledo, the state party’s former vice chairman, lists nearly 20 indicators he says show Straus working against both conservative Republicans and the advancement of a conservative legislative agenda. Talk about a Truth-O-Meter dream. If every politico issued such missives, we’d postpone vacations, double up staff, contemplate a reality show. But we digress—and are reviewing just a handful of Barton’s statements, starting with this: “Straus Republican lieutenants Charlie Geren, Jim Keffer, and Byron Cook aired radio ads supporting Democrat Mark Homer over conservative Republican Kirby Hollingsworth, helping the Democrat to a narrow win.” Background: Barton’s statement refers to three GOP House members endorsing an East Texas Democratic incumbent facing a Republican foe. Homer, of Paris, prevailed with 52 percent of the 2008 vote, according to the Texas secretary of state. To our request for back-up information, Barton passed along a copy of a newspaper ad with pro-Homer quotations from the cited GOP House members plus audio of a radio ad narrated by then-Rep. Brian McCall, a Plano Republican recently appointed chancellor of the Texas State University System. The newspaper ad, headlined “Republican Representatives Endorse Mark Homer,” quotes Geren, R-Fort Worth, saying Homer “works with everybody to bridge divides;” Cook, R-Corsicana, calling Homer a “problem solver;” McCall rating Homer “one of the best” and Rep. Tommy Merritt, R-Longview, saying: “The only team Mark is on is yours.” The radio spot features McCall saying: “During campaigns you hear a lot of talk about breaking gridlock. Candidates all talk about it. Some even mean it. Mark Homer has done it. Mark works with everybody, Republicans, Democrats, doesn’t matter. He works for you...” McCall then identifies himself as a Republican House member and says he’s joined by Keffer, Cook, Geren and Merritt “urging you to re-elect” Homer. “Mark bridges divides, he looks for common ground, creates solutions,” McCall says in the ad. “...So this time, send a problem solver back to Austin. The only team he’s on is yours.” That certainly sounds like several House Republicans touting a Democratic colleague. Anything askew in Barton’s recap? When we reached them, Homer, McCall and Keffer each confirmed the Republicans pitched in after Homer asked for help, though each man bridled at parts of Barton’s description. For starters, Homer said, his 1,899-vote win was not the squeaker Barton suggests. “For him to call it narrow is stretching it,” he said. Also, he said, the Republicans didn’t air the radio ad, or pay for it, as Barton’s letter says. Instead, Homer said, his campaign wrote the script, which each Republican approved. Homer said his campaign also bought air time. And was the ad a difference-maker, as Barton suggests? We don’t know how to gauge that. Homer said: “It certainly contributed... If I didn’t have it, could I have won? I feel strongly I could have won. But it was nice to have it.” Homer said he’s lined up similar commitments from Republicans this year. Like who? “I am not ready to say,” Homer said. “I don’t want to say yes (about who’s endorsing me) and if it doesn’t work out for some reason, I don’t want that to become a campaign issue.” Keffer noted that Homer was vice chair of a House committee that Keffer chaired. He said of his endorsement: “We are not so polarized and partisan (in the House) that we can’t look at good members on either side of the aisle . . . I am not afraid to do that. We need the best people we can get down in Austin.” McCall questioned the part of Barton’s statement calling Homer’s GOP helpers lieutenants of Speaker Straus. At the time of the 2008 election, McCall pointed out, Straus wasn’t yet the House speaker; he didn’t launch his unexpected candidacy for the post until later. McCall said he doesn’t know if Straus knew about the pro-Homer ad. Upshot: The radio spot wasn’t aired by the Republicans, as Barton puts it, and only one Republican voice -- McCall’s -- was heard. Also, Straus wasn’t House speaker when the ad aired in 2008, so he had no “lieutenants.” But the GOP members Barton named have proven to be Straus allies. And they earlier joined hands in a radio ad for Homer, their Democratic colleague. Barton’s statement is Mostly True.

pomt-02599	"The national economic recovery has led to higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state in the nation, including Wisconsin."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-state-budget-surpl/	Why the big surplus predicted in the state budget? Gov. Scott Walker says wise government belt-tightening and reforms, tax cuts and business-friendly deregulation boosted hiring and the economy, promising now to help fill state coffers with extra income-tax revenue. When Walker made that claim in his State of the State address on Jan. 22, 2014, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin begged to differ. "Scott Walker’s "surplus" isn’t built on prudent financial decisions -- it’s built on disinvestments in our future that harm the economic security of the middle class," a Democratic news release issued during the speech argued. "Walker’s first budget cut nearly one billion dollars from public schools and our technical college system that provides critical job training programs." Then the party added this: "The national economic recovery has led to higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state in the nation, including Wisconsin." Before Walker’s speech fades into history, let’s check the claim that Wisconsin is far from alone in enjoying a firmer financial footing. Wisconsin is projected to have a $1 billion surplus at the end of the two-year budget period covering July 2013 to July 2015 -- almost all of it because tax collections are rising faster than expected, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau said in January. The predicted surplus -- expected revenues exceeding planned expenditures -- is a notable switch from shortfalls that forced Wisconsin and other states into emergency changes to keep budgets balanced during the Great Recession and its immediate aftermath. We asked Democratic Party spokesperson Melissa Baldauff to back up the claim of "higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state." She cited an Associated Press story from January 2014 that said that "almost all states will see fairly decent surpluses" in their 2014 budgets. That story quoted the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO). We followed up with Scott Pattison, executive director of the budget officer’s group. He confirmed the projection. The 2013 stock market surge will goose income tax collections, Pattison said, and many states budgeted conservatively for 2014, not foreseeing the market’s runup. That, he said, means surpluses are in store for fiscal year 2014, which for most states ends by mid-year. And that comes on the heels of the 2013 budget year in which "37 states exceeded original (revenue) forecasts, six states were on target and seven states ended fiscal 2013 below the original revenue estimate," according to the nonpartisan budget association’s December 2013 report, "The Fiscal Survey of States." Baldauff also cited that report. The revenue windfalls meant surpluses were common, the report said. So the Democrats’ claim of "higher than expected tax revenues" and resulting widespread surpluses was confirmed by the group. We broadened our view, checking with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which also regularly tracks state budgets. "State fiscal conditions continued to improve in fiscal year (FY) 2013," the group said in its "State Budget Actions FY 2013 and FY 2014." General fund revenue growth was notably strong and outpaced projections in most states." Did that leave states with extra money to play with? Yes, the group said. "At the same time, expenditures were generally on target," its report said. "The combination of these factors enabled many states to shore up reserves and support supplemental expenditures. Overall, the fiscal situation was solid in almost every state in FY 2013." In another report, the group noted in January 2014 that "in a dramatic turn from recent years, California lawmakers will consider how to allocate a potential budget surplus—yes, a surplus." In its "State Legislatures Magazine" in January 2014, the group added: "Driven by improving revenues and on-target expenditures, states entered fiscal year 2014 in better economic shape than they have been in years." The revenue collection boost was "somewhat unexpected," it said, and many states used the excess to supplement appropriations or fortify their rainy day funds. Early in fiscal 2014 pointed, state revenue collections were meeting or exceeding targets in most states, the group reported. Few are predicting, though, that revenue gains will be as strong as in 2013. Many states planned for that, said Pattison of the budget officers organization, fearing that the 2013 rise was a one-time event. Our rating The Democratic Party of Wisconsin generated this claim: "The national economic recovery has led to higher than expected tax revenues and projected budget surpluses in nearly every state in the nation, including Wisconsin." State budget watchers confirm a widespread recovery in tax revenues as the nation continues to edge out of the Great Recession. This fiscal year likely will not match 2013 in tax-revenue growth, but states predicted that and most should see surpluses by mid 2014, as most did in 2013. We rate the party’s claim True.

pomt-05530	Says that Mitt Romney, while he was in Arizona, said he believes the state’s SB 1070 immigration law should be the model for national immigration laws.	false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/11/charlie-gonzalez/us-rep-charlie-gonzalez-says-arizona-mitt-romney-s/	Ahead of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s fundraising visit to Texas last month, U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, a San Antonio Democrat, criticized the former Massachusetts governor’s immigration positions. In a March 27, 2012, conference call organized by the Democratic National Committee, Gonzalez said that while in Arizona, Romney said he believes that the state’s much-debated immigration-enforcement law — which originated in 2010 as Senate Bill 1070 — should be the template for federal immigration laws, a stance that Gonzalez described as disturbing. We wondered whether Gonzalez accurately characterized Romney’s declaration. Gonzalez’s comment to reporters: "Gov. Romney has actually (said) — while he was in Arizona, of course, and I understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the Arizona crowd — he felt that SB 1070, which has made its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and will be argued in April, he believes that it should be the template, it should be the model for United States immigration law, not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in Congress have been espousing for a number of years, but an extreme version of an anti-immigrant law passed by the Arizona Legislature." To back up Gonzalez’s statement, DNC spokesman Ricardo Ramirez pointed to an answer Romney gave during the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona. Romney did not say in the debate that Arizona's 2010 law should be adopted by Congress in lieu of comprehensive immigration reform; his reply to a question focused instead on a different, older Arizona statute. That said, we see how his reply could be misread. As John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, crowd members applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona’s Maricopa County, shown in attendance, who is known for his advocacy of tough immigration policies. Then King said to Romney: "You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?" "You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona," Romney answered. "They passed a law here that says, that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent." E-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses; there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system. Since the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups have interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states. However, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic’s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article, pointing out that Arizona’s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act. "It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court," Nowicki wrote. "That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants." According to Nowicki’s article, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told the Republic that in the Arizona debate, Romney was referring to the E-Verify requirement as the model and not SB 1070. Williams reiterated that statement to us in an email. Ramirez, of the DNC, also pointed to the rest of Romney’s debate response in the Feb. 22 debate as backup for Gonzalez’s claim. The remainder of Romney’s answer: "So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing. And I will drop those lawsuits on day one. I'll also complete the fence. I'll make sure we have enough Border Patrol agents to secure the fence. And I will make sure we have an E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers, and to check E-Verify. And if an employer hires someone that has not gone through E- Verify, they're going to get sanctioned just like they do for not paying their taxes. You do that, and just as Arizona is finding out, you can stop illegal immigration. It's time we finally did it." So, after praising Arizona’s E-Verify requirement, Romney said that "the right course for America" is to drop the lawsuit against Arizona — presumably the Obama administration’s challenge to SB 1070, now before the U.S. Supreme Court. In a telephone interview, Ramirez argued that Romney was indicating that if state laws like Arizona’s SB 1070 became widespread, then he "would be just fine with that." Williams later told us as much in his email: "Gov. Romney supports the right of states to craft laws that assist the federal government in enforcing immigration laws, particularly when the federal government has failed in its duty to enforce those laws. As president, Gov. Romney will use federal resources to stop illegal immigration, not to sue states that are seeking to help the federal government enforce the law." Of course, saying he wouldn’t sue states that adopt SB 1070-style laws isn’t the same as saying that Arizona’s law should be the model for federal immigration laws. On the other hand, Nowicki noted that even if Romney wasn’t referring to SB 1070 in his "model" comment during the Arizona debate, he hadn’t exactly distanced himself from the law, which was designed to spur a crackdown on illegal immigration by Arizona’s state and local law enforcement agencies. (Before the law could go into effect, the Obama administration sued, asking a federal judge to block the measure. The judge put on hold several provisions, leaving in place others. That decision, upheld by an appeals court, is scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on April 25, 2012.) In addition to opposing the federal challenge to the law, Romney has touted the endorsement of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped draft SB 1070 — a fact that the Romney campaign noted in its Jan. 11, 2012, press release announcing the endorsement. In the release, Romney said: "Kris has been a true leader on securing our borders and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into this country. ... With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem." Kobach, who served as an adviser to Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign, has told news organizations, including The Associated Press, that he is serving as an unpaid adviser on immigration issues to Romney's 2012 campaign. In an interview with KNXV-TV in Phoenix for a Jan. 31, 2012, report, Kobach said: "I’m providing advice on the best approach to immigration enforcement and immigration law generally, and I have encouraged the Romney campaign to take a stand of attrition through enforcement, which is what Arizona’s SB 1070 is all about." As The New York Times wrote in a Jan. 24, 2012, blog entry, Romney showed his support for the concept of "attrition through enforcement" when he plugged "self-deportation" as a solution to illegal immigration during a Republican presidential debate a day earlier. The Times blog post says the strategy of inducing illegal immigrants to leave voluntarily arose from a recognition by groups that oppose illegal immigration that the federal government was not going to deport the millions of illegal immigrants living in the United States. "Instead, the idea is to make it so difficult for illegal immigrants to live in this country — by denying them work, driver’s licenses and any public benefits and by stepping up enforcement — that they will give up and go home," the post said. So, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law — which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law that Gonzalez says Romney called a model for the nation. That’s quite a difference. Then again, Romney also said he would end the federal challenge to the 2010 law on his first day as president. Finally, we turned to NumbersUSA, an Arlington-Va.-based nonprofit group that opposes illegal immigration and advocates for limits on legal immigration, because it tracks what the presidential candidates say about immigration. The group’s president, Roy Beck, told us that Romney has expressed support for enacting "attrition by enforcement" policies on a national level such as requiring that businesses use E-Verify. Beck said Romney has not said specific provisions of SB 1070 should be taken as a model for federal immigration laws. Our ruling Gonzalez could legitimately have targeted Romney’s vow to immediately drop the federal challenge to Arizona’s immigration-enforcement law as president. Instead, the Democrat’s statement to reporters mischaracterizes Romney’s salute to Arizona’s 2007 mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees. That E-Verify requirement was not in the 2010 Arizona law. We rate the Texan’s claim as False.	None	Charlie Gonzalez	None	None	None	2012-04-11T06:00:00	2012-03-27	['Arizona', 'Mitt_Romney']

pomt-05795	"You can’t put a gun rack in a [Chevrolet] Volt."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/24/newt-gingrich/gingrichs-gun-rack-quip-about-volt-shot-full-holes/	Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich recently went gunnin’ for greenies. Gingrich’s target is the Chevy Volt, an electric car that also can run on gas. During a recent Republican presidential campaign swing through Georgia, he revved up crowds by calling it the car that rich, liberal environmentalists think you ought to drive. President Barack Obama would make you ditch your gas guzzler at the side of the road for the Volt, if he had his way, Gingrich warned. "This is an administration that is deeply opposed to Americans having the right to choose the kind of car or truck they want to drive," the former Georgia congressman told a crowd in Cobb County on Saturday. "And I keep trying to get across to my liberal friends: You cannot put a gun rack in a Volt." Slow down there, Mr. Speaker. You can’t put a gun rack in a Volt? Is Gingrich taking us for a ride? We realize this is not a pressing policy issue. And Gingrich was obviously trying to inject a little humor in what has been a demolition derby of a campaign. But PolitiFact Georgia decided it was time for a little detour from our typical GOP primary coverage. We set the Truth-O-Meter’s sights on Gingrich’s high-voltage claim. We contacted the Gingrich campaign for a comment, but did not get a reply by the time this article went to press. The Chevy Volt is a $40,000 electric car. The midsize sedan can travel about 35 miles on battery power alone, but if you need to go a few hundred miles farther, the gas tank kicks in. To charge the Volt, you hook the battery to an orange cord stored under the trunk carpet. The other end plugs into an electrical outlet. Chevy designed the Volt with so-called "early adapters" and green technology fans in mind, company spokesman Robert Peterson said. Owners tend to have high incomes and are concerned about the environment and U.S. energy dependence. Chevy manufactures cargo nets, floor mats, a sunshade and an ashtray for the Volt, but nary a gun rack, Peterson said. "It’s not something we normally consider," he said. He lent us a Volt for our fact check. Car experts weren’t sure a gun rack would fit. "You certainly CAN put a gun rack in a Volt, if you're talking about a tactical shotgun with a dash-mounted rack, as in a police cruiser," said Dan Neil, Pulitzer-winning car columnist and author of the "Rumble Seat" column in The Wall Street Journal. "A window rack, like in pickups? No, that would be difficult." Gingrich took his gun rack quip on the road. He repeated it in Tulsa, Okla., on Monday before a crowd of 3,000 at Oral Roberts University. We heard Gingrich say it again as we sat behind the wheel of a borrowed Chevy Volt, listening to the Sean Hannity radio show. We were hunting for a gun rack, and the Volt did its best to help. It started with the push of a button, and greeted us with a melody that sounded like a harp on Auto-Tune. A screen showed us the location of nearby stores. The Volt’s pearly center console glowed under buttons lit up in cobalt blue. We felt as if R2-D2’s younger, sexier brother was our co-pilot. Local gun store salesmen told us we could get a truck accessory store to customize a rack. We found a video online that showed a Volt owner rigging one up with plastic piping and plywood. We don’t think these were what the former House speaker had in mind. PolitiFact Georgia opted to test products we could buy off the shelf. We returned to the newsroom parking lot with three gun racks and a stick as a gun stand-in. The stick was a precaution. We didn’t want our co-workers to get the wrong idea. It was about 40 inches long, or roughly the length of a shorter shotgun. The first contraption suspended guns on two racks behind the Volt’s seats. They hooked onto the car’s rear headrests and handily balanced the stick. It was designed to fit two long guns. The second used two camouflage neoprene slings to cradle up to two guns behind the car’s front seats. They fit, but not well. The slides of the Volt’s heated seats were in the way. We tied the slings’ bottom attachments to the front seat belt anchors instead. That’s four long guns. The third rack was designed to show off guns in the car’s rear window. The kit came with two plastic hooks with long adjustable bases. Each end was shaped like a wedge. They fit snugly in the space between the upholstery and window, but were about 8 inches too short. It was nothing that duct tape and PVC pipe couldn’t fix, but no self-respecting Georgian would display his guns that way. We checked online and found window racks that we think would work. How do we rule? Gingrich said you can’t put a gun rack in a Chevrolet Volt. We installed two gun racks that tote four guns combined. Our own research shows Gingrich’s claim is a lemon. We give him a False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6b893c6f-adb9-4a69-a7f7-3eb4edc24e73	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-02-24T06:00:00	2012-02-18	['None']

pomt-12040	"Since I’ve been the state treasurer, we’ve increased the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent."	half-true	/california/statements/2017/sep/13/john-chiang/chiangs-claim-californias-affordable-housing-doesn/	State Treasurer John Chiang has made boosting California’s supply of affordable housing a key talking point during his run for governor. Chiang, one of several Democratic candidates in the 2018 race, claimed at a recent campaign event in Santa Monica that he’s helped greatly expand that supply. "Since I’ve been the state treasurer, we’ve increased the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent," Chiang said in a Facebook live video on August 13, 2017, joined by Congressman Ted Lieu. Chiang made a similar assertion in a Facebook post one month later. California’s struggle to build enough affordable housing is well documented: Estimates place the state's affordable housing shortage at 1.5 million residences. We wanted to know, however, whether Chiang was right about the pace of this construction upswing and whether he left anything out. We set out on a fact check. Our research Chiang took office as treasurer in January 2015. We asked his office for information supporting his statement about the 80 percent growth in construction since that time. It provided data showing the number of low-income housing units constructed -- or rehabilitated -- by developers receiving one of two types of federal tax credits. That combined number jumped from nearly 14,000 units in 2014 to about 25,500 in 2016 -- an increase of about 83 percent, which tracks with Chiang’s statement. These tax credits are awarded by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, headed by Chiang, and are a catalyst for building affordable housing. Matt Schwartz, president of the nonprofit California Housing Partnership, told us these credits are the driving force for as much as 95 percent of the state’s affordable housing construction each year. One type can cover more than half the cost of developing a unit while the other can cover a quarter of the cost, Schwartz said. Schwartz clarified that these tax credits are only used on affordable rental properties. The treasurer’s data seems like a fair starting point for tracking affordable housing construction. But given that some of the construction was for rehabilitation -- something Chiang did not make clear in his statement -- we wanted a deeper look at the data. How many rehabs? We found rehab projects accounted for more than half of the construction in 2014 and more than 60 percent of construction in 2016. "Most of the rehabilitations are of existing affordable housing units. That’s different than actually adding brand new units to the housing stock. That quote (from Chiang) is not spliced in a way that that’s obvious," said Carol Galante, a professor of affordable housing at UC Berkeley. A treasurer’s office fact sheet promotes the same 80 percent increase in affordable housing units, but clarifies that those are "built or rehabilitated." SOURCE: California Treasurer's Office Not just a coat of paint Representatives for the treasurer told us they’ve always interpreted the term "building, construction" as including both new and rehabilitated units. Mark Stivers, who heads the state tax credit allocation committee, said rehabs involve far more than "just slapping paint" on an old apartment. The use of the federal tax credit for rehabilitation, he said, locks in that unit at an affordable rate for 55 years through a deed restriction. Schwartz, of the nonprofit housing partnership, added that rehabilitation is a key part of preserving California’s limited affordable housing stock. He added that Chiang has shown strong leadership in expanding affordable housing in the state. Our ruling California State Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed he’s helped boost "the building, construction of affordable housing by 80 percent" since he took office in 2015. Data from the treasurer’s office show an 83 percent increase in the construction -- and rehabilitation -- of affordable housing units from 2014 through 2016. But Chiang’s claim omits the fact that less than half were new units added to the housing supply. The majority were rehabilitation projects on existing homes. Experts told us such improvements help preserve affordable housing, but don’t necessarily expand it. A fact sheet on the treasurer’s website gets the details right. But Chiang's statement in a campaign video and later in a Facebook post leave out this important context. For this reason, we rate Chiang’s claim Half True.

pomt-03390	"It is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans’ phone calls without getting a specific FISA warrant to do so."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/08/lynn-westmoreland/phone-call-surveillance-policy-no-mystery-congress/	A Georgia congressman’s recent attempt to clarify the federal government’s powers in terms of electronic surveillance made us curious. U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, a Republican from Coweta County, said Edward Snowden is flat-out wrong that contractors like him can eavesdrop on the phone calls of Americans whenever they want. Snowden is the former government contractor who caused an international stir by leaking National Security Agency documents about its surveillance program. "That is a lie," Westmoreland said. The congressman, who is a member of the House Committee on Intelligence, explained. "It is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans’ phone calls without getting a specific FISA warrant to do so, based on compelling evidence of a connection to terrorism. Plain and simple," Westmoreland wrote in an op-ed that we spotted on the Peach Pundit website. We wondered if the congressman was accurate when he wrote that the NSA cannot legally record or monitor Americans’ telephone calls without a specific FISA warrant. In early June, news accounts in The Guardian and The Washington Post reported that the federal government, as part as what’s called the "2015 program," had hundreds of millions of telephone records as part of its terrorism surveillance efforts. The news organizations also reported on another program used by the NSA and FBI that scours the nation's main Internet companies, extracting audio, video, photographs, emails, documents and connection logs to help analysts track a person's movements and contacts. The reports were based on leaks from Snowden, who wanted to expose the depths of the surveillance. FISA, which stands for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was created in 1978 to establish federal regulations for counter intelligence. A secret court of Washington, D.C.-area federal district court judges was created to hear government requests for search warrants. Congress passed, and President Barack Obama signed, a five-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act in December. The amendments allow surveillance of non-U.S. citizens overseas who the government believes may be involved in terrorist activities. Section 702 of the act, first approved in 2008, allows such intelligence without a court order for each individual target. A February 2012 letter by Attorney General Eric Holder and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper seeking the act’s reauthorization also supports Westmoreland’s argument. "(T)he Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence may authorize annually, with the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), intelligence collection targeting categories of non-U.S. persons abroad, without the need for a court order for each individual target," the officials wrote. The government is required to submit updates about the program’s progress twice a year to Congress. Section 703 sets rules for the surveillance of U.S. citizens. The guidelines require a 90-day court order and additional 90-day renewals, if necessary. Section 704 of the act focuses on U.S. citizens outside the country. It, too, requires a court order to conduct surveillance. Emory University law school professor Charles Shanor said Westmoreland has a point. Shanor said a FISA or a probable cause warrant is necessary for surveillance. "You have to have authorization, even to get the log of calls made," said Shanor, who clerked for a federal court judge and worked for three years as the general counsel at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Westmoreland’s spokeswoman Leslie Shedd sent us several documents to back up her boss’s claim. It included testimony from a June 18 House committee hearing that he attended. Several House members asked intelligence officials if they can listen to phone calls without a warrant. Here is one exchange between Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and U.S. Army Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the NSA’s director. ROGERS: "Is -- is the NSA have the ability to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their emails under these two programs?" ALEXANDER: "No, we do not have that authority." ROGERS: "Does the technology exist at the NSA to flip a switch by some analyst to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their emails?" ALEXANDER: "No." The president addressed the issue during an interview with Charlie Rose on his PBS show. "(I)f you’re a U.S. person, then NSA is not listening to your phone calls and it’s not targeting your emails unless it’s getting an individualized court order. That’s the existing rule," Obama said. Is it possible that the federal government has conducted surveillance on U.S. citizens overseas? Intelligence officials told Congress at the June 18 hearing that they do not include U.S. citizens. In order to do surveillance under Section 704, Deputy U.S. Attorney General James Cole said at the June hearing, it would require "identifying that person; identifying the probable cause to believe that that person is involved in either terrorism or foreign intelligence activities; and indicating that we have then the request to the court to allow us to intercept their communications because we've made the showing that they're involved in terrorist or foreign intelligence activities." Again, Westmoreland said it is illegal for intelligence officers to listen to the phone calls of Americans without a FISA warrant. Federal documents, congressional testimony and comments from the president support his claim. The rules are different if you’re not a U.S. citizen. Since Westmoreland specifically referenced U.S. citizens, we rate his claim True.	None	Lynn Westmoreland	None	None	None	2013-07-08T00:00:00	2013-06-20	['United_States']
pomt-06866	"Social Security doesn’t contribute a penny to the deficit."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/aug/02/alliance-retired-americans/washington-group-says-social-security-isnt-contrib/	CORRECTION, Sept. 29, 2011: This fact check originally said that without changes in law, the Social Security trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2036. That is incorrect, a reader pointed out, though 2036 is the year Social Security is expected to no longer cover full benefits--again, barring changes in law. This correction, reflected in the amended text below, does not affect our original rating. The Texas AFL-CIO’s Ed Sills noted in his July 12 email blast of labor-related news that a Washington group was urging people to call their U.S. senators about preserving Social Security. In asking its members to call their senators, the Alliance for Retired Americans said: "Social Security faces an immediate threat from politicians in Washington" who want to cut the program’s cost-of-living inflation adjustment "to reduce the deficit. But Social Security doesn’t contribute a penny to the deficit." Not a cent? That’s an eye-catching claim because last year for the first time since 1983, Social Security’s income from payroll taxes did not cover what it paid beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration’s summary of its 2011 annual report says the program ran a "cash deficit" of $49 billion in 2010 and is projected to run a $46 billion deficit in 2011. The summary attributes these shortfalls in part to the weakened economy. It also says that in 2012-14, the agency expects such deficits to shrink as the economy strengthens. In subsequent years, though, Social Security’s deficits are expected to grow rapidly as the "number of beneficiaries continues to grow at a substantially faster rate than the number of covered workers." The agency doesn’t say Social Security is going broke. Through 2022, it says, "annual cash deficits will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets" from the U.S. Treasury. Some "trust fund" background: When Social Security’s payroll tax income exceeds payments to beneficiaries, the government spends the surplus as general revenue and the Treasury gives Social Security interest-bearing bonds in return. When Social Security has to redeem its "trust fund assets" to cover a difference between income and payments, it is relying on these bonds and the interest they generate. As of December 2010, there was about $2.6 trillion in Treasury bonds and related interest in Social Security’s trust fund. Barring changes in law, the agency’s summary report says, the trust fund will not have enough money to cover full benefits starting in 2036. "Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2085," the summary states. So the question is, when Social Security’s trust fund is used to cover benefits, is Social Security contributing to the government’s overall deficit, which was approaching $1.4 trillion when we started this review? David Blank, spokesman for the Alliance for Retired Americans, said the group made its not-a-cent claim because Social Security is financed by the payroll tax paid by workers and employers on each worker's first $106,800 of annual income, supplemented by income from the government bonds purchased by the program in surplus-income years. "Social Security is prohibited from spending any money beyond what it has in its trust fund," Blank said by email. "This means that it cannot lawfully contribute to the federal budget deficit, since every penny that it pays out must have come from taxes raised through the program or the interest garnered from the bonds held by the trust fund." Blank’s bottom line: Social Security "is a self-financed program." Correct, said Ben Veghte, a research associate at the National Academy of Social Insurance, whose mission is to "promote understanding of how social insurance contributes to economic security and a vibrant economy." Veghte told us that because Social Security is considered an "off-budget" independently financed program, it simply can’t contribute to the general government deficit. When it needs to draw on revenue from bonds that were purchased in earlier years, he said, it’s simply fetching due returns. At this time, he said, Social Security is funding 83 percent of its benefits from payroll taxes, 13 percent from interest on bonds and 3 percent from taxing the benefits of high-income recipients. Neil Buchanan, a professor of law at George Washington University who’s disputed claims that Social Security is in the ditch, said the program’s 2010 and expected 2011 cash deficits might have been hurried along because of the latest recession, but it’s long been known that as baby boomers started to retire, each year’s payroll tax income for Social Security would stop covering all the costs of benefits. However, Buchanan said, it’s possible to conclude that the recent cash deficits contributed a trivial amounts to the federal deficit. Jagadeesh Gokhale, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, said in an interview that whenever Social Security taps proceeds from its U.S. bonds, it’s clearly affecting overall government spending because the Treasury has to get the money somehow, usually by borrowing money from another source. "Basically the liability of the federal government to Social Security is going to be exchanged for liability to the public," Gokhale said. "So, yes, if Social Security is redeeming Treasury IOUs to pay scheduled benefits, it is contributing to the federal government’s unified federal deficit." Unified? The Social Security Administration says the "unified" budget encompasses all of the government’s budgetary activities, excluding Social Security and Post Office operations, with the unified budget deficit being the measure that determines how much the government has to borrow from the public to meet its obligations. Then again, it notes, "those involved in budget matters often produce two sets of numbers, one without Social Security included in the budget totals and one with Social Security included. Thus, Social Security is still frequently treated as though it were part of the unified federal budget even though, technically, it no longer is." Feeling flummoxed, we heard back from June O’Neill, who headed the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for part of the 1990s. O’Neill, an economics professor at Baruch College, City University of New York, aligned with Gokhale of the Cato Institute, saying that whenever Social Security doesn’t collect enough in payroll taxes to cover benefits, its need for additional money naturally ripples through the entire budget. She pointed out, though, that Social Security in 2010 and this year is hardly responsible for a big part of the deficit. Also, she stressed, it would have been incorrect to say Social Security contributed to deficits before last year. That’s because more money came in via payroll taxes than was paid out in benefits. O’Neill said all government programs contribute to the deficit. "There’s nothing special about" Social Security on this point, she said. Put another way, she said, the CBO tracks government receipts and expenditures; Social Security’s money in and money out are included. We’re expertised out. And our conclusion is that there's a legitimate rationale for saying Social Security doesn’t contribute to the deficit. After all, it draws on a payroll tax to pay for itself and has built up $2.6 trillion in Treasury IOUs and interest to cover cash shortfalls. However, when Social Security draws from its trust fund, as it did last year and will again this year, it is asking Treasury for money that has to come from the overall budget. And these transactions contribute to the overall federal deficit--not much perhaps, but more than a penny. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-00916	President Barack Obama's veto of the Keystone XL pipeline killed "42,000 jobs."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/02/tom-graves/graves-right-number-bit-keystone-jobs-context/	President Barack Obama's veto of the Keystone XL pipeline killed "42,000 jobs." U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Georgia in a press release on Tuesday, February 24th, 2015 President Barack Obama carried through with his threat to veto a bill approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline almost as soon as it hit his desk last week, and project supporters were equally quick to pounce. Among those criticizing the veto was U.S. Rep Tom Graves of Ranger, who accused Obama of "putting partisan politics in front of all the families who would benefit from the good paying jobs" resulting from the pipeline project. "The president’s veto of 42,000 jobs is appalling," Graves said in a press release issued Tuesday, Feb. 24, the same day as the veto. Keystone XL supporters have long said thousands of new jobs would be created by the controversial project that has been in the works since 2008 and that could allow 800,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sand fields of Alberta, Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast. PolitiFact has checked several pipeline-related jobs claims, rating at least three, including one from President Obama, as "False" on the Truth-O-Meter. We decided to check Graves’ statement as well . In January 2014, the State Department issued a report estimating that the pipeline project would support 42,000 jobs, most lasting no more than a year or two, while the pipeline was under construction. It also forecast that no more than 50 permanent jobs would be required to maintain the completed pipeline. In November 2014, we fact-checked a statement by Russ Girling, CEO of TransCanada, the company that wants to build the pipeline. Girling told a Sunday morning television talk show audience that the 42,000 jobs would be "ongoing and enduring," a statement that earned him a False rating. A few months earlier, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner received a False rating for saying that the then-six-year delay in the project’s approval had cost Americans 100,000 jobs. He was citing a study that experts said was "flawed" and the company in charge of the project, TransCanada, said was "no longer relevant." The jobs comment that snagged the president came in 2013. Obama told The New York Times that the "most realistic estimates" showed that the pipeline project would create "maybe 2,000 jobs" during construction. That statement was rated False, in part, because the White House did not provide any supporting evidence. In addition, the administration’s own State Department predicted the construction process would create nearly twice as many jobs as the president said. For our fact-check of Graves’ statement, we reached out to his spokesman, Garrett Hawkins. We asked if it was fair to suggest that the pipeline bill is an issue of jobs for Americans if the outcome is, based on the State Department’s report, mostly short-term jobs and at best 50 permanent jobs. We also asked if Graves had evidence to suggest otherwise. We received a quick response back from Hawkins, saying; "It is indisputable that President Obama’s own State Department said the Keystone XL pipeline will support more than 42,000 jobs." He said Graves is "pro-jobs, whether it’s one year of employment or a permanent position." "For the Americans who have suffered under President Obama’s economy and are desperate for work, a short-term job would likely be an answer to prayer and a springboard to another opportunity down the road," Hawkins said. "It’s both strange and sad to see the far left belittle these jobs." We should point out that in the past it’s been reported that about 10,000 of those jobs could last only four to eight months. We also should point out that Graves wasn’t the only member of Congress this week to issue a statement on the veto referencing the 42,000 jobs. We saw a statement from U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from Florida's 27th congressional district, saying the pipeline had multiple good points: bringing the U.S. closer to total energy independence; advancing the country’s national security interests; creating around 42,000 jobs and adding more than $2 billion to the national economy. U.S. Rep. Elise M. Stefanik, a Republican from New York, issued a statement saying she was ‘incredibly disappointed’ in the presidential veto of a project that, she said, "would create as many as 42,000 jobs and help lower energy prices for hard-working" families in her district. So where does this leave us? Graves is correct when he says that Americans who are unemployed would jump at the chance at any job -- even one one that would last a year or two at best. Who is to say that job couldn’t be the springboard to another. But when the average person hears that a project has an $8 billion impact and will add 42,000 jobs -- they’re likely thinking that more than 50 of those jobs will be long-term. Yet that’s the State Department estimate -- no more than 50 of these 42,000 jobs will be needed once the pipeline is built. That’s a lot of context that readers are missing in Graves’ statement. Both Democrats and Republicans have spun the numbers on this issue to their advantage. And Graves continues to do that with his statement. Graves statement is accurate and misleading at the same time. He gets very close to a Mostly True on this one, but we thought enough context was missing to take it down a notch. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02611	People on pot "shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/24/nancy-grace/nancy-grace-says-pot-users-shoot-each-other-and-ki/	An amusing Web video pits tough-talking former prosecutor and HLN host Nancy Grace against a combative adversary on the subject of pot: Nancy Grace. In one frame, Grace argues smoking marijuana makes users less prone to picking a fight or "basically starting Mortal Kombat." They’re more likely "to lay on the sofa and eat," she said while discussing Trayvon Martin having marijuana in his system at the time of death. In the other frame, Grace is heated up about the debate du jour: legalized recreational pot in Colorado. In a recent show, Grace dismissed the arguments of a marijuana advocate who thinks the drug should be legalized and regulated like alcohol. She argued about whether the drug is "highly addictive" with Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert, who suggested Grace is against legalization because "she does not like the people that use marijuana." She disagreed. "The reason I’m against legalization of pot is that I’ve seen too many felonies, and I don’t mean pot sales or growing pot," she said. "I mean people on pot that shoot each other, that stab each other, strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families — wipe out a whole family." Tvert went on to chastise her "1930s" tone, and the argument went on. For many, Grace’s comments about people using marijuana and committing violent acts raised eyebrows, so we decided to check it out. HLN publicists did not respond for comment. The consensus among drug and psychiatry experts: Marijuana alone does not propel one to commit acts of violence. Most users are not lighting up and heading over to Fight Club. They want to wind down, not amp up. And while there is evidence that people who commit crimes often smoke marijuana (in part because smoking marijuana is a crime in many places itself), there is little support to back up the idea that it drives people to commit crimes, especially violent ones like Grace described. "Clearly the majority of users don’t become aggressive," said Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and chief of the Division of Substance & Alcohol Abuse at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. "Definitely in terms of clinical work, violence is not the first thing that comes to mind when people are dealing with marijuana." That said, marijuana is still a mind-altering drug, and it could have a different effect on people who are predisposed to aggression and anxiety, he said. It could induce fear or paranoia when people cannot process an environment, though some may withdraw instead of reacting aggressively. Other psychologists and psychiatrists essentially agreed with Salloun. "Other than people driving under the influence, there’s no scientific basis for what she’s saying," said Matthew Johnson, associate professor in the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The effect is often not as dramatic as driving under the influence of alcohol, Johnson said. Usually people who drive while high drive slower, and the impairment is usually noticed when the driver’s attention is divided, he said, akin to the effect of some prescription medications. People who come to treatment facilities are typically using multiple drugs, making it tough to suss out which substance was responsible for a violent act. Violence is not typically associated with the use of marijuana, unless the victim is a "chocolate chip cookie," joked Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, professor and vice chairman of the University of Florida’s Department of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Addiction Medicine. Levity aside, Teitelbaum stressed some people can still become addicted to the drug, and he worries about more young people using it with further legalization. A spokeswoman for the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Drug Free America Foundation directed us to a slew of news clips documenting shootings related to marijuana theft, grow houses and co-ops. The clips also highlighted marijuana use of gunmen from some of the country’s most recent and notorious shooting sprees. "In many cases of violence, such as with Benjamin Bishop, Jared Loughner, James Holmes and the Pentagon shooter, these gunmen actively were or previously had been marijuana users," said Calvina Fay, the foundation’s executive director, in a statement. She pointed to a 2012 study by researchers from Duke University, the University of Oregon, King’s College London and University of Otago in New Zealand that highlighted brain development in teens who smoke marijuana. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, relied on data for more than 1,000 people who were tracked from the time they were born to age 38. People who started using marijuana as teens and used it at least once a week showed the biggest loss in IQ points. People who picked up the drug as adults didn’t show the same loss in mental functioning. Johnson, the Johns Hopkins professor, says this research is controversial because it’s tough to eliminate marijuana use from all other factors that make people willing to engage in behavior that isn’t socially acceptable. "But even if that were true, we’re talking about a small minority," he said. "It’s not a question for the large majority of the public." Gil Kerlikowske, the White House director of national drug-control policy, released an analysis in May that attempted to show a link between crime and marijuana use. It found that 80 percent of adult males arrested for crimes in Sacramento, Calif., in 2012 tested positive for at least one illegal drug. The most commonly detected drug was marijuana, which was found in 54 percent of those arrested. The analysis didn't say what percentage of the crimes were violent and did not conclude that marijuana was the reason people committed crimes. (A positive urine sample only indicates use in the past month.) FBI data for violent crimes with reported drug and alcohol involvement is not broken down by substance, so there is no telling which violent crimes as reported by law enforcement agencies are at least linked to marijuana use. A 2003 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found "surprisingly few" studies have tried to nail down a direct link between marijuana use and crime. After reviewing related academic studies and crunching arrest and crime data, the NBER researchers determined people involved with violent crimes are also likely to use marijuana, but "the marijuana use is not necessarily related to their decision to engage in crime." Their report highlighted a 20-year-old study by the National Research Council that suggested longterm marijuana use may affect a person's nervous system so he or she becomes more violent. Still, the causal link "remains in question," the NBER report said. The researchers did find a positive association between marijuana use and property-damage crimes, particularly among youth. Finally, on the subject of high-profile murderers who use the drug, Johnson said there is bound to be overlap between people accused of murder and those who use marijuana given how popular it is. But the same could be said for people who have blond hair and commit murders, he said. One is not a direct result of the other. Dr. Antoine Douaihy of the University of Pittsburgh College of Medicine said even though he thinks Grace is overreaching, there are concerns about the unknown social risks of legalizing marijuana in more states. Often, he said, people are passionate about the topic without noting nuances or differentiating among legalization, decriminalization and authorizing cannabis for medicinal purposes. Our ruling Grace said, people on pot "shoot each other ... stab each other ... strangle each other, drive under the influence, kill families." Yes, you can find individual cases to back up each of Grace's points, but Grace suggested pot drives people generally to commit violent acts, and there's no evidence of that. Behavioral science experts we consulted stressed using marijuana has consequences. But a hard turn toward violence, including shooting each other and killing families, isn’t one of the direct effects from using the drug for most people. We rate Grace’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-05707	"A little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/08/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-almost-half-americans-receive-f/	In a speech to supporters at the end of the Super Tuesday primaries on March 6, 2012, Rick Santorum offered a set of statistics designed to highlight what he sees as the growing dependence of Americans on the federal government. "In a very short period of time, the next two years, a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them," Santorum said. "After Obamacare, it will not be less than 50 percent; it will be 100 percent." We will take up the two parts of this statement in separate items. In this item, we’ll look at whether it’s correct that "a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them." We’re going to ignore Santorum’s focus on what will happen within "the next two years," since we don’t have a crystal ball. But we think the most recent data can serve as a fair stand-in instead. For that, we can use a table produced by the U.S. Census Bureau that offers data for the average number of Americans who received benefits from selected government programs during a three-month period between January and March 2010. The table includes such non-means-tested programs as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment compensation, veterans' compensation, workers' compensation, railroad retirement and veterans' educational assistance. It also includes such means-tested programs as Medicaid, food stamps, the Women, Infants, and Children program, federal Supplemental Security Income, public or subsidized rental housing, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, free or reduced-price school breakfasts and lunches, energy assistance and other cash assistance. The Census Bureau found that a little over 147 million Americans received payments from at least one of these programs at a time when the U.S. population was just over 303 million. This meant that 48.5 percent of Americans received federal cash or cash-like benefits -- and it means that Santorum’s number is well-supported. In fact, counting such items as amounts refunded from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies -- neither of which are included in these figures -- would push that number higher. Our colleague at the Washington Post Fact Checker concluded that the usefulness of these numbers is weakened because they count everyone in a household as benefiting from a particular federal payment even if that payment is made in the name of only one person. We think that's a fair point, although we would add that if a couple and their two children live under the same roof as grandma, and she receives Social Security and Medicare, those federal benefits add to the resources available to the rest of the family. And if a child gets free school lunches, his parents will have more disposable income as a result. Our ruling The percentage of Americans "who depend on some form of federal payment" is indeed "a little less than 50 percent," as Santorum said -- it was 48.5 percent in 2010. If anything, the ongoing rise in usage of food stamps and other federal assistance programs may have pushed this number higher, and adding in tax refunds from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies could push the number higher still. The number, however, includes every member of a household in which one member receives benefits, and in some households, it would be a stretch to say, as Santorum does, that as a result of that every member will "depend on some form of federal payment." Discounting for that, we rate Santorum’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-08T11:31:36	2012-03-06	['None']

pomt-00863	"Every day, a black name resume is 50 percent less likely to get responded to than a white name resume."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/15/jalen-ross/black-name-resume-50-percent-less-likely-get-respo/	The Sunday shows capped a turbulent week for race relations around the country, from the shooting of two officers in a new wave of protests in Ferguson, Mo., to the closing of a University of Oklahoma fraternity over racist chants. CNN’s State of the Union invited four student leaders to talk about what the next generation can do to improve the dialogue. University of Virginia student council president Jalen Ross pointed out that the most common examples of racial discrimination aren’t limited to dramatic moments that make headlines. "Every day, a black-name resume is 50 percent less likely to get responded to than a white-name resume," Ross said. "Right? That’s everyday racism." Ross may not be the typical politician who meets our Truth-O-Meter, but we thought his point was interesting and telling about the state of race relations if true. Ross told PolitiFact by email that he was referencing a field study from the National Bureau of Economic Research called "Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?" The study is more than a decade old, published July 2003. Economists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan wanted to explore racial bias in the job market. They responded to help-wanted ads for a variety of positions in the fields of sales, administrative support, clerical services and customer services posted in The Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune with fake resumes. The researchers plugged in made-up names on the resumes that are associated with African-Americans (they used Lakisha Washington and Jamal Jones as examples) or whites (Emily Walsh and Greg Baker) based on naming data for babies born between 1974-79 in Massachusetts. The name on each resume was randomly assigned, so the same resume in some cases had a black name and in others had a white name. Then they counted the callbacks. The resumes with white-sounding names spurred 50 percent more callbacks than the ones with black-sounding names. After responding to 1,300 ads with more than 5,000 resumes, the researchers found that the job applicants with white names needed to send 10 resumes to get one callback, but the black candidate needed to send 15 for one. It didn’t matter whether the employer was a federal contractor or was described as an "equal opportunity employer," as those also discriminated like the others. "We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names," their paper states. "These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market." Ross erred slightly in his exact wording. While white-sounding names spurred 50 percent more callbacks than the ones with black-sounding names, black-sounding names were 33 percent less likely to get responded to. (Thanks percentage change calculators.) The researchers cautioned that their findings do not reveal anything about gaps in hiring rates or earnings between whites and blacks. Also, they only focused on one avenue for job postings, newspaper ads, even though social circles represent a major way people find employment (not to mention that online postings for jobs are much more popular now than 2002). Still, their findings echoed similar preferences among employers for applicants with names that were not distinctively black. After we published our fact-check, Mullainathan told us by email that Ross's characterization of the study is "broadly right," though it's possible the numbers have changed. "I know there have been more recent studies but often in other areas (not employment but housing, etc.), and they continue to find large gaps today," he said. David Figlio, a Northwestern University professor of education and social policy and of economics, said he had no reason to think the dynamics have substantially changed. "There have been a number of recent studies on related topics that suggest that similar patterns are still at work in other areas," Figlio said. "So while I can't confirm the exact number, I believe the fundamental relationship to still be true." We found another National Bureau of Economic Research paper looked at a slightly related angle: whether having a name that sounded African-American posed significant harm for one’s economic well-being. The authors analyzed naming patterns of children born in California from the 1960s to 2000. The names DeShawn, Tyrone, Reginald, Shanice, Kiara, Deja and Precious were very popular black names but "virtually unheard of" for white children, they found. Conversely, names such as Connor, Cody, Jake, Molly, Emily, Abigail and Caitlin were way more popular for white children. The differences in name preferences took off with the rise of the Black Power movement in the late 1970s, the authors said. The key difference between the papers is that economists Roland Fryer and Steven D. Levitt found "little evidence" that names alone can have a direct effect on one’s economic livelihood, concluding that having a black name is "primarily a consequence rather than a cause of poverty and segregation." But the authors said this does not necessarily negate the findings of Bertrand and Mullainathan. They noted that having a black name on its own is not likely to have a big effect throughout the interviewing process, as an employer who meets an applicant and discriminates on race would immediately notice his or her race during the meeting. Also, the fact that Levitt and Fryer did not find a significant impact "could simply mean that their data aren’t comprehensive enough," said Alan Auerbach, a University of California Berkeley economist. Our ruling Ross said, "Every day, a black name resume is 50 percent less likely to get responded to than a white name resume." A reputable study by respected economists of callback rates for resumes with white- and black-sounding names backs up this point. Ross' biggest error is his specifc phrasing, while white names were 50 percent more likely to get a call back, that means that black names were 33 percent less likely to do so. Ross made a mistake in his phrasing -- one that tripped us up as well. But his overall point remains valid and the study he relied on showed a sizable discrepancy between white and black sounding names. We rate the claim Mostly True. Correction: Like Ross, we originally made a mistake calculating the percent change conveyed by the study. This item has been updated to reflect the correct information.

pomt-10310	On public financing of his campaign.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/barack-obama/he-said-hed-pursue-it-but-opted-out/	"If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." - Barack Obama, fall 2007 "We've made the decision not to participate in the public financing system for the general election." - Barack Obama, June 19, 2008 Sen. Barack Obama's decision to opt out of the public financing system marked a milestone in modern presidential politics: the first time a major nominee has declined public financing since the system was created after Watergate. Obama's announcement on June 19, 2008, prompted swift criticism from Sen. John McCain's campaign that Obama had flip-flopped. "The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people," said McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker. "Barack Obama has failed that test today, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics." The group Let Freedom Ring made a similar charge in July 2008 with a TV ad. When we talk about public financing, we're talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who direct $3 to the fund on their tax returns. The upside is that candidates don't have to spend time seeking contributions, but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount set by the Federal Election Commission. This year's general election limit is $84.1-million per candidate, but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September, and the Nov. 4 election. To explore whether Obama made a full flip-flop, let's go back a year to 2007 shortly before he announced his candidacy. On Feb. 1, 2007, Obama requested an opinion of the FEC on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised. A month later, the FEC issued an advisory opinion that said it was okay as long as his campaign kept the primary election contributions and the general election contributions separate. The day of the FEC decision, McCain's campaign said he would commit to public financing. "Should John McCain win the Republican nomination, we will agree to accept public financing in the general election, if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same," Terry Nelson, McCain's campaign manager, told the New York Times. Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying: "If Senator Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." In the fall of 2007, Obama elaborated on his position when he answered a questionnaire sent by the Midwest Democracy Network, which asked the candidates if they would participate in public financing." "Yes," Obama said in his response. "In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election. My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election. ... The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal, and Sen. John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge. If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election." The message seemed clear: Obama and McCain wanted a publicly funded general election. But then both campaigns saw tactical advantages to getting out of the public financing system. McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 6, 2008, saying he wanted to withdraw from public funding for the primaries. McCain's private fundraising had improved after his early primary victories, and his strategists were concerned that they would be hamstrung by spending limits if they stayed in the public system. But that effort stalled because of vacancies on the FEC. Chairman David M. Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb. 19, 2008, saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling. Obama repeated his commitment in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Ohio, when moderators pushed him to explain why voters shouldn't consider his position on public financing to have changed. "What I've said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody." In the meantime, Obama's campaign had benefited from an unprecedented tidal wave of private contributions, especially from donors who gave less than $200. The small contributions not only fueled the campaign in the early primaries, but the donors could be tapped again (and again) before they hit the $2,300 limit for individuals. As they considered their plans for the general election, a factor for both campaigns was the money spent by independent groups known as 527s, named after the section of the tax code that governs them. Groups on both sides are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars, but the spending could become lopsided to the benefit of one candidate, either because favorable groups buy lots of ads touting him or they buy lots of ads attacking his opponent. In either case, the candidate on the losing side of 527 spending would be at a significant disadvantage if he was using public financing for his campaign and had to adhere to spending limits. So as the money flowed in, Obama campaign strategists made a calculation: They decided they could raise so much from private contributions that they were better off avoiding the public system. "It's not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections," Obama said in a video to supporters. "But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system." He said McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee are largely bankrolled by "Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs. And we've already seen that (McCain is) not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations." Asked whether they pursued an agreement with McCain, the Obama campaign pointed us to a news account that said Bob Bauer, an attorney for Obama, met with McCain lawyers to discuss how both campaigns could operate in the public financing system. But that account was sketchy and didn't sound to us like the "aggressive pursuit" that Obama had promised. The fact is that Obama said he would pursue public financing, but decided it wasn't in the campaign's tactical interest. That might have been a tactical decision, or even a wise one, but we see it as a Full Flop.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-04T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['None']

pomt-12481	Wisconsin politicians get daily expense payments "even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel," and "no receipts are required for them to get paid."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/03/wisconsin-freedom-alliance/do-s-legislator-get-daily-stipend-just-showing/	The Wisconsin Freedom Alliance, a conservative political group, splashed into the news briefly in 2016 when it funded ads criticizing various Republican state Senate candidates during primary campaigns. Now the group is back with a campaign charging that taxpayers are on the hook for bloated pensions, salaries and other benefits for state lawmakers of all political stripes. In an April 2017 radio ad, the alliance ripped a practice that pays Wisconsin state lawmakers a per-diem amount when they travel to the Capitol for business. "Did you know state politicians can collect their per diems even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel? No receipts are required for them to get paid. No receipts! It’s the honor system for politicians paying themselves. Does that sound like a good idea?" Is that the way the system works? The benefit Legislators in most states qualify for per-diems. In many cases they receive more than Wisconsin lawmakers can get. That hasn’t prevented the per-diems from coming under occasional attack in Wisconsin. They top out at $115 a day for state senators, and $78.50 a day (and $157 for an overnight) for Assembly members. In 2016, overall payments to Assembly members ranged from a low of $916 to state Rep. Nancy VanderMeer (R-Tomah) to a high of $9,591 to state Rep. Peter Barca (D-Kenosha), the Assembly minority leader. In total, the 99 Assembly members received $484,504. The 33 senators received $200,860 in 2016. The payments ranged from $2,024.00 to state Sen. Terry Moulton (R-Chippewa Falls) to $14,256 to state Sen. Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), the majority leader. Lawmakers living close to Madison qualify for lower per-diem rates. Lawmakers base salary is $50,950. The Wisconsin law governing the benefit says legislators "shall be entitled to an allowance for expenses incurred for food and lodging for each day that he or she is in Madison on legislative business." (italics ours). So, if the allowance is tied to spending on food and lodging, is it possible, as the alliance contended, that it is paid "even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel?" Michael Flaherty, executive director of the Freedom Alliance, cited a Dec. 30, 2016 story by the USA Today Network-Wisconsin, headlined "Madison lawmakers max out hometown perk". The story said "Lawmakers can collect the money as income without spending a dime on meals, lodging or gas. No receipts of expenses are required to get paid." The no-receipts claim is on target, according to the clerks for the Senate and Assembly. Lawmakers are not asked to itemize. As for whether a lawmaker who skips meals and drives home to sleep can still get a per diem, the answer is, yes, that’s possible. But it’s impossible to say how often that happens, given the loose accounting system. "It’s a benefit, an allowance," said Senate Chief Clerk Jeff Renk. In Renk’s opinion, despite the statute’s talk of expenses incurred, lawmakers who incur no expense while collecting a per diem are not violating the law. The perk is so automatic that lawmakers, at the beginning of a two-year legislative session, choose whether to receive the maximum daily reimbursement for days they travel to Madison within that period. That’s how the law was written. All they have to do to collect is confirm their appearances by entering a mark in a computer program. One piece of the group’s claim requires a minor clarification. Travel costs in the form of mileage are reimbursed separately from the per-diem payments. Our rating The Wisconsin Freedom Alliance claimed that state lawmakers get daily expense payments "even if they don’t spend a dime on meals, or lodging or travel," and "no receipts are required for them to get paid." Per diems are built on an honor system that requires no documentation that any travel or lodging expense has been incurred. Travel costs, though, have nothing to do with per diems, and some clarification is necessary here because no one can say how often lawmakers get the per diem without spending anything. We rate the claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Wisconsin Freedom Alliance	None	None	None	2017-05-03T05:00:00	2017-04-25	['None']
pomt-02569	"I never gave up custody of my children. I never lost custody of my children."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/30/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-never-gave-parental-role-though-she-ag/	Wendy Davis told an Austin crowd that she’s had enough of people distorting her life story, especially in connection with her daughters. According to the text of her speech, which she gave Jan. 28, 2014, to the Travis County Democrats, the Fort Worth state senator and Democratic gubernatorial candidate said she was separated from her first husband at 19 and divorced at 21. Her second husband, she said, "was generous and supportive when it came to my education," which extended to earning a degree from Harvard Law School while her two girls (one by her previous marriage) mostly lived in Texas with him. "And when our marriage ended 10 years after my graduation, he and I remained partners, sharing the responsibilities of parenting and doing what was right for Amber and for Dru," she said. "I am very proud of our family, and of the decisions we made together to do what was right for our daughters." "And for those who have mangled the story of my life – either carelessly or purposely – know this: I never gave up custody of my children. I never lost custody of my children. And to say otherwise is an absolute lie." Davis once referred to herself as the "noncustodial parent" of her youngest daughter. Is it also correct that she never gave up custody? By email and telephone, lawyers steeped in family law told us it’s rare for a Texas parent to lose custody of a child in the sense of being barred from any parental role. They cautioned, too, that "custody" is an outdated word that obscures how state laws were revised in the mid-1990s so that splitting couples would divorce without one being presumed to have lost his or her parenting role and responsibility. As things stand, a parent may be designated the "managing conservator," lawyers said, or both parents can be declared joint managing conservators. Davis spoke in wake of a news story Davis made her "never" declaration nearly two weeks after a Dallas Morning News news story, posted online Jan. 18, 2014, examined discrepancies in her biography as she has recounted it. For that story, Davis told the paper that her "language should be tighter. I’m learning about using broader, looser language. I need to be more focused on the detail." The story noted first that Davis’ personal biography had been employed to draw voter support-- "a divorced teenage mother living in a trailer who earned her way to Harvard and political achievement." "The basic elements of the narrative are true," the story said, "but the full story of Davis’ life is more complicated, as often happens when public figures aim to define themselves. In the shorthand version that has developed, some facts have been blurred." Specifically, the newspaper said, Davis was 21, not 19, when she was divorced. Also, it said, she lived only a few months in the family mobile home while separated from her first husband before moving into an apartment with her daughter. The story said that as a single mother working two jobs, she met Jeff Davis, a lawyer, married him and had a second daughter. He paid for her last two years at Texas Christian University and her time at Harvard Law School, the story said, also keeping their two daughters while she was in Boston. Past coverage of custody Custody came up as the story said the couple divorced in 2005 and Jeff Davis "was granted parental custody, and the girls stayed with him. Wendy Davis was directed to pay child support." The story quoted Jeff Davis as saying: "She did the right thing. She said, ‘I think you’re right; you’ll make a good, nurturing father. While I’ve been a good mother, it’s not a good time for me right now.’" The story further said that Wendy Davis declined to discuss the circumstances or terms of the divorce. "When I decided to run for governor, I promised my girls we would not revisit a time that was terribly difficult for them," she told the paper. "I will tell you it was very important to me that Dru stay in her childhood home. It was a very difficult time in our life." Sen. Davis also said: "I very willingly, as part of my divorce settlement, paid child support. That was at my request, not any court telling me I needed to financially support my daughters." The Texas Tribune said in a Sept. 1, 2013, news story that when Jeff Davis filed for divorce, Wendy Davis moved to an apartment. The story continued: "The (family) house, which was in her husband's name, is where Amber and Dru grew up, and that is where they wanted to stay, their mother recalled. "The divorce decree in 2005 gave Mr. Davis primary custody of Dru, who was then 17, and" Wendy "Davis agreed to pay $1,200 a month in child support, records show," the Tribune said. ‘Joint managing conservators’ At our inquiry, Davis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña sent a copy of the agreed divorce decree, dated Nov. 15, 2005. In the 35-page filing, a Fort Worth state district judge ordered that Wendy and Jeff Davis be appointed "parent joint managing conservators" of Dru Davis, who was then 17. Amber Davis was no longer a minor. Acuña also emailed us a statement by the senator’s lawyer in the divorce, Terry Gardner, stating that Davis "always maintained joint custody of her teenage daughter during and after her divorce from Mr. Davis. Both parties were appointed parent joint managing conservators by the court, and shared the responsibilities of parenting their child." The order states that Jeff Davis has the "exclusive right to designate the primary residence of the child within Tarrant County." Both parents, the decree says, retained the right to consent to decisions involving the child’s education, health care and other needs. The decree includes a "standard possession order" specifying when each parent would have Dru Davis living with them--specifying certain weekends and holidays--followed by the stipulation that Wendy Davis pay $1,200 a month in child support. Davis called herself ‘noncustodial parent’ The 2013 Tribune story quoted the senator as saying she did the right thing: ''My girls wanted to stay in their family home. I did feel like as the noncustodial parent that that was my obligation.'' We ran Davis’ "noncustodial parent" comment past Acuña of Davis’ campaign. She did not reply. Earlier, we asked about letters to the Tarrant County district clerk, Thomas Wilder--one dated Dec. 2, 2005, and the other dated Feb. 24, 2006--listing Jeff Davis as the "custodial parent" and Wendy Davis as the "noncustodial parent." We obtained the letters from Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer for the Austin American-Statesman, who found them in records of the divorce kept by the Tarrant County district clerk's office. Acuña, indicating the letters and attached forms were administrative paperwork, said by email that the "divorce decree clearly states that Wendy and Jeff Davis be awarded joint managing conservatorship. The divorce decree is the controlling document." Outside lawyers say senator didn’t give up custody At our request, Jack Sampson, a University of Texas law professor expert in family law, reviewed the decree, saying by phone that it shows Davis did not give up custody in the divorce. "She’s a joint managing conservator," he said, who agreed her daughter would primarily live in the family home with her father. By email, Fort Worth lawyer Chris Nickelson, said that the divorce order shows Davis "was appointed a joint managing conservator and was given possession and access to her daughter. She therefore shared joint custody with Jeff." Similarly, Austin lawyer Jimmy Vaught, chair-elect of the Family Law Section of the State Bar of Texas, said the decree shows the senator and her husband having the same parental rights and duties except for control over where the daughter lives. Asked if making the family home where Jeff Davis lived Dru Davis’ primary home constituted the father gaining greater custody, Nickelson replied: "There will always be a group who perceives having the right to determine the primary residence means you have ‘custody.’ But that is not true under Texas law." He added: "Non-lawyers often think that if one person has more rights or more possession time than the other person, then it means they have custody while the other does not. Despite family lawyers’ best efforts, we have never been able to beat this idea out of people’s heads." Sampson and Nickelson each said the letters to Wilder in the county records reflected only on the senator not being her youngest daughter’s primary caretaker and being ordered, as agreed, to pay child support for about the last half year of Dru Davis’ years as a minor. Both lawyers said the letters do not mean Davis gave up custody. Daughters comment On Jan. 28, 2014, the Davis campaign released letters from the candidate’s daughters. Dru Davis wrote: "My mom has always shared equally in the care and custody of my sister and me." Amber Davis wrote that at the time of her mother’s divorce, "I was a young adult in college and Dru was in high school and to be clear, no one ‘lost or gave up custody’ of either one of us. But no matter how difficult it was, both of our parents were there for us." Our ruling Davis said she "never gave up custody of my children. I never lost custody of my children." Custody, it turns out, is an outdated term for what has evolved into "managing conservatorship." And in the senator’s divorce, she and her ex-husband agreed to joint managing conservatorship, which means that neither parent sacrificed custody. That said, her ex-husband’s home was designated as their daughter Dru’s primary residence in the divorce decree and Davis agreed to make child-support payments. Outside of the legal process, it’s not uncommon for the parent who’s not the primary caregiver to be considered noncustodial, which may explain why the candidate described herself this way less than five months ago. Still, it would be incorrect to say she legally relinquished her parental role. We rate this statement, which was missing this clarification, as Mostly True. CLARIFICATIONS, 5:50 p.m., Jan. 30, 2014: This story was amended to clarify that Tilove obtained described letters in the public records of Davis' divorce and that the letters were addressed to the Tarrant County district clerk, not to a lawyer for Wendy Davis.

pomt-08607	"More people were killed in the United States last year by tainted food than U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began."	false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/22/ted-ankrum/ted-ankrum-democrat-us-house-says-annual-us-deaths/	Ted Ankrum, the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House seat held by Michael McCaul, R-Austin, floats a startling comparison in an e-mail blast advocating laws ensuring food inspections: "More people were killed in the United States last year by tainted food than U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began," his Aug. 31 statement says. "... It takes laws to require testing and inspections AND government inspectors to enforce them. Yet, we do not have the laws since Congress won’t pass them." Wait a sec: Tainted food kills more o' us than war? To our inquiry, Ankrum told us by e-mail that he made the comparison by recalling an article in The New York Times. Via an online search, we found the relevant July 24, 2010, op-ed column, titled "Unsafe at Any Meal." The piece, by Eric Schlosser, author of "Fast Food Nation," says about 200,000 Americans are sickened every day by contaminated food and every year about 325,000 people are hospitalized (due to) a food-borne illness. It goes on: "And the number who are killed annually by something they ate is roughly the same as the number of Americans who’ve been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003." While that punch line is less sweeping than Ankrum's statement, the article doesn't substantiate the comparison. Seeking evidence, we visited websites that respectively track casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. deaths due to foodborne diseases. According to the Iraq Coalition Casualties Count, the United States suffered 4,421 deaths in Iraq from 2003 to Sept. 21, 2010 and 1,301 deaths in Afghanistan since 2001, for a total of 5,722. Keeping in mind when Ankrum made his statement, we also checked U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan as of the end of August 2010; that total was 5,670, according to numbers posted by the U.S. Department of Defense covering deaths in Afghanistan as of Aug. 31 and deaths in Iraq as of Sept. 4. And what of deaths due to food? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 76 million cases of foodborne disease occur each year in the United States, most of them mild. The CDC estimates 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths related to foodborne illnesses each year. A CDC official, Barbara Mahon, told us via e-mail that although the 5,000 figure was declared in a 1999 article, it remains the best number to cite until the CDC completes an update that's under way. Mahon said: "Making these (death) estimates is a complex process that uses multiple data sources and statistical methods." For instance, she said, threatening Salmonella bacteria can come from many sources including food, water, direct animal contact or even transmission from another person. If a person dies from such an infection, she said, "there is usually no way to know whether they got their infection from contaminated food or from another source. Only if they are part of an outbreak for which a source is determined (usually less than 5 percent of cases of Salmonella infection) would it be possible to know where that particular infection came from. Otherwise, it might or might not have been foodborne." Mahon noted that people "could die of Salmonella without it ever being diagnosed. So, to estimate the true number of Salmonella deaths due to food, it is necessary to take all of this into account, which requires looking at many different kinds of data from multiple sources and using appropriate statistical techniques to adjust for the various sources of infection and for under-diagnosis and under-reporting." Back to Ankrum's statement: It looks like annual U.S. food-borne deaths, based on the figure aired in 1999, run short of U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan by about 700. When we followed up, Ankrum told us he relied on his memory of Schlosser's op-ed column in making his statement. "So 'uncle,' you got me," he said. Side note: Schlosser's comparison might have fared better on the Truth-O-Meter even though it says U.S. residents killed by what they eat each year is "roughly" the same as U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003. Accounting for his 2003 limit and also adjusting for when the column appeared reduces combined U.S. deaths in the conflicts to 5,477-- less than 10 percent off the CDC's number for annual U.S. deaths from food-borne causes. We rate Ankrum's statement False.	None	Ted Ankrum	None	None	None	2010-09-22T17:59:50	2010-08-31	['United_States', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan']
pomt-12541	Says the University of South Florida invests in oil companies like BP, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/apr/19/usf-divest/fact-check-how-does-university-south-florida-inves/	University of South Florida students, faculty and alumni are revamping their efforts to have more say in how the university invests its money. A new video called "#HeyJudy" from the USF Divest coalition urges USF administrators to stop investing in a number of industries that they don’t support, such as private prison operators, tobacco companies, oil companies and weapons manufacturers. A cool-talking student narrator (he’s "kind of a big deal") lays out the problem and calls on USF President Judy Genshaft to implement an ethical review process giving students and faculty some influence over where the money goes. The video laces comments from a the narrator with asides from people who control the industry being called out. "Here at the University of South Florida we invest in oil companies," the narrator says. "Like BP, even though we screwed up your coastline," says a man dressed like an oil executive. "Ooo." "Tobacco companies," the narrator says, adding to the list. "USF hypocritically proudly tobacco free, yet, the school shares in tobacco’s plentiful profits," says a man with a cigar in tow. "That is hypocritical," the narrator responds. "We also invest in weapons manufacturers." "Anyone need a hellfire missile? 50 percent off," exclaims a man with a missile on his shoulder. "No thank you," says the narrator. "And private prisons." "Has anyone seen any black people?" asks a man in a suit. "We need to make our quota." Divestment has been suggested many times at USF since 2013, either through student elections, student petitions or Student Government, often led by the student organization, Students for Justice in Palestine. With the video buzzing on campus we wanted to check out if USF invests its money in oil companies, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons. What’s going on with USF’s investments? When we reached out to USF Divest about this claim, they said their evidence stems from a 2013 document detailing how the USF Foundation invests its share of USF’s endowment money. USF’s investments are managed by several entities. The university’s total endowment of more than $400 million is managed by the USF Foundation. The USF Foundation is run by an elected board who raises, manages and invests money from private donors to support the university’s activities. The board’s Investment Committee oversees the university’s $400 million total endowment. The foundation is classified under Florida laws as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, meaning some relevant records are shielded from disclosure. This makes it hard to pinpoint the exact companies the foundation invests its money. Here’s what we know. The committee that oversees the university’s endowment does not select individual stocks or companies for the endowment to invest in; rather, it hires investment managers who decide what funds to invest. Adam Freeman, the communications director for USF, said the video asserts that the USF Foundation made a decision to invest in certain companies, which is not the case. "The university does not invest in individual companies," he said. "A diversified portfolio has exposure to a wide array of asset classes with investments that will span most, if not all, major industries. The investment practices followed by the foundation are common within colleges and universities as well as other institutional investors." Steven Perfect, a finance professor at Florida State University, said investors have no control over the contents of individual funds, but said they can always choose to move to other mutual funds that more closely track their preferences. A strict enforcement of the video’s divestiture goals would be a bit of a challenge, but is certainly possible at some cost, Perfect said. There are certain investment plans that offer investors carbon-free portfolios, for instance. USF Divest said there are hundreds of campaigns going on nationwide and there are many examples of successful divestment efforts. For example, Columbia University divested from private prisons in 2014 by selling its stock in G4S, the world's largest private security firm, as well its shares in the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). What about those specific industries? The foundation’s status under Florida laws and its wide-ranging investment techniques make it hard to pinpoint specific companies and industries where money is being invested. The most recent document about the foundation’s investment decisions is from 2013. Back in 2013, Ken Souza, the investment director of the USF Foundation, provided a list of investment managers that decide what mutual funds to invest in. Once they had the list of mutual funds, the group was able to look up the specific companies using the Securities Exchange Commission Edgar website. To look up a mutual fund on SEC Edgar, you need the name of the mutual fund or the Stock Ticker associated with the mutual fund. (A Stock Ticker is the five-letter identification to look up the mutual fund.) This is what the group received: With the stock tickers, they were able to look at what companies those mutual funds invested in, which included British Petroleum (an oil company), Altria (a tobacco company better known by Philip Morris) and CoreCivic (a company that owns and manages private prisons and detention centers), to name a few. We were able to confirm these companies on the SEC Edgar website. We noticed that portfolio holdings were even more diverse than what USF Divest highlighted. For instance, Wilmington Funds (WMRIX) invests in stock in multiple industries including automobiles, airlines, textiles, technology and energy. USF Divest said it requested more up-to-date information from the foundation but never got it. We asked the university and the foundation, too. Freeman said that the foundation does not have a publicly available document that would provide that level of detail like the 2013 document. (And he did not offer one up.) Besides the foundation’s audited financial statements, the most updated investment information that is publicly available is in the foundation’s Investment Prospectus — a two-page overview about the endowment’s investment strategy. As detailed in the Investment Prospectus, the endowment is invested with managers who specialize in specific asset classes. (An asset class is a group of securities that have similar characteristics and behaviors and is subject to the same laws and regulations.) Perfect said the Foundation’s asset allocation plan suggests it’s investments are diversified, but said he can’t be certain without seeing what’s inside each asset class. Our ruling USF Divest said the university invests in oil companies like BP, tobacco companies, weapons manufacturers and private prisons. Based on a 2013 list of mutual funds that the foundation invested in, the claim holds water. The caveats are that the mutual fund managers directed where the money should be invested, not the foundation directly, and this investment is common and covers most industries represented on the stock market. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06701	Says Barack Obama’s "favorability rating in Israel once clocked in at 4 percent."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/sep/04/kinky-friedman/kinky-friedman-says-barack-obamas-favorable-rating/	Texas humorist Kinky Friedman, who challenged Rick Perry for governor five years ago, prefers Perry to Barack Obama for president. Friedman, who is Jewish, offers among his reasons in an Aug. 24, 2011, column in The Daily Beast that Perry is a friend to Israel who has visited the country "on many more occasions than Obama, who’s been there exactly zero times as president. If I were Obama I wouldn’t go either. His favorability rating in Israel once clocked in at 4 percent." It's been documented that Obama has not been to Israel as president. But Is Friedman’s 4 percent statement right? An online search led us to reports of an August 2009 poll in Israel in which only 4 percent of respondents saw the Democratic president’s administration as more pro-Israel than pro-Palestinian. The Jerusalem Post, which commissioned the poll from the Smith Research Center, reported that 51 percent of the polled Israelis said Obama’s administration was more pro-Palestinian than pro-Israel, 35 percent considered it neutral and 10 percent declined to express an opinion. Six times from May 2009 through May 2011, the polling firm asked Israelis about the Obama administration’s lean toward Israel and the Palestinians, with the August 2009 results marking the administration’s lowest pro-Israel rating, according to a summary chart posted by the newspaper this May. The administration’s highest pro-Israel rating came in May 2009; 31 percent of respondents said it was more pro-Israel, 14 percent said it was more pro-Palestinian. In the May 2011 poll, 12 percent said the administration was more pro-Israel, 40 percent rated it more pro-Palestinian. Next, we asked academic experts and journalists versed in the Middle East about Obama’s standing in Israel. Professors Michael Desch of the University of Notre Dame and Jennifer Loewenstein of the University of Wisconsin-Madison agreed that Obama’s policies toward achieving peace in the Middle East are not weaker toward Israel than those of previous presidents, though there have been perceptions otherwise at least since Obama reached out to the Muslim world in a June 2009 speech in Cairo. Both also noted that The Jerusalem Post polls did not inquire directly into Obama’s popularity. Desch, a political scientist, added that Obama might not be as unpopular in Israel as The Post polls suggest. In a November 2009 poll gauging Obama’s popularity among Israelis, commissioned by the U.S.-based New America Foundation, 41 percent of 1,000 respondents had a favorable view of Obama while 37 percent had an unfavorable view, according to a Dec. 10, 2009, news article in Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper. Not that participants had glowing hopes. Haaretz reported that 55 percent of those polled said they thought Obama did not support Israel, with 42 percent saying he did, reflecting the "complexity of views" about him as he pressed both Israel and the Palestinians to resume stalled peace talks, the paper said. The article quoted pollster Jim Gerstein saying: "They genuinely admire and like him ... but at the same time they also want to feel that he is in their corner, and they have concerns over this." In the poll, 50 percent of respondents believed Obama was "weak on terrorism," while 43 percent rated him as naïve, the newspaper said. In its own analysis, the foundation said that while Obama’s favorability rating is "not astronomically high for a U.S. president, it is notably stronger than the favorability ratings for Israel's foreign and defense ministers, and a mere seven (percentage) points below that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu." The foundation quoted Gil Tamary of Israel's Channel 10 News saying that much of Obama's relative unpopularity is a direct consequence of the Israeli press' daily attacks on him. "But based on our survey results," the foundation said, "should Obama decide to make a direct pitch to the Israeli public, his starting position would be one of relative strength. Obama has not yet reached out to Israelis in the way he has to the Muslim world, with his historic trips to Egypt and Turkey. A similarly momentous state visit to Israel could build a tremendous amount of goodwill with an already receptive Israeli public." We searched for other polls of Obama’s standing in Israel. Gallup has not asked explicitly about the president, but it has polled Israelis on whether they approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leadership of the United States. In 2009, Obama’s first year as president, 61 percent approved. In 2010, 54 percent approved, 34 percent disapproved and 14 percent did not know or refused to answer, Gallup says. This year, the Pew Research Center surveyed attitudes on issues including confidence in Obama in more than 20 countries, including Israel. "About half (49 percent) of Israelis have at least some confidence in Obama," Pew said in its July summary, "when it comes to world affairs and about the same percentage (51 percent) has little or no confidence in the U.S. president." The narrow divide in confidence in Obama contrasts with a chasm over his handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Only 29 percent of respondents in Israel approved of Obama’s handling of the conflict; 64 percent disapproved. Pew said 84 percent of residents of the Palestinian territories disapproved of Obama’s handling of the conflict. "Elsewhere in the Middle East, at least eight-in-ten in Lebanon (85 percent), Jordan (82 percent) and Egypt (82 percent) disapprove of Obama’s handling of this issue," Pew said. Uriel Heilman, managing editor of JTA, which describes itself as a global news service of the Jewish people, told us in an interview that many Israelis view Obama as hostile to the country’s current government in part because the American president was critical of Israeli settlements at a time the government was seen at home as making peace concessions. Another time, he said, there was umbrage at Netanyahu not getting a photo opportunity or press conference with Obama during a White House visit. Heilman added: "Let’s not forget Obama is a Democrat and Netanyahu is the equivalent of a Republican" in Israel. Also, he said, Obama’s race may be a factor: "Some people have biases." By email, Gil Hoffman, The Jerusalem Post’s chief political correspondent, suggested Obama has not owned up to missteps. He pointed to a July 2010 interview in which Obama was asked by Israeli anchorwoman Yonit Levy about people who feel he doesn’t have a special connection to Israel. Obama replied: "Some of it may just be the fact that my middle name is Hussein, and that creates suspicion. Some of it may have to do with the fact that I have actively reached out to the Muslim community, and I think that sometimes, particularly in the Middle East, there’s the feeling of the friend of my enemy must be my enemy. And the truth of the matter is, is that my outreach to the Muslim community is designed precisely to reduce the antagonism and the dangers posed by a hostile Muslim world to Israel and to the West." He noted, though, that every speech he’d given about Israel referred to the United States’ special bond with it, including support for its survival and people. Hoffman opined that Obama’s unpopularity is rooted in the absence of peace talks and the failure of his policies to "advance the peace process the way his Democratic and Republican predecessors did. The Israeli Right, which doesn't want a Palestinian state, wouldn't have liked him anyway. And the Israeli Left, which desperately wants two states for two peoples, is very disappointed. We had negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians for 16 years.They ended when Obama was elected and they have not re-started since." So, what of Friedman’s claim? There was a 4-percent result in a poll, but that question covered the Obama administration’s support for Israel--not Obama’s popularity. Meantime, Obama has been viewed favorably by a greater share of Israelis. The statement misrepresents his standing. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09375	"According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people ... to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates" of the health care bill.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/29/mark-kirk/kirk-says-health-care-bill-will-lead-irs-hire-more/	Immediately before and after President Barack Obama signed a landmark health care reform bill on March 23, 2010, critics -- mostly Republicans -- charged that the measure would lead to the hiring of more than 16,000 new Internal Revenue Service employees simply to enforce the bill's tax provisions, including the controversial requirement that almost all Americans secure health insurance or else face a tax penalty. One of at least a dozen lawmakers who made that point was Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., who is a strong contender this fall to win the Senate seat once occupied by Obama himself. "About the only jobs created by the (health care) legislation would be at the IRS," Kirk said in a floor speech on March 21, 2010, the day the measure passed the House. "According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people -- over 700 just in Illinois -- to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill." As we looked into the origin of this statistic, we found reasons to be cautious about its accuracy. Let's first look at what the Congressional Budget Office said. On Dec. 19, 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill, which ultimately became the basis for the bill that was passed by both chambers and signed into law. In its analysis, the CBO wrote that it had "not completed an estimate of the discretionary costs that would be associated with the legislation," including the costs for the IRS and other "federal agencies that would be responsible for implementing the provisions of the legislation." But CBO did offer an estimate of the costs to the IRS for "implementing the eligibility determination, documentation, and verification processes for premium and cost-sharing credits." The IRS, the analysis said, "would probably" need to spend "between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years." However, CBO did not translate that dollar range into a possible number of new hires. Instead, that task was taken up by another group -- the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. On March 18, 2010, the House Ways and Means Republicans released a report titled, "The Wrong Prescription: Democrats’ Health Overhaul Dangerously Expands IRS Authority." That report is the source of the 16,000-plus figure. The Ways and Means Republicans' report acknowledged that it is "impossible to know exactly how many new employees the IRS would have to hire to enforce the individual mandate and other provisions of the Democrats’ health care bill." Still, the report uses IRS data and "reasonable assumptions about costs and program responsibilities" to suggest that as many as 16,500 additional "examiners, agents, and other employees" could be needed. Here's the report's explanation of the math, which is based on the high end of CBO's cost estimate of $10 billion over 10 years: "First, assume that the IRS budget would grow by the $10 billion that CBO indicates could be necessary. While there might be some early-year start-up costs to prepare for the added workload, most of the costs would accrue in the last six years of CBO’s ten-year budget window, when the individual mandate and other provisions, which present the bulk of the new enforcement responsibilities, take effect. Thus, for this analysis, assume that $1 billion total will be spent by the IRS in the first four years to prepare for the mandate with the spending increasing to $1.5 billion per year in each of the last six years. "Second, in the last year for which actual IRS data is available, fiscal year 2009, the IRS employed the equivalent of 92,577 people, nearly half of whom worked directly in examinations and collections. In total, the IRS had payroll and benefit expenses of $8.371 billion, implying that costs per worker were $90,427. If the $1.5 billion in annual funds are used for the payroll and benefits of a similar mix of employees, the IRS could add more than 16,500 additional agents, auditors, examiners, and administrative support personnel to enforce large portions of the nation’s health insurance system." But even as it offered the 16,500 figure, the Ways and Means Republicans' report offered caveats as well. "Some might argue that figure over-estimates the number of employees that would be hired, because it includes only payroll and benefit costs and does not include other costs that would be incurred, including office overhead," the report says. "However, note that the IRS total budget in fiscal year 2009 was $11.708 billion, meaning that, when all costs are included, IRS total spending averaged $126,474 per employee. Thus, critics of the 16,500 figure might argue that any new employees should be assumed to cost as much as the average member of the existing workforce and that the $1.5 billion per year would 'only' support hiring slightly more than 11,800 new IRS employees." In fact, in a footnote, the report said that "it is likely the number would lie somewhere in between the two sets of figures. There would be some additional overhead costs for the new employees, such as computers and telephone services. But there could also be fixed costs that are not as affected by additional workers (e.g., the agency may already have extra office space so does not need to rent additional square footage for each additional worker)." We contacted a half-dozen experts in federal human-resources issues to see if they could provide an independent critique of the report's math, but those who responded ultimately declined to either confirm or second-guess the Ways and Means Republicans' calculations, citing uncertainty about what kind of staffing would be needed. One key unknown is whether computer automation -- something in which the IRS has made a substantial investment in recent years -- could handle much of the work stemming from the health care bill, rather than employees. For the record, the IRS itself says that it has not sorted out the employment fallout yet. On March 25, 2010, IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman appeared at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. At one point, Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., asked Shulman, "You said that right now you are moving forward as far as calculations and costs and staffing needs the IRS has -- you haven't made any of those final determinations yet, have you?" To that question, Shulman answered, "That's correct." Ultimately, we have several problems with the way that Kirk has used the 16,500 figure. • The attribution is misleading. Kirk is right that the 16,500 figure has a connection to CBO -- but only an indirect one. CBO offered a cost estimate, but suggested nothing about how many jobs that dollar figure would translate into. Calculating a jobs number was a task that the Ways and Means Republicans took upon themselves. The CBO is Congress' nonpartisan referee for budgetary questions, and as such maintains a high degree of credibility on both sides of the partisan divide. For Kirk to attribute the 16,500 figure to the CBO rather than to an entity of House Republicans -- who voted unanimously against the final health care bill -- in effect launders partisan fingerprints from the estimate. Even if the 16,500 estimate is ultimately proven accurate, it would have been more accurate to label the the estimate as one coming from a partisan, rather than a nonpartisan, entity. • It uses the high end of the CBO estimate. The CBO estimated a cost burden of between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. The Ways and Means Republicans' report made its calculations based only on the high end of that range. If it had used the $5 billion figure instead (or offered it side by side with the $10 billion figure) it would have worked out to 8,250 jobs. Yet Kirk failed to use a qualifier like "as many as" or "up to" 16,500 new IRS employees. • The Ways and Means Republicans themselves acknowledge that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs. Factoring overhead -- rather than just salaries and benefits -- into the equation would reduce the number from 16,500 new employees to 11,800. This isn't just an outside critique; this is something stated explicitly in the Ways and Means Republicans' own report. And if one uses the $5 billion CBO estimate rather than the $10 billion CBO estimate, that number could shrink to 5,900 new jobs -- substantially below the 16,500 figure used widely in the congressional debate. We think it's fair to assume that the IRS will need to hire new employees, perhaps thousands, to handle the caseload from the new health care bill. And for this item, we will assume that the Ways and Means' Republicans' methodology is credible, since we were not able to find any expert who argued otherwise. Finally, Kirk is hardly alone in ignoring the caveats to the 16,500 figure -- Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., to just cite one example, said in a March 25, 2010, floor speech that "16,500 new IRS agents are going to be required to be hired because of the health care reform bill," which to us expresses an unwarranted degree of certainty. But in this item, we're focusing on Kirk's statement, and we believe it rates only a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Mark Kirk	None	None	None	2010-03-29T16:22:26	2010-03-21	['United_States']
pomt-03013	"Rather than prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government, (Democrats) sat on their hands and did nothing" when they were the majority.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/15/GaGOP/gop-comes-deals-defense-ethics/	In politics, one of the most important rules is never miss an opportunity to take a shot at the other side. Last month, Georgia’s Democratic and Republican parties attacked each other over the issue of ethics. The genesis of this fight was an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report that the head of Georgia's ethics commission is accused by current and former commission employees of improperly intervening in an investigation of Gov. Nathan Deal. "Senate Dems Warned of State Ethics Oversight," read the headline of a news release by the Democrats the day the article was published. The news release accused Deal, a Republican, of engaging in "cronyism." The governor strongly denied any involvement in the ethics case. The Georgia Republican Party sent out its own news release that day, as well. "For over a century, Democrats occupied the Governor's Mansion and set the legislative agenda under the Gold Dome. Rather than prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government, they sat on their hands and did nothing," the Republican Party said in a statement. Surely, the Democrats passed some sort of ethics reform in the century it was in charge of the Georgia Legislature and in the governor’s office. Or maybe not. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out. PolitiFact Georgia took a look in the AJC’s digital archives, which go back to the mid-1980s. During that decade, leaders were aghast at the lack of oversight to prevent and punish public corruption in Georgia. The state’s bribery laws were widely considered to be too narrowly defined. News accounts of alleged bribery were as common as the mercury topping 90 degrees. "It was a completely open world," University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said. In 1990, lawmakers passed an ethics bill that included a cap on campaign contributions at $3,500. Not good enough, many said. In 1992, the Georgia Legislature passed House Bill 1125, legislation aimed at strengthening the state’s ethics laws and campaign finance guidelines for elected officials. The law required for the first time that lobbyists disclose every penny they spend trying to influence legislation. It also imposed new campaign contribution restrictions. The provisions included: No public officials shall accept more than $101 for a speech or similar activities that relate to the duties of their office; The names and dollar amounts of campaign contributions must be reported; Campaign contributions by individuals, political action committees and companies to statewide candidates are limited to $2,500; the limit is $1,000 for a Legislature candidate; Lobbyists must register themselves and pay an annual fee or face a fine up to $2,000. The legislation was crafted after a 50-member panel was created to study and make recommendations to improve Georgia’s ethics guidelines. The leader of that effort was then-Secretary of State Max Cleland, a DeKalb County Democrat who later became a U.S. senator. "It's a phenomenal improvement in ethics laws in Georgia," Melissa Metcalfe, then director of the citizen lobby group Common Cause Georgia, said about the bill at the time. In 2000, the Georgia House of Representatives passed what the AJC reported at the time was its first formal code of conduct for itself. The code set up procedures for educating House members on ethics guidelines and for publishing a handbook containing rules and laws pertaining to ethical conduct. It also required an ethics training course for all newly elected members. The AJC noted some problems with the new code, such as it allowed lawmakers to take gifts of any value from anyone without disclosing them. It also gave them discretion to keep complaints filed against members confidential even after an initial finding of "substantial evidence" of a violation. Still, both the 1992 bill and the 2000 code were passed when Democrats were in control. Was the GOP trying to rewrite history here? Ryan Mahoney, a spokesman for the Georgia Republican Party, maintained the claim is accurate. "Our claim is that while in power the Democrats did nothing to ‘prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government,’ " Mahoney said via email. "Passing two ethics-related bills in 130 years clearly isn't ‘prioritizing’ ethics reform. And creating a system ripe for corruption ... where lobbyists can spend unlimited amounts of money on lawmakers did not ‘restore trust in state government,’ " he said. "On the flip side, Republicans in just 10 short years have passed two comprehensive ethics reform bills. Clearly, they prioritize ethics reform and have done lots to restore trust in state government." In 2002, Republican Sonny Perdue won the governorship and the GOP held the majority of seats in the Georgia Senate. In 2005, lawmakers passed an ethics bill that created a bipartisan House-Senate committee to look into legislative conflicts of interest, prohibited former lawmakers from returning to the Capitol as lobbyists for a year and extended lobbyist disclosure provisions to regulatory officials. Some complained that the bipartisan committee’s work would not be done in public. In 2010, the Legislature passed legislation that tightened reporting requirements for lobbyists and legislators and made it a crime to use state agencies or authority to attack or harass someone. Earlier this year, the Legislature approved a bill that caps gifts from registered lobbyists to government officials at $75. Lobbyists can continue to pay for lawmakers’ meals, cocktails and travel as long as the tab for any single expenditure does not exceed that amount. The cap is one of the more forgiving in the nation among states that allow such spending, but it does mark the first time any limits have been placed on the practice in Georgia. Emmet Bondurant, the former chairman of Georgia Common Cause, said the 1992 bill "would had been considered significant ethics reform." However, he said neither Democrats nor Republicans have been truly serious about ethics reform because they have not given the state ethics commission the ability to investigate potential conflicts of interest. "The ethics commission has been largely confined to record-keeping," said Bondurant, whose wife once served on the commission. Bullock agreed that Georgia passed ethics guidelines on the Democrats’ watch, but he noted that states have gradually toughened their ethics laws in recent decades. In South Carolina, for example, lobbyists cannot buy lawmakers anything. Not even a cup of coffee. Mahoney stood by the claim. "When you do the math and think about how long the Democrats were in charge, I think it’s abundantly clear who has prioritized ethics," he said. Again, the Georgia GOP news release said "rather than prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government, (Democrats) sat on their hands and did nothing" when they were the majority in state government. A search back as recently as the 1980s clearly shows there were bills passed aimed at improving ethics in Georgia while Democrats were in charge. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11321	Says that in the U.S. Capitol, "Stephen F. Austin’s and Sam Houston’s statues" are "the only ones holding a rifle or a sword."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/apr/12/jonathan-saenz/texan-us-capitol-statues-stephen-f-austin-sam-hous/	A fundraising email staked a claim to uniqueness about Texans in the U.S. Capitol that made us wonder. Jonathan Saenz, who heads Texas Values, a group that says it’s dedicated to faith, family and freedom, wrote March 28, 2018, that during a recent walk through the U.S. Capitol, "I gazed up at the carvings and paintings that tell America’s glorious story… smiling that Stephen F. Austin’s and Sam Houston’s statues were the only ones holding a rifle or a sword. I was reminded about the truth of all that’s exceptional about America and Texas." That kind of historical trivia seems tailor-made for our Texas Truth-O-Meter. Tourists visiting Washington, D.C., learn that the Capitol houses 100 statues, two donated by each state. According to the Architect of the Capitol, which is the steward of the landmark buildings and grounds of Capitol Hill, such statues were confined to the building’s National Statuary Hall until Congress in 1933 reacted to overcrowding--at the time, 65 statues were wedged three-deep into the hall--by authorizing the statues to be spread throughout the building, which extends to the Capitol Visitor Center. We scrolled online through the architect office’s posted photos of the 100 statues. Could it be that only Austin and Houston were carved holding a gun or sword? Austin’s statue has a long gun front and center, it looked to us, while Houston’s statue just barely appeared to have a sword to its left rear side. But our click-through of photos of the Capitol statues showed that Houston wasn’t the only one holding a sword. (A fair number of others, we saw, hold books.) List of statues holding weapons When we sought expert help, a curator from the Capitol architect’s office, Jennifer Blancato, emailed us a list of Capitol statues holding weapons — with a notation that the Austin statue alone holds a firearm, which she listed as a rifle. Blancato listed 12 Capitol statues--including the one of Houston--of men holding swords. Similarly, William C. diGiacomantonio, chief historian of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, which was chartered by Congress in the 1960s to educate the public on the Capitol’s history and heritage, responded by email that the Capitol statue of Austin is the only one brandishing a musket or rifle while, he said, many Capitol statues hold swords. Blancato specified as the sword-holding statues: Houston; Gen. Joseph Wheeler of Alabama; Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith of Florida; Gen. James Shield of Illinois; John Stark of New Hampshire; Philip Kearney of New Jersey; John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania; Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island; John Sevier of Tennessee; Ethan Allen of Vermont; Robert E. Lee of Virginia; and Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. (Blancato otherwise said the statues of King Kamehameha I of Hawaii and Chief Washakie of Wyoming hold spears.) We shared Blancato’s break-out with Saenz who said in an emailed statement that he based his claim about the Texas statues on what he noticed while at the Capitol, perhaps "because my focus is always primarily on Texas." Our ruling Saenz said the Capitol statues of Austin and Houston are "the only ones holding a rifle or a sword." This proud Texan's claim has an element of truth in that Austin’s rifle-bearing statue alone holds a rifle. However, a dozen statues donated by states, including the one of Houston, hold swords.

pomt-12778	"Muslims offended that their kids have to recite national anthem."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/21/blog-posting/muslims-objecting-kids-singing-national-anthem-was/	A series of Internet posts implying that Muslim parents don’t want their kids to sing the national anthem has continued to cause a stir, mostly by not making it clear to readers that the controversy is actually years old — and in Australia. "Muslims offended that their kids have to recite national anthem," read the headline on a post we first saw Feb. 20, 2017, on LadyLibertysNews.com. Facebook brought it to our attention as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear its news feeds of fake news. The post was one of many others across cyberspace that discussed how an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children must sing the national anthem. Though some choppy grammar and poor editing made it difficult to know what was a direct quote, we gleaned that a Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman named Unthman Badar said the national anthem was part of a concerted effort of "forced assimilation" of Muslims by Australian officials. But the post included two deceptive photos of schoolchildren standing at attention before an American flag in a classroom. Let’s be clear: There is a controversial pro-Islamic group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir, and their spokesman Uthman Badar (note the spelling difference) did say Muslim children should not sing the national anthem. But what’s not entirely clear from the story is that this happened during a contentious meeting about the strain of Islamic citizens assimilating into Australian culture, held in Sydney on Nov. 1, 2015. "This imposition of values is manifest in matters such as the insistence of senior government ministers that Muslim children sing the national anthem – an anthem which reflects a particular, disputed view of history and celebrates particular ideological values ... Why should they be forced to sing it?" Badar said, according to news reports. (Watch his speech above; the relevant portion starts around the 9:50 mark.) "It is nothing less than forced assimilation ... sought to be justif­ied by exaggerated fear of a security threat," he added. The Australian anthem reads: Australians all let us rejoice, For we are young and free; We've golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts; Of beauty rich and rare; In history's page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair Beneath our radiant Southern Cross, We'll toil with hearts and hands, To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands, For those who've come across the seas We've boundless plains to share, With courage let us all combine To advance Australia fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia fair. The LadyLibertysNews.com story did mention that the story was about Australia, but you had to read carefully to see that. Their post on Facebook was even more deceptive. It includes the caption, "If you're offended by our beautiful flag, representing the blood that has been shed defending this great country, you can go back to the hell hole you came from!!" The LadyLibertysNews.com Facebook page includes a picture of President Donald Trump taking the oath of office and is written from an American perspective. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To the site’s credit, when we contacted them via Facebook message about the post on Feb. 20, they conceded the photo choice was incorrect. Shortly thereafter, they changed the images to a single photo of the Australian flag. As of this writing, they have not amended their Facebook post, which had been shared more than 13,000 times. Our ruling A blog post claiming that Muslims are offended "their kids have to recite national anthem" linked to a deceptively edited post that includes images of children standing at attention before an American flag. In reality, the genesis of the story is not from America but Australia, where a spokesman for an international Islamic political group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir questioned why Muslim children should be forced to sing the Australian national anthem. The post, which has been altered after we inquired, is definitely misleading but not altogether fake. It also comes from 2015, which isn’t mentioned in the post being virally shared.

pomt-00964	"Austin has more lobbyists working for it than any other municipality in Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/16/dave-claunch/mayor-dave-claunch-says-austin-has-more-capitol-lo/	Texas cities naturally gear up to fight state encroachment by enlisting lobbyists, an Austin-area leader said. At a January West Lake Hills City Council meeting, where the council voted to hire a lobbying firm for $40,500 over nine months, Mayor Dave Claunch said employing lobbyists is a way for cities to preserve local control. Claunch went on to say: "Austin has more lobbyists working for it than any other municipality in Texas, mostly because they are frequently a target of the Legislature." Is Austin No. 1 among Texas cities in its load of lobbyists patrolling the Capitol? Claunch, asked how he reached his conclusion, said by phone that's just "common general knowledge." Checking lobbyist registrations For our own look, we turned to state filings by lobbyists. The Texas Ethics Commission has the responsibility of maintaining records including lobbying activity reports. Under state law, lobbyists are required to register with the commission and list their clients annually; the filings are available online. By phone, Natalia Ashley of the Texas Ethics Commission staff said whenever a lobbyist gets a client, he or she must amend their registration. When this happens, the agency’s public lobbyist-client lists are updated, she said. And when there is an update, she said, the new breakdown replaces the previous version posted online, "so we don’t keep a printed document for each update." Still with us? This was significant for our purposes, we realized, because a lobbyist-client list for 2015 about the moment Claunch spoke wasn’t readily available to us a few days later. By the time we inquired, that particular list had been overtaken online by updated versions possibly presenting information that would not have existed when Claunch spoke. To fairly check his claim, then, we considered a next-best thing, the agency’s lobbyist-client list for cities covering 2014. And according to that 2014 Lobby List, updated by the state Jan. 9, 2015, the City of Austin had 22 state-registered lobbyists in 2014, a total greater than the count shown for any of 89 other municipalities. The City of Irving, between Dallas and Fort Worth, came in second with 13. West Lake Hills had four people registered. Top 5 Texas Cities Based on Number of Registered Outside Lobbyists (2014) CITY STATE-REGISTERED LOBBYISTS Austin 22 Irving 13 Fort Worth 10 Houston 9 San Antonio 9 Source: Texas Ethics Commission, 2014 Lobby List with Concerns (Employers and Clients), Jan. 9, 2015 (downloaded Feb. 4, 2015) A complication? We wondered if those reported counts made this a slam-dunk claim. Possibly not, a City of Austin official suggested. John Hrncir, a city governmental relations officer, told us that even though 22 people were listed as lobbying for the city in 2014, he directly consulted with less than half that many. Similarly, a City of San Antonio official said by phone the number of lobbyists shown in state filings as representing that city do not reflect the lobbyists he regularly consults. Jeff Coyle, San Antonio’s director of intergovernmental relations, said he communicates actively with about four or five of San Antonio’s nine contracted lobbyists. Brie Franco, legislative attorney for the City of El Paso, said by phone that she talks directly to three of the four lobbyists listed as representing the city in state records. El Paso hired the firm Focused Advocacy to represent its interests in the legislative session, the same firm enlisted by West Lake Hills. Hrncir said that when a lobbying firm tells the ethics commission its clients and expected payments, the firm may specify all employees with any possibility of doing work on behalf of the city. We ran Hrncir’s analysis by Jack Gullahorn, president of the Professional Advocacy Association of Texas, which says it’s the only recognized statewide association for the lobby and government affairs community. By phone, Gullahorn said Hrncir was correct and added that the entirety of lobbyists in a firm routinely register for all of the clients listed underneath the firm even though someone at the practice may be the primary contact. Lobbyists do this "to be conservative in following the law," Gullahorn said, by ensuring they don’t get in trouble with the state if someone is found lobbying for the city without reporting that in advance. According to an ethics commission report on laws affecting lobbyists, each lobbyist must provide information about each client that employs, retains or reimburses them to lobby. Spending on lobbyists It’s one thing for Austin to have the most lobbyists indicating they’re out there walking the pink building on its behalf. We also looked into how the city stacks up in spending on contract lobbyists at the Capitol. According to a resolution approved without debate at the Austin City Council’s Nov. 20, 2014, meeting, council members agreed to contract with 10 lobbying firms for the 2015 legislative session for an amount not to exceed $805,000 all together. But there were a couple changes after that, Hrncir said, because lobbyists Randy Erben and Luis Saenz joined the administration of Gov. Greg Abbott. Hrncir said the city made an individual contract with Brian Yarbrough, Erben’s previous partner. Jennifer Rodriguez from McGuireWoods Consulting was to assume Saenz’s role on the city’s part, Hrncir said. Lobby Firms Hired by City of Austin Before 2015 Legislative Session FIRM MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE FIRM OR LOBBYIST EXPECTS FROM THE CITY FOR LOBBYING Nora Del Bosque $65,000 Randall Erben*/Erben & Yarbrough $90,000 Marta Greytok Consulting $90,000 Cliff Johnson $90,000 Demetrius McDaniel/GreenbergTaurig $90,000 Clayton Pope $90,000 Luis Saenz*/McGuireWoods Consulting $70,000 Trent Townsend/Imperium Public Affairs $65,000 Joe D. Valenzuela $65,000 Angelo Zottarelli/Adams & Zottarelli, LLC $90,000 TOTAL $805,000 *Erben and Saenz were appointed in December 2014 to be legislative director and appointments director, respectively, for Gov. Greg Abbott, with their duties hence shifted by the city to others, according to John Hrncir, a city governmental relations officer. Source: City of Austin web page, "Resolution No. 20141120-036," adopted by Austin City Council, Nov. 20, 2014 (accessed Feb. 4, 2015) According to lobbyist filings with the commission covering 2014, Austin also was No. 1 in expected spending on lobbyists at the Texas Capitol. To approximate the amount city-hired lobbyists expected to be paid during 2014, we noted the minimum values and maximum values of prospective compensation reported by all the lobbyists listed for each of the five cities already having the most outside lobbyists for the year. In this subset, Austin was No. 1 again (as noted) but Irving, which had more lobbyists than Houston and Fort Worth, was evidently outspent by bigger cities. Projected Ranges of Compensation for City Lobbyists in Texas (Sampling)* 2014 City Projected Range of Compensation of Lobbyists Registered to Represent City Austin Up to $575,000 - $1,050,000 Fort Worth Up to $225,000 - $445,000 Houston Up to $345,000 - $420,000 Irving Up to $215,000 - $340,000 San Antonio Up to $145,000 - $280,000 *This chart reflects projected compensation amounts to lobbyists hired by only the five cities with the most outside lobbyists per commission filings in 2014. Source: Texas Ethics Commission, 2014 Lobby List with Concerns (Employers and Clients), Jan. 9, 2015 (Feb. 6, 2015) Our ruling Claunch said: "Austin has more lobbyists working for it than any other municipality in Texas." In 2014, indeed, Austin had more lobbyists (22) representing its interests before state government than any other Texas city and also was expected to spend more on such lobbyists than a few other cities identified as clients by multiple lobbyists. But lobbyist filings with the state don’t reveal how much time any lobbyist puts in for a particular client. It's possible, for instance, that some lobbyists who registered for Austin worked for firms hired by the city but didn’t personally put in time on its behalf.

pomt-15211	Emails released to the public show Hillary Clinton discussed "the location of Ambassador Stevens, who of course was murdered, in Libya."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/11/andrew-napolitano/did-hillary-clinton-emails-reveal-location-ambassa/	Of course Hillary Clinton’s emails contained classified information, says Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano. That’s obvious, in his view, from the sensitive content of the emails that have been released. The FBI is now investigating the security of the private email system Clinton used while secretary of state, which was not designed to handle classified information. Clinton has said she never dealt with classified information on her private server, though two government watchdog groups have said she did. Even the emails that have now been made public contain sensitive information -— including information about Benghazi, said Napolitano, a former judge, in an Aug. 5 conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity. "I saw emails that have been revealed under the Freedom of Information Act," Napolitano said. "And in them, she is discussing the location of French fighter jets during the NATO bombardment of Libya, how big the no-fly zone is, where the no-fly zones are, and are you ready for this? — the location of Ambassador Stevens, who of course was murdered, in Libya. If that is not classified — if she didn’t know that was classified, she has no business being in public office." Former U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was killed in the 2012 attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Do emails contained on Clinton’s private server really discuss information about his location in Libya? As we'll see, Clinton's emails discuss Stevens' location in general terms — similar to information shared in the media at the time. Key emails We found six possibly relevant emails in the cache of Clinton emails that the State Department has released to the public so far. These emails all take place in a one-month period in 2011 during the Libyan Civil War, about a year and a half before the September 2012 Benghazi attack. At the time, Stevens was not yet the ambassador — he was the special envoy to the Transitional National Council (called the TNC), then the de facto government of Libya — and he was embarking on his first trip to Libya in this role. He became ambassador in May 2012, about four months before his death. We’ll lay out the key points in each email that speak to Stevens’ whereabouts, and then get into the analysis. March 23, 2011: In this email, which Napolitano pointed out to us, Clinton’s then-chief of staff Jacob Sullivan wrote to Clinton about the NATO mission in Libya. Sullivan also wrote that someone named Bill was "trying to make sure Chris Stevens gets into E. Libya." March 27, 2011: This is an email between two State Department officials that was then forwarded to Clinton. The subject line is: "Chris Stevens mission." Regarding his location and travel plans, the email said, "The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days." April 8, 2011: An email among State Department employees (marked "sensitive but unclassified") that was later forwarded to Clinton said, "Security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required." April 10, 2011: Another email among State Department employees later forwarded to Clinton marked "sensitive but unclassified" said, "The situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point where Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat, etc)." April 22, 2011: Yet another email among State Department employees, this one marked "unclassified," that was later forwarded to Clinton, "I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5." April 24, 2011: A final email among State Department employees later forwarded to Clinton: "Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off." After this email, few of the emails released so far discuss Stevens in any capacity until after the 2012 attacks. Clinton only participated in the March 23 email conversation, and she did not say anything about Stevens’ location; in the other emails, she only received the messages. In any case, the information ended up on her private email server. What do the emails tell us? These emails do discuss Stevens’ location, though the terms are vague. We learn from the emails that Stevens was in Malta then Benghazi, where he met with local leaders at unspecified locations, and he stayed at an unnamed hotel. That’s about it. Napolitano’s statement suggests that if a bad guy had gotten his hands on these emails, Stevens could have been in danger because the bad guys would know exactly where to find him. In reality, these emails don’t reveal much more than what was publicly known at the time. On March 25, 2011, Stevens’ predecessor, Ambassador Gene Cretz, said in a press conference that Stevens would soon be traveling to Benghazi. We found at least four State Department daily press briefings between March and April 2011, where a press secretary discussed Stevens’ Benghazi plans with journalists. Quite a few newspaper and television reports at the time said Stevens was in Benghazi meeting with local leaders, such as the New York Times and Fox News. The media reports did not mention that Stevens went into Libya by way of Malta, and that he had set up shop at a hotel. There is, however, an April 11, 2011, Associated Press photo of Stevens meeting with local journalists at the Tibesty hotel in Benghazi, where we now know (as a result of State Department and congressional Benghazi investigations) Stevens had lived and worked in 2011. Now to address the broader point of Napolitano’s statement: that Clinton sent and received classified information. Three of the six emails detailed above were marked "unclassified." Regarding the other three, Clinton received information from other State Department employees, and — as we found in a prior story — as head of the agency, she had the authority to say whether information from her department was classified or not. Of course, there’s always the possibility of Clinton emails clearly containing classified or sensitive information about Stevens that have yet to be or never will be released. But Napolitano specified that he was talking about emails already available to the public. Our ruling Napolitano said emails released to the public show Clinton discussed "the location of Ambassador Stevens, who of course was murdered, in Libya." To clarify, Stevens was not the ambassador to Libya at the time, and the emails occurred about 18 months before the Benghazi attacks that killed him. Clinton received at least six emails that discussed Stevens’ location in Libya, though the terms are vague -- for example, saying he was in Benghazi at an unidentified hotel. The context of Napolitano’s statement gives the impression that the emails contain information that would have been damaging if released, but it was widely noted in the media at the time that Stevens was in Benghazi, and on at least one occasion, reporters encountered him at the hotel where he was living and working. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-05172	Says he has nearly 200 delegates bound to support his candidacy at the Republican National Convention.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jun/15/ron-paul/ron-paul-touts-nearly-200-delegates-bound-his-cand/	U.S. Rep. Ron Paul proclaims "great news" in a message to supporters posted online June 6, 2012. The Texas presidential candidate says: "Due to the smart planning of our campaign and the hard work and diligence of supporters like you, we stand to send nearly 200 bound delegates to the Republican National Convention in Tampa. This number shatters the predictions of the pundits and talking heads and shows the seriousness of our movement." Paul’s message continues: "What’s more, we will send several hundred additional supporters to Tampa who, while bound to" presumptive nominee Mitt "Romney, believe in our ideas of liberty, constitutional government, and a common-sense foreign policy. When it is all said and done, we will likely have as many as 500 supporters as delegates on the convention floor. That is just over 20 percent!" We don’t know how anyone could pin the number of philosophical supporters Paul will have at the convention in late August. Setting that aside, is it correct, as Paul says, that his campaign stands to send nearly 200 "bound delegates" to Tampa? Agreed, one could view Paul’s declaration as a prediction that’s not factually checkable. We see it, though, as a done-did-it boast; note his present-tense crow that the total "shatters the predictions" of others. Let’s look at whether evidence backs up his message. Paul’s campaign did not reply to our requests for elaboration. So, unfortunately, we do not know how he gets to his "nearly 200" count. An independent monitor of delegates won by each candidate, the Associated Press news organization, pegs Paul’s current delegate count at 137. It puts Romney at 1,480 of the party’s 2,286 delegates. Other former candidates and delegate counts, as tabulated by the AP: Rick Santorum (267); Newt Gingrich (138); Jon Huntsman (2). On a web page showing the count, the AP says Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, "became the Republican party's presidential nominee by crossing the threshold of 1,144 delegates to the GOP national convention. ... Most delegates are awarded through state primaries and caucuses. Other delegates, mostly members of the Republican National Committee, are free to endorse any candidate they choose at any time, even before a primary. The Associated Press includes such delegates in its tally once they declare a candidate preference." According to the AP, Paul’s delegates were accumulated in 21 states, starting with one delegate in Iowa’s Jan. 3, 2012, caucuses and three in the subsequent New Hampshire primary. Paul drew the majority of delegates resulting from February caucuses in Minnesota and Maine, drawing 30 and 21 delegates, respectively. He won 18 delegates in the Texas primary in May. Notably, too, some delegates remain to be chosen. For instance, Utah, where Romney has long ties, will determine 40 delegates via its June 26 primary. For deeper perspective, we asked the reporter who oversees the AP count, Stephen Ohlemacher, if Paul stands to have nearly 200 bound delegates at the convention. Ohlemacher said that’s theoretically possible. When we visited by phone on June 13, 2012, Ohlemacher said the AP had either not determined — or voters and activists had yet to decide — how about 230 delegates break out between Romney and Paul, counting 46 members of the Republican National Committee yet to say who they support. RNC members are automatic delegates and may support any candidate they choose. Ohlemacher elaborated in a follow-up email: "Delegates are bound -- or unbound -- based on state party rules. For delegates who are bound by the outcome of primaries, I simply do the calculations on election night and verify them later with the state party. State parties sometimes wait for the certified election results, which can take a month or longer in some states. "For unbound delegates, the AP asks them whom they support. If they say they support a candidate, we count the delegate in that candidate’s total. But we don’t bind them. In fact, when the nomination was still in doubt, we re-interviewed many RNC delegates several times to see if they had changed their minds." In five of six states with caucuses -- Iowa, Colorado, Minnesota, Maine and Washington -- the AP reached delegate counts by assuming each candidate would capture the share of delegates commensurate with how they fared on caucus day, even though actual mix of delegates would be determined later, Ohlemacher said. Still to settle out, he said, are Utah’s winner-take-all primary and delegate-selection decisions at state conventions in Iowa, where the party chair supports Paul and 26 delegates are to be awarded; Montana, with 23 delegates at issue; and Nebraska, with 32 delegates at stake. Looking back, Ohlemacher said that in Pennsylvania, 59 delegates were elected directly on the ballot, with no indication whom they supported for president. The AP reached 31 of them, he said, with 28 yet to respond, making their candidate choices unknown. Also, he said, the Pennsylvania party has yet to pick 10 additional delegates. On another front, Louisiana’s recent state convention ended with 23 delegates not assigned to candidates, he said. Five were to be "uncommitted," he said, based on the state’s GOP primary results. Also, he said, the AP has not determined the alignment of 12 delegates picked at the Illinois state convention or 16 delegates chosen at Indiana’s convention. Phew. It could be, we suppose, that Paul picks up enough yet-to-be determined delegates to have nearly 200 delegates at the convention. However, it also seems unlikely Paul could have known as much for a certainty when he sent his message. Separately, we contacted Romney’s campaign about delegate counts and didn’t hear back. We also nudged Ted Kwong, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, who deferred to the AP’s count. "We don’t have an official, up-to-date delegate count," Kwong said by phone. Our ruling If enough yet-to-be-chosen or yet-to-declare delegates go Paul’s way, he could land nearly 200 delegates. However, we rate claims based on what’s known when the claims are made. Paul had 137 delegates when he wrote supporters about shattering predictions. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2012-06-15T16:49:13	2012-06-06	['None']
pomt-13480	"Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/09/donald-trump/trump-says-veterans-treated-worse-illegal-immigran/	Donald Trump has repeatedly said immigrants living illegally in the United States have it better than veterans who have served the country. He said it over Memorial Day weekend at a rally honoring prisoners of wars and troops missing in action, during a speech in Arizona outlining his immigration plan and most recently at the Union League of Philadelphia, which supports veterans and their families. "Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants, people that come into our country illegally," Trump said Sept. 7. His campaign stuck by the claim, offering evidence he is right. We decided to take a deeper look. The Trump campaign’s argument In an email, the Trump campaign claimed that many politicians give more attention and pledge more support to those in the country illegally than to veterans. Specifically, Trump’s campaign said Hillary Clinton "downplayed" the Department of Veterans Affairs scandal about veterans waiting for months for medical care. (We rated Mostly False a claim by Trump that Clinton is "satisfied" with the VA.) They also noted that she has not demanded "the introduction of a massive veterans benefits bill her first 100 days as president." Instead, she said pledged "to fight for illegal immigrants and spend taxpayer dollars granting them benefits, such as Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare." (We rated a similar claim by Trump Mostly False that Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and to provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for undocumented immigrants.) Trump’s campaign also pointed to a 2008 Washington Post article noting that a man had previously been convicted of drunken driving but not questioned about his immigration status. He later killed two people while drunk and speeding, and sentenced to 24 years in prison. "Illegal immigrants convicted of DUIs are often released without any immigration consequences," Trump’s press team wrote. "But members of the military who receive DUIs are subject punishment from their commanding officers and court martial." The campaign also said that in terms of financial resources, billions of dollars are spent at all levels of government on undocumented immigrants, about $950 million were budgeted for fiscal year 2016 to care for children who entered the country illegally without their parents, cost to house undocumented immigrants in prisons in fiscal year 2014 was $1.87 billion. Other than the anecdote about the DUI case, we’re not sure any of these examples show how veterans are being treated worse than people living in the United States illegally. So we decided to directly compare the two groups using things Trump often talks about -- education, health care and tax and fiscal policy. Education In terms of K-12 public education, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that no one can be denied access, even if they are undocumented, said Irene Bloemraad, a sociology professor at the University of California. That equal access also applies to veterans, but presumably veterans are not seeking K-12 education, Bloemraad said. "At best, we can conclude no advantage, one way or another, at this level of education," she said. That Supreme Court ruling does not apply to post-secondary education and it’s up to states to set the rules regarding undocumented immigrants’ access to public colleges and universities, Bloemraad said. Two states -- Alabama and South Carolina -- bar undocumented students from enrolling in public postsecondary institutions. Georgia’s State Board of Regents does not allow undocumented students to enroll in selective public universities (institutions that admit fewer than apply), according to University Leaders for Educational Access and Diversity Network. "Veterans would presumably face no ban to enrolling," Bloemraad said. "So clearly, veterans are not treated worse; rather, in some states undocumented students are in a much more difficult position." A veteran resident can also pay in-state tuition rates and can apply for federal benefits for post-secondary education, she said. Higher education and training benefits are available to veterans, servicemembers and their families through federal programs such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Undocumented students are not eligible for federal financial aid. In some states, undocumented students are required to pay higher, out-of-state rates for their education, even if they have lived in that state most of their life, Bloemraad said. Overall: Advantage veterans. Medical care The Emer­gency Med­ical Treat­ment and Active Labor Act, enacted by Congress in 1986, provided that hospitals provide anyone emergency care until stabilized, said Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. So undocumented immigrants, by law, can get immediate emergency care -- but so can veterans. In this regard, both groups are treated the same in case of medical emergencies. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to buy health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Veterans enrolled in the Veteran’s Affairs health care system (about 9 million of the 22 million veterans) are not eligible for the Affordable Care Act, but others would be -- unless they are eligible or have other coverage such as Medicare or employer-sponsored insurance, Wilensky said. Still, veterans are eligible for medical care. It’s "hard to think of an example where an illegal immigrant would get better care," Wilensky said. Some of the Veterans Affairs care is clearly substandard or delayed, but that’s a different problem, she said. Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard University, said there are limits to the programs and care available to undocumented immigrants. They are not eligible for Medicaid, for instance, she said. Veterans are eligible for Medicaid and those who qualify usually do not pay copays for Veterans Affairs health care, according to the Veterans Affairs Department. "I can't think of ways in which veterans have less access or lower quality care than undocumented immigrants," Baicker said. Overall: Advantage veterans. Taxes, Social Security Veteran’s benefits generally are not subject to tax and many tax provisions benefit service members, said Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Pay earned while serving in a combat zone is exempt from federal income tax, he said. "I can't think of any tax issue that would hit troops harder than undocumented immigrants," Williams said. Veterans are entitled to Social Security benefits. Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, according to the Social Security Administration. As the Associated Press has also noted, undocumented immigrants don’t have the right to vote, don’t have legal permission to work or to receive most government benefits. Veterans who are citizens have the right to vote, have job employment resources such as the Veterans Employment Center and may qualify for Veteran Affairs health benefits. Overall: Advantage veterans. Our ruling Trump said, "Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants." In some states undocumented immigrants are barred from enrolling in post-secondary institutions, or pay out-of-state tuition even if they’ve lived in that state most of their lives; veterans are eligible for federal benefits for higher education and training and are eligible for in-state tuition. Undocumented immigrants also aren’t eligible for Medicaid, cannot buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act and cannot receive Social Security benefits, all of those services and benefits are available to veterans. Veterans also have the right to vote and are eligible for federal job placement resources. Veterans are entitled to several more benefits that are not offered to civilians, much less undocumented immigrants.

pomt-02377	Dan Patrick "called for increasing the gas tax and the state sales tax."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/17/david-dewhurst/dan-patrick-once-called-regular-gas-tax-increases-/	State Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, the conservative radio talk-show host who led Republican primary balloting for lieutenant governor, has not been stumping on a raise-your-taxes platform. Yet his opponent in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the nomination, incumbent David Dewhurst, aired a TV ad before the March primary in which the narrator declares that Patrick "called for increasing the gas tax and the state sales tax." He did? By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us a backup document for the ad including excerpts from news stories published in 2009 and 2011 quoting Patrick as supportive of higher gas and sales tax rates. Also by email, Patrick campaign spokesman Logan Spence pointed out entries on Patrick’s campaign website characterizing the tax claims as misrepresentations. Hiking either tax would be a big move. Lawmakers last raised the state gas or motor fuels tax, of 20 cents a gallon, in 1991 and last increased the statewide sales tax, to 6.25 percent, in 1990, the House Research Organization noted in a March 11, 2011, report. We searched the Nexis database for relevant news stories on Patrick's positions on the taxes. Gas tax In the 2009 legislative session, Patrick resisted a push by Sen. John Carona, R-Dallas, and others to offer voters in Dallas, Harris and other urban counties the option of raising gas tax rates by up to 10 cents a gallon locally toward paying for local transportation projects. During Senate floor debate, Patrick told colleagues the option would burden taxpayers. "I didn't come to Austin to be in this Senate to raise taxes over and over again on my constituents," Patrick said, the Dallas Morning News reported in an April 9, 2009, news story. That day, Patrick was on the losing end of a Senate vote for a proposal including the local-option tax increase, but the tax option never did make it into law. Five months later, as noted by Dewhurst’s camp, Patrick told a forum of Houston-area residents he would back regular statewide gas-tax hikes. Specifically, a Sept. 17, 2009, Houston Chronicle news story quoted Patrick as saying that he supported a slight increase to the state's gas tax and then annual one-cent increases to generate money for state transportation projects. "I want the whole state involved" in paying for transportation needs, Patrick said. We found no evidence of Patrick raising that idea again, while in February 2013, he declined to opine on increasing the gas tax after Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock, R-Killeen, chairman of the House Public Education Committee, said he was going to be brave by supporting an increase. According to a Feb. 26, 2013, Associated Press news story, Patrick, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, "passed on the question, saying his head had been buried in education." During a February 2014 candidate forum, Patrick floated another way to raise money for transportation projects by saying he favors dedicating revenues from the state’s vehicle sales tax to future highway funding, the Chronicle reported Feb. 6, 2014. Sales tax From June 2008 into May 2012, news stories show, Patrick spoke in favor of increasing the state sales tax. Almost always, he said money generated by such increases should be spent to reduce property taxes. A June 24, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news story, echoed in a Jan. 8, 2009, Chronicle news account, quoted Patrick as saying: "We need to fund our schools for the long term, and the best way to do this is through sales tax." The Statesman story said Patrick had previously called for repealing the state’s business margins tax while boosting the sales tax 2 percentage points and also charging sales tax on some items then exempt from the tax. The story did not list particular items. Such an increase would generate an estimated $6 billion a year, the Statesman said. The story also said: "Many Republicans, including Patrick, have long embraced the idea of relying more on the sales tax to pay for government services. At its convention this month, the Texas Republican Party included abolishing the school property tax--to be replaced with the sales tax and spending cuts--in its platform." Patrick told the paper: "The fairest way to tax people is on what they consume and their ability to pay, not on where they live." Another instance: Patrick said during a 2010 committee meeting that he favors a sales tax increase to fund public education instead of relying on property tax revenue, the Chronicle reported Sept. 17, 2010. "The homeowners and the commercial business owners can't stand much more," Patrick said, noting that all consumers would directly contribute to public education if the funding source shifted from property to sales taxes. According to a Sept. 6, 2011, Chronicle news story, as noted by Dewhurst's camp, Patrick suggested a two-cent state sales tax increase, which he said would generate enough revenue to make up for $5 billion in school-related reductions put in motion by the 2011 Legislature. According to the story, Patrick told a local group he wouldn't suggest more of an increase because if the rate goes too high, it begins to affect commerce in the border counties. "Right now you have 4.5 million homeowners paying for education," Patrick said. "I'd rather have all 21 million (residents) contributing to the cost of education." Reporters for the Houston newspaper wrote conflicting interpretations of Patrick’s remarks with a Sept. 2, 2011, Chronicle news blog post stating that Patrick wasn’t saying to the local group that revenue from increased sales taxes should be spent making up for cuts in school aid. According to the blog post, Patrick was proposing "to tie a sales-tax increase to a property-tax reduction of somewhere between 5 and 10 cents" per $100 valuation. A May 18, 2012, news story in the Morning News mentioned Patrick’s earlier call for a two-cent sales tax increase to cover lowered school property taxes. "What we have seen over the years is that tying the system to the property tax has not worked very well," Patrick said. "We have to find a steady stream of revenue that keeps up with the growth and the needs of our state." We did not spot more recent news stories about Patrick pitching higher sales taxes to lower property taxes, while a video posted by his campaign suggests he’s not seen a sales tax plan that he would champion. In Patrick’s video, posted online Feb. 9, 2014, Patrick reads aloud a voter question about why he doesn’t favor eliminating property taxes entirely by raising the sales tax. "We need to move more to sales tax, away from property taxes, for really our main source of funding our government and our schools," Patrick says. But he also says there are ways to achieve as much solely by eliminating existing sales-tax exemptions while preserving exemptions on food and medicine. "If there’s a model presented to me and the Legislature where we think we can actually do that, then I’m all in favor of that," Patrick said. "I haven’t seen the model yet, but I’m a sales tax, I’m a sales/consumption tax guy. So, let’s move away from property taxes." Summary Summing up: Patrick opposed a local-option gas tax proposal before calling--in a 2009 appearance--for regular statewide jumps in the tax to bolster transportation projects. Far as we can tell, he did not repeat that call. From 2008 into 2012, meantime, Patrick consistently advocated higher sales taxes to pay for lowering property taxes, though he recently said he hasn’t warmed up to a particular tax-swap plan. We failed to win an interview with Patrick to discuss his tax views over the years. Our ruling Dewhurst said Patrick "called for increasing the gas tax and the state sales tax." Both parts of this claim are correct, but clarifications are missing. Patrick piped up once for regular gas tax increases, in a 2009 talk, also making it clear that related revenue should pay for transportation projects. Similarly, his consistent calls for higher sales taxes have almost always been linked to reductions in property taxes, a detail this claim doesn’t cover. Finally, Patrick has not made increasing either tax a theme of his campaign for lieutenant governor. We rate this statement as Mostly True.

For instance, during congressional testimony in 2009, a nurse from Texas told of losing her coverage after being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer because she had failed to disclose in her insurance application that she had once visited a dermatologist for acne, the Los Angeles Times reported. Such stories provide the background for a claim in The Road We’ve Traveled, a 17-minute film from President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign. The film touts Obama’s achievements in health care, saying that the Affordable Care Act has substantially expanded coverage for millions of Americans. The film claims that as a result of Obama’s policies, "Americans no longer will see their coverage dropped or capped when illness strikes." We decided to check to see whether that was correct. In the widely publicized (and criticized) practice, health insurers used sometimes innocent or inadvertent mistakes by applicants to retroactively rescind their coverage. Furthering public outrage were revelations that these was not merely rogue practices but, at least at certain companies, pervasive policies. According to congressional testimony, employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses, the Los Angeles Times reported. This issue was confronted head-on in the 2010 health care law passed by the Democratic Congress and signed by Obama, according to a summary of the health care law published by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The law has already begun to prohibit individual and group health plans from placing "lifetime limits on the dollar value of coverage" and prohibit insurers from "rescinding coverage except in cases of fraud." Beginning in January 2014, the law is scheduled to prohibit individual and group health plans from placing annual limits on the dollar value of coverage. (Prior to that date, plans may impose annual limits on coverage only according to limits set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.) Whereas the old practices allowed companies to comb policies for inadvertent omissions and minor breaches of the fine print, the new law sets a higher threshold -- fraud -- that would be harder, though not impossible, for companies to prove. On the surface, then, the ad would appear to be accurate. However, we think there’s a bit of context that’s worth noting. The law doesn’t explicitly stop companies from imposing limits on the number of visits to doctors, physical therapists and the like. This may be dealt with once an "essential health benefits package" is created by 2014 -- a package that would serve as the minimum list of services available with plans purchased on the health care "exchanges" that are to be set up by the health care law. But since the elements of this package have not yet been determined, we don't know whether the package will ultimately include a ban on limiting physician visits. This lack of certainty weakens the film’s claim that Americans will "no longer will see their coverage … capped when illness strikes." Second, it’s worth noting that the number of people who experienced revocations of their insurance was quite small. Typically this only happened to people with individually purchased insurance policies, and even within that group, the rates were small. We looked at the study that served as the statistical basis for the congressional hearings we cited earlier. It was produced by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the group of state-based officials who regulate insurance. The group found that in the five-year period from 2004 to 2008, the annual number of rescinded policies averaged 5,449 per year, ranging from a high of 7,004 in 2005 to a low of 4,818 in 2007. To put this in perspective, 28.5 million people in 2008 had individually purchased insurance -- the only kind for which people had to worry about getting their insurance revoked -- while 202.6 million had private insurance of any type, according to the Census Bureau. So, fewer than two of every 10,000 people who held individually purchased policies in 2008 saw their insurance revoked that year, or about two of every 100,000 people who had private insurance of any kind. Our ruling The film is largely accurate that Obama’s health care law makes it all but impossible for health insurers to revoke their beneficiaries’ policies for anything short of willful fraudulence. But the law hasn’t yet entirely closed the door on limiting beneficiaries medical services. And it’s worth noting that, their media profile notwithstanding, there weren’t a large number of people who experienced revocations every year. Their number was far smaller than, say, those hurt by pre-existing condition rules, or those left uninsured after graduating from college -- the other two claims the film makes about Obama’s health care law. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-03-19T16:31:10	2012-03-16	['United_States']
pomt-10688	"This guy didn't even support Ronald Reagan."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/11/rudy-giuliani/hitting-him-where-it-hurts/	Among GOP primary voters, the name Ronald Reagan is sacred. So, it's not surprising that each Republican candidate for president has done his best to claim Reagan's mantle and position himself as heir to his legacy. Rudy Giuliani, the only GOP candidate who says he supports abortion rights, might have the hardest time making that sale, since Reagan's legacy is so wrapped up in his socially conservative views. Even so, Giuliani has made much of the past statements of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has admitted he did not always support the Gipper. The Romney admission in question, like much else Romney has tried to bury in his past, came in a 1994 Senate debate when Romney faced Edward Kennedy. The topic was economics. Kennedy said: "And under your economic program, under the program of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush, we saw the growth in terms of the unemployment, the growth in the number of children living in poverty, the growth in terms of those children out of wedlock." Romney responded: "I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Romney has since gone out of his way to distance himself from such remarks, repeatedly referencing Reagan in glowing terms on the campaign trail this year and acknowledging his own conversion to social conservatism on hot-button issues like abortion and gay rights. "Now, I wasn't always a Ronald Reagan conservative," Romney told a meeting of conservative activists in January. "Neither was Ronald Reagan, by the way." We find Giuliani correctly characterizes his rival's past statements and find the claim to be True.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2007-12-11T00:00:00	2007-11-26	['None']
pomt-07254	Says Rick Perry is "the guy that tracked" down Democratic legislators who fled Texas in 2003.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/may/28/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-rick-perry-tracked-down-democra/	Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh, declaring that Texas Gov. Rick Perry is toying with running for president in 2012, has praised him for opposing abortion and amnesty for illegal immigrants -- and for tracking down Democrats. According to a transcript of Limbaugh’s May 18 program posted online, Limbaugh said: "Rick Perry’s the guy that tracked these Democrats that left the state down. Remember they ran out, just like the Wisconsin Democrats did," a reference to the 14 Wisconsin state senators who left the Badger State for about a month this year in an attempt to stop legislation reducing the collective-bargaining rights of many state workers. Limbaugh, who didn’t respond to an email seeking the backup for that claim, was surely referring to one of two bygone events in the Texas Legislature: when House Democrats hied to Oklahoma in a May 2003 attempt to prevent action on a GOP-steered redraw of the state’s congressional districts, or when Senate Democrats similarly made a July 2003 run to New Mexico. Both flights temporarily kept the respective chambers from having sufficient members to conduct business. Both also ended with the Democrats returning--and Republicans ultimately setting in place revised districts that resulted in GOP candidates capturing a majority of the state’s U.S. House seats. Did Perry track down the departed D’s, as Limbaugh says? News reports from those episodes suggest Senate Democrats were not "tracked" at all since their destination was quickly revealed; before leaving Austin on July 28, some gave interviews on the fact the senators were boarding private planes to Albuquerque. The Houston Chronicle reported the next day that Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who presides over the Senate, said that since the senators had left the state, "from a practical standpoint, there's not much we can do." But the earlier surprise departure of more than 50 House Democrats on May 12, 2003, stirred search actions that involved Republican heavyweights including Perry. The Dallas Morning News reported on May 13, 2003, that the Democrats had been found the night before, based on a sighting of a private airplane belonging to former House Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale Center. Laney had boarded his Piper Cheyenne with his pilot on May 12, taking off from Hale County Airport and landing at the Downtown Executive Airport in Ardmore about an hour later, the newspaper said, quoting an airport employee. In a telephone interview, former News reporter Matt Stiles told us he drove to Ardmore from Dallas the same day after a colleague, Pete Slover, twigged the plane’s location. Stiles said he arrived at the Holiday Inn by 6 p.m., recognized Laney and then gathered comments from some House Democrats that became part of the paper’s scoop that evening. The News said that four Texas DPS officers, in plain clothes, also made it to the hotel in the wake of the Democrats. That evening, the newspaper said, the troopers spent most of their time sitting in the hotel lobby, with cars and planes at the ready for transporting anyone who volunteered to return to Austin. The News quoted a DPS captain saying: "We came at the request of the governor's office to make contact and to inform them that their services are still needed in Austin. They have chosen to stay here." The newspaper said the troopers planned to depart by midnight. Next, we contacted Bob Richter, former spokesman for then-House Speaker Tom Craddick. Richter told us that the day the Democrats vamoosed, Perry appeared "gung-ho on getting them back" and "brought a bunch of people together to try to find them." A command post was set up next to the speaker's office. At one point, Richter said, he saw Perry in his office calling out the number on the tail of Laney’s plane. A subsequent Morning News article on May 23, 2003 said that in the early hours of the search, a DPS lieutenant had called the federal Department of Homeland Security seeking the whereabouts of Laney's plane. Homeland Security officials released a partial transcript of the call and said the DPS officer had misled them into believing the plane had crashed, the newspaper reported. According to a May 28, 2003, Houston Chronicle article, House General Investigating Committee Chairman Kevin Bailey, D-Houston said Capitol security tapes showed Perry entering and leaving Craddick’s office on May 12. Bailey also said that Perry's homeland defense coordinator - Assistant Attorney General Jay Kimbrough - gave the DPS a California phone number for Homeland Security’s air interdiction service, which tracks terrorists and smugglers. The governor wasn’t the only one looking for the Dems. U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, then the House majority leader, said his staff asked the Federal Aviation Administration to find Laney’s plane, according to the May 23 Morning News story. The report quotes DeLay saying that when he learned the plane was en route from Ardmore to an airport north of Austin, he passed the information to Craddick. The San Antonio Express-News reported June 5, 2003, that Perry at one point directed a DPS official where to send Texas Rangers to hunt for two missing Democrats -- an order that the newspaper said "directly contradicts the governor's longstanding contention that he wasn't involved in the DPS search for Democratic lawmakers who fled Austin to kill a congressional redistricting bill." According to the newspaper, the DPS official, Lt. Will Crais, described as the ranking officer at the command post set up at the Capitol, testified in a lawsuit brought against.the DPS by a Democratic legislator. The newspaper reported that Crais said Perry "began asking me numerous questions" and eventually ordered that Rangers be dispatched to Galveston and to Brownsville, where it was thought that Rep. Craig Eiland, D-Galveston, and Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, were hiding. Neither legislator was there. Eiland was in Ardmore and Oliveira was in Matamoros, Mexico, across the Rio Grande from his hometown, the Express-News reported. Perry's spokeswoman, Kathy Walt, told the newspaper that Perry issued no such orders. Throughout, Walt had described the governor as having no involvement in the hunt beyond checking on its status. According to a June 5, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article citing Crais’ testimony, Craddick was the one who told the DPS the missing lawmakers were in Ardmore. Perry’s office didn’t immediately respond when asked about Limbaugh’s claim that he pinpointed the Dems. Craddick issued a statement saying: "That is not correct. Perry was not the guy that tracked the Democrats down." Our sense: Perry was trying to find the missing lawmakers. His homeland defense coordinator and the Department of Public Safety were joined in that effort, which also involved federal agencies, and the governor reportedly directed the Texas Rangers to two Texas cities. But it was a news organization that got to the Democrats first. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2011-05-28T06:00:00	2011-05-18	['Texas', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Rick_Perry']

pomt-03444	Proposed cuts in the House farm bill mean "2 million less people on food stamps, 210,000 children will not receive school lunches or breakfasts."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/21/barbara-lee/food-stamp-cuts-would-deny-aid-millions-school-lun/	When the House of Representatives voted down the 2013 food bill, cuts in the food stamp program played a central role. The bill as a whole aimed to reduce spending by about $40 billion, with about half of the total coming from a range of nutrition programs. Democrats vigorously opposed the plan. "The price of a farm bill should not be making more people hungry in America," said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., during Thursday’s debate. One claim about what the cuts would do to families came earlier in the week from Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. In an interview on MSNBC, Lee said the cuts would mean "2 million less people on food stamps. 210,000 children will not receive school lunches or breakfasts." Judging by the House vote, 234 opposed versus 195 in favor, that sort of argument was persuasive, although some of the opposition also came from conservatives who thought the farm bill as a whole was too expensive. We thought the claim about the impact on families would bear a closer look. Lee’s office pointed us to a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a group that generally favors government aid to society’s less fortunate members. That report highlighted a couple of key changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. Among the most significant, the House measure would eliminate something called "categorical eligibility." Categorical eligibility allows states to use one set of criteria for its welfare programs, a move that reduces red tape but also has the effect of granting food stamps to people with incomes or assets slightly above the federal cutoff. The CBPP report cited a 2012 Congressional Budget Office study that said getting rid of categorical eligibility would reduce the program rolls by about 1.8 million people. (About 47.7 million people are currently in the program.) The CBO is the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress. Its analysts also wrote that the change would likely "increase the time required to verify information on SNAP applications, which would probably result in more errors and greater administrative costs." Analysts who think Congress ought to do away with categorical eligibility don’t challenge the CBO numbers. Rachel Sheffield with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, opposes a broad approach to eligibility, as well as a measure called Heat and Eat, which allows states to make what she says are unrealistic allowances for a family’s utility bills. "Loopholes like broad-based categorical eligibility and Heat & Eat have allowed the rolls to swell and should be eliminated," Sheffield said. But that is a matter of policy, not the numbers in the CBO estimate. Sheffield agrees that the number of SNAP participants would decline and in her view, that would be better. In some states, there is a direct connection between food stamps, which go to a household, and free and reduced-price school meals, which go to the children. Basically, in those states, if a family gets food stamps, the children automatically qualify for a break on the price of breakfast and lunch at school. In an analysis of the latest bill, the CBO estimated that reducing the food stamp rolls would mean that about 210,000 children would lose automatic eligibility for the school meals program. However, they might still qualify; they would need to apply separately. So to say that all 210,000 would no longer be able to participate goes beyond the CBO analysis. Our ruling Lee said that cuts in the House farm bill would leave 2 million people without food stamps and remove 210,000 children from the school breakfast and lunch program. Ultimately, both numbers go back to the Congressional Budget Office, which is generally seen as impartial. The CBO analysis largely supports the food stamp rolls reduction, but there is more uncertainty regarding school meal subsidies. She is off a little bit on the 2 million number; it's actually 1.8 million. And, with school lunches, it's uncertain that all 210,000 would no longer qualify. It's possible some might still be able to receive free or reduced cost lunches by applying separately. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13129	"Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-some-states-you-can-cast-early-/	Campaigning in Eau Claire, Wis., one week before election day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had a message for Wisconsinites who voted early for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but now regret it. "Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake," Trump said in the Nov. 1, 2016 speech. Cast your ballot early, take it back and cast a new one? In Wisconsin, if you act quickly enough, you can do it, whether you voted in-person absentee or absentee by mail. The act is known as "spoiling," something that has been permitted in Wisconsin for many years. "It’s something that, prior to this year, very few people have done," Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney told us. Of course, 2016 has been unlike most any other election year. And it also applies in reverse -- folks who voted early for Trump could take back their ballots, too. How spoiling works According to a Wisconsin Elections Commission news release issued on the same day of Trump’s speech: Once you have been issued a ballot, whether at the polling place, at the clerk’s office or by mail, you can ask to spoil your ballot as long as the ballot has not been cast and get a new one in the event you make a mistake or change your mind. When voting by mail, spoiling your ballot requires contacting the clerk’s office and requesting a new ballot be sent to you. The deadline for most voters to make that request is Nov. 3, 2016. Voters who have already mailed absentee ballots back to the municipal clerk’s office can go to the clerk’s office and make the request for a new ballot in person. The deadline to request a new absentee ballot would the last day the clerk offers in-person absentee voting. For most clerks, that is Nov. 4, 2016, but voters should contact their municipal clerk for scheduled hours. Absentee voters cannot spoil their ballot at their polling place on Election Day. That was prohibited by a 2011 state law. Voters in at least three other states -- Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania -- also accommodate early voter’s remorse, according to news articles in the past two days by the Washington Times, ABC News and Fox News. The National Conference of State Legislatures doesn’t have a list of states that allow re-casting a ballot. In some instances, it may come down to the discretion of a local election official, spokesman Mick Bullock said. Our rating Trump says: "Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake." As long as you do it in time -- in Wisconsin, several days before election day -- you can "spoil" your original ballot and cast a new one. At least three other states allow re-voting, too.

pomt-05698	PIP fraud is "$1 billion in fraud."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/09/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-pip-fraud-1-billion/	Just about every time Gov. Rick Scott mentioned his goal to reform Florida’s no-fault insurance law this legislative session he includes something else: PIP fraud accounts for $1 billion. He calls it a "fraud tax" on consumers. Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, insurance groups and other advocates for change have also used the figure. Scott repeats the $1 billion claim to reporters and interest groups and average Floridians. "We are the No. 1 state for staged auto accidents where people fake an accident," Scott said. "If we don't fix this — it's already $1 billion in fraud — it will go up 30 percent year after year after year." With a cost so central to the push for reform, we wondered where it came from -- and if it’s right. Scott’s communications team pointed us a to presentation outlining the problems with PIP from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. Total payments of PIP benefits jumped 70 percent from 2008 to 2010. In 2008, it was $1.45 billion. In 2010, it was $2.45 billion. Reform advocates see it this way: What else but fraud could explain an increase in PIP payouts when the number of drivers stayed constant and traffic accidents have declined over recent years? "Ironically, the number of lawsuits also doubled in the last two years," wrote Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty in a January letter to the editor, "which undermines the entire premise of the ‘no-fault’ legal system." Scott’s press office also pointed us to a December 2011 report from a working group written by the state’s insurance consumer advocate, Robin Westcott, who works for Atwater. This report uses slightly different numbers, based on what is called "direct variable cost," to measure the burden on insurance companies. The direct variable costs include direct incurred losses, money to defend and investigate suspicious claims, commissions, taxes, licenses and fees, and policyholder dividends. This measure does not include overhead expenses and investment income. These costs increased from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $2.7 billion in 2010, creating the $910 million "fraud tax." "There is no other cause attributable for this increase but that of fraud and abuse in the PIP system reflected as a $910,695(000) fraud tax on consumers," the report states. The reports use different data, which may explain their differing measuring points. The Office of Insurance Regulation uses PIP data reported by insurers in early 2011. The CFO report uses numbers from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. We went outside the state and consulted the Insurance Information Institute. By their calculations, Florida’s no-fault insurance law has cost insurers $1.3 billion from 2009 to 2011. The institute did not have a comparison for 2008-2010. The group adjusted its estimate for the rising cost of health care by incorporating the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. We should note that the $1.3 billion estimate includes actual data through the second quarter of 2011, so part of it is an estimate. So, if you ask the insurance industry and its self-reported data on PIP payouts, Scott’s right. Some say it's not all fraud Ask the other side of the bitter PIP reform fight and you’ll get a different perspective. Opponents of insurers in the PIP fight -- mainly lawyers -- told us they questioned the methodology of both measurements of the $1 billion Scott mentions. Florida Justice Institute officials pointed us to a college professor’s analysis of the Office of Insurance Regulation’s data. Florida State professor Lorilee Medders dinged the agency’s data for being voluntarily submitted by companies and unaudited by the Office of Insurance Regulation. Beyond that, though, lawyers say there could be other reasons besides fraud for the increased payouts. A big one: the economy. Russel Lazega, a personal injury attorney who represents hospitals and emergency rooms across the state, as well as a small insurance company, said he’s seeing more middle-class clients file PIP claims. Normally they might have eaten the cost of medical care and missed work for fear of increased premiums. These days, he said, they can’t afford to pay out-of-pocket for care and have to file claims. "Now they don’t have a choice," said Lazega, a critic of the changes Scott supports. Lazega added he represents St. Petersburg emergency rooms and hospitals trying to get trauma bills paid. "I have a hard time wrapping my head around where they come up with a $1 billion number," he aid. Kim Driggers, a Tallahassee attorney who represents chiropractors and works with the Florida Justice Association, called the notion of "$1 billion in fraud" an overreach. "Just because more in benefits were paid in a year certainly does not mean every dollar spent was on a fraudulent claim," she said. "It’s not like the CFO went out and said here’s $1 billion I was able to recover in fraudulent claims being filed," she said. "That to me would be a fraud ... the ones that you put in jail, the ones that you prosecuted, because those are the crooks that were caught that were scheming the system." These lawyers acknowledge fraud is out there but agree the industry is overstating and oversimplifying with their cries of fraud. "He (Scott) can show a correlation but that’s a hell of a long way from causation," said Bill Newton, a member of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud's board of directors and executive director of the Florida Consumer Action Network. He has criticized Scott’s preferred reform for PIP as a gift to insurance companies. Other voices You won’t hear the $1 billion thrown around by PIP reform’s sponsor in the Senate, Joe Negron, a Republican from Stuart. "I haven’t seen strong evidence to verify that," Negron said in an interview. "People are mixing fraud and over-utilization. They mean different things to me." To Negron, a trial lawyer, fraud means billing someone for services you don’t receive. Over-utilization, though, means billing someone for services you received but did not need, such as visits to massage therapists and chiropractors. Sen. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, also working on the PIP issue, said he leans with Scott: requiring insurers to pay for unnecessary services is fraud. "I think there’s a nexis," he said. Robin Westcott, the insurance consumer advocate, said the $1 billion "fraud tax" total in her report could more accurately be described as a "fraud and abuse tax," which was her intent. Still, she said, "something’s gotta be wrong about this." The National Association of Insurance Commissioners recently released unaudited 2011 data showing more escalation in PIP losses -- $1.4 billion since 2008. Our ruling Scott has industry data on his side when he uses the number $1 billion, but it’s not clear to us that all of that money is caused by fraud. Those opposed to PIP reform put forward interesting arguments that the economy might be driving some of the increase in payouts, to people who otherwise might have paid for care on their own if they could afford it. Nevertheless, most people following the issue agree that fraud is a factor of increased PIP payouts by insurers. The question is how much, and it’s not crystal-clear.

pomt-06279	President Obama plans to "impose a tax of at least 23 percent on the Medicare prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries."	false	/texas/statements/2011/nov/22/national-taxpayers-union/taxpayers-group-says-obama-plans-impose-23-percent/	President Barack Obama plans to "impose a tax of at least 23 percent on Medicare’s prescription drug benefit for low-income beneficiaries," a group says. The National Taxpayers Union, which generally advocates lower taxes, featured the Obama claim in a half-page advertisement in the Nov. 13, 2011, Dallas Morning News brought to our attention by a reader. We’re all familiar with Obama’s 23 percent Medicare tax. Oh, wait. We’re not. Pete Sepp, the taxpayers’ union spokesman, told us in an interview that the "tax" in the ad refers to what the Obama administration has pitched as a money-saving mandate that pharmaceutical drug makers rebate money to the government for prescription drugs sold to low-income Medicare beneficiaries employing the fairly new federal prescription-drug benefit. That benefit also is known as Medicare Part D, which was ushered into place when George W. Bush was president to help elderly Americans afford prescription drugs. Sepp said Obama’s proposal amounts to a "mandatory extraction that functions like a tax." As noted in an October 2011 article in the journal Health Affairs, Obama in September proposed a $3 trillion package of savings including $320 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings. The bulk of the suggested savings involved reduced payments to hospitals and other providers, the article says, but an element ties to requiring Medicare to receive rebates from drug companies for drugs purchased by low-income beneficiaries much like Medicaid has for years. An October 2011 critique of Obama’s proposal, whose authors include Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, points out that since 1991, drug manufacturers have been required to enter into agreements with the federal government to pay rebates to the Medicaid program as a condition of their drugs being covered by Medicaid. The rebate rates are tied to a share of the average manufacturers price for each drug or the difference between that price and the "best price" offered to any payer. Since 2010, the minimum rebate amounts have been set at 23.1 percent of the average manufacturers price for most brand-name drugs, the critique says. So now we know where the 23 percent figure originated. Back to Medicare: The Health Affairs article says that while the federal government has been forbidden by law from negotiating drug prices in Part D, "Democrats and a few Republicans have long looked for other ways to enable the program to capture drug discounts. The Obama plan proposes that manufacturers pay Medicare the same ‘rebates’ for brand-name and generic drugs that they already pay Medicaid for beneficiaries who receive the Medicare low-income subsidy. This option is estimated to save $135 billion over ten years." The Obama proposal states the administration wants to "align" Medicare drug pricing with Medicaid practices. Currently, the proposal says, Medicare Part D insurance plan sponsors negotiate their own rebates and prices for drugs. The resulting rebates reached for brand-name drugs are less than what the government achieves for those drugs under Medicaid, the proposal says, resulting in higher prices in the end. Sepp warned against such rebate proposals in a July 2011 letter to members of Congress, saying they amount to "federally-forced price controls on prescription drugs to certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries (who would see no financial gain even as Washington’s coffers got fatter)." His letter says health care providers under Medicare Part D had already "negotiated deep voluntary discounts of 20 to 30 percent from drug makers and pharmacies, saving both enrollees and taxpayers considerable sums." Sepp told us by email that the "money collected from the ‘rebates’ don't wind up in the actual consumers' pockets or the various Part D plans; instead they go to a fund that will defray certain government Medicare program costs. A ‘rebate’ as is commonly understood is something that the consumer of product receives after purchase. This ‘rebate’ is nothing of the kind, and represents deceptive terminology." Also, Sepp said, the sought rebate is based on a percentage of price per unit, "a lot like the way some excise taxes on products such as some tobacco items work." We failed to draw a response from the government on this topic, but outside experts said they’d never heard the Medicaid rebates -- or proposed Medicare rebates -- referred to as taxes. Judith Lave, a University of Pittsburgh professor of health economics and former director of the Pennsylvania Medicaid Policy Center, said the Medicaid rebates help government lower drug prices; the same would be so, she said, if such practices were permitted for Medicare. "To view it as a tax is a bit of a stretch," Lave said. "That is an inappropriate use of the word ‘tax.’ I would say the government plans to use its market power to get lower prices from the pharmaceutical companies." Kenneth Lawson, who heads the University of Texas School of Pharmacy’s Division of Health Outcomes and Pharmacy Practice, said that to the degree drug manufacturers want their products to be available to Medicaid and, potentially, Medicare beneficiaries, rebates could seem like taxes; they have to pay to play. Lawson said, though, that the ad statement misleads by suggesting low-income beneficiaries would bear rebate costs most likely to be spread out in different ways by paying companies. Rebates can cut drug manufacturer profits, he said, and/or the makers could raise drug prices to partly or completely cover the rebates, ultimately shifting the costs to consumers, hospitals, prescription drug plans (including taxpayers who support Medicaid), and other purchasers of medications. So it’s possible, he said, that Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries could be contributing towards the cost of rebates indirectly through the taxes they pay that support Medicare and Medicaid. "Of course," he said, "these rebate costs are spread across a relatively large number of people." The taxpayer union’s Sepp nudged us to a June 2011 paper criticizing Medicare rebate plans by Joseph Antos of the American Enterprise Institute and Guy King, former chief actuary for Medicaid and Medicare. The paper says: "Like a tax, the requirement that pharmaceutical manufacturers pay a minimum rebate has its initial impact on the manufacturers but the final incidence would be borne primarily by patients, who are the end-users of the prescription drugs." Sepp said by email: "Supporters call this a rebate so they can raise revenues for the federal government without branding their scheme a tax and having to answer a lot of inconvenient questions about it. Just because they don't want to call it a tax doesn't mean it won't function like one." Our ruling We see how the Obama proposal could be judged a nearly mandatory give-back in that drug companies that decline to give rebates would do so at risk to their bottom lines. It also makes sense that drug companies wouldn’t swallow the costs of the rebates; they’re not free. Then again, contrary to the ad's statement, there’s no evidence low-income Medicare beneficiaries would pay a 23 percent "tax." And all told, Obama's urged rebate remains that--money paid in return for a purchase or action/opportunity. One would have to connect more dots to make it a tax. We rate the group’s statement False.

pomt-13940	Says Donald Trump has "bankrupted his companies not once, not twice but four times."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/	Hillary Clinton mocked Donald Trump’s business failings in a major speech arguing that the presumptive Republican nominee would be disastrous for the economy. "He’s written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11," Clinton quipped, adding. "He bankrupted his companies not once, not twice, but four times." We rated a similarly worded claim from Trump’s former primary rival Carly Fiorina Mostly True, because it’s not accurate to say Trump is solely to blame. (For the record, Trump doesn’t deny the charge and instead argues it was a smart business decision.) At the time, we found four bankruptcies, but since then, we’ve found two more for a total of six. So Clinton was right that Trump bankrupted companies four times, and she could have offered a higher count as well. Let’s go through them one by one. Bankruptcy No. 1: The Trump Taj Mahal, 1991 Trump’s first bankruptcy may have hit the businessman, personally, the hardest, according to news reports. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J., which opened in 1990, primarily with junk bonds at a whopping 14 percent interest. A year later, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities. So Trump decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times. As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post. Bankruptcy No. 2: Trump Castle, 1992 Within a year of his first Chapter 11 filing, Trump found himself in bankruptcy court again for Trump Castle, which opened in 1985. It was his "weakest gambling hall," according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, and ironically faced competition from Trump Taj Mahal. In March 1992, the Castle filed a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, and Trump gave up his 50 percent share in the casino for lower interest rates on $338 million worth of bonds. Bankruptcy No. 3: Trump Plaza and Casino, 1992 The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1984, declared bankruptcy at the same time as the Castle. A $210 million joint project of Trump’s and Harrah’s, the casino had racked up $250 million in debt by 1992, after a staggering 80 percent decline in cash flow. So Trump Plaza filed for prepackaged bankruptcy that spring as well. Bankruptcy No. 4: Plaza Hotel, 1992 Later that year, Trump filed bankruptcy on another Plaza, this one in New York. Trump purchased the Plaza Hotel in Midtown Manhattan for $390 million in 1988, but it accumulated more than $550 million in debt by 1992. In December 1992, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News. Trump remained the hotel’s CEO, but it was merely a gesture; he didn’t earn a salary and had no say in the hotel’s day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times. Bankruptcy No. 5: Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, 2004 Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth. Bankruptcy No. 6: Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 Trump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts -- was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. It declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After debating with the company’s board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing. Whose fault is it anyways? Experts told us during the primary season Trump alone didn’t cause the bankruptcies. While six in 25 years is a lot, five were tied to a struggling gaming industry. Trump was acting, they said, as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, previously told us. He added that people typically wouldn’t personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. "The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space," Levitin said. Our ruling Clinton said, Trump has "bankrupted his companies not once, not twice but four times." Trump has actually filed Chapter 11 six times, four times within two years in the 1990s, once more in 2004 and once more in 2009. But experts told us Trump shouldn’t bear all the responsibility, as Clinton’s wording suggests, as the majority of bankruptcies happened as the overall casino industry struggled. We rate her claim Mostly True. <div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com</div>	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-06-21T16:37:49	2016-06-21	['None']
pomt-12476	On voting for a health care bill without an up-to-date Congressional Budget Office score	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/04/paul-ryan/did-paul-ryan-flip-flop-how-pass-big-health-care-b/	As legislation to dramatically overhaul the Affordable Care Act neared a vote in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, critics said that Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was hypocritical in how he brought a revised bill to the floor. In March, a bill known as the American Health Care Act was pulled from the floor by GOP leaders because it didn’t have enough votes to pass. That was considered a major defeat for both congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump, who had campaigned on the repeal and replacement of President Barack Obama’s far-reaching health care law. Republican leaders adjusted the bill following negotiations with both the conservative and moderate wings of the party. A new version passed the House on May 4 by a 217-213 vote margin. In addition to decrying the substance of the bill, Democrats and other critics took House Republicans to task for seeming to ram the bill through the chamber without adequate procedural safeguards. One concern was that the full text of the revised bill and the relevant amendments was only posted on the Web on the evening of May 3, less than 24 hours before the House was scheduled to vote on it. Another concern was that the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan office that analyzes the impact of pending legislation -- had not reviewed the new version of the bill. The CBO had reviewed the original bill, and in doing so, it found that the measure would lead to an additional 24 million Americans being uninsured by 2026, compared to the number who would be uninsured if the current law was still in force. Critics said Ryan and House Republicans were hypocritical for voting on a new version without a new CBO score, and they pointed to Ryan’s past comments as evidence. On June 23, 2009, Ryan signed on to a letter to the then-director of CBO seeking a wide-ranging analysis of the Affordable Care Act, which then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was trying to pass. "We are writing to respectfully request that you analyze the House Democrat bill as expeditiously as possible. ... Before Congress changes health care as the American people know it, we must know the likely consequences of the House Democrat legislation, including the number of people who would lose access to their current insurance, the number of jobs lost due to business taxes, the number of uninsured people who would obtain coverage, and the extent of the cannibalization of employer coverage due to Medicaid expansion." Then, in an appearance on MSNBC in July 2009, Ryan personally criticized the Democrats’ procedural handling of the bill in the House. "I don't think we should pass bills that we haven't read, that we don't know what they cost," Ryan said. We wondered whether Ryan’s past remarks and current actions amounted to a flip-flop, so we sought advice from a range of congressional experts and veterans of House floor action. Generally, we found a sharp partisan divide between those who thought Ryan’s actions in shepherding the health care bill were appropriate and those who did not. But we also found some agreement that members of both parties tend to speak and act differently depending on who’s in the majority and who’s in the minority -- and a measure of agreement that Ryan did not meet the spirit of his 2009 comments in 2017. Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staffer on the Rules Committee who now studies Congress at the Woodrow Wilson Center said the bill did not require a new CBO score, since its previous iteration had already been analyzed by the agency. "CBO is not obliged to score amendments adopted subsequent to a bill's being reported," Wolfensberger said. Wolfensberger added that CBO is expected to do a new analysis of the bill eventually -- but that it would happen after passage. Ryan could have waited for a new CBO analysis before calling for the vote, but it was within his discretion to go forward without a new score. Several Republicans with House floor experience said they have no quarrel with how Ryan has handled the bill. "It is well established that when you are in the minority, you complain about procedure, and when you are in the majority, you complain about partisanship," said John Feehery, a former aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. "Nothing about Ryan's comment strikes me as unusual or otherwise inappropriate." Glenn LeMunyon, a former floor specialist to then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, agreed. "The opposing side on any legislative matter will always try to make that case, and the media will try to exploit it," he said. "But the truth is that this is very normal procedure. They have taken legislation and crafted it (with additional amendments) in order to gain enough support to pass." LeMunyon said the revised Republican bill "is not some new incarnation of health care policy. It is very similar to that which has been in the works for many months. This is not a situation where cost estimates are a complete unknown at all. Leadership has a very good idea of what it would score and so do all the members, regardless of the complaints coming from the opposition." But congressional experts more aligned with Ryan’s critics say his earlier remarks and his present actions are at odds. Former Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas -- a longtime member of the House Rules Committee -- said Ryan’s positions are inconsistent. "I don’t remember examples of proceeding without a CBO score," Frost told PolitiFact. When asked to consider the argument that the three amendments are simply minor tweaks that don’t merit a separate CBO score, he responded, "Nothing is minor in this bill." And Norm Ornstein, a longtime follower of congressional procedure who has been critical of Republicans from his perch at the American Enterprise Institute, said that "of course" Ryan’s past comments conflict with his recent actions. "This is a giant leap in hypocrisy," he said. Ornstein seconded Frost’s assessment that voting on a bill this far-reaching without a revised CBO score is essentially unheard of. Meanwhile, several of the experts we contacted agreed that situational procedural ethics are rampant in both parties. Pelosi herself faced similar complaints when she was trying to get the ACA passed early in Obama’s tenure. In particular, she was pilloried by Republicans when she told an audience prior to passage, "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy." A Pelosi spokesman said at the time that her words were taken out of context. "She meant there was so much talk about process (in Congress) that people have lost sight of what’s actually in the bill," the spokesman said. "Once it’s passed, we can remind them of all the good things that are in it." In addition, those sympathetic to Pelosi have said that the House passage of the ACA was done over a much longer period and included more public hearings. The CBO analyzed the ACA or parts of it on more than two dozen occasions in 2009 and 2010. Still, the perception that Pelosi unfairly strong-armed the ACA to passage while ignoring longstanding procedures has helped shape the perception of Ryan’s actions today. "We have been around long enough to know about pots calling kettles black, and shoes being on the other foot," Wolfensberger said. "Neither party has a monopoly on procedural abuses, shenanigans and shortcuts. This is the new normal, and has been for the last few decades -- not deliberative democracy." In other words, the contrast between Ryan’s words in 2009 and his actions in 2017 are par for the course in Congress in recent years. But while Ryan was within his rights to handle the Republican health care bill as he did, his 2009 comments raised the procedural bar in a way that his actions in 2017 did not meet.

pomt-01136	"We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/22/jim-moran/jim-moran-says-college-coaches-are-highest-paid-pu/	U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, is ending his 24-year congressional career with hopes of reforming big-time college sports. Moran, who will retire Jan. 3, recently introduced legislation that would create a congressional commission to look into policies of the NCAA after myriad scandals involving misconduct by coaches and athletes, academic fraud and under-the-table payments. The resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve "the interaction of athletics and academics" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes’ abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs. "We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach, and yet only 20 schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses," Moran said in a Facebook post. Today, we’ll take a look at the claim that coaches top the payroll in 40 states. We’ll come back soon with a Truth-O-Meter on Moran’s statement that only 20 big-sport universities have athletic departments that make a profit. Moran’s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, sent us an email with three articles on coaches’ salaries. One, an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report, merely repeated the 40-state statistic as fact. The other two are graphics created by USA Today and Deadspin, a sports website. USA Today compiled salary information for head football and basketball coaches at major Division I schools. Deadspin’s graphic was published in 2013 and uses data from the 2011-12 school year. Reporter Reuben Fischer-Baum considered the public employee pay information for each state and media reports on coaches’ salaries. He found that 40 of the states had coaches at the pinnacle of the pay pyramid among public employees -- 27 were football coaches and 13 were basketball coaches. We ran our own check and also found that coaches, when all of their annually guaranteed compensation is totaled, are the highest-paid public workers in 40 states -- often by a longshot. We compared the 2014 football and basketball head coaches’ salaries listed in USA Today -- showing 107 of them are making at least $1 million a year -- with either salary data bases or the most current news report we could find on each state’s payroll. But there’s a caveat to these raw figures. Many states don’t list coaches as their top earners, even though the coaches’ guaranteed pay may be many times higher than the next-highest paid public employee. That’s because, as a general rule, only a small portion of coaches’ earnings comes from taxpayers or a university’s general fund. The lion’s share comes from money raised by school-affiliated athletic foundations, personal appearance fees, product endorsements, broadcasts and cuts of team revenues. In addition, most coaches are eligible for sizeable bonuses based on their team’s performance. For example, although Virginia Tech football coach Frank Beamer’s $2.6 million base salary outstrips anyone on the state payroll, he was not included in a list of top-paid public workers published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch in September. The reason: Beamer receives no state money and is not in the state salary database of public employees. Virginia’s highest-paid state employee, according to the database, is Ronald Schmitz, chief investment officer of the Virginia Retirement System. He made $786,596 in salary and bonuses during the budget year than ended on June 30. Two years ago, George Mason University basketball coach Paul Hewitt topped the salary list, receiving state pay of $744,750. As for some other high-profile coaches in the state during the last budget year:: University of Virginia football coach Mike London was paid $330,750 by the state. But his total salary, according to USA Today, was $2.3 million plus a possible $700,000 in bonuses. VA basketball coach Tony Bennett’s guaranteed salary was $1.8 million -- $300,000 of which came from state coffers. Virginia Commonwealth University basketball coach Shaka Smart was paid $1.2 million -- $400,000 of which came from the state. We should note that there are other state employees, often hospital physicians, who whose total pay packages are also supplemented by outside earnings. Identifying the top earner in each state is tricky because of inconsistent and incomplete data. Moran and Deadspin, using guaranteed compensation packages to coaches, found 40 states whose highest-paid public employee ran a football or basketball team. The number drops to at most 34, we determined, if only direct state compensation to the coach is considered. The number could be lower because, in most states, we were unable to find online data breaking down the taxpayers’ share of their coaches’ guaranteed pay. Here’s some interesting information we turned up about taxpayers’ direct contributions to the salaries of star coaches in other states: University of South Carolina football coach Steve Spurrier’s guaranteed salary is $4 million -- $350,000 of which comes from the state. Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo is paid $3.9 million, including $399,870 from the state. University of North Carolina basketball coach Roy Williams is paid $1.8 million, including $337,500 from the state. Our ruling Moran said that "in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach." The congressman is correct if we focus on the guaranteed total pay of coaches. But there’s a caveat: State taxpayers usually pay a small share of coaches’ salaries at large universities. Most of the money comes from school-affiliated foundations, endorsements, broadcast contracts and the like. If we only consider the direct taxpayer subsidy to salaries, coaches are the highest-paid public employees in at most 34 states -- and likely less. So we rate Moran’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-06744	On serving out his gubernatorial term	full flop	/virginia/statements/2011/aug/26/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-no-longer-promising-finish-gubernatorial/	Two weeks out from Election Day 2009, Republican Bob McDonnell had a big lead in the race for governor and was fielding questions about whether he would complete his anticipated term leading Virginia or turn his ambition towards Washington. "Will you make a commitment right now that were you to win on November 3rd, that you will stay for your entire four-year term and not run for President in 2012?" asked Ryan Nobles of NBC12 in Richmond. "Absolutely, I think those are all pipe dreams down the road," McDonnell replied. "You’ll be there from the start right until the end?" Nobles pressed. "Absolutely, we need a full time governor," McDonnell said. Virginia gubernatorial races get a lot of national attention. The Old Dominion and New Jersey are the only states that choose governors the year after presidential elections. There isn’t much else to feed political junkies during these odd years. But the 2009 Virginia gubernatorial race particularly piqued national interest. It came a year after Barack Obama carried Virginia, marking the first time in 44 years a Democratic presidential candidate won the state. Suddenly, reliably-Republican Virginia was recast as a critical swing state presidential politics. McDonnell’s popularity in Virginia created a buzz about his potential for the GOP national ticket in 2012. McDonnell, still seeking to nail down his gubernatorial win, dismissed the speculation. "The candidate doesn’t want to talk about future ambitions, saying he will serve his full four-year term through 2013 if elected," The Virginian-Pilot reported on Oct. 17, 2009. Two days later, during his interview with Nobles, McDonnell said, "You know, there’s a lot of number of national political pundits that are paying an exceptional amount of attention to Virginia. I am running to be governor of Virginia...I am fully committed to four years as Virginia’s governor." A month after his inauguration, McDonnell reaffirmed the pledge. Dispelling rumors that he might run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, McDonnell told WTOP Radio on Feb. 23, 2010: "I am absolutely planning to serve for four years." McDonnell’s response changed earlier this year when asked, for the first time, whether he would be interested in joining the GOP ticket in 2012 as the vice-presidential candidate. "What if the party’s nominee.. came to you and said ‘for the betterment of your party and your country, I need you to serve as my running mate." Nobles asked during a February 21 interview this year. "Wouldn’t that be a difficult thing for you to turn down?" "Probably," McDonnell replied. McDonnell then stressed that he was honored to be governor and was not seeking to join the national ticket. McDonnell expressed outright interest in the No. 2 spot in a Politico story that ran Aug. 15, noting the his popularity in Virginia and his recent ascension to the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association. "I’d be very interested," McDonnell was quoted as saying. "It is a swing state. I’m not asking for the call. I’m not looking for the call. As I’ve said many times, I’ve got the best job in America. But I think anybody who is in public life, if a presidential nominee called him and said, ‘I need your help to win,’ it would be a tremendous honor. … We’ll see. It’s going to be seven, eight, nine months before any of these decisions are made." . The next day, McDonnell was accused of reneging on his promise to serve out his term by David Mills, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia. "Virginians deserve an answer: Is McDonnell just a flip-flopper who won’t stand by his word if it interferes with his personal political ambitions? Or did he knowingly mislead Virginia voters?" Mills said in a news release. Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s chief of communications, told us: "The governor’s position has been absolutely consistent on this issue. He is fully committed to serving the people of Virginia. He is planning to serve the full four years of his term." Martin said the vice-presidential talk "is a hypothetical conversation about a possible phone call that couldn’t even happen until a year from now. You can’t change your position on something that hasn’t happened." But McDonnell is no longer promising to finish his gubernatorial term. He has put out word he is interested in being nominated for vice president next year. That’s a Full Flop!	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2011-08-26T06:00:00	2011-08-15	['None']
pomt-07263	"Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board."	true	/florida/statements/2011/may/26/jeff-brandes/st-petersburg-republican-says-he-bucked-gop-during/	Members of the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club are known for asking tough, pointed and sometimes over-the-top questions of the politicians who speak at their regular luncheon meeting. The May 13, 2011, event -- which was broadcast on WEDU's "Florida This Week" program -- was no exception. We'll cut to the chase. A questioner asked first-term state Rep. Jeff Brandes, a Republican representing District 52 in Pinellas County, if he was a fraud. "When you ran for office, if I recall correctly, you said, 'Now when I get elected, I'm gonna really take that Legislature to the woodshed,' " a man named Thomas Dunn said to Brandes. "But when you got elected, somehow you lost your backbone and you became a lackey if not a lapdog for the speaker. So my question is, when you ran for office, were you a fraud?" Brandes, who ran a campaign commercial vowing to take Tallahassee "to the woodshed," sat back in his chair and chuckled. "That's an interesting question," he started in response. "If you'll go back and watch that commercial, and read it line by line, what you'll see what I said is, for those that want to increase taxes or increase government regulation, we're going to take them to the woodshed. That was the exact line. I know and understand everybody wants me to take everybody to the woodshed, and sometimes it's probably appropriate." He continued: "The reality is, I think I stood up on a number of issues against the speaker and against the governor. I've gotten a phone call from the Governor's Office saying why don't you think welfare recipients should be drug-tested. I believe it's a violation of people's privacy to do that. And I stood up and did that (voted against that). So I think you'll find I have a lot of votes where I was the voice in the Legislature against something. Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board. That takes a little bit of courage. So to say I have no courage, no backbone, is, I think, a little disingenuous." Brandes repeatedly used the woodshed imagery during the campaign because he used to be in the lumber business -- his family once owned Cox Lumber. He said in the television ad that "high taxes and over-regulation have got to stop so jobs can return. If Tallahassee gets in the way, we're taking them to the woodshed." And at his election night victory party after defeating incumbent state Rep. Bill Heller, he signed blocks of wood. Some Democrats, and apparently Dunn, took the line to mean that Brandes would take Tallahassee to the woodshed on every issue. While that may be a stretch, Brandes did defend his record as being an independent voice in the Legislature in his response. So we decided to check his record from the 2011 legislative session. Turns out, there are examples where Brandes bucked the Republican leadership, and even the entire Florida House of Representatives. Brandes was the lone person in the Legislature to vote against HB 949, a bill that added some licensing requirements for pest control businesses. The bill passed the House 116-1 and the Senate 38-0. Brandes' legislative aide, Nick Hansen, said Brandes voted against the bill because it included additional regulations. Brandes also was the lone "no" vote on SB 650, which allows a mobile home park homeowners association a chance to buy its park outright if the owner is considering changing its land use. The bill passed the House 114-1 and the Senate 39-0. And he opposed the majority of Republicans on several other issues: HB 88: Brandes was one of two Republicans to oppose a bill that put restrictions on the amount of severance pay public employees can receive. The bill passed both chambers. SB 330: Brandes was one of four members of the Legislature and the only Republican to vote against a bill that makes it an election code violation for candidates to falsely say they served in the U.S. military. (Brandes is a former officer in the U.S. Army Reserves who served in the most recent Iraq war.) The bill passed both chambers. HB 661: Brandes was one of four Republicans to oppose a bill that would cap damages in wrongful death cases at nursing homes at $250,000. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. An amendment to HB 733: Brandes was the only Republican to join Democrats in supporting an amendment that would have lengthened an August sales tax holiday. (Two other Republicans initially voted with Brandes, but later changed their vote.) The bill did not pass. And as he said at Tiger Bay, Brandes was one of two House Republicans to vote against HB 353, which requires cash welfare recipients to first pass a drug test. Brandes spoke on the House floor that the measure violated people's privacy rights. The bill passed both chambers. Now, Brandes didn't always buck his own party. In fact, he was in lockstep on most of its highest priorities. He voted for GOP bills that prohibit public employees unions from collecting dues through automatic payroll deductions (which ultimately failed), restrict or limit abortions (passed), loosen the state's growth management laws (passed), change election law (passed), and to ask voters to approve a constitutional amendment creating two Supreme Courts (failed). He also voted for the budget. But in this fact-check, we're judging his words. Brandes said: "I think you'll find I have a lot of votes where I was the voice in the Legislature against something. Sometimes I was the only 'no' vote on the entire board." Measuring "a lot" can be subjective, but Brandes is right that on two occasions he was the only "no" vote in the Legislature. In other cases, he bucked his party and stood with Democrats. We don't know if that adds up to taking them to the woodshed or not. But we do know it makes his statement True.

pomt-01271	"Families in Del Valle, who are City of Austin residents, have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store."	false	/texas/statements/2014/nov/06/delia-garza/delia-garza-says-austin-residents-del-valle-must-d/	Delia Garza, newly elected to the Austin City Council, said during her campaign that Austinites on the city’s southeastern fringe have to leave town and drive to the next county to find the closest grocery store. Garza, who won the District 2 seat representing Southeast Austin, told the Austin American-Statesman for an October 2014 news story that some communities in Southeast Austin lack basic modern amenities. "Families in Del Valle, who are city of Austin residents, have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store," Garza said. Del Valle is an unincorporated community that sits on land granted to Mexican nobleman Santiago del Valle in the early 1800s. It has no local government of its own and no official boundaries. But Austin has annexed portions, including the site of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (which was founded as Del Valle Army AIr Base in 1942). The site of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport was annexed by the City of Austin in 1990. After that, most recently in 2013, the city added more Del Valle territory to the east. (Map excerpted from City of Austin map of Austin City Council districts.) According to Google Maps, parts of Del Valle annexed into Austin are 8 to 13 miles southeast of downtown Austin and 15 to 20 miles from Bastrop to the east. So, is Garza right that Del Valle Austinites are closer to a grocery store in Bastrop than a store in Austin? Not so, we found. Some small Del Valle stores offer produce and perishable groceries. Besides, the nearest full-scale supermarket sits 10 miles away in Austin while the closest Bastrop supermarket is more distant. Garza’s backup Garza, asked the basis of her claim, said she learned about local difficulties reaching a major grocery at a September 2014 meeting in the office of Margaret Gomez, who represents the county’s southeastern Precinct 4 on the Travis County Commissioners Court. By phone, Gomez told us Del Valle residents have to drive 20 miles to the nearest grocery store in Austin or Bastrop. She also called the Del Valle area a "food desert." According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a food desert exists if at least 500 low-income city residents live over a mile from a supermarket or if at least 500 rural residents live over 10 miles from one. According to Gomez and Garza, the absence of a grocery store in the area has long bothered residents. According to a November 2010 Statesman news story, Del Valle activist Patricia King collected over 1,300 signatures on a petition to bring a big grocery to Del Valle. The story described King driving to a Bastrop H-E-B for groceries every two weeks. By phone, H-E-B spokeswoman Leslie Sweet told us the company has long received requests for a Del Valle store as it does for stores all over Texas. Sweet said H-E-B leaders consider population and density important criteria when deciding where to build. Checking mileage, talking to residents We were ready to check the distance from the part of easternmost Del Valle also in Austin -- hence, still in council District 2 -- to groceries in Austin and Bastrop, following up with a Del Valle field trip. Using Google Maps, we found that the closest Bastrop H-E-B, on Hasler Blvd. is about 20 miles away while the closest Austin H-E-B, on East Riverside Drive, is less than 10 miles away. Also, the Austin H-E-B on East Seventh Street is about 10 miles from Austin’s most distant Del Valle neighborhood and an Austin Walmart on Slaughter Lane is just over 16 miles away. A Bastrop Walmart is 20 miles away. In our trip to Del Valle, we paused first in Oak Ranch, a three-year-old approximately 350-resident neighborhood near the city limit, built on lands the city annexed in 2003 and 2006. Judy Lollich, Oak Ranch’s community manager, called the lack of a nearby supermarket the neighborhood’s biggest problem and, she estimated, about half of Oak Ranch’s residents, particularly the elderly, buy groceries in Bastrop to avoid Austin’s traffic. Despite the shorter distance to the Riverside H-E-B, she said, that trip can take as long as the one to Bastrop. "Sometimes with (Texas) 71 traffic, going to get an emergency food becomes over an hour’s ordeal," Lollich said. A couple Oak Ranch residents told us they occasionally shop in Bastrop to avoid Austin traffic. Other residents told us they bought groceries at the Texaco Breadbasket near Pearce Lane and Ross Road, a quarter mile from Oak Ranch. We parked at the Texaco to talk to customers. Twelve of 13 queried shoppers (none living in the Austin part of Del Valle) said easy access to groceries is a local problem. Four shoppers reported buying groceries occasionally in Bastrop or knowing someone who did. Inside the Texaco Bread Basket, which is the closest grocery option for Del Valle residents living inside and outside the Austin city limits. (Photo/Dylan Baddour, Austin American-Statesman). Our Ruling Garza said Del Valle families who live within Austin’s city limits "have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store." It may be more stressful to travel to Austin than Bastrop to shop and we can see how the lack of a nearby big grocery is distressing. However, several Austin grocery stores are closer -- by about 10 miles -- than the nearest equivalent Bastrop grocery. This fact makes what Garza said False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-13501	The Secure Communities Program and 287(g) immigration programs "were programs that worked" but were "recklessly gutted" by the Obama administration.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/06/donald-trump/trump-says-secure-communities-287g-immigration-pro/	One facet of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s new immigration plan would increase cooperation between federal and local law enforcement agencies to deport criminals living in the country illegally. "We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program," Trump said in Phoenix on Aug. 31. "We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked." The programs Trump mentioned led to the removal of undocumented criminal immigrants. But they have also been criticized as tools for racial profiling, diminishing trust between communities and police, and for deporting large numbers of immigrants with no criminal record. We wanted to take a closer look at the programs, whether Obama "gutted them," and why there is disagreement on whether they worked. Trump’s campaign did not return our requests for more information. Secure Communities Implementation of Secure Communities began in 2008 under President George W. Bush. The program ended in 2015 when Obama replaced it with a similar enforcement program. Secure Communities resulted in deportations but also stirred up controversy with law enforcement and advocates for holding immigrants without probable cause. Secure Communities was designed to "improve and modernize efforts to identify aliens convicted of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment, and who may be deportable, and remove them from the United States once they are judged deportable," according to ICE. Here’s how it worked: when someone was booked into a police station or jail, that person’s fingerprints and booking information was sent to the FBI, which in turn shared it with the Homeland Security Department. DHS then ran the information through its databases and if there was a "hit," meaning if that person had an immigration record, then Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the local law enforcement agency were notified. ICE then determined that person’s immigration status and whether or not to deport the person based on the agency’s priorities. ICE could then request a detainer, asking the local agency to hold the individual beyond the point he or she would be released, so ICE could have a chance to transfer the person to federal custody. During the course of this program, ICE’s priority was immigrants in the country illegally who had also broken criminal laws. A 2010 ICE memo outlined removal priorities, with the highest priority including violent criminals. From October 2008 to February 2015, ICE removed 406,441 people from the country, the agency reported. That included 135,726 criminal aliens convicted of Level 1 offenses, such as murder, rape and sexual abuse of a minor. Secure Communities was responsible for 60 percent of all interior deportations in fiscal year 2013 and 73 percent in fiscal year 2014, a Migration Policy Institute analyst testified in December 2015 before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. (Interior deportations do not account for border removals.) "Nonetheless, Secure Communities also proved to be highly controversial, because it resulted in a large number of low-priority removals and was seen by many (law enforcement agencies) as damaging to public safety," said Marc R. Rosenblum, who left the institute to work for the Homeland Security Department in January 2016. In 2014, a federal judge ruled that an Oregon county had violated a woman’s Fourth Amendment right by detaining her for immigration authorities without probable cause, The Oregonian reported. "It’s hard to call (Secure Communities) a success by any measure except to the extent that you support the violation of our Constitution in order to deport more people," said Lena Graber, a special projects attorney for Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an immigrant advocacy group, via email. In November 2014, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said Secure Communities would be "as we know it, discontinued." By that point, Secure Communities had attracted "a great deal of criticism," was "widely misunderstood," and "embroiled in litigation," Johnson said. "Governors, mayors, and state and local law enforcement officials around the country have increasingly refused to cooperate with the program, and many have issued executive orders or signed laws prohibiting such cooperation," Johnson wrote. In his memo, Johnson also announced the creation of the Priority Enforcement Program. That program continues to use fingerprint data, but, as its name suggests, emphasized top priority offenders, such as those who pose a threat to national security. The Priority Enforcement Program also stipulates that ICE cannot ask local law enforcement agencies to detain individuals beyond their release date (detainers can be used in limited circumstances). ICE, instead, can ask to be notified of the release date. One of the issues with Secure Communities was that while it was mandatory nationwide, more than 300 jurisdictions were not cooperating, said Randy Capps, director of research of U.S. programs at Migration Policy Institute. Many refused to comply with the detainers requested by ICE, he said. More than half of the undocumented population lives in places that were not cooperating with ICE as part of Secure Communities, Capps said, which poses a problem for Trump if he is elected president and wants to revert back to the Secure Communities program. "That was one of the main reasons why the Obama administration went to PEP," Capps said, "to try to get some of these local and state police departments back on board." Capps views Obama’s Priority Enforcement Program as a revision, and not a gutting, of Secure Communities. ICE still does fingerprints and issues notices, he said, even if it does not also ask local law enforcement for detainers. Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, said Secure Communities was effective because it was able to link DHS and FBI databases so that ICE and local law enforcement agencies could be notified when noncitizens were arrested. "The result was that ICE was able to identify and remove more criminal aliens than ever before," Vaughan said. "Local law enforcement agencies no longer had to make a judgment call on whether to seek information on an inmate’s immigration status, it was done automatically (which thwarts racial profiling), and they no longer had to make manual queries of ICE, which saves time and resources." 287(g) The other program Trump wants to expand, "287(g)," stems from the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The act added section 287(g) allowing ICE to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies and train officers to carry out immigration law enforcement functions. ICE has these agreements with 32 law enforcement agencies in 16 states, including Florida, Texas and Arizona. ICE credits the program for identifying more than 402,000 "potentially removable aliens" from January 2006 through Sept. 30, 2015. The program has had two enforcement models: a task force, where officers patrolling the streets could approach and process "removable aliens," and a jail model, allowing officers in state and local detention facilities to process removable aliens charged with or convicted of an offense. Capps, from Migration Policy Institute, says 287(g) has a mixed track record. There were allegations of racial profiling early on, particularly in the small number of jurisdictions using the task force model, when officers could ask someone about their immigration status on the street, Capps said. In 2009, DHS decided not to renew the task force model agreement with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for his hard-line immigration stance. The Obama administration decided in 2012 to end the task force model. As a result, trained local police can only question people about their immigration status after they are booked into jail, Capps said. In December 2011, DHS said the Justice Department found "discriminatory policing practices" within the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office and terminated the county’s jail mode agreement. Vaughan says local agencies have wanted 287(g) because "they had so many criminal aliens that ICE couldn’t handle the workload by itself," and because they were too far from ICE offices to be able to arrange regular pickup of criminal immigrants. "I believe that the Obama administration’s suppression of this program has contributed to the steep drop in interior enforcement," Vaughan said. Interior removals went down about 71 percent from 237,941 in fiscal 2009 (the first year Obama entered office), to 69,478 in fiscal 2015, according to ICE data. Interior deportations have decreased under Obama due to the administration’s focus on border apprehensions and removal of undocumented immigrants threatening public safety, analysts have told us. Our ruling Trump said Secure Communities and 287(g) immigration programs "were programs that worked" but were "recklessly gutted" by the Obama administration. The programs have led to the removal of criminal immigrants living illegally in the United States, and the Obama administration did scale down their scope. Yet the programs have been criticized for allowing officers to racially profile minorities, a federal judge found Fourth Amendment violations in one of them, and federal reviews have found discriminatory practices in the other. While the programs have removed criminals from streets, they’ve also involved unlawful practices. Given the ambiguity of their outcomes, we rate Trump’s statement Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1318e101-9ad1-48f1-b146-78a1b1dd980f	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-06T17:17:36	2016-08-31	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-09367	“This week liberal Bill White faced an ethics complaint about more than $83,000 he failed to report to the state Ethics Commission.”	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/30/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-cites-complaint-against-democratic-/	GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign excels at producing provocative videos, the latest one attacking Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White with excerpts from Texas TV newscasts about a Republican complaint against White. A link to the “Liberal Bill” video went to reporters on Friday accompanied by this message: “This week liberal Bill White faced an ethics complaint about more than $83,000 he failed to report to the state Ethics Commission.” Undisputed: Such a complaint was filed by the Perry-allied Republican Party of Texas. The commission hasn't ruled on it. Unproven: Perry's characterization of White as "liberal." That label, which isn't backed up in Perry's statement or the video, might not reflect White's record. For now, we'll let the word slide as a rhetorical swipe. Our lingering question: Did White fail to report more than $83,000 to the state, as Perry's campaign says? In a March 23 complaint to the Texas Ethics Commission, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party, states that White’s state-required personal financial statement, submitted in February, lists no income received in 2009 from Wedge Services, LLC though White separately reported $83,677 in wages from Wedge Services on his 2009 federal tax return. White acknowledges that his tax return, which he recently made public, specifies his Wedge Services’ income as part of “Wages Received and Taxes Withheld.” He also admits that his personal financial statement doesn’t have an entry showing Wedge paying him. But, White says, there’s a reasonable explanation; he wasn’t required to detail his Wedge Services’ income—which was deferred compensation—on his personal financial statement in the way it's spelled out on his tax return. White last worked for the company in 2003. While there's no one entry on the financial statement showing Wedge Services paying White, his campaign says the income came from a brokerage account, invested in stocks and mutual funds, that was established for his deferred compensation. We confirmed that a list of the stocks and funds provided by White's campaign is on his ethics filing. While it's possible to estimate how many shares of stock White's family had in five entities plus the number of shares he had in three mutual funds, the form doesn't show the total value of such holdings or precisely how much income they produced. But proceeds are shown in categories such as $5,000 to $9,999. The categories enable anyone (provided they get help from the White campaign identifying relevant stocks and mutual funds) to estimate that White took in $36,500 to $94,992 in 2009 due to his holdings in the Wedge-originated brokerage account. In a March 25 sworn statement, White states the “proper recording” took place with the commission based on instructions for filing the statement and conversations with commission attorneys before and after the filing. Confusing? There's a reason. The Texas law governing personal financial statements doesn’t speak explicitly to reporting deferred compensation. Broadly, the relevant section (which runs about 900 words) states that each statement must reflect the filing individual’s financial activity in the preceding calendar year including a list of “all sources of occupational income." Filers must identify any person or group from which they received fees or retainers paid in advance of future services. They also must report income from stocks, bonds, notes and other commercial paper, plus each source of more than $500 from interest, dividends, royalties and rents. There's more to report, according to the law, but there's no mention of deferred compensation. We found no past commission opinions on whether filers have to specify income from deferred compensation. Austin lawyer Buck Wood, an expert on ethics law, agreed there's nothing on the record. "That's a new one on me," Wood said. Could White have reported the money from Wedge Services to the state in the same way he did on his federal tax return anyway? Of course—if only to avoid shots like the one fired by the Texas GOP. Not the point, his campaign said, stressing that White consulted accountants to make sure he complied with the law. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said a CPA for White spoke to an attorney for the ethics commission the day after the GOP filed its complaint. Bacon said Robert Mannas, an assistant general counsel for the commission, told the CPA, Nancy Wakefield, that White had reported his income correctly. Bacon said the commission's general counsel, Natalia Luna Ashley, later cautioned that Mannas's advice didn't constitute a ruling on the complaint. Commission spokesman Tim Sorrells declined to comment on Bacon's account. Generally, Sorrells said, whether anyone has complied with relevant laws and commission rules is a call for the agency's eight appointed commission members to make. So, where does this leave Perry’s statement? White does face a complaint, but Perry's statement leaves out a key piece of context: That complaint was filed by the GOP. And it's misleading to conclude, as Perry's statement does, that White failed to report more than $83,000 to the commission. White's camp said he accounted for his deferred compensation as directed. The law doesn't specify if or how candidates should report deferred compensation. We rate Perry’s statement as Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-03-30T21:12:28	2010-03-26	['None']

pomt-09313	Says the new health care law delivers a "$13 billion tax increase on families with special needs."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/apr/18/john-carter/rep-john-carter-says-families-special-needs-childr/	The White House and most congressional Democrats have touted the nation's new health care reform law for extending insurance to those who have historically struggled to get coverage. Meanwhile, an opponent, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, says it will slap higher taxes on families with children who have special needs. "$13 billion tax increase on families with special needs thanks to Obamacare," Carter said in an April 12 Twitter message that links to the House Republican Conference blog, where a series of "ObamaCare Flatlines" posts started appearing shortly after President Barack Obama signed the health care legislation in March. Carter is the secretary of the conference, which consists of every Republican House member. U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, from Illinois, also sent his Twitter followers the tax blast. "An estimated 30 million families use pre-tax dollars in flexible spending accounts (FSA) to pay for routine medical care and other vital child care services," the conference's April 9 post states, going on to note that those families include parents with special needs children who use their pre-tax FSA dollars to pay fees related to their child's education. "ObamaCare burdens these families with a huge tax increase," the post continues, because the law caps the money a person can put in their flexible spending account at $2,500 per year. A $13 billion tax increase on families with special-needs children? Creighton Welch, Carter's press secretary, pointed us to a March 20 report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) that estimates the flexible spending cap will generate $13 billion in revenue by 2019. The committee advises Congress on tax policy. Welch said the reference to "30 million families" using flexible spending accounts comes from the right-leaning Americans for Tax Reform, whose tax policy director, Ryan Ellis, told us the statistic came from the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a nonpartisan research center that collects and analyzes data on employee benefit plans. Yet the institute, which doesn't take positions on policy issues, told us it couldn't vouch for the number. An industry estimate from the companies that administer the programs for employers is about 30 million, according to a June article by Kaiser Health News, part of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health policy. Some employers offer their employees the choice of signing up for flexible spending accounts. Those employees send a portion of their pay to an account that can be tapped for certain medical expenses. Employees bank the dollars tax-free, thus reducing their taxable income. The GOP conference cites several examples of medical expenses parents with a special child could pay for with their flexible spending account, including Braille books. Some other existing restrictions on the savings accounts: In most cases, employees have to save all medical receipts and submit them to an administrator. And they must spend the entire balance; if there's money left in the account at the end of a year, their employer keeps it. For that reason, beneficiaries tend to use the accounts for routine health expenses they know will come due, not emergencies. They're a reliable way to fund co-pays, dental care and special procedures that can be scheduled to match an account holder's accumulated contributions. People with more serious illnesses who have predictable costs also can benefit significantly. The new health care law includes a provision that will cap flexible spending accounts at $2,500 per year, starting in 2013. There currently isn't a federal cap, though the institute says some employers limit how much their employees can put in their accounts. Typical limits range from $2,000 to $5,000. The $13 billion reflects the additional income tax revenue the government expects to reap during the seven years from 2013 through 2019 due to some employees with flexible spending accounts incurring more taxable income. Experts we spoke with didn't quibble with that number. But some cast the provision as shrinking a tax break, not raising taxes, because technically it imposes no tax on people who use flexible spending accounts. Leaving aside the argument over whether shrinking a tax shelter is the same as a $13 billion tax increase, some people will probably wind up paying more taxes after 2013 when the flexible spending limit kicks in. But will they all be parents of children with special needs, as Carter's message states? Welch said the Republican conference doesn't know, but that "many of the 30 million families that use FSAs have special needs children." Perhaps, but we didn't find data backing up that claim. "When it comes to FSA, we know nothing about who uses them or why they use them," said Paul Fronstin, director of the Health Research and Education Program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. "There's been no research on it other than 20 percent of the population that's eligible (for flexible spending accounts) contributes to them," he said. The average annual contribution to a health care FSA is $1,400, he said — an amount that would not be affected by the new limit. Fronstin said there's no way of gauging how many special-needs families will be affected, but that they won't be the only Americans losing part of their tax shelter. Ellis, from Americans for Tax Reform, agreed there's no data on how many FSA accounts are held by special-needs parents. But he said they'll be particularly affected by a cap because they bear high costs relating to special-needs education. Ellis said he has a friend who uses his FSA to help pay his Down syndrome child's tuition at a special-needs' school in the District of Columbia. Ellis said his friend's employer caps his flexible spending account at $5,000. On the other hand, Rich Robison, executive director of the Federation for Children with Special Needs in Massachusetts, and the parent of two young adults with Down syndrome, pointed out that the Individuals with Disabilities and Education Act (IDEA) requires schools to pay for accommodations a child with special needs may need to obtain a "free appropriate public education." Henry Aaron, an economics scholar at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said he suspects "only a tiny fraction" of the estimated $13 billion tax revenue would come from families with special-needs' children. Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that Carter's claim ignores the health law's broader impact: the JCT and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office project that 32 million uninsured will have health insurance coverage by 2016. "Some of those are families with people with special needs," he said. The upshot? Carter's statement that the health care law will smack a $13 billion tax increase entirely on families with children who have special needs defies common sense. At our inquiry, his office backed off the sweep of Carter's Twitter message and conceded they didn't have numbers confirming that special-needs' families would bear the brunt of the tax change. All in all, Carter makes a dramatic, unsupported charge. We rate his statement as Pants on Fire.	None	John Carter	None	None	None	2010-04-18T21:57:08	2010-04-12	['None']
