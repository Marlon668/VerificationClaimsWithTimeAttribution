pomt-03868	Says "Kurt Schrader supports Obama’s sequester … but won’t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/10/national-republican-congressional-committee/kurt-schrader-supports-85-billion-sequester-wont-c/	Since just before the sequester set in March 1, the National Republican Congressional Committee has been filling email in-boxes in Oregon with allegations that U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader has shirked his fiscal duties by siding with fellow Democrat, President Barack Obama. An email from an NRCC spokeswoman had this subject line: "Kurt Schrader’s priorities: A robotic squirrel." That was followed by a press release sarcastically thanking Schrader for standing by while the government wastes money "on frivolous programs like the production of a musical about climate change and a menu of foods people could eat on Mars – yes, the planet Mars." Those were followed by a limited-distribution online banner ad that reads: "What?! Kurt Schrader supports Obama’s sequester … but won’t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games." By this point, PolitiFact Oregon can’t stop giggling. A musical about climate change? A robo-squirrel to pick up robo-nuts? A new menu of what we might eat on Mars, maybe while playing new video games? We were intrigued to find out more, even though we know that campaign blasts from the major parties tend to be over the top. For those of you not keeping up with sequester news: A long, long time ago, Obama and Congress agreed to across-the-board federal cuts if they couldn’t agree on a more measured way to reduce spending and balance the budget. Well, guess what? They couldn’t agree -- Obama and Democrats want new revenue; Republicans do not -- so the country is in sequestration mode, with $85 billion in automatic cuts between now and Sept. 30, 2013. Republicans are using the impasse to drum up public support for their cause and against Democrats. The National Republican Congressional Committee -- which is chaired by Oregon’s very own Rep. Greg Walden -- wants to take out Schrader in 2014. Other Democrats, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, are being similarly targeted nationally. Now that we have the background, let’s try to unwind the statement. Is it true that Schrader supports Obama’s sequester, but refuses to cut $1.6 million for video games? According to an NRCC statement, Schrader voted for the sequestration bill, and voted against legislation that would have replaced it. That’s accurate-ish. Schrader joined his party in voting against two GOP-backed bills last year that would have replaced the across-the-board cuts with deep cuts to entitlements and social programs. But let’s not forget this: The 2011 bill creating the sequester law was backed by 174 Republicans, including Walden, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and House Speaker John Boehner. To single out Schrader -- and other potentially vulnerable Democrats -- as supporting the sequester ignores an awful lot of Republicans who voted for the sequester bill, and blames Democrats for failing to vote for a replacement budget dictated by Republicans. Now on to the fun stuff. All four items highlighted by the NRCC come from the annual "Wastebook" put out by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-OK. His office identified about $18 billion worth of wasted -- in his opinion -- tax dollars in 2012. The programs are included regardless of home state or party backing. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is spending about $1 million a year -- out of a $17 billion budget -- to develop food items for a 2-1/2-year trip to Mars in the 2030s. The robo-squirrel reference comes from a $325,000 National Science Foundation grant to researchers in California who are studying how a robot squirrel might fake out a non-robot rattlesnake. A New York City-based theater also received nearly $700,000 from the NSF to create a musical about climate change and biodiversity. And, finally, NASA is spending $1.6 million to develop video games and other entertainment as a way to get more students interested in science, math and technology. The point being made by House Republicans is obvious: The White House need not furlough airport security workers when there are so many other places to cut. Yet $18 billion plucked from a "waste book" is not close to $85 billion. And, seriously, Congress doesn’t go back and comb through individual budgets and kill off low-level programs a senator deems frivolous. The broader NSF and NASA budgets were approved by both Republicans and Democrats. There is no either-this-or-that choice to make in the here-and-now, and to suggest that Democrats could cut a Mars-related project for more airport securityis misleading. Certainly Republicans are making a valid point that the two sides could make targeted, intelligent reductions, but that’s not the hang-up in the standoff. The hang-up is over money. Republicans do not want to raise taxes. In a response to PolitiFact Oregon, NRCC spokeswoman Alleigh Marré said that Schrader voted twice against sequester replacementbills. Did those bills, we asked, include a line item reduction of $1.6 million for NASA’s video games? The response: No, they did not. In case you’re wondering, Schrader’s office declined to comment on how the congressman truly feels about video game development, Mars food items and other spending choices mocked in the Wastebook. His office says he opposes the sequestration as bad policy that doesn’t address long-term cost drivers, like health care. Of course he does. We can’t think of anyone who thinks across-the-board cuts is a good way to budget. And despite the NRCC’s assertion that this is Obama’s sequester, PolitiFact has ruled that the sequester is the baby of both parties. (And no, Obama can’t blame Congress either.) The NRCC’s online ad states: "Kurt Schrader supports Obama’s sequester … but won’t cut $1.6 million to fund new video games."The statement is inaccurate in many ways. This is not Obama’s sequester, as PolitiFact has ruled. Schrader voted for the 2011 bill authorizing sequestration, along with many Republicans. He voted against two sequestration bills pushed by Republicans that would have sheltered defense at the expense of human services and entitlement programs. Neither of those bills included a line item calling for $1.6 million to be taken out of NASA’s budget for video games. Schrader was not in a position to cut -- or to not cut -- that money with his sequestration-related votes. Clearly the ads are meant to showcase extreme examples of budget fat. But in doing so, the NRCC has jumped into spacey nonsense. We find the claim not only false, but ridiculously so. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-03724	Wisconsin education agency "urged white students to wear white wristbands ‘as a reminder about your (white) privilege.’ "	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/15/george-will/wisconsin-dpi-urged-white-students-wear-white-priv/	In mid-March 2013, an allegation surfaced in conservative circles that the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction encouraged white students to wear white wristbands to remind them about their white "privilege." The wristbands weren’t aimed at showing white supremacy, but rather as a reminder to the wearer of advantages that may come from being white. Neither the claim, nor a denial by the department, attracted much attention beyond blogs and websites. However, the matter took on a higher profile on April 3, 2013. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer George Will repeated the claim in his nationally syndicated column, saying the department "urged white students to wear white wristbands 'as a reminder about your (white) privilege.’" Is Will right? The column A regular commentator on ABC’s Sunday program "This Week," Will is based at The Washington Post. His column is carried by some 400 newspapers, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The column citing the wristbands, headlined "Schools push a curriculum of propaganda" in The Post, begins with a reference to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. DPI, the state agency for elementary and secondary education, isn’t run by the administration of Republican Gov. Scott Walker but by an independently elected and nonpartisan superintendent. The day before Will’s column was published, superintendent Tony Evers defeated a GOP lawmaker to win reelection. "Wisconsin’s DPI, in collaboration with the Orwellian-named federal program VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America; the 'volunteers' are paid)," Will wrote, "urged white students to wear white wristbands 'as a reminder about your privilege, and as a personal commitment to explain why you wear the wristband.'" Will cited an article about the wristbands by EAGNews.org, a website of the Education Action Group Foundation, a Michigan-based national organization that favors school choice and opposes public unions. The Michigan group’s article included a link to a flier mentioning the wristbands that was posted on the DPI website and distributed at a training class for DPI’s VISTA workers. Besides the wristbands, the flier also made other suggestions, such as putting a note "on your mirror or computer screen as a reminder to think about privilege," Will noted. "After criticism erupted," his column continued, "the DPI removed the flyer from its website and posted a dishonest statement claiming that the wristbands were a hoax perpetrated by conservatives.’ But, again, the flyer DPI posted explicitly advocated the wristbands." So, the claim from Will is about more than the existence -- even temporarily -- of a flier. His claim is that the department actively "urged" white students to wear the wristbands. Wristbands revealed The article by the Michigan group that revealed the flier carried a headline stating that "Wisconsin education officials want students to wear ‘white privilege’ wristbands." But the only evidence cited was the DPI web page that displayed the flier. DPI took down that page four days after the EAGNews.org article, but provided a copy to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The one-page flier was produced by the Beyond Diversity Resource Center in New Jersey, which says it "teaches people to internalize the ethics and practices of true respect for cultural differences." Headlined, "Addressing Racial Privilege: A Mental Model for White Anti-Racists," the flier poses two dozen questions and suggestions aimed at making white people sensitive to advantages they may enjoy by being white. One of the suggestions is to wear a white wristband "as a reminder about your privilege and as a personal commitment to explain why you wear the wristband." The center said in late March 2013 it received "hate mail and threatening phone calls" since word of DPI’s use of the flier surfaced. DPI’s response We asked DPI spokesman John Johnson to respond to Will’s claim. He noted that Will had not contacted DPI; a Will researcher also did not reply to requests for information from PolitiFact Wisconsin. The VISTA workers cited in Will’s column -- there are 13 in Wisconsin who are paid $11,352 per year from federal funds -- work in the Milwaukee, Madison, Janesville, Beloit and Racine school districts, Johnson said. Their role is to develop "family-school-community partnerships," according to the VISTA page on DPI’s website. Johnson said that in training, the VISTA workers were given a number of handouts, including the one that mentions the white wristbands, and the handouts were posted on a DPI web page. But DPI has never made any communication with any school or district about white wristbands and DPI is not aware of any schools that have such a program, he said. DPI took down the flier mentioning the wristbands from its website to make it clear there is no DPI-backed wristband program. In its place is a statement that says in part: "First and foremost, and to be absolutely clear, no DPI official has asked, requested, or encouraged any school district, educator, or student to wear any wristband, and none of our VISTA volunteers have had any children put on any wristbands. To be clear, no Wisconsin students were given white wristbands." So, although the wristbands idea was a small part of training materials given to VISTA workers, DPI was responsible for providing the information and posting the link on its web page, even if no instruction was given for carrying out a wristband program. But Will cites no evidence, and we’re not aware of any, to show that DPI promoted such a program to students. Our rating Will said DPI "urged white students to wear white wristbands ’as a reminder about your (white) privilege.’" DPI was responsible for a flier given to 13 federally paid workers that suggests white people consider wearing the white wristbands. But there is no evidence that DPI took any steps to urge students to wear the wristbands. We rate Will’s claim Mostly False.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2013-04-15T09:00:00	2013-04-03	['None']

pomt-14506	"There is great disparity, tremendous disparity, in the (capital) funding on a per-student basis between our traditional public schools and our charter public schools."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/feb/22/janet-adkins/traditional-schools-get-much-more-capital-funding-/	A Florida House bill that would make school districts share capital funding with charter schools has sparked a debate over how much money the privately run institutions should get. A bill sponsored by Rep. Erik Fresen, R-Miami, would in part require that charter schools have access to local school board levies that are normally reserved for traditional public schools’ capital improvements. Charter schools are financed with taxpayer money but managed by private companies. Initially touted as an option for students attending low-performing public schools, charters have grown in popularity. Critics have complained that too many taxpayer dollars have subsequently been shifted to the private companies that run charters, while traditional schools suffer from a lack of resources. In a House Appropriations Committee hearing for Fresen's HB 873, Republicans supported equal access to capital improvement funds by charter schools. "I think it is time that we recognize that there is great disparity, tremendous disparity, in the funding on a per-student basis between our traditional public schools and our charter public schools," said Rep. Janet Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, at the Feb. 9 hearing. The bill has drawn some extra scrutiny because Fresen works for an architecture firm that builds charter schools and his sister and brother-in-law are executives for the state's largest charter-school operator. The bill passed Appropriations 19-5 and on Feb. 17 passed the Education Committee, 13-4, both times along party lines. These votes move the bill to the House floor. The Legislature has argued about charter-school funding for years, and the subject is confusing, to say the least. We wanted to run the numbers to see if Adkins, a candidate for Nassau County Schools superintendent, is correct to say there’s a "tremendous disparity" between charter and traditional schools. It turns out that while the figures aren’t so easy to decipher, it seems Adkins has a point. School funding 101 Florida has 4,270 public schools with around 2.7 million children enrolled and more coming every month. Those figures include some 650 charter schools across the state, with about 250,000 students. Charter-school enrollment has grown at least fivefold in the last decade. That means statewide, there are more than six traditional schools for every charter school. But since charter schools often have much smaller enrollments than their counterparts, traditional schools have almost 11 students for every one in a charter. Calculating school funding is confusing alchemy that mixes money from the state and local governments, including several kinds of tax revenues, grants and awards. Many of these sources are earmarked for specific things, like vocational-technical career centers and money to even out class sizes. For this fact-check, we’ll focus on capital outlay costs, which are dollars set aside largely for construction and maintenance. Adkins confirmed to PolitiFact Florida she was referring specifically to those capital dollars, not operating funds. State money for operations is allocated annually by the Legislature on a per-pupil basis — around $7,100 per student — and given to school districts, which divide the money among charter and traditional public schools. (This is the cash Gov. Rick Scott likes to mention when he talks about school funding.) Capital funding is a different story. Districts have been under pressure to build schools as Florida’s population grows, and a good chunk of the capital funding the state sets aside for schools is to pay down debts on projects they’ve already completed. Many charter schools, however, lease the property they occupy instead of erect new buildings, so much of their capital funding goes to paying rent. That’s a controversial practice on its own, since districts are often left without assets if a charter school closes. There are several sources for these capital dollars, but we’re going to look at the two most relevant sources: state Public Education Capital Outlay money and local school board levies. Split access As charter schools grew more popular, the Legislature gave them more of the state capital money, known as PECO, than it gave traditional schools — which received nothing from that fund in some years. The totals have been in flux recently, but charter schools get vastly more PECO money than traditional schools on a per-student basis. Last year lawmakers gave $50 million to those 650 charter schools and $50 million to the other 3,600 traditional schools. That gives charter schools a bit more than $200 per student in PECO funding, while traditional schools get roughly $20 per student. The Legislature is currently debating how much to allocate for 2016-17. (As lawmakers head into budget negotiations, the House has proposed $90 million in capital funding for charter schools. The Senate has offered charters zero capital dollars. Both chambers would keep traditional schools’ capital outlay at $50 million.) But school boards have the power to add to their capital budgets in the form of levies. These levies can be up to 1.5 mills (that’s $1.50 per $1,000 in taxable property values) on an annual property tax bill. Money from those local levies, however, is largely off limits to charters. State statute allows districts to share this money with charter schools, but only five districts do. Fresen’s bill would require school districts to share a portion of this money with charters. Districts argue these local levies are needed to keep up with ever-growing communities. A common argument is that the districts have needed this money as the state has cut other sources of funding. It’s important to remember that not every district levies these taxes at the same rate or brings in the same amount. But there’s no denying it’s a huge pot of money to which charter schools don’t have ready access. According to the Florida Department of Revenue, these levies created an annual pool of about $2.3 billion statewide in 2015. Traditional schools also receive an additional $850 million or so in dedicated capital funding along with their PECO money, a House comparison says. Charter schools Traditional schools PECO funding $50 million $50 million School board levies N/A* $2.3 billion Other state and local revenues N/A $850 million Total capital outlay funding $50 million $3.2 billion Full-time students 250,000 2.4 million Capital funding per student $200 $1,300 Sources: Florida Department of Education, Florida Department of Revenue, Florida House Appropriations Committee, Office of the Speaker of the House * Five counties share some levy funds with charters These figures are rounded estimates, of course, and we need to remember that traditional schools and charter schools face different challenges. It also doesn’t include money from bonds that school districts can ask voters to approve. But using these estimates, we found that traditional schools have a more than 6 to 1 ratio of capital dollars than do charters. We’d consider that a pretty big disparity, regardless of the reasons behind the policies. Our ruling Adkins said, "There is great disparity, tremendous disparity, in the (capital) funding on a per-student basis between our traditional public schools and our charter public schools." While charter schools do get a larger per-student share of one kind of state capital funding, traditional schools can bring in much more by taking advantage of school board levies and other sources that charters can’t access. There are many fine details that can get lost in discussions about the subject. But we found that currently, traditional schools potentially can get six times the capital funding per pupil than charter schools can. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Janet Adkins	None	None	None	2016-02-22T16:25:02	2016-02-09	['None']

pomt-07602	The U.S. gives foreign aid to Cuba and Venezuela, even though those countries are our enemies.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/23/ted-poe/ted-poe-decries-us-aid-venezuela-cuba/	In a House floor speech on Feb. 9, 2011, Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, took aim at American aid to foreign countries. Poe has introduced a bill to require separate votes on aiding specific countries, thus ending the practice of bundling foreign aid into a single bill. "Maybe it’s time to reconsider our foreign aid that we send to countries throughout the world," Poe said in the floor speech, which has attracted attention in conservative circles on the Internet. "There are about 192 foreign countries in the world, … and we give foreign aid to over 150 of them." Poe proceeded to name some examples of countries where many Americans might be uncomfortable sending taxpayer money, including Egypt, Pakistan, Russia and China. But two of the nation’s in Poe’s speech caught our eye -- Venezuela and Cuba. Critics of Venezuela’s leader, Hugo Chavez, call him a dictator. Meanwhile, Cuba has been a communist country for decades, led by Fidel Castro and now his brother Raul. In its widely followed rankings, the group Freedom House rates Venezuela toward the bottom of the nations it classifies as "partly free," while Cuba sits at the lower end of its "not free" scale. And both nations have strained relations with the United States. So Poe suggested these as two examples of what’s wrong with U.S. foreign aid. "We give money to Venezuela. Why do we give money to Chavez and Venezuela? He hates the United States. He defies our president, makes fun of our nation. We don’t need to give him any foreign aid. We give $20 million to Cuba. Why do we give money to Cuba? Americans can’t even go to Cuba. It’s off-limits. It’s a communist country. But we’re dumping money over there." We looked at budget documents for foreign aid and talked to experts in the field, and here’s what we found. Poe is correct that U.S. foreign aid flows into both countries. In fiscal year 2010, the Venezuela account showed $6 million, while the Cuba account showed $20 million. For fiscal year 2012, the administration has requested a little less for Venezuela -- $5 million -- and the same $20 million amount for Cuba. To give a sense of context, the 2010 funds allocated for Venezuela amounted to less than 1/100th of 1 percent of the total U.S. foreign-aid budget, and the figure for Cuba was about 4/100 of 1 percent of the U.S. foreign aid budget. The percentage of the entire federal budget is even more minuscule. Still, even if the amount is small, taxpayer money is taxpayer money, so Poe has a point. However, Poe also said in plain language that "we give money to Chavez." And while he didn’t say it in as explicit a fashion, Poe implied that the U.S. sends aid to the Cuban regime. This is where it gets more complicated. The funding for both nations comes from the Economic Support Fund, which, according to the State Department, "supports U.S. foreign policy objectives by providing economic assistance to allies and countries in transition to democracy. Programs funded through this account promote stability and U.S. security interests in strategic regions of the world." Let’s take Cuba first. A spokesman for the U.S. Agency for International Development confirmed that no U.S. aid goes to the Cuban government. In an explanation of its proposed budget, the administration writes that "Cuba is the only non-democratically elected government in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most politically repressed countries in the world. In view of these challenges, U.S. assistance for Cuba aims to empower Cuban civil society to advocate for greater democratic freedoms and respect for human dignity." The $20 million designated for Cuba "focuses on strengthening independent Cuban civil society organizations, including associations and labor groups. … To advance the cause of human rights in Cuba, U.S. assistance provides humanitarian assistance to political prisoners and their families … The United States supports nascent pro-democracy groups, the use of technology, and new information-sharing opportunities." A 2006 review by the Government Accountability Office noted that the aid is such a threat to the regime that it has to be kept under tight wraps on the island. "Given the Cuban government’s repressive policies and opposition to U.S. democracy assistance, grantees employed a range of discreet delivery methods," GAO reported. In other words, the money being sent to Cuba is designed to foster democracy in what is currently an undemocratic country -- not to support the government. Poe’s failure to note that distinction as he attacks aid to "Cuba" strikes us as misleading. Now let’s look at Venezuela. In its $5 million budget request for 2012, the administration said it wants to "strengthen and support a Venezuelan civil society that will protect Democratic space and seek to serve the interests and needs of the Venezuelan people. Funding will enhance citizens’ access to objective information, facilitate peaceful debate on key issues, provide support to democratic institutions and processes, promote citizen participation and encourage democratic leadership." Another administration document says aid helps "strengthen the capacity of non-governmental organizations to monitor and report on government performance" -- in other words, to be a watchdog of the government, not a supporter. The U.S. AID spokesman confirmed that no money goes to the Venezuelan government. So far, this sounds a lot like the situation with aid to Cuba. But there’s a difference. The same administration document goes on to say that this civil-society funding "will involve both government and opposition supporters and will be open to all regardless of political perspectives," providing some support for Poe’s statement. Still, most observers see the State Department’s openness to funding representatives of Chavez’s government as more of a diplomatic nicety, since foreign efforts to bolster democracy in a country with democratic shortcomings are typically framed with great rhetorical care. Indeed, there are strong signals that Chavez himself has no use for U.S. funding. A 2010 study by FRIDE and the World Movement for Democracy, a pair of non-governmental organizations, noted that members of a local group called Súmate who had received U.S. aid for a project on electoral observance "were accused of conspiracy and betrayal. The trial against them, which was initiated in 2003, is still pending." In a 2006 article based on Freedom of Information Act requests, the Associated Press reported that Chavez accused his opponents of taking "gringo money" to undermine his regime. So, while it’s possible that some U.S. aid has flowed to allies of Chavez, the bulk of U.S. aid goes to independent groups whose existence is more likely to undermine his authority than strengthen it. Where does this leave us? The one claim for which Poe may have a point is that some U.S. aid could make its way to supporters of Chavez (though not the government per se), given how the U.S. wrote the ground rules. However, Chavez has made his opposition to U.S. aid clear, and has even gone so far as to prosecute some opponents who have taken it. Meanwhile, the aid sent to Cuba is certainly not going into the government’s coffers, and it, like the Venezuela aid, is considered far likelier to undercut the government than support it. We take no position on the wisdom of Poe’s bill, but we do think his description of U.S. aid to Venezuela and Cuba is incorrect. The relatively small amounts of money sent to those two countries is primarily going to bolstering an opposition to their governments. So while there is a tiny sliver of truth that some U.S. aid could end up going to supporters of Chavez (though not to the Chavez government itself, nor to the Cuban government), we think the overall message of Poe's claim -- that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to prop up unfriendly, undemocratic governments -- is so inaccuate that we are rating his statement False.

pomt-02732	"The latest Quinnipiac poll found that nearly six-in-ten Americans oppose ObamaCare -- 30% support the law and 57% oppose it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/19/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-posts-wrong-poll-figure-obama-support-quickly-/	A reader recently asked us to check into a series of Facebook posts by the Republican National Committee themed to the "Twelve Days of Christmas." In the RNC’s version, the 12 days refer to aspects of President Barack Obama’s health care law that, according to Republicans, are having negative repercussions on the economy and health care system. One of those posts claimed that "the latest Quinnipiac poll found that nearly six-in-ten Americans oppose ObamaCare -- 30% support the law and 57% oppose it." It received nearly 4,000 "likes" -- but as it turns out, one of the percentages cited in the post was wrong. In the latest Quinnipiac poll, released on Dec. 11, 2013, respondents were asked, "Do you support or oppose the health care law passed by Barack Obama and Congress in 2010?" The poll results showed 57 percent opposition to the law, which was what the RNC had correctly cited. But the actual level of support in the poll was 39 percent -- not the 30 percent listed in the Facebook post. The error cut the amount of support by about one-quarter -- not a trivial amount. As it turned out, the error was simply a typo; the supporting material cited in the RNC’s Facebook post had the correct number -- 39 percent. When we brought this to the RNC’s attention, spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski wrote back, "Yes, this was a typo and we are fixing it right now." True to her word, the Facebook post was corrected within an hour or so. (We’ve posted a before-and-after look at right.) So the 57 percent in opposition was correct, but the actual level of support was 39 percent. Once we notified the RNC of this error, they quickly fixed it. Because one number was wrong in the original post and one was right, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-00778	Says U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has "sided with the GOP on key votes twice as often as he sided with Democrats."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/apr/09/brook-hines/patrick-murphy-supports-gop-most-key-votes-strateg/	Florida Democrats are drawing battle lines against one another now that U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has declared he’s running for Senate in 2016. Following the second-term congressman’s announcement he’ll seek Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s job, some liberals are saying Murphy is not the right candidate. They cite the Jupiter Democrat’s habit of breaking with his party on House votes. "As a matter of fact, he’s sided with the GOP on key votes twice as often as he sided with Democrats," said Brook Hines, a marketing consultant for progressive campaigns, in a column on politics site TheFloridaSqueeze.com. Hines later says U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, whom she calls "a bold progressive," would be a better candidate. Murphy was for many years a registered Republican before running for Congress in 2012, and he has a reputation for sometimes breaking with his party. But twice as much on so-called key votes? We decided to check the roll call to find out how Murphy really voted. Voting progressive Murphy has lived up to his moderate campaigns. He voted for a measure that would have made the president balance the budget by 2023 and backed a farm bill Democrats balked at because of work requirements for food stamp recipients. He also was one of only 19 Democrats to vote in favor of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project. But measuring Murphy’s record comes down to how you look at the issues. Hines told us she used the website ProgressivePunch.org as her source, and there are some very specific guidelines to how she came up with her 2-to-1 comparison. First of all, the site has a group of 37 representatives that founder Joshua Grossman deems "the progressive cohort." These 37 are chosen using a complex formula, but basically we can consider them the most liberal members (people like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and New York’s Nydia Velázquez). There’s a smaller cohort for the Senate, too. Grossman’s site then compares a representative’s voting record to how this cohort voted to come up with what it calls "crucial votes," which has a complicated definition: Any vote in which at least three-quarters of the 37 representatives voted against Republicans, while at least 10 percent of Democrats split from their party. That means votes where most liberals voted together and many moderates sided with the GOP. Using this data, the site comes up with a "progressive score" that shows the ratio of how an official compares with the most progressive members of Congress. In Murphy’s case, Hines took the progressive score for the 2015-16 Congress -- 31.25 percent (meaning that according to the site, he voted against progressive Democrats almost 69 percent of the time in the first three months of this year) -- to make her comparison. There are some problems with this comparison. The sample is small, because the 2015-16 score is comprised of only 17 votes so far, unlike the site’s lifetime score, which goes back to when Murphy took office. (His 45.71 percent lifetime score is a bit higher than just 2015-16.) And because the site’s record-keeping isn’t fully up-to-date, there’s no way to look up exactly which votes are part of the site’s calculation. Other examples There are other ways to look at Murphy’s voting record that show he doesn’t vote with Republicans twice as often. Both the Washington Post and the New York Times have tools that track major votes. In the Post’s sample, Murphy voted against his party in three out of eight key examples. The Times says he’s voted with Republicans two out of six times in major votes this year. GovTrack.us graphs Murphy as a centrist, but not nearly as far to the right as other Democrats. Ballotpedia.org concluded that Murphy outright voted with Republicans on three out of 13 issues. Perhaps most comprehensive is CQ’s "party unity" score, which measures how often Murphy voted with his party when a majority of Democrats voted the same way. His score for votes in 2014 is an 80, meaning he sided with Republicans about 20 percent of the time. That puts him about 12th from the bottom in terms of voting with his party, and the lowest among Florida’s delegation. For reference, the party average is about 90 percent; Minnesota Democrat Collin Peterson is dead last with a unity score of 48. Our ruling Hines said Murphy has "sided with the GOP on key votes twice as often as he sided with Democrats." That’s true by looking at one small subset of data gleaned through one progressive website that compared Murphy with a small group of liberals. Murphy does break ranks relatively often in a partisan Congress, but other outlets show Murphy sides with his own party, the Democrats, more often than not in notable votes. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Brook Hines	None	None	None	2015-04-09T16:47:21	2015-04-06	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'United_States']

pomt-13508	"Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-obama-administration-has-let-300/	A number of the statements Donald Trump made in his high-profile immigration speech in Phoenix were ones we’d checked before. But one was new to us. "Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities," Trump said. "These are individuals encountered or identified by (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct." As it turns out, the numbers are a lot more complicated than Trump indicated. Let’s take a closer look. Where does the 300,000 figure come from? Stephen Miller, a spokesman for Trump, directed us to Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies with the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors stricter immigration policies. (Officially, the center’s website says the group’s research has convinced many of its staff to be "animated by a ‘low-immigration, pro-immigrant’ vision of an America that admits fewer immigrants but affords a warmer welcome for those who are admitted.") Vaughan said that the 300,000 estimate comes from three distinct numbers. • In fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a cumulative 86,288 criminal aliens from custody pending removal proceedings. (That number has actually fallen year by year, from 36,007 to 30,558 to 19,723.) This number was announced by Sarah R. Saldana, ICE’s director, at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on April 28, 2016. According to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, these 86,288 criminal aliens collectively were convicted of more than 231,000 crimes. • From Jan 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015, state and local law enforcement agencies turned down 18,646 requests by ICE to hold deportable aliens arrested for non-immigration-related crimes until ICE could take them into custody. This figure was verified by ICE during an investigation by the Texas Tribune. • Vaughan has calculated that between 2013 and 2015, ICE officers, due to prosecutorial discretion, "let off more than 200,000 criminal aliens they encountered, instead of initiating deportation. Most of these were in local custody at the time. The encounters were hands-on, usually interviews at a jail – not just reviewing a list or getting a hit in a database." Vaughan said this number comes from internal ICE reports on enforcement activity -- the Weekly Report on Departures and Detention. The original documents are cited in the footnotes of Vaughan’s work here, here and here. If you put these three figures together, they add up to roughly 300,000. How solid is the 300,000 number? On purely numerical grounds, the experts we checked with didn’t express much concern about the first two categories, which collectively add up to about 105,000 individuals. The 200,000 figure is more controversial, however. Part of the concern stems from relying heavily on Vaughan’s calculations of ICE data, made necessary in part because the numbers from ICE are often opaque, hard to obtain, or both. Adam Cox, a law professor at New York University who has studied the issue, said that Vaughn offers "no evidence about whether there was actually probable cause under the law to arrest most of those who were not arrested. The report treats every encounter by an ICE agent as one in which we know there could have been an arrest. But as we know from many studies in lots of policing contexts, many police encounters end without an arrest because there is no basis for an arrest to be made." Other experts also urged caution about the number. "We cannot confirm that ICE has released 300,000 criminal immigrants and not placed them in removal proceedings," said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that believes that well-managed immigration brings "benefits to immigrants and their families, communities of origin and destination, and sending and receiving countries." Meanwhile, another concern stems from differences of opinion about what "prosecutorial discretion" means. The Obama administration has enacted a policy of "prosecutorial discretion" to prioritize removal proceedings. The guidelines place a lower priority for removal on those who came to the United States before age 16, are currently below age 30, have resided in the U.S. consistently for five years, are in school or have graduated or are serving in the military or have been honorably discharged -- and have "not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanor offenses." To supporters, this simply makes sense: In a world of limited resources, ICE should be putting the most dangerous or disruptive deportable individuals at the top of the list. To critics, however, this policy is a smokescreen for failing to uphold the law. Current law, Vaughan said, states that all aliens who are here illegally "are potentially subject to deportation regardless of whether they have other criminal convictions." Prioritization hasn’t been driven by resource constraints or public-safety considerations, she said, but rather "by political considerations." There’s a related question of whether it’s reasonable to call the Obama policy "political correctness," but that’s an opinion, so we’ll set that aside. At the very least, we can say that there is a professional dispute about whether the 200,000 figure is accurate. And since this category accounts for two-thirds of the total number referenced by Trump, this at least raises a question about whether his 300,000 figure is credible. How accurately did Trump describe Vaughan’s statistic? Beyond the question of whether the number is accurate, experts told us that Trump cut a few corners in how he described the number in his speech. • The three categories are a mixture of different statistics, and there may be some overlap. Vaughan acknowledges this, though she suspects the impact would be small. "There may be a few duplicates in the mix, if an individual was encountered or released more than once during the time period, but these are not enough to throw off the estimate by a lot," she said. • Trump is loose with his terminology. He uses the term "criminal aliens," even though the widely accepted definition of that term refers only to the first category of the three -- the one that counted 86,288 over the three-year period. As for the third category -- the cases where a local law enforcement agency declined to hold a deportable individual in custody for ICE -- it counts arrests, not convictions, making the term "criminal alien" inappropriate in at least some instances. Cox cited research showing that nearly one-third of all noncitizens taken into federal custody this way between 2008 and 2012 had no criminal convictions. • It’s an overreach to lay all of this at the Obama administration’s feet. For starters, Saldana in her congressional testimony said that between one-third and two-thirds of the criminal releases -- the first category -- were required by law, not by ICE’s choice, depending on the year. "These folks would also have to be released by ICE even if Trump were president, unless the agency was planning to flout court orders and ignore the detention rules written into law by Congress," Cox said. One problem, as we’ve noted previously, is that in some cases, the individual’s home country -- notably Cuba and Vietnam -- refused to accept them. We found that in fiscal year 2013, home country refusal led to the release of 3,746 people. (Critics, including Trump, say the U.S. should work harder to punish those recalcitrant countries.) Meanwhile, the primary actor in the third category are state and local law enforcement agencies, not the Obama administration, meaning it is "flatly incorrect to say that these are ‘criminal aliens’ that the Obama administration has allowed . . . to return back into United States communities," Cox said. In fact, he added, "ICE has been extremely unhappy about this resistance and has worked hard to get local governments to comply with detainer requests, so it is misleading to say ICE is ‘responsible’ for any such releases." (Vaughan countered that these releases "could have been prevented if the Obama administration had taken action against" sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that do not routinely turn over deportable aliens in their custody. "Instead, the administration has facilitated them," she said.) Our ruling Trump said that "since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct." One can make a reasonably strong -- though not foolproof -- case for 100,000. But immigration professions are divided over how credible the next 200,000 is. Meanwhile, Trump’s description of the number in his speech is not entirely accurate.

pomt-02553	Florida shelled out more money for drug testing than it saved by denying welfare benefits to people who tested positive for drugs.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/04/nan-orrock/orrock-questions-drug-testing-plan/	Partisan sparring by state lawmakers in an election year -- who could imagine such a thing? But the gloves came off when state Rep. Greg Morris, R-Vidalia, and state Sen. Nan Orrock, D-Atlanta, appeared on a television newscast to debate Morris’ proposal to require drug testing of applicants for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly the federal food stamp program. Georgia currently has a law on the books that mandates drug testing of applicants for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or what most people think of as welfare. But it’s been on hold because of legal battles over the constitutionality of a similar Florida law. Morris said his bill, much like the TANF drug-testing laws, is designed to ensure that the tax dollars of working Georgians aren’t subsidizing drug use. Orrock said the bill, if enacted, would violate the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against warrantless and suspicionless searches. She also said it would not be a money-saver. The Atlanta lawmaker said Florida spent more money for drug tests once its TANF law was implemented than it saved denying benefits to people who tested positive for drugs. We decided that claim was worth putting to a test of its own -- a truth test, especially given that, as of October, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 1,883,966 Georgians were receiving food stamps. Orrock said she based her statement on a story in The Miami Herald about Florida’s program, which operated for four months before it was halted due to legal challenges. The newspaper reported that 4,086 welfare applicants were subject to drug testing, and 108 people, or 2.6 percent, failed. An additional 40 people scheduled but canceled their tests. State law required Florida to reimburse applicants who tested negative an average of $35 for the screening -- or a total of $118,140. The result was a net loss of $45,780, the newspaper reported. Those same statistics, which support Orrock’s statement, were repeated in The New York Times and other publications. We also reached out to the Florida Department of Children & Families, the agency that headed the four months of drug testing of TANF applicants. Michelle Glady, the agency’s press secretary, said the department spent $115,364.95 on drug-test reimbursements, a slightly lower number than others reported Glady said she did not provide the news media with the numbers that were reported on a net loss. But the department also didn’t deny any benefits and so saw no savings. "Benefits were restored" because of the lawsuit, Glady said. PolitiFact has done extensive research and reviewed several studies on the topic of drug testing of recipients of government assistance, including claims that these initiatives can save taxpayers’ money. The ones we found showed that the costs to the state exceed any savings. In Florida, the American Civil Liberties Union sued over the law requiring drug testing of TANF recipients, saying it constituted an "unreasonable search" by the government, a violation of the Fourth Amendment. U.S. District Judge Mary S. Scriven issued a temporary injunction in October 2011, saying the law "appears likely to be deemed a constitutional infringement." And this past December, she ruled that the 2011 law requiring Florida welfare applicants to undergo drug tests was unconstitutional. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who had made the drug testing a campaign issue, has filed an appeal. In a harshly worded, 30-page opinion, Scriven concluded that "there is no set of circumstances under which the warrantless, suspicionless drug testing at issue in this case could be constitutionally applied." Scott has insisted that the urine tests are needed to make sure poor children don’t grow up in drug-riddled households. Maria Kayanan, associate legal director for the ACLU in Florida, said the full costs of the drug-testing law in that state are unknown. The state hired outside attorneys, and their bills are not yet fully tallied, Kayanan said. She said she would expect Morris’ legislation, if passed, to face the same legal challenges and outcomes as Florida’s law to drug-test TANF applicants. Melissa Johnson, a policy analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, also predicted that there would be legal obstacles to Morris’ bill. Federal law prohibits states from adding requirements for participants in the food stamp program, Kayanan and Johnson said. "It’s like a hammer looking for a nail," Johnson said. "There is no evidence that a problem exists." So where does this leave us? Orrock based her statement on news accounts about the Florida experience. Previous studies also suggest that similar measures elsewhere would not save taxpayers money. We rate her statement True.	None	Nan Orrock	None	None	None	2014-02-04T00:00:00	2014-01-22	['None']

pomt-13059	"Report: 3 million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/18/blog-posting/no-3-million-undocumented-immigrants-did-not-vote-/	Were there 3 million illegal votes from undocumented immigrants in this year’s presidential election? Well, that’s what some websites are saying. "Report: 3 million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens," reads a headline on InfoWars, a conspiracy website ran by Alex Jones. The article has been shared via Facebook more than 48,000 times when we last looked. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Other websites also have touted this report, including Milo, TheNewAmerican and FreedomDaily. So is there any truth to it? Well, we don’t know for absolute certain. But the report is actually a tweet, and the person who authored the tweet won’t explain how he arrived at his figure. If that isn’t reason enough to be skeptical, independent experts and historical analyses suggest it’s highly suspect. In other words, don’t buy it. Where’s the report? As evidence of its claim, InfoWars’ headline refers to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter profile says he’s the founder of VoteStand, a voter fraud reporting app. There is no report from VoteFraud.org, however, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. The information comes from tweets made by from Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13. Here they are: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Phillips would not provide any additional information when asked by PolitiFact. He said he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would also not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. Phillips said he would release the information publicly once he is finally finished. According to his page on LinkedIn, Phillips is a former finance director of the Alabama Republican Party. He also served as executive director of the Mississippi Republican Party and was managing director of a super PAC that supported Newt Gingrich’s 2012 campaign for president. Plenty of reason to be skeptical While we have no idea how Phillips arrived at his claim that 3-million noncitizens voted, people who have made similar claims in the past have cited a 2014 report that claims 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010 midterm congressional elections. That report was based on data from a Harvard survey of people. But the data was flawed, which created flaws in the subsequent report. The authors of the survey say a small percentage of respondents, who are citizens, accidentally misidentified themselves as noncitizens on the survey. This is because the respondents didn’t read the question carefully and accidentally selected the wrong response to the question. How do researchers know this? One of the authors of the survey, Brian Schaffner, said people changed their answers later when they were asked about their citizenship. "When we took out people who changed their answer on the citizenship question and only look at people who answered consistently that they were noncitizens, we found no reported noncitizens who voted," Schaffner told PolitiFact. Other research contradicts Phillips’ tweet. News 21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. "Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper," reads the 2007 report. States that have tried to purge noncitizens from voter rolls, meanwhile, have found even government data lacking. In 2012, Florida Governor Rick Scott’s administration started an effort trying to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. Through this process the Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the voting rolls. State officials began to pursue a second attempt at a purge in advance of the 2014 election but then abandoned that effort, too. Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, called Phillips’ claim "fake news." "There is no credible evidence I have seen to show large numbers of noncitizens voting in U.S. elections anywhere," Hasen said. "The idea that 3 million noncitizens could have illegally voted in our elections without being detected is obscenely ludicrous." Our ruling Reports claim 3 million "illegal aliens" cast votes in this year's election. The articles point back to tweets from Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app. But Phillips will not provide any evidence to support his claim, which happens to be undermined by publicly available information. If Phillips does release a more detailed report, we will consider that information. But for now, this claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.

pomt-13015	"More than two-thirds of the aliens the Obama administration has brought to the United States under the president's Central American Minors program weren’t actually minors at all."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/07/blog-posting/claim-central-american-minors-program-mostly-benef/	A conservative news outlet criticized a federal program created to bring United States children fleeing violence in Central America into the United States, saying it largely benefits adults. "Recent government data shows that more than two-thirds of the aliens the Obama administration has brought to the United States under the president's Central American Minors program weren’t actually minors at all," said the Dec. 1 post published by MRCTV. Only 30 percent of individuals who have come to the United States under the program are under 18 years old, the article said. "Conversely, a full 70 percent of those aliens who’ve been allowed into the United States under the president’s program for ‘minors’ are adults," said MRCTV. A PolitiFact reader asked us to look into it. We found that while MRCTV’s data for arrivals under 18 is largely accurate, its interpretation of who should count as a minor differs from the government definition. The public relations firm representing MRCTV, which says its goal is to "break down the boundaries between traditional conservative media and mainstream culture," did not respond to requests for information. Violence and poverty Gang violence and poverty in Central American nations has propelled thousands of children to leave their homes unaccompanied and cross illegally into the United States. The number of Central American children coming alone started to increase in fiscal year 2012, largely due to an influx from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. It rose significantly in fiscal year 2014, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The number of unaccompanied children (0 to 17 years old) from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras apprehended at the southwest border reached a high in fiscal year 2014 at 51,705, up from 10,146 in fiscal year 2012, per border patrol data. Apprehensions of unaccompanied children from those three Central American countries dropped in fiscal year 2015 but picked up again in fiscal year 2016. The White House in June 2014 announced a series of new programs and partnerships with Central American countries to address economic and criminal problems that motivated youth to migrate to the United States. Central American Minors program President Barack Obama’s administration in November 2014 also announced a refugee/parole program "to provide a safe, legal, and orderly alternative to the dangerous journey that some children are currently undertaking to the United States." The Central American Minors program allows certain parents with lawful presence in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees. Children ineligible for admission as refugees but at risk of harm may be admitted under parole. A "qualifying child" must be unmarried, under 21 and living in Guatemala, El Salvador or Honduras, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The immigration agency says that in certain cases, a parent who lives with a qualifying child may also apply for the program if he or she is the legal spouse of the person in the United States requesting the child’s resettlement. The program was expanded in 2016 to allow additional family members to apply. A State Department spokesperson said given the time it takes to vet applicants, no one who would be eligible under the expansion has been admitted yet. More than 10,500 people have applied for the Central American Minors program and 1,644 have been admitted as of Dec. 1, according to the State Department. Here’s a breakdown of the 1,644 arrivals: "Minors" admissions comprise 83 percent: - 484 (29 percent) under 18 years old - 1,106 (67 percent) under 21 years old - 1,370 (83 percent) under 22 years old "The reason that some arrivals are 21 (not under 21, as the program specifies) is that a qualifying child must be ‘under 21’ at the time the application is received, but can arrive as a 21-year-old, since the adjudication process takes approximately one year on average," a State Department spokesperson said. The remaining 17 percent of arrivals are the legal/biological parents of the qualifying child, according to the State Department. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com MRCTV’s post that more than two-thirds of arrivals under the programs aren’t minors is technically accurate when accounting for minors as applicants under 18. Generally in the United States, 18 is considered the "age of majority" and the age when individuals are no longer considered minors. (Eighteen is the minimum age to vote, but Americans must be 21 to legally buy alcohol.) But immigration law has a different rule: "A ‘child’ is defined as an individual who is unmarried and under the age of 21," according to USCIS. The reason? People who may have been targeted for persecution when they were under 18 could still be at risk when they cross that threshold, said Peter Margulies, who teaches immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law. "Gangs still want more members," Margulies said. "If gangs don't care if their target is 17 or 20, the United States should extend protection in both cases. Otherwise, the individual remains in danger of persecution." "Gangs do not stop their abuse on a victim’s 18th birthday," added Michael Kagan, a law professor and director of the immigration clinic at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Our ruling An article by MRCTV said, "More than two-thirds of the aliens the Obama administration has brought to the United States under the president's Central American Minors program weren’t actually minors at all." Per State Department data, 83 percent (1,370) of 1,644 individuals who have come to the United States through the program have been under 22 years old and qualifying minors, including 484 people (29 percent) under 18 years old. Though 18 is generally considered the age of adulthood, for immigration purposes, an unmarried person under 21 is considered a "child," meeting the qualifying age for the minors program. Some individuals who were 21 were admitted because they were under the age at the time of their application. MRCTV’s statement is accurate but needs additional clarification.

pomt-03900	Says that since 1975, redistricting by Texas lawmakers has always been found in violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/mar/01/trey-martinez-fischer/trey-martinez-fischer-says-texas-legislature-has-n/	A section of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 must continue to apply to Texas, the chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus said, and a decades-long losing streak shows it. State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer spoke in advance of arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in an Alabama challenge to the act’s Section 5, which requires nearly every southern state and some other governmental entities to get federal approval before changing election practices. Covered jurisdictions, including Texas, must win "preclearance" from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before changes take effect. Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, said at a Feb. 25, 2013, Capitol press conference that Congress made Texas subject to Section 5 starting in 1975 because the state had been printing English-only ballots, discriminating against Spanish speakers. (As we’ve noted, other triggers also figured into the decision.) Subsequently, Martinez Fischer said, Texas "was never able to preclear; it was always a fight. Texas always ends up on the losing side." His comments were paraphrased in an Austin American-Statesman news article as his saying that since Texas was put under the section, the Texas Legislature has never gone through redistricting without violating it. Never? By telephone, Martinez Fischer told us that his focus has been on Texas House districts and that the caucus’ redistricting counsel, Jose Garza of San Antonio, has advised that every Texas House map as initially drawn by lawmakers had been found in violation of Section 5, which proscribes changes abridging or denying the right to vote on account of race or color or membership in a language minority group. With help from lawyers versed in redistricting, including Steve Bickerstaff of Austin and Michael Li of Dallas, we confirmed numerous instances of the Justice Department objecting to--not preclearing--Texas redistricting plans. For starters, we figured there were 16 major opportunities for Texas to redraw districts statewide from 1981 through 2011, nearly all of them touched off by an immediately preceding U.S. census. Bickerstaff noted there also was some redistricting action between 1975 and 1980; more on that below. For this fact check, though, we chose not to take into account the largely undisputed district maps for the State Board of Education; there has been little to no fight there. There has been much tussling over Texas-drawn maps of U.S. House and Texas Senate and House districts. Li, who has also been a Democratic fundraiser, guided us to Texas Legislative Council timelines outlining the litigation history of redistricting from the 1980s through 2012. Any Justice Department objections on the timelines, Li noted, would automatically tie to Section 5 since the section is the agency’s sole legal basis for judging preclearance, though he also reminded us that plans are sometimes precleared through a Washington, D.C., judicial panel. Coincidentally, the timelines also were cited as sources for a chart sent our way by Martin Golando of Martinez Fischer’s office indicating eight instances of preclearance being denied over the decades. Garza, the redistricting counsel, said by phone the key point is that "there’s never been a decade in which the state came through clean when it comes to discrimination against minorities." That’s confirmed by the timelines. Let’s get gritty. The timeline for the 1980s shows the Justice Department objecting to U.S. House districts as passed into law and not preclearing Texas House and Texas Senate plans drawn by the Legislative Redistricting Board, a five-person panel that can act if legislators fail to agree on those plans. In the ‘90s,the department precleared the legislated U.S. House plan--though, Bickerstaff noted, a lawsuit charging that the plan unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered districts culminated in a federal court imposing a plan, in 1996, redrawing 13 of the then-30 districts. Court-drawn maps are not subject to preclearance, Li advised. In November 1991, the Justice Department objected to the legislated Texas House plan; a revised plan, passed into law along the lines of a lawsuit settlement, won preclearance in July 1992. The timeline for the state’s Senate plan that decade probably should be read at your own risk. The original legislated Senate plan was withdrawn from the Justice Department before a preclearance decision, according to the timeline. Another plan, settling a lawsuit charging the legislated plan with discriminating against minority voters, was passed into law, then rejected for preclearance by Justice only to be precleared by the Washington federal court. Other judges, in Austin, ordered that plan used in the 1994 elections and, presumably, through the decade. In the 2000s, Senate districts drawn by the redistricting board won preclearance, according to the council’s timeline. Lawmakers failed to agree on redrawn congressional districts, so a federal court imposed a plan for the 2002 elections before the 2003 Legislature swapped in its version, which the Justice Department precleared in December 2003 despite a memo from staff lawyers saying the plan violated the section by diluting black and Hispanic voting power in two congressional districts, according to a Dec. 2, 2005, Washington Post news article. Garza noted that the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 held that one district in the plan diluted the minority vote in violation of another section of the Voting Rights Act, fueling changes. Justice denied preclearance to Texas House districts as drawn by the redistricting board. A Nov. 16, 2001, Justice Department letter says the state failed to show the plan had neither a discriminatory effect or intent against minority voters in Bexar County, South and West Texas. A Texas-based panel of federal judges later redrew districts to address the concerns. In August 2012, In August 2012, most recently, a U.S. District Court in Washington denied preclearance of the legislated remaps of House, Senate and U.S. House districts adopted by the GOP-majority Legislature in 2011. The state has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. U.S. Justice Department Section 5 Preclearance Decisions Texas Redistricting Plans 1981-2012 Initial Texas Redistricting Plan Precleared Initial Plan Not Precleared Notable U.S. House, 1981 Texas House, 1981 Texas Senate, 1981 U.S. House, 1991 Federal court hearing discrimination lawsuit later redrew 13 of 30 districts Texas House, 1991 Revised plan passed into law reflected lawsuit settlement and precleared in July 1992 Texas Senate, 1991 State withdrew legislated plan before preclearance decision.

Upshot: Nine of the dozen initially legislated or board-devised redistricting plans did not win preclearance, counting the 2011 congressional, Texas Senate and House plans whose court rejections are on state appeal. Conversely, three initial state plans won preclearance, though a federal court acting on a discrimination lawsuit later redrew much of one and the Supreme Court held that another one had a non-Section 5 voting-rights flaw. Bickerstaff offered his summary dating back further, emailing that by his memory, since 1975, lawmakers or the redistricting board have adopted 13 statewide redistricting plans, not counting education board plans. "Only one plan," the Senate plan written by the board in the 2000s, "escaped objection under Section 5 and was used for the decade," Bickerstaff said. Our ruling Martinez Fischer said that since Texas was placed under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in 1975, the Texas Legislature has never gone through redistricting without violating it. We see a reasonable basis for this claim in that Section 5 objections have been lodged by federal authorities in every once-a-decade round of redistricting since then. Still, three initial redistricting plans won preclearance and one plan survived through its decade unscathed by the Justice Department or federal courts. In these ways, "never" is misleading, rendering the claim partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Trey Martinez Fischer	None	None	None	2013-03-01T16:31:19	2013-02-25	['Texas']

pomt-08497	"The years that I was speaker, the Florida House consistently offered leaner budgets than the governor offered."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/08/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-counters-earmark-attacks-says-he-propo/	Yep, Gov. Charlie Crist is still talking about those budget "earmarks" Marco Rubio tried to stick in the state budget. Back when Crist was running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, he claimed that Rubio, as House speaker, tried to direct $800,000 to a South Florida sports group to place artificial turf on a flag football field where Rubio played. PolitiFact Florida ruled the claim Half True, noting that Rubio didn't sponsor the specific appropriation, but supported it by voting for the budget. Then on Sept. 20, 2010, the new no-party Crist began airing a TV ad criticizing Rubio for inserting $800,000 for a turf field and $1.5 million for a rowing institute. We found even less evidence -- in fact we found none -- that Rubio had anything to do with the rowing institute appropriation and ruled the claim Pants on Fire! On Oct. 6, 2010, during the first prime-time debate between Crist, Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek, Crist again brought up the earmark issue. Midway through the debate, which was moderated by George Stephanopoulos and broadcast on ABC stations across the state, a panelist asked Crist whether he thought his opponents deserved to be on a national corrupt candidates list. Crist said that he wouldn't say whether Rubio was corrupt ("That's for other people to decide.") But Crist said Rubio put questionable things in the budget, like "$800,000 for an AstroTurf field on -- for a flag football field that he plays on-- in Miami." "Is that corrupt? Is it wrong? It's clearly wrong, in my view. That's why I had to veto some things," Crist said. Rubio was prepared for the attack. "First of all, let's set the record straight. The things he's absolutely said are just not true," Rubio said. "I had nothing to do with the flag football field. "The second thing is that he says I steered money -- all these things are false allegations. The fact is that the years that I was speaker, the Florida House consistently offered leaner budgets than the governor offered. Leaner budgets than the Senate offered. If you-- if you wanted a leaner budget, you should have lined up behind our budget. Our budget was even leaner than yours." Crist never responded to Rubio's claim about the budget, but the claim had us wondering: Despite all this tough talk by Crist about earmarks and vetoing pet projects, did Rubio actually propose smaller state budgets than the governor? A quick bit of background. The governor each year proposes a budget to legislators prior to the spring legislative session. But it's the House and Senate that actually craft the state budget plan. Usually, the House and Senate pass different versions of the budget, then work together to reconcile those differences. After a final budget is approved by the Legislature, it is sent on to the governor, who has the power of a line-item veto -- meaning the governor can veto specific appropriations and programs from the budget without having to veto the budget in its entirety. The state Constitution requires that the state budget be balanced. Crist was elected governor in 2006, and has presented budgets in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Rubio served as House speaker during Crist's first two budget years, in 2007 and 2008, so those are the two years we will be comparing. 2007 -- Crist's first budget as governor, Rubio's first as speaker On Feb. 5, 2007, Crist proposed a $71.2 billion state budget that included $20 million for stem cell research, $32.5 million to establish a voter paper trail and $50 million for ethanol research and manufacturing. But the proposal was short-lived. Souring economic and tax collection data forced Crist to amend his budget recommendations a little more than a month later. Crist revised his budget request on March 15, cutting approximately $473 million in spending. The new proposed spending plan totaled $70.8 billion. (For consistency, we have rounded the overall budget numbers to one decimal place). The House leadership, led by Rubio as speaker and Ray Sansom as budget council chair, released a $70.2 billion budget program less than two weeks later. The budget that actually passed on April 11 was a little bigger, totaling $70.3 billion. That's about $500 million or .7 percent less than what Crist proposed. In negotiations with the Senate, the state budget grew. On April 30, Senate and House leaders settled on a $71.9 billion spending plan. Crist wound up vetoing more than $400 million in projects from the Legislature's budget, including $800,000 for artificial turf for a South Florida football field. (The budget ended up being cut by nearly $1.2 billion during a special session because of declining tax revenues, and another $500 million during the 2008 regular session). To us, the key to the 2007 comparison of the Crist and Rubio-led budget proposals is looking at the revised recommendation of Crist (about $70.8 billion) and the version that Rubio ultimately shepherded through the House (about $70.3 billion). We think it's fair to use the $70.3 billion figure because Rubio controlled a Republican-dominated House and could easily have decided to stick with the lower $70.2 billion original proposal if he wanted. Conversely, we don't think it's fair to saddle Rubio with the budget that came out of negotiations with the Senate. Nor do we think it's appropriate to consider Crist's original proposal, which came when economic conditions were different and a month and a half before Rubio unveiled his spending plan. Using those two numbers then, $70.3 billion for Rubio and $70.8 billion for Crist, Rubio indeed proposed spending less than Crist. But not by much. 2008 -- Crist's second budget as governor, Rubio's last as speaker On Jan. 31, 2008, Crist proposed a $70 billion budget, a small decrease from the budget approved in 2007. "As a nation, we are facing extraordinary economic times," Crist said in announcing his budget recommendations. "However, we can be certain that Florida's brightest days are ahead of us. It is especially important — now more than ever — for government to spend the people's money wisely and live within our means, just as Florida's families do every day." Crist's proposed budget added about $1 billion for education, and dipped into trust funds and reserves for about $1.1 billion in order to balance the budget. Crist's budget included a 2 percent pay raise for state workers, allocated $300 million to an environmental land buying program called Florida Forever and sent $46.9 million to expand public health centers. His ideas got an icy reception from leaders in the House, particularly Rubio, who argued against using reserves to plug budget holes and instead advocated eliminating and merging functions of some state agencies. "We must balance our budget by living within our means," he said. "We should not spend money that we do not have. And we should not rely on gimmicks." As the calendar turned from January to February and then to March, Crist's budget became less and less realistic, as state revenue projections continued to plummet. By March 12, 2008, the Orlando Sentinel reported that the state would receive $3 billion less in revenue than was anticipated when Crist proposed his budget. Crist said the grim numbers helped advance his position to use one-time reserves to balance the budget without raising taxes. And Rubio persisted that the government needed to cut spending. That takes us to March 31, the day the House unveiled its budget proposal. The House advocated for a $65.1 billion budget, which would cut 7.5 percent from the current budget. The House proposal cut per-student funding $86, eliminated about 1,000 state jobs, and stripped money out of the Florida Forever program. A $65 billion budget plan eventually passed the House along party lines on April 10. The House and Senate eventually agreed to send a $66.2 billion budget to Crist. Crist ultimately vetoed only $1 million in projects -- $300,000 for a lake restoration program in Central Florida and $840,000 for a Miami festival promoting ties with Miami's sizable Nicaraguan community. The differences between the House and Crist's proposed budgets in 2008 are more stark than they were in 2007. Crist proposed a larger budget of around $70 billion by tapping trust funds. The House budget was leaner by $5 billion (or more than 7 percent), and relied less on trust funds and more on spending cuts. We should note that Rubio and the House did have the advantage of being able to wait two months after Crist to release their budget proposal. In those two months, revenue projections plummeted, necessitating smaller budgets. Our ruling All this budget talk started with an argument over earmarks in the budget, and more generally, who can stake a claim to being the better fiscal conservative -- Charlie Crist or Marco Rubio. Rubio says the House budgets he proposed in 2007 and 2008 were "leaner budgets than the governor offered." Rubio is largely right, though his claim could use a little additional information. In 2007, the budgets offered by Rubio and Crist ultimately were pretty similar, with the difference being just about $500 million in a budget totaling more than $70 billion. The budgets in 2008 were significantly different, however, primarily because Crist wanted to use trust funds to help balance a bigger budget. Rubio advocated cutting state spending to make the budget smaller. It's also worth noting that state revenue projects took a turn for the worse in between when Crist proposed his budget in 2008, and when Rubio and the House proposed theirs. We find this claim to be Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-10-08T15:36:45	2010-10-06	['None']

pomt-04585	U.S. House opponent Paul Ryan supports "cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/23/rob-zerban/paul-ryan-backs-cutting-veterans-funding-24-percen/	So controversial are the budget and Medicare reforms pitched by GOP vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan that they’re being used not only to attack him, but other Republicans running for the U.S. House of Representatives, as well. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, is seeking election to an eighth two-year term even as his name appears on the ballot as Mitt Romney’s running mate. Ryan’s opponent, Democrat Rob Zerban, went beyond the more common attacks when he appeared Aug. 9, 2012, on Ed Schultz’s national radio talk show. Schultz, who also hosts a talk show on MSNBC, asked Zerban whether Ryan’s proposals play well in his southern Wisconsin district. Zerban said constituents are "overwhelmingly against" them once they hear details, such as "cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent." That’s a big reduction. Has Ryan really sought a 24 percent cut for veterans? Zerban’s evidence When asked for evidence, Zerban campaign spokesman Karthik Ganapathy cited a Huffington Post article published 10 days after Zerban’s interview; it in turn cites an article published five months earlier in The Atlantic magazine. Both claim Ryan’s budget cuts veterans programs by 24 percent, but The Atlantic cites as its source a March 2012 item in The Washington Post Wonkblog. The Post article says that over 10 years, Ryan’s budget would spend 13 percent less on veterans than Obama’s budget. Ganapathy said the two articles he cited claimed a 24 percent cut because that was the figure Post originally used. The Post article does say it was updated, but refers only to the 13 percent figure, so it’s not clear whether 24 percent had been cited previously. It doesn’t really matter. Both the Ryan budget and the Obama budget cited by the Post actually raise -- not cut -- spending on medical, disability, housing and other services for veterans by billions of dollars. It’s just that Ryan’s budget doesn’t increase spending for veterans as much as Obama’s does. To be sure, there are fears that Ryan’s long-term budget plans -- which largely aim to reduce federal spending -- could necessitate dramatic reductions in services. Zerban’s spokesman cited a March 2012 article by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington, D.C. think tank, about the long-term spending "path" traced by Ryan’s budget. By 2050, the article claimed, "most of the federal government aside from Social Security, health care and defense" -- including veterans programs -- "would cease to exist." But Zerban didn’t say Ryan’s plan would someday cause veterans programs to "cease to exist." What’s more, that sweeping prediction is a measure of long-term outcomes, not actions in one-year budget increments. Indeed, many budget watchers point out that Ryan’s long-term plan lacks enough detail to know where, and to what degree, specific cuts would occur. In an August 2012 analysis, University of Maryland public policy professor Philip Joyce said the level of proposed spending cuts "will require the federal government to stop doing lots of things that it does now." The cuts could be realized through a two-thirds reduction in, for example, doctors and nurses in veterans hospitals, the professor said. But Joyce also said the lack of detail on cuts to federal services makes it "impossible to know what the actual impact" of Ryan’s long-term budget would be. Similarly, our friends at FactCheck.org observed in August 2012 that "Republicans boast of cutting the deficit more than the president, but don’t detail how what programs would have to be eliminated or reduced to achieve that. And the Democrats fill in the details, claiming popular programs like education are on the chopping block." Our rating Zerban said Ryan supports "cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent." But Ryan’s short-term budgets provide for spending increases for veterans services. And even if his long-term plans lead to spending reductions, there isn’t enough detail to know whether and how much programs for veterans would be trimmed. We rate Zerban’s statement False.

pomt-00792	Says President Ronald Reagan "had a month of job creation of 1 million."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/06/george-will/no-reagan-did-not-oversee-creation-1-million-jobs-/	Disappointing job numbers -- 126,000 added jobs in March -- put the White House on the defensive and energized President Barack Obama’s critics. Conservative columnist George Will noted how poorly Obama stacks up against Republican icon Ronald Reagan. "During the Reagan recovery there were 23 months of job creation over 300,000," Will said on Fox News Sunday. "Reagan had a month of job creation of 1 million, and this was at a time when there were 75 million fewer Americans." Will is correct that across President Reagan’s two terms, there were 23 months when the economy added over 300,000 jobs (the average monthly gain once the recovery took hold in March 1983 was about 250,000 jobs). But the focus of this fact-check is Will’s claim that Reagan oversaw a month when employment shot up by 1 million. Dave Weigel of Bloomberg Politics questioned Will’s claim, and we thought it was worth examining. We emailed Will and his assistant and did not hear back by the time we published, but there can be only one month that Will had in mind. It is September 1983. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employer data showed 1.1 million more people getting paychecks in September than in August. This would be extraordinary except for one thing. On August 7, 1983, about 675,000 telephone workers went on strike. At the end of the month, they approved a contract and went back to work. In the interim, the Labor Department gathered its payroll data -- and, essentially, documented the effect of the strike. "No doubt the striking workers returning to their jobs would have created a big bump in employment," said Doug Rossinow, a historian at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, Minn., and author of The Reagan Era: A history of the 1980s. Put simply, the strike jangled the monthly job counts on both ends. It drove down the tally for August and pumped it up in September (and drove it back down for October). This graph using government data shows what happened: The government’s September 1983 jobs report explicitly tied the 1.1 million spike to the labor dispute. "Nonagricultural payroll employment rose by 735,000 in September," the report said. "About 675,000 of this increase, however, represented the return of employees to payrolls following settlement of strikes, chiefly that of communications workers." Newspapers were careful not to read too much into the big number. The New York Times wrote that the recovery was gaining ground with a rise of "nearly 400,000, in the overall number of people employed." The Labor Department did not count the striking workers as employed in August because they weren’t drawing a paycheck. But the jobs they had on Aug. 6, 1983, were waiting for them when they settled at the end of the month. The claim that 1.1 million new jobs were added in a single month has been debunked before, as recently as January 2015. Our ruling Will said Reagan created 1 million jobs in one month. The reality is that the jobs created by Reagan in 1983 were the result of a counting anomaly that started with a strike of telephone workers. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics rightly discounted the spike when it first reported it in 1983, as did news reports. Will should have, too. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12546	"United Airlines flight attendant slaps crying baby during flight."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/18/now8newscom/fake-news-story-says-united-flight-attendant-slapp/	A fake news website targeted United Airlines over recent bad publicity by concocting a bogus story that said a member of the flight crew abused an infant. "United Airlines flight attendant slaps crying baby during flight," read the headline on an April 10, 2017, post on Now8News.com, a known fake news site. Facebook users flagged the story as being possibly false, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curb fake news. The post, which is fake, said the flight attendant on a flight from New York to Chicago had asked the parents of a 7-month-old boy several times to "quiet that annoying a-- baby down." After four attempts, the attendant reportedly grabbed the child from its mother’s arms and slapped him in the face. The crew member had to be restrained and the plane made an emergency landing in Missouri. If the date on the story sounds familiar, it’s the same day a doctor named David Dao was forcibly removed from a United flight for not giving up his seat to help transport United employees from Chicago to Louisville, Ky. The story ignited a firestorm of backlash on social media and beyond. Since March, the airline has had a run of events that have cast it in a bad light. There was a furor over two teens denied a flight because they were wearing leggings. After the Dao incident, a scorpion stung a passenger on a flight from Houston to Calgary, Canada. Most recently, a couple from Salt Lake City alleged they were kicked off a plane for no justifiable reason on their way to a Costa Rican wedding and honeymoon. The fictional post on Now8News.com no doubt was timed to capitalize on Dao’s removal, laying blame on United for yet another PR disaster — but this one never happened. Now8News.com is a fake site designed to resemble a legitimate TV station’s website. There’s no indication on Now8News.com that it posts fabricated content, although its Facebook page notes that it publishes "what the Main Stream Media won't tell you, and a little BS too." PunditFact has written about the site before, when it posted a fake story that said a Black Lives Matter supporter had killed 19 white women and hidden their mutilated bodies in a freezer. This made-up story looked to draw in readers by piling on a controversial incident on a United flight. Readers no doubt would be fooled into thinking this was real, too. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-13407	Tom Suozzi raised taxes "by hundreds of millions of dollars" as Nassau County executive.	true	/new-york/statements/2016/sep/23/national-republican-congressional-committee/suozzi-passed-major-tax-hikes-nassau-county/	Nothing, the saying goes, is as certain as death and taxes. Now both are campaign fodder in the race for a congressional seat on Long Island. Republicans are using Democrat Tom Suozzi’s record on taxes as Nassau County Executive in the 3rd Congressional District race. One claim followed a newspaper report that two of the voter signatures collected to help get Suozzi on the ballot are from people who had already died. "Long Island voters who are actually living and breathing are clearly still unhappy with Suozzi raising taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars," Chris Pack of the National Republican Congressional Committee said. Suozzi served as Nassau County Executive from 2002 to 2009. Before that he was the mayor of Glen Cove. He wants to succeed Democrat Rep. Steve Israel, who’s not seeking re-election. He faces Republican Jack Martins, who has served in the State Senate since 2011 and also was mayor of the village of Mineola for eight years before that. So is the NRCC correct? Did Suozzi raise taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars when he was county executive? Raising taxes in Nassau County When Suozzi took office in 2002, Nassau County was in rough financial shape, riddled with debt amid a hiring freeze for non-essential workers. The county was trying to figure out how to recover from a fiscal crisis that started under the previous administration. The county received a bailout from the state, which also created an independent authority to monitor the financial condition of the county. That authority, the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, has released reports on the county’s finances since its creation in 2000. To restore the county’s financial footing, Suozzi pitched an unusually large tax increase of close to 20 percent. The county legislature approved it,and property taxes increased by more than $125 million for residents that year. Though steep, the increase helped stabilize the county’s finances, at least in the short term, said E.J. McMahon of the Empire Center for Public Policy. Suozzi kept taxes mostly flat for the remainder of his time in office until 2009 when there was an increase in property tax revenue of close to 4 percent, or about $40 million. Suozzi also proposed a tax on energy use for Nassau County residents during his second term. It passed the legislature and took effect in 2009. It was repealed after Suozzi lost re-election. The tax generated close to $40 million for the county before it went off the books in the second half of 2010, according to documents from the county’s budget office. Two years after Suozzi lost the county executive’s office, the state took control of the county’s finances again. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee said in an online post that former Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi raised taxes by "hundreds of millions of dollars." During his time in office, Suozzi raised taxes by more than $200 million by collecting more in property taxes and instituting an energy-use tax. The $40 million collected from the short-lived energy-use tax combined with the $160 million increase in property taxes brings the total above that threshold.

pomt-12211	"More people, almost twice as many, pay the penalty or take the waiver than signed up for (Obamacare)."	false	/california/statements/2017/jul/21/kevin-mccarthy/kevin-mccarthys-false-claim-obamacare-sign-ups/	Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield is no fan of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But did he accurately characterize sign-ups under the federal health law in a recent interview on Fox Business? Here’s what he said in the interview on June 11, 2017: "Remember this, under Obamacare it mandates that you have health insurance. If you don’t, you have to pay a penalty or take a waiver. More people, almost twice as many, pay the penalty or take the waiver than signed up for it." McCarthy is correct that Obamacare requires people to have health insurance, unless they pay a penalty or claim an exemption. Exemptions are granted based on household income levels. But we wanted to know: Have almost twice as many people really declined health coverage -- by paying the penalty or taking a waiver -- as signed up for Obamacare? And what counts for a ‘sign-up’ under Obamacare? We set out on a fact check. Our research We asked McCarthy’s spokesman for evidence supporting the claim. For the penalty and exemptions, he cited figures from an IRS report to Congress based on tax year 2015, the latest year for which numbers are available. They show: 6.5 million people paid a penalty in 2015 12.7 million people claimed an exemption in 2015 Altogether, 19.2 million declined Obamacare coverage that year. These figures are widely accepted by health policy experts. For Obamacare sign-ups, McCarthy’s spokesman cited a 12.2 million figure for the most recent enrollment period. It’s based on a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services news release, though health policy experts say it’s far from the full picture on Obamacare sign-ups. It shows the number who selected or were automatically re-enrolled in an Obamacare marketplace plan nationally. Looking at the numbers, 19.2 million is not "almost twice as many" as 12.2 million. There’s also the larger question: Are the marketplaces the full picture of Obamacare sign-ups? Absolutely not, health policy experts told us. ‘The missing piece’ President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. The federal law, however, did not go into effect until 2014. When it did, it created two ways to increase the number of people with health insurance in the United States -- the exchanges and an expanded Medicaid program -- said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. Total sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act’s are closer to 20 million when adding enrollment through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, Kominski said. That figure comes from a March 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services. "It’s a false statement," Kominski said of McCarthy’s claim. "The category that the congressman conveniently left out of his narrative (is) the roughly 14 million people who were newly enrolled in Medicaid programs around the country. It’s the missing piece." "To ignore one category and exclusively focus on the other is disingenuous," he added. "Either that or it shows a fundamental lack of (understanding) of the law." Kominski advocates for the Affordable Care Act as "a great step forward" on his website. ‘It’s certainly part of Obamacare’ Joy Melnikow, Director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, agreed Medicaid can’t be ignored. "It’s certainly part of Obamacare," Melnikow said. "It was the bigger piece of what Obamacare did." The two main parts of Obamacare, the marketplaces and Medicaid, are more connected than some might think, she added. "When someone goes to buy insurance on the exchange, the process solicits information about that individual’s income to see if they qualify for Medicaid. If they qualify for Medicaid, the exchange insurance sign-up will route them to sign up for Medicaid." Absolute conclusions? Drawing an absolute conclusion about how many people signed up for Medicaid because of Obamacare isn’t so simple, noted one health researcher. "There’s not a clean, easy way to measure who signed up because of the Affordable Care Act," said Cynthia Cox, who studies the ACA at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research organization. It’s not always clear, she added, whether enrollees signed up because they heard about Medicaid expansion under the ACA or for other unrelated reasons. Our ruling Congressman Kevin McCarthy claimed almost twice as many people have paid a penalty or taken a waiver as signed up for Obamacare. By focusing only on enrollment through the Obamacare exchanges, McCarthy’s claim presents a narrow and misleading look at total insurance sign-ups under the federal health law. Even under the limited view, those foregoing insurance do not amount to "almost twice" the exchange sign-ups. Most notably, the congressman’s claim ignores the huge category of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Of the 20 million people who gained coverage under Obamacare through early 2016, about 14 million were under Medicaid. The data show about the same number of people declined coverage -- not "almost twice as many" -- as signed-up for Obamacare. We rate McCarthy’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-01678	The Milwaukee Police Department has seized nearly as many firearms this year as the much larger New York City Police Department.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/17/edward-flynn/edward-flynn-says-milwaukee-had-seized-many-firear/	In the wake of a shooting that wounded two children, ages 10 and 11, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn held a news conference and denounced the shooters as cowards. "We have remorseless, reckless criminals in possession of high-quality firearms shooting at each other, and they don't care who they hit," Flynn said of the July 23, 2014 shooting in the 2800 block of N. 37th St. As of that date, there had been 13 kids wounded in such shootings in 2014. One of those, Sierra Guyton, who was wounded in a playground shooting, later died. Flynn said getting firearms off the streets is a focus of his department’s efforts and then offered a statement that you don’t hear often when it comes to crime -- how efforts in Milwaukee compare favorably to New York City. "As of July 6th, the New York City Police Department had confiscated approximately 1,350 firearms from the streets of a city of 9 million," the chief said. "So far this year, the Milwaukee Police Department in a city of 600,000 -- 15 times smaller than New York -- has seized 1,340 firearms from the streets of this city." Are Milwaukee cops keeping pace with the NYPD when it comes to gun seizures? Let’s take a closer look. A visit from NYC brass When Flynn made the claim, New York’s numbers were top-of-mind. "Several NYPD executive level commanders were sent to Milwaukee by Commissioner (William) Bratton to study a variety of topics, including our methods of crime control, community relations, and accountability systems," said Lt. Mark Stanmeyer, Milwaukee Police Department spokesman. Indeed, the visit coincided with the day of the shooting and Flynn’s next-day news conference. When the topic of gun seizures was discussed at the get-together, New York officials said they had seized 1,350 firearms as of July 6, 2014, according to Stanmeyer. MPD officials saw that figure nearly matched theirs -- 1,347 seizures as of July 24, 2014. To be sure, the MIlwaukee figure included an extra two-plus weeks. But Flynn had a talking point. When we asked New York Police Department officials about guns seized, they were not able to provide the number for July 6, 2014 that was used by Flynn. But their data tracked with the figure Flynn used -- 1,289 firearms had been seized as of June 8, 2014 and 1,881 had been seized as of Aug. 10, 2014, according to department spokeswoman Sophia Mason. To get the comparison on the same time frame, the Milwaukee figure was 1,460 as of Aug. 10, 2014. In 2013, the department seized 1,921 guns. "I don’t believe the point the Chief was making about the population/gun recovery ratio is lost," Stanmeyer said in an email. "Even using the August 10 data, they only have 421 more guns with 7.7 million more people." He also noted that the Milwaukee figure does not include 353 firearms turned in during a gun buyback program last spring that was led by faith leaders. So what’s the explanation for the similar numbers? First, in New York the number of guns seized is down compared with last year. Bratton said in a June 10, 2014 report on Capitalnewyork.com that the number "in some respects is reflective of the fact that crime is continuing to go down." The numbers of murders, rapes and robberies also are lower than a year ago. "We’ve had an increase, a temporary increase, in shootings. ... Crime goes up, it goes down," Bratton said in the article. "It’s always going to go up at some point in time. We’ll always have the ability to push it down." Another factor could be at work in New York. New Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to reform the department’s long-standing and controversial stop-and-frisk policy where cops can detain, question and search people suspected of crimes. Even before de Blasio took office in January 2014, the number of stop and frisk stops had dropped sharply in the past two years. Law enforcement officials told the New York Post that such stops can be effective in obtaining illegal firearms. Our rating Flynn said his department’s gun seizures, through a mid-year point, were about to those of much-larger New York City. New York’s numbers may be down a bit this year, so other factors may be at work. But Flynn’s claim didn’t get into the reasons why. It was a straightforward numerical claim. We rate it True.

pomt-09401	The Iraq war has been "our longest war."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/23/bob-schieffer/schieffers-timely-reminder-iraq-war-has-one-tempor/	Though it escaped notice amid a blizzard of activity on health care reform, March 19 marked the seventh anniversary of the invasion that began the Iraq war. Host Bob Schieffer noted that milestone during the March 22, 2010, edition of CBS's Face the Nation. "March 19th was the seventh anniversary of the Iraq invasion, which began our longest war," he said. We wondered if it really has been America's longest war. We decided not to count the 46-year-long Cold War on the grounds that it belongs in a separate category. We also did not count situations in which U.S. military forces have remained in a long-term role long after the shooting has stopped, such as the U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea for the last 55 years. Finally, we ignored battles that are popularly called "wars" but are usually not fought on military terms, such as the "war on drugs." To Schieffer's credit, it's worth noting that the Iraq war has indeed been longer than many of the United States' most significant military conflicts: the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II and the Korean War. That's not an inconsequential milestone. But we found at least three wars that were longer than the Iraq War. One is the Revolutionary War, which by the official Defense Department reckoning lasted from 1775 to 1783, or about eight years. The second is of much more recent vintage. U.S. military operations in Afghanistan began on Oct. 7, 2001, and are still going on, more than eight years later. The third is Vietnam. This one is harder to date, because it ramped up slowly. But the official dating is from Aug. 5, 1964 (around the time of the Tonkin Gulf resolution) to May 7, 1975 (shortly after the fall of Saigon). That's more than 10 1/2 years. If you date it only until the Paris peace accords on Jan. 27, 1973, then it would be about 8 1/2 years. So, all three of these wars have strong claims for being longer than the Iraq war. It's worth noting that answering this question is more art than science. James Bradford, a Texas A&M historian, points out that the American Revolution may have begun with the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) -- or earlier, with the breakout of hostilities at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Meanwhile, the end of the war could have been the the British surrender at Yorktown (Oct. 17, 1781), the signing of the Treaty of Paris (September 1783), the ratification of the treaty by the Continental Congress (Jan. 14, 1784), the ratification by King George III of England (April 9, 1784) or the exchange of the ratification documents (May 12, 1784). Another problem: "It depends on how one conceptualizes a war," said Richard H. Kohn, a historian at the University of North Carolina. "Afghanistan could be considered simply a campaign of the 'war on terror' if one accepts that as a war, just as Korea and Vietnam could be considered campaigns of the Cold War rather than separate wars." Finally, no one knows when the Iraq War (or Afghanistan) will end. "Maybe [Schieffer] figures Iraq will be the longest by the time we eventually leave, which of course is still possible," said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla. So it's clear that this is not a black-and-white question. Still, we think there's enough evidence to say that the Iraq war was not America's "longest war." According to official Defense Department dating, the Revolutionary War, Vietnam and Afghanistan were (or are) all longer. So we rate Schieffer's statement False.

pomt-03681	"Schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/24/randi-weingarten/union-chief-criticizes-days-spent-testing/	Last month, 35 people, including former Superintendent Beverly Hall, were indicted for their alleged roles in a widespread test cheating scandal at Atlanta Public Schools. The educators are accused of a mix of charges involving altering -- or pressuring other educators to alter -- standardized test scores. Some of the accused then accepted bonus money based on the falsified test results. As the long line of defendants made the perp walk into the county jail, critics of standardized testing policies noted that scandals like Atlanta’s probably resulted partially from the pressure to succeed on standardized tests. "Standardized tests have a role in accountability, but today they dominate everything else and too often don’t even correlate to what students need to know to succeed," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, in a statement. "It is outrageous that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing." With students spending fewer than 200 days in school (Georgia requires at least 180 days in school; the national average requirement is about 178 days), the union chief’s claim could mean more than half the school year is spent on testing. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Weingarten’s number was correct and decided to take a closer look. Weingarten’s and the AFT’s spokesman, Scott Stephens, told us that the union chief’s statement was based on both factual reports as well as anecdotal evidence from the organization’s 1.5 million members nationwide. "While 100 days is on the high end, it’s clear that in many states, ‘up to 100 days’ is a pretty good estimate," he said. Stephens cited two reports to back up Weingarten’s claim. The first, from the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, includes findings from the Wisconsin Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development about the amount of time spent on testing in general and for students with special needs. The Wisconsin association found that Wisconsin teachers spent a per-district average of 976 hours administering tests. The data in that report is based on information collected in the 2005-2006 school year, and uses cumulative numbers instead of breaking down the information into the time spent per district or per school. The second report is a 2012 white paper by the Central Florida Public School Board Coalition. The group found that in Florida, students will spend at minimum nine weeks in kindergarten and up to 21 weeks of the school year in 10th grade on testing. Twenty-one, five-day weeks equate to 105 days, which satisfies Weingarten’s claim. Based on the data some school districts have presented, Weingarten’s claim is correct, said Robert Schaeffer, public education director for the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, also known as FairTest. That group has also been critical of standardized tests for the time and expense required by educators and school systems to administer them. Schaeffer’s organization does not track standardized testing days nationally, but has supported legislation in states like Washington, requiring school systems to post testing schedules so parents can see how much testing must be done. It is important to note that the testing numbers included in the studies are cumulative numbers. Not all students take the same tests at every grade level. And not all tests are administered the same number of days. Also some of the tests, like end-of-year exams, can be taken multiple times by some students, which would also impact the data. PolitiFact Texas has examined similar claims and found that statements made about the amount of standardized testing mandated for school systems was exaggerated, as not all grades or all students took tests on each of designated testing days. Test preparation is broad and could be considered everyday classroom standards, said Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Education. Test preparation can also differ by school. For example, Georgia administers three basic standardized tests. Simply adding up the available testing windows for the three easily exceeds 100 days, but provides a misleading statistic. Although the test windows cover numerous days, actual test administration days are much fewer. All three tests are not administered to all students on each available day. Also key, the tests do not take all day to complete. Unfortunately, there is no good, reliable national data involving this part of standardized testing, said Tom Loveless, director of the Brookings Institution’s Brown Center on Education Policy. (The Council of Chief State School Officers no longer tracks the data.) Also, what is designated as test prep can vary between educators, and could be construed as almost anything taught during the school year, as opposed to skills that would not regularly be taught, Loveless said. "And I think (Weingarten’s) statement points to an extreme example using questionable sources of evidence," he said. "The statement is quite vague and an exaggeration." So does the union chief’s claim get a passing grade? Weingarten said that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing. Upon initial review, basic testing calendars from some school districts bear out the claim. But a deeper delve into the data finds that not all students in each district take each test, tests are not administered each day during the multi-day testing windows, and in some cases, the tests do not cover an entire day. Weingarten allowed herself some latitude by using broad phrasing, such as "some districts" and "up to 100 days" in her claim. But the thrust of her statement is misleading, according to education experts. Weingarten’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rated the claim Mostly False. Staff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this article.	None	Randi Weingarten	None	None	None	2013-04-24T00:00:00	2013-04-02	['None']

pomt-14791	"Probably less than 4 percent" of Wisconsin residents "are enjoying the subsidies" from Obamacare.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/02/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-probably-less-4-percent-wisconsin-resi/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson isn’t shy about his dislike for the Affordable Care Act. So when conservative radio host Charlie Sykes asked him in an interview Nov. 5, 2015 for his take on what’s commonly known as Obamacare, Johnson was ready. "We haven’t heard a lot of Republicans talking about Obamacare," Sykes said. "I think that there was an assumption that, you know, once Obamacare was implemented, that people would just decide they like it, it would become entrenched, and therefore it would fade as a political issue. "That is just not happening, is it?" "Well," Johnson replied, "unless you are one of those individuals — in Wisconsin it’s probably less than 4 percent of the population — that are enjoying the subsidies, you’re getting harmed by Obamacare." In 2013, we checked a Johnson claim about Obamacare -- that premiums for "an average plan for a family didn’t go down by $2,500 per year, it’s gone up about $2,500 per year." We rated that Half True, as Johnson correctly cited rising premium costs, but experts said the evidence that Obamacare affected the increase was thin. Let’s see if he hit the numbers this time. Background on the system After the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, states could create their own marketplaces for health care or use the ones established by the federal government. Wisconsin is one of more than 30 states that chose to not set up its own online marketplace. Insurance subsidies are available under the law for people with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold who are not offered what is considered affordable health insurance through an employer. In 2015, that income level is $11,770 for an individual and $95,400 for a family of four in Wisconsin. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a provision of the ACA that helps low- and middle-income people buy health care in the federal marketplace with subsidies. That is the provision Johnson was referring to when he said "probably less than 4 percent" of Wisconsin residents "are enjoying the subsidies" from Obamacare. Looking at the subsidies When asked for backup for his claim, Johnson’s team pointed to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nationally respected authority on health care and population information. The Kaiser report pulled its data from a U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report on enrollment in Affordable Care Act marketplaces. It also shows the number of people receiving premium subsidies in each state as of March 31, 2015. How do the numbers break down for Wisconsin? According to the Kaiser report, 166,142 people received subsidies to help pay premiums as of March 2015. About 20,000 more Wisconsinites are enrolled in the marketplace, but don’t receive financial assistance. By this tally, 90.7 percent of those enrolled in ACA coverage in Wisconsin receive subsidies. The most recent Census Bureau estimate puts the state’s population at 5,757,564. By those numbers, 2.9 percent of Wisconsin residents are receiving the subsidies. For a national perspective, we turn to a PolitiFact Georgia fact check of a claim by Republican U.S. Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia. Scott claimed 97 percent of Americans do not receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act. The Kaiser report showed about 9 million people receive federal and state subsidies to buy insurance. In comparison to the estimated U.S. population of about 318 million, that’s just about 3 percent. Our rating Johnson said, "probably less than 4 percent" of Wisconsin residents "are enjoying the subsidies" from Obamacare. He calculated this figure based on enrollment data and Census Bureau population statistics. Those numbers put the figure at 2.9 percent. We rate the claim True.

pomt-06032	Says Mitt Romney "runs away from Ronald Reagan."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/13/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-ad-says-mitt-romney-runs-away-ronald/	In a web video released on Jan. 13, 2012, Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign took aim at "Massachusetts moderate" Mitt Romney, comparing him to fellow Bay State politicians (and Democratic presidential losers) Michael Dukakis and John Kerry and even taking him to task for being able to speak French. The ad fires a fusillade of shots designed to show that Romney is too liberal to be a Republican presidential nominee. We’ve chosen one of those claims to check. "What has Massachusetts given us?" the ad asks, offering grainy footage of Dukakis’ ill-fated tank ride during the 1988 campaign and Kerry’s windsurfing from 2004. The video goes on to describe Romney as "a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan," then cuts to a clip of Romney speaking during a debate while running for Senate in 1994. In the debate, Romney said, "Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." We have already looked at the question of Romney’s view of Reagan, a conservative icon, during a fact-check of a Democratic National Committee ad on Nov. 29, 2011. The DNC ad from 2011 juxtaposes two clips of Romney talking. The first was the same one later used in the Gingrich ad. The second showed Romney standing at a podium saying, "The principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them." The 1994 clip, which came during Romney’s bid to unseat the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, showed part of an exchange in which the two men had a philosophical discussion about poverty and families. Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claimed that child poverty rates rose when Republicans occupied the White House. "Under the Reagan-Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know we’ve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs," Kennedy said. "If you’re not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, you’re going to see the breakdown of the family as well." Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldn’t be used to score "political hits," prompting Romney to fire back that he wasn’t politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was. "I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all. I talked about what I’d do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush," Romney said, in a clear attempt to distance himself from the former president. In our fact-check of the DNC ad, we couldn’t find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan beyond the 1994 debate comment. Still, Romney did say it on live television, so we have no quarrel with the Gingrich campaign using it. The Gingrich ad also correctly identified it on-screen as having occurred in 1994, some 18 years ago. But we have a different problem with the Gingrich ad: It erred by using the present tense in the voice-over, saying that Mitt Romney "runs away from Ronald Reagan." To us, that means that Romney is still distancing himself from Reagan. And that’s definitely not the case. Consider the second clip in the DNC ad, in which Romney was speaking at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., in May 2010. He was talking about America’s position in the world. "I have to tell you that I’m optimistic. I’m optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them." After some applause, Romney continued by elaborating on Reagan-like policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased "that wonderful line" of Reagan’s: "(Reagan) said, ‘Of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong.’ And he’s absolutely right," Romney said. We found other examples of Romney's fealty to Reagan's legacy: • During his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bush’s tax cuts. "That's failing Reagan 101," Romney said, essentially holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire. • In a debate that year, he was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, "I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan." • When he proposed a detailed economic plan last year, Romney included a provision for a new "Reagan Economic Zone," an international free-trade area designed to reward nations that have "embraced free enterprise and open markets." • On Dec. 16, 2011, at a Fox News-sponsored debate, Romney referred to Reagan in explaining his change of heart on abortion. Both Romney and Reagan started off favoring abortion rights before shifting to an anti-abortion stance. "I've learned over time, like Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and others, my experience in life over, what, 19 -- 17, 18, 19 years has told me that sometimes I was wrong," Romney said. "Where I was wrong, I've tried to correct myself." • On Dec. 15, 2011, the Romney campaign unveiled a group called "Reaganites for Romney," featuring officials who served in political or policy roles during the Reagan Administration. "These individuals were part of a movement that changed America and the rest of the world," said Romney. "The smaller government policies of the Reagan era helped turn around a struggling economy and create millions of jobs. And the strong defense of freedom around the world led to the crumbling of empires and dictatorships. I am proud to announce this group of conservative leaders – with their help we can recreate the robust job creation of the Reagan years." Our ruling Ginrgich’s ad contains a grain of truth: In one televised debate 18 years ago, Romney distanced himself from Reagan and his policies. But more recently, Romney has had only kind words to say about the Gipper. When the DNC charged that Romney had flip-flopped on his support for Reagan’s policies, we ruled that charge Mostly True. In this case, though, we don’t think Romney’s long-ago discomfort with Reagan-era policies justifies the Gingrich ad’s claim that Romney is "a Massachusetts moderate who runs away from Ronald Reagan." We rate it Mostly False.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-01-13T17:36:34	2012-01-13	['None']

pomt-10959	Says a poll showed Democrat Beto O’Rourke within 2 percentage points of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/jul/20/republican-party-texas/texas-poll-ted-cruz-leads-beto-orourke-2-points-pe/	A recent Republican pitch opened: "The Democrats are unhinged." We can't fact-check that opinion. But the July 2018 email blast soliciting donations to the Republican Party of Texas also quoted the party’s Stephen Wong saying that a new poll shows the Democratic U.S. Senate nominee, U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, running very close behind Republican Sen. Ted Cruz -- the Houston lawyer who won the seat in 2012 by nearly 16 percentage points. Wong wrote: "You’ve probably seen how" ecstatic "the far-left has been the last 24 hours. First there was a poll showing Francis ‘Beto’ O’Rourke within 2pts(!) of Senator Cruz." Then, Wong said, O’Rourke reported raising more money than Cruz in the year’s second quarter. From April through June 2018, O’Rourke’s campaign again outraised Cruz’s effort. And did a recent poll show O’Rourke closely trailing Cruz? Party notes poll touted by liberal blogger To our inquiry, Kyle Whatley, the party’s executive director, pointed out a July 10, 2018, post on the Politicus website quoting Markos Moulitsas, founder of the liberal Daily Kos blog, saying in a tweet that data collected by Civiqs, a division of the Moulitsas-founded Kos Media, shows that O’Rourke "now trails Ted Cruz by only 2" percentage points, "48-46." When Civiqs launched an online "dashboard" in March 2018, spotlighting its polls such as one gauging President Donald Trump’s job approval, Moulitsas wrote: "Daily Kos is a partisan outfit. Civiqs has its own mission, and that is to represent the state of public opinion accurately." In July 2018, Moulitsas showcased the Texas poll’s Cruz-O’Rourke results in another tweet: SOURCE: Tweet by Markos Moulitsas, July 9, 2018 The illustration says registered voters responded to this question: "If the election for U.S. senator from Texas were held today, and the choices were Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke who would you vote for?" In reply, 48 percent said Cruz, 46 percent replied O’Rourke and the remaining 6 percent split between supporting someone else or being unsure, the illustration says. According to the illustration, the result was based on 12,379 responses gathered from Feb. 16, 2017-July 4, 2018--or more than 17 months. Poll confirmed by firm To our inquiry, the director of Civiqs, Drew Linzer, told us the poll showing O’Rourke just behind Cruz, available to Civiqs subscribers, was accurately portrayed by Moulitsas. By email, Linzer further said the poll, not commissioned or sponsored by a client, relied on responses since February 2017 from respondents engaged over the web as volunteers for Civiqs survey panels who self-identified as Texas residents and registered voters. Civiqs says in the methodology section of its website that it maintains a growing "nationally representative opt-in online survey panel, or list of Americans who have agreed to take polls at civiqs.com. Panelists reside in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and match the contours of the United States along key geographic, demographic and ideological lines," Civiqs says. We asked Linzer, a former political scientist at Emory University, to talk about relying on responses collected over more than 17 months. "The lengthy timeframe," Linzer replied, "enables Civiqs to perform long-term daily tracking in a sustainable, methodologically rigorous manner." Civiqs, he said, applies "specialized trendline fitting statistical models" to ensure the results match current public opinion. Linzer said by phone that for the Texas poll, Civiqs emailed 40 to 50 respondents a day, asking each one about their Texas residence and registered voter status and stance on the Senate candidates, with those results over time feeding the trend line. As of July 4, 2018, the latest date shown on the trend line posted by Moulitsas, "the most recent day’s worth of data has the greatest impact on the result," Linzer said, though responses from previous days mattered a lot too, he said. Linzer said responses gathered in 2017 also contributed to the result, but only "infinitesimally so." "It’s complicated. It is a little different from what a traditional pollster does" in reaching one set of respondents over a few consecutive days, Linzer said. Broadly, Linzer said, "I want to report what our data indicates, where public opinion is today. I also want to calculate where public opinion has been on every day leading up to today. In order to do that, I take all the data we’ve collected and put it into our statistical model," generating trend lines. Cruz pollster raises flags We also reached out to the Senate campaigns about the poll claim. O’Rourke’s camp didn’t offer a comment. But Chris Wilson, who conducts polls for Cruz’s campaign, drew on a Moulitsas-tweeted illustration breaking out the demographics of the results to suggest by phone that Republican respondents to the poll outnumbered Democrats by insufficient percentage points. Linzer separately told us the results imply that 31 percent of respondents identified as Democrats, 36 percent as Republicans and 33 percent as independents. Wilson said that considering Republicans’ prevalence in statewide races since 1994, any poll projecting fall results should query more Republicans--perhaps making the sample 40 percent Republican, 30 percent Democratic and 20 percent independent. Linzer said that the poll reflected the partisan mix of Texas registered voters. Wilson also questioned the idea that 3 percent of respondents remained undecided some four months before Election Day. "There’s no race in America right now that only has 3 percent undecided," Wilson said. A Texas pollster's analysis We also asked Jeff Smith of Austin, a longtime Democratic pollster, to review the poll. Smith commented by email that the trend lines attributed to the poll "make sense; they may be on top of a trend. They have a good track record." Smith offered a disclaimer, though, about depending on panels of people opting in to participate online. "Just as traditional telephone polling excluded those without phones, online surveys exclude those who don’t opt in," Smith wrote. "I would expect that group (the opt-in’s) to be somewhat more attuned to politics than the electorate at large. Second (again, as with traditional polling), the target demographic profile incorporates assumptions about turnout. If they use the all registered voters profile, for example, they are assuming that Hispanics will turn out in the same proportions as others. "That said," Smith closed, "I don’t see any reason not to use them as a credible polling source." Close match-up? Other Texas polls haven’t suggested a 2-point margin in the race though a couple taken since April 2018 came close. Daron Shaw, a University of Texas government professor and pollster, responded to us by email that the Civiqs poll aside, "one could claim that the margin of error surrounding some of the public polls is consistent with the spirit (if not the precise number) of the email" blast from the Texas GOP. Texas polls summarized on the Real Clear Politics website as of mid-July 2018 showed Cruz leading by three to 11 percentage points. The most recent three polls, all taken since June 2018, showed Cruz ahead by five, nine and 10 percentage points. SOURCE: Web post, "Texas Senate - Cruz vs. O'Rourke," Real Clear Politics, undated (accessed July 16, 2018) Shaw led us to notice that the April 2018 Quinnipiac survey showing Cruz ahead by 3 percentage points had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. "So the result is really as follows: if we did 100 polls, 95 of them would show Cruz between 43 and 51, and O’Rourke between 40 and 48. The margin thus varies between Cruz +11 and O’Rourke +5," Shaw wrote. Similarly, Shaw said, the margin of error in the latest UT/Texas Tribune poll, taken in June 2018, can be read as placing Cruz up between 2 and 8 points. Still, Shaw wrote, six public polls taken since spring 2018 show Cruz prevailing by as many as 11 points. "The chances of this happening if O’Rourke is actually winning is statistically infinitesimal," Shaw said. Another note: After the April 2018 Quinnipiac results came out, Joshua Blank and Jim Henson of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin suggested that historically, spring polls showing closer-than-expected races haven’t played out in November balloting. The pair compiled statewide polling results from April through July for Texas elections going back to 2010 for president, senator and governor. The two concluded that Cruz’s lead in April 2018 wasn’t as stout as one might expert given that Republicans in the past races were leading polls at comparable points by 9 percentage points on average. Still, they wrote, "there's little evidence from the eventual election results that Cruz's lead isn't likely to grow." "The obvious caveat," Blank and Henson said, "is that historical data is good for predicting outcomes where the present can be reasonably said to resemble the past." Our ruling The Republican Party of Texas said a recent poll showed O’Rourke within 2 percentage points of Cruz. Through July 4, 2018, Civiqs says, its polling of Texas registered voters placed Cruz with 48 percent support and O’Rourke with 46 percent. It’s worth clarifying, though, that the results were rooted in respondents who opted in to be surveyed online by a company whose owners include a liberal political blogger.

pomt-13818	Says Gary Farmer’s claim that he "received an 'A' from the NRA" is "an absolute lie."	true	/florida/statements/2016/jul/15/jim-waldman/state-senate-candidate-never-actually-received-rat/	In a duel for state Senate, two Democrats are battling over bad grades. Jim Waldman, a former four-term House member from Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, sees a bad grade from the National Rifle Association as a selling point. But Parkland lawyer Gary Farmer, his well-funded primary challenger for the newly redrawn District 34 seat, calls it a false advertisement. (Rep. Gwyndolen Clarke-Reed is also in the race.) Farmer’s campaign sent out emails and fliers claiming Waldman received an A grade from the NRA. You can see how this might be a problem for a Democrat in a heavily Democratic district like Fort Lauderdale. Waldman says it's not just a problem — it's wrong. He accused Farmer of being the liar, holding up his D from the NRA in 2010 and his voting record on gun legislation in the Florida House. "Unfortunately, a political committee led by Gary Farmer is spreading lies about my record on guns," Waldman wrote in an email to his campaign subscribers. "They’re spending tens of thousands of dollars mailing a FALSE claim to voters that I received an ‘A’ from the NRA." He continued: "Check the report card. Their claim is an absolute lie." With both camps taking aim, PolitiFact Florida stepped into the ring. Throwing punches This fight started in early July, when Farmer’s campaign sent a mailer to residents of District 34 that said Waldman received an A from the NRA in 2010. In addition to fliers, Farmer also sent an email that claimed Waldman received an A rating for six years. This email included a screenshot from the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, which gives grades to politicians based on their support for Second Amendment rights. It also cited Project Vote Smart, a website that aggregates candidate information. Farmer spokesman Jay Shannon said the NRA screenshot was captured July 1. Farmer’s camp also showed us another screenshot from Project Vote Smart showing Waldman with an A in 2010 (and an F in 2008). PolitiFact was able to confirm the Vote Smart screenshot through the Wayback Machine, which archives web pages from the Internet. Shortly after the Farmer campaign took these screenshots, the campaign claims the grade changed from an A to a D on the NRA’s subscriber-only website. After the NRA changed its grade, Waldman spokeswoman Ashley Walker called Project Vote Smart to report an error on their site, and it also changed the grade from an A to a D on July 11. Project Vote Smart aggregates information from other organizations, so it makes sense it would change the grade if the NRA’s website reflected something different. But why did the NRA’s grade change in the first place? Farmer’s email suggests it was an inside job, claiming friends of Waldman in the NRA changed it on his behalf. But he has no proof to back this up, and the NRA tells a different story. Marion Hammer, the former president of the NRA and the executive director of the Unified Sportsmen of Florida, said Waldman never received an A from the NRA. Hammer said the NRA noticed the 2010 grade was listed as an A sometime this year, and changed it back to a D. "Anyone who knows anything about Jim Waldman should know he would never get an A from (the) NRA and should be suspicious enough to check it out before using it," she said. Waldman has typically voted not to expand gun rights during his tenure in the House, with a few exceptions. In 2014, Waldman voted yes on two bills supported by the NRA. One bill, dubbed the "Pop-Tart" bill, relaxed Florida’s zero-tolerance policy in schools by prohibiting administrators from disciplining children for playing with simulated weapons. The bill passed 97-17, with 25 Democrats crossing party lines to vote for it. The other bill Waldman supported was the 2014 "warning shot" bill, partly inspired by Marissa Alexander, who was convicted in 2012 of three counts of deadly assault after firing a shot in the direction of her estranged husband and two of his children. She was sentenced to 20 years. Farmer described this bill as expanding Florida’s "stand your ground" law, but some law enforcement agencies said it actually made the law more difficult to enforce. This bill passed in the House 92-24, with 18 Democrats in favor. Hammer emphasized that the NRA changed the grade to correct the record, adding the NRA would never change grades as favors to candidates, no matter if they are aligned with the organization’s views or not. The real proof, she said, is in the magazines that the NRA Political Victory Fund sends out during election time (which can’t be hacked). According to the NRA’s 2006-12 Florida report cards, these are Waldman’s grades: 2012 D 2010 D 2008 F 2006 N/A (Waldman did not respond to an NRA questionnaire) Waldman hasn’t returned the questionnaire for 2016, either, and will probably receive a D again for 2016, Hammer said. We never got a clear explanation as to why the grade was posted incorrectly in the first place. Hammer said she was not going to investigate the issue further, calling it a waste of "effort and energy in order to settle a dispute between two anti-gun Democrats." Our ruling Waldman said Farmer’s claim that he "received an A from the NRA" is "an absolute lie." Screenshots show the grade for Waldman was once listed as an A, but spokespersons for the NRA said that information was wrongly listed (and they don't know why). The NRA made it clear that Waldman would never would receive an A, has only received a D or F in previous races, and did not change the grade for his benefit. Waldman’s claim is accurate. So we rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84c66d52-2a74-4911-9c33-7a6834ffe5e1	None	Jim Waldman	None	None	None	2016-07-15T13:54:14	2016-07-08	['None']

pomt-10172	"He has asked for $932-million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he’s been in the United States Senate."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/mccain-right-on-amount-of-obamas-pork-requests/	Sen. John McCain has a long reputation as an opponent of pork-barrel spending, those billions of dollars for local projects earmarked quietly every year into massive federal spending bills. In the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008, McCain said Sen. Barack Obama, in his relatively brief senatorial career, has asked for $932-million in pork for his home state of Illinois. Just to be sure everyone heard it, McCain cited the number three times. "He has asked for $932-million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly $1-million dollars for every day that he’s been in the United States Senate," McCain said. In response, Obama noted, correctly, that he has eschewed any pork spending for fiscal 2009. Said Obama: "Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up." McCain shot back that Obama did not suspend his requests for pork-barrel projects until after he was running for president, and then reminded viewers of that number again. "He didn’t happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932-million in requests," McCain said. And in case you missed it the first two times, McCain cited the number yet again a few minutes later. "And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932-million worth of pork-barrel spending projects." We should note that PolitiFact has found that while McCain has a well-deserved reputation in Washington as a pork-buster, his record is not entirely pristine. For example, McCain in 2006 co-sponsored legislation that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona to honor the late United States chief justice William Rehnquist. But as for his claim in the debate: Is it accurate? Obama, on his Web site, has listed every earmark he’s requested – but not necessarily received – as a U.S. senator. It totals $931.3-million. McCain is also correct that it comes to nearly a million dollars for every day that Obama’s been in the United States Senate, provided you include just working days. The math goes like this: Obama was elected in 2004 and took office January 3, 2005. Since then, there have been about 930 working days, as they are defined by most people, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, which would mean McCain would be completely right if he had specified working days. Technically, Obama's been "in Congress" for more than 1,350 days, if you count weekends. So how many points do you take off for McCain not saying "every working day"? Not many. We say this claim is Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-26T00:00:00	2008-09-26	['None']
pomt-11140	"Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress" and "voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/may/31/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-misleads-lobbyist-attack-jim-renacci/	U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s first TV attack ad portrays his opponent U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci as a fan of lobbyists working in government. "The U.S. Congress. There’s 68 teachers, 15 farmers, four pilots but only one lobbyist," says the narrator as a cash register cha-ching sound is heard in the background. "That's right, Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress. And what's he done? He voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest." Text on the screen shows this is a reference to the 112th Congress. That timeframe refers to January 2011 to January 2013. Democrats have long portrayed Renacci as a lobbyist. But what this ad omits is that while he was registered to lobby, there is no evidence he actually lobbied. And in fact, it wouldn’t make sense for a member of Congress to work as a lobbyist at the same time. The ad also gives viewers no context about the votes cited. Brown is one of several Democratic incumbents defending a seat in a state that Donald Trump won in 2016. Trump endorsed Renacci during the primary. ‘Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress’ Before being elected to Congress, Renacci primarily worked in the private sector. He owned and operated over 60 entities, according to his Congressional biography, including nursing facilities, a CPA firm, real estate and auto dealerships. (He later said it was his experience losing his dealership in the auto industry bailout when General Motors closed his dealership that prompted him to run for Congress.) He also served as president on the Wadsworth City Council and then served as mayor from 2004 to 2008. In 2008, Renacci and two other individuals registered as lobbyists for Smokehouse International Group LTD, named for Smokerise Drive, the street on which Renacci and other partners had offices. They intended to lobby in areas including defense, aviation, homeland security, and trade, according to their Senate lobbyist registration forms. Renacci filed documents with the House a handful of times between 2008 and 2011 stating that he gave no political contributions while a lobbyist. His campaign spokesman, James Slepian, said that it was a mistake to file the forms since he wasn’t lobbying and that it was handled by a lawyer. Slepian told us previously that two business associates wanted to form the firm and Renacci agreed to help because of his background as a CPA. The firm "never got off the ground," Slepian said, "but as a precautionary measure, one of the partners registered all three of them as lobbyists, just in case they ever took on any lobbying clients." Brown’s campaign pointed to his lobbyist registration and a March article by the Associated Press. The AP quoted Renacci’s attorney, Laura Mills, as stating that Renacci never lobbied. She said that he asked her office to deactivate his lobbyist registration in 2009 before he entered Congress. But the AP found that Mills didn't file the companion form required to deactivate Renacci's registration until 2011, a few months after he took office. Members of Congress can’t lobby Congress or the executive branch on behalf of any private organization or individual "as that would conflict with a Member‘s general obligation to the public," according to the House Ethics manual. In addition to it being banned, it defies logic that as a House member Renacci would want to lobby himself and his colleagues as a lobbyist. As a member, he already had the power to draft legislation and seek support from other members for his priorities. Renacci ‘voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest’ This part of the ad references two votes by Renacci. The first one is fairly circuitous. The campaign pointed to Renacci’s vote on a procedural maneuver related to HR 921 on Nov. 16, 2016. The resolution related to a bill to ban U.S. bank transactions in connection with export of commercial aircraft to Iran. The resolution passed, with all of the Republicans voting in favor and all of the Democrats voting against it. If the resolution had been defeated, then the minority party — the Democrats — would have had the opportunity to decide what legislation to consider next. On the Democrats’ plate: the No Lobbyists on Presidential Transition Teams Act, HR 6324. That bill, introduced by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., would have prohibited the use of funds to the president-elect "for any services or facilities provided by registered lobbyists." The bill was in response to a move by Trump to put lobbyists in his transition team. The ad doesn’t explain that Renacci never took a direct vote on lobbyist bill -- in fact, it never received any vote. Joshua Huder, a senior fellow in the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown, said that the Brown ad is relying on a hypothetical scenario about a tenuous connection. Members in the majority rarely vote "no" on a previous question because that would be handing off power to the minority. That’s something that leadership strongly discourages. The ad also cited Renacci’s vote in favor of a change to House Ethics Rules on Jan. 6, 2015. The vote passed along partisan lines: All of the Democrats voted against it, while all but four Republicans voted for it. The new rules proposed by Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., said that a person who is a subject to a preliminary or second-phase review by the Office of Congressional Ethics shall be informed of the right to counsel and that the person’s constitutional rights can’t be denied. Slepian said that Renacci "believes in due process as enshrined in our Constitution and this measure was brought forth to ensure that due process rights are not eroded by bodies within our government." The rule change drew objections in 2015 from Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. At the time, he felt the rules would inhibit the ethics committee’s investigations. But now that more three years have passed, Holman told PolitiFact that the House rules didn’t "seem to have made much of a difference." Our ruling Brown’s TV ad said, "Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress" and "voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest." Renacci misfiled paperwork about his lobbying activities, but there’s no convincing evidence he actually worked as a lobbyist while a member of Congress. The statement about a vote to help lobbyists hold government positions was not a direct vote. The ad is using circuitous logic on this point. Another vote involved a rule change that drew concerns from a government watchdog at the time, but the watchdog told PolitiFact that it ultimately didn’t make much difference. The statement omits critical evidence that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-01554	Says Mitch McConnell voted "three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/12/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-ad-says-mitch-mcconnell-vo/	Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic Senate candidate from Kentucky, says that as Mitch McConnell’s wealth has grown, he has hindered Kentucky’s prosperity. Recently, we looked at an ad in which Grimes said McConnell, the incumbent Senate minority leader, made millions while in public office. We rated that claim Mostly False. But that was only one of several claims in the ad that attacked McConnell for being out-of-touch with average Kentuckians and biased toward the wealthy. Another claim caught our attention: McConnell voted "three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas." We’ve noticed that this claim -- that a candidate voted for tax breaks that send jobs overseas -- is a trending talking point among Democratic candidates, and we’ve found that often the claim is simplistic and misleading. So we decided to see whether or not Grimes’ claim about McConnell stacks up. The votes The ad makes it sound as if McConnell voted three times to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing specifically. This is not the case. For evidence for its claims, the Grimes campaign pointed us to information on their website. All three "no" votes were on legislation that sought to close already-existing corporate tax deductions. These deductions did not pertain to outsourcing specifically because under current law, there is no special provision that gives corporations a deduction or any kind of tax break for moving employees out of the country. McConnell’s first "no" vote was in 2010 on the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. The second and third "no" votes were on the Bring Jobs Home Act, which was proposed in 2012 and again in 2014. These votes, split almost exclusively along party lines, were on procedural measures that ultimately prevented the bills from receiving a final passage vote. Both laws would have given a tax benefit to companies that insource jobs and denied an already-existing tax break to companies that outsource them. The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isn’t a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California. Tax experts we spoke with said the law was almost entirely symbolic. The amount of money associated with these standard deductions is minuscule, compared to corporate tax revenue overall. So minuscule, in fact, that getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a company’s decision to engage in foreign activity. "It adds up to a trivial amount of money," said James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan. "Given how many big multinational firms we have, it’s impossible that it has any effect on their behavior." Eliminating standard deductions for costs associated with outsourcing would result in an average $14.2 million a year in revenue, according to Joint Committee on Taxation estimates. That’s not much in the grand scheme of things. For some perspective, the Internal Revenue Service took in $273.5 billion in corporate income taxes in 2013 alone, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group, based on Office of Management and Budget data. Revenue from eliminating that deduction would amount to 0.005 percent of total revenue. Among Republicans’ reasons for opposing the Bring Jobs Home Act, the policy would have lost revenue and added to the deficit, according to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation. The government would have spent more money on the tax credit for insourcing than it would have raised by eliminating deductions related to outsourcing. Overall, the policy would have resulted in an estimated $214 million loss over 10 years. Our ruling Grimes said McConnell voted "three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas." The ad makes it seem like McConnell voted to approve corporate tax breaks that incentivize outsourcing. Actually, he voted "no" on legislation that would have eliminated the standard business expense deductions -- which exist for all businesses -- for costs associated with outsourcing. (Current law includes no provision that specifically addresses insourcing or outsourcing.) These bills had little chance of passing, and they were largely symbolic. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06449	President Obama’s uncle and aunt "are illegal aliens ... who've been allowed to stay in this country."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/20/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-links-obama-relatives-immigration/	It’s a time-honored tactic to bring up a political foe’s family foibles. Jimmy Carter’s alcoholic brother. Bill Clinton’s brother’s drug arrest. Now the target is President Barack Obama and his Kenyan relatives, and the person taking aim is Michele Bachmann. The Minnesota congresswoman who is running for president mentioned Obama’s family members in answering a question about immigration policy during a Republican primary debate. "Well, I think the person who really has a problem with illegal immigration in the country is President Obama. It's his uncle and his aunt who are illegal aliens... who've been allowed to stay in this country, despite the fact that they're illegal," Bachmann said, according to a transcript of the Oct. 18, 2011, debate. Bachmann’s campaign didn’t respond when we asked what the basis was for this claim, but stories about Obama’s aunt and uncle have been in the news plenty this year. In October 2008, the Boston Globe tracked down Zeituni Onyango, believed to be Obama’s paternal aunt, living in a public housing project. Obama’s presidential campaign soon confirmed their relationship. Onyango is the half-sister of Obama’s late father. Then came the news, reported by the Associated Press, that Onyango had previously been ordered to leave the country by an immigration judge who denied her request, based on violence in her home country, for political asylum. That meant she was no longer in the U.S. legally. The Obama campaign responded that the candidate had no knowledge of Onyango’s immigration status. Within days, Obama was elected president. Onyango’s request for asylum was reopened in December 2008, and she won a 10-month reprieve. After several more court hearings, a judge granted her asylum in May 2010. The White House said it had not intervened in the case, while critics charged that such an outcome was rare for most illegal residents. The Globe reported later that the judge had based his decision on the fact that Onyango’s immigration status had been leaked to the media, which exposed her to heightened threats of persecution in Kenya. This year, it was an Obama uncle who made news. Onyango Obama, the brother of Zeituni Onyango and the president’s late father, was arrested in August in Framingham, Mass., on a suspicion of drunk driving. The Boston Globe, citing an arrest report, said Obama first told the officer he had not had anything to drink, then admitted to one beer and then to two beers. He failed three sobriety tests and had a blood alcohol level of .14, the paper said. The legal limit in Massachusetts is 0.08. When offered a phone call, the paper quoted from the report that Obama replied, "I think I’d like to call the White House.’’ He was also held on an immigration detainer. The Globe cited anonymous federal law enforcement sources who said immigration authorities discovered that Obama had been living and working in Massachusetts in violation of a 1992 deportation order. "Uncle Omar," as the president knows him, first came to the U.S. in 1963 and enrolled in school in Cambridge, Mass., the Globe wrote. After being held for about two weeks, the 67-year-old Obama was released from jail with little explanation from officials. A White House spokesman said the administration expected the case to be handled like any other and that the elder Obama would not receive any special help. One of the elder Obama’s lawyers -- from the same firm who helped his sister -- said he planned to fight deportation. "He's just been here for such a long period of time. He hasn't been to Kenya in forever. He was young when he came to the United States," attorney Scott Bratton told the Boston Globe. Obama has pleaded not guilty in the drunken driving case, which is still pending. Our ruling Bachmann said, "I think the person who really has a problem with illegal immigration in the country is President Obama. It's his uncle and his aunt who are illegal aliens... who've been allowed to stay in this country, despite the fact that they're illegal." It’s true that the president’s aunt and uncle were both in the U.S. illegally at one time, But Zeituni Onyango was granted asylum in May 2010 and is no longer in the U.S. illegally.

pomt-04203	"The poverty level in" the Dallas school district "is one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/dec/05/dan-micciche/dallas-school-board-member-says-poverty-among-dall/	In a November 2012 opinion article, a member of the Dallas school board touted a breakfast-in-the-classroom program for heading off student hunger. Dan Micciche, writing in the Dallas Morning News, also spoke to poverty in Dallas: "The poverty level in" the Dallas school district "is one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark." Like some other urban Texas counties, Dallas County is home to more than 10 school districts. Similarly, the Houston district is among more than 20 Harris County districts. So we figured Micciche was not speaking to poverty across Big D. But is child poverty in the Dallas district super-high? By email, Micciche pointed us to a chart in a January 2012 report on school breakfast programs by the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit that focuses on reducing hunger among poor Americans. The chart lists the share of students in 26 large urban school districts determined to be eligible for federally supported free- and reduced-price school meals in a recent school year. The intent, the report says, was to look at the "largest school districts in a substantial number of states." Students who qualify for the meal assistance do not have to be living below the federal poverty level. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the poverty level are eligible for free meals, while children from families with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level are eligible for reduced‐price meals, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture fact sheet. For the year running through June 2013, 130 percent of the poverty level is $29,965 for a family of four; 185 percent is $42,643, the sheet says. In 2010-11, the report chart indicates, the Dallas district had a greater share of students eligible for free- and reduced-price meals than districts serving New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark. Specifically, 88.2 percent of the Dallas district’s students were eligible for free- or reduced-price meals, 83.5 percent for free meals. Among the cited others, the Detroit district ranked second with 84.3 percent of students eligible for free- or reduced-price meals, 82.1 percent for free meals. Micciche’s other mentioned districts fell out in this order: Chicago, Newark, Houston, Los Angeles and New York, where 64 percent qualified for free- or reduced-price meals. Among all the sampled districts, the Memphis and Oklahoma City districts had greater shares of students eligible for free- or reduced-price meals than the Dallas district. Next, we looked for a more precise breakdown of children living in--not just above--poverty. The government determines who lives in poverty by comparing annual income to dollar values called thresholds--updated annually for inflation--varied by family size, number of children and age of householder, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If a family’s before-tax money income is less than the dollar value of their threshold, then that family is considered to be in poverty. For people not living in families, poverty status is determined by comparing the individual’s own income to his or her threshold. The poverty levels are not adjusted for regional differences in the cost of living. Census spokesman Robert Bernstein helped us compare child poverty, based on tax filings and other records, within the Dallas district to child poverty in the six other districts. Some 47 percent of children in the Detroit district lived at or below the poverty level in 2010, according to the bureau, compared to nearly 38 percent of children in the Dallas district. Smaller shares of students lived in poverty in the other districts. A center researcher, Madeleine Levin, informed of this breakdown, cautioned by phone that the government’s poverty threshold is less restrictive than the income hurdles for the school meal programs. "You’re comparing apples to oranges," she said. "Totally different numbers." Micciche agreed, further speculating that the bureau’s estimates swept in children living within the bounds of districts but not attending public school. "That’s not my point," he said by phone. "The students who are in our schools come from a high-poverty population." Finally, we looked at figures for student eligibility for free- and reduced-price lunches in 2010-11 as compiled by the U.S Department of Education on its Elementary/Secondary Information System. Resulting percentages varied, sometimes considerably, from the survey results cited by Micciche. The Dallas and Newark districts had the greatest share of students eligible for the programs, about 87 percent total, followed by the Detroit district, at 80 percent. The Newark district had a much lower student enrollment, 33,812, compared to 157,143 students shown for the Dallas district. Levin told us the discrepancies may reflect the fact that the federal counts drew on figures dating to October 2010 while the center drew on responses from food service departments submitted in fall 2011. At any rate, Levin said, both data sources indicate a high level of poverty among students in the Dallas schools. The Dallas school board voted in late November 2012 to offer breakfasts in the classroom across the district, according to Dora Rivas, who directs the district’s Food and Child Nutrition department. The breakfasts will be phased in starting in 2013-14. Our ruling Micciche said the poverty level in the Dallas school district "is one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark." The poverty level is among the highest, though it looks like a greater share of Detroit students was living at or below poverty in 2010 and data collected by the federal government suggests that as of October 2010, the Dallas district was tied with the considerably smaller Newark district with nearly nine in 10 students eligible for free- or reduced-price meals. Then again, a more recent survey of school districts indicates Dallas had the greatest share of students qualified for the meal programs that year. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

pomt-12549	"African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Florida’s death row."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/apr/17/randolph-bracy/florida-lawmaker-says-african-americans-are-grossl/	The decision by Orlando-area prosecutor Aramis D. Ayala to no longer seek the death penalty in murder cases has injected a racial discussion about death row into the Florida legislative session. Ayala, a Democrat elected as state attorney in 2016, announced her decision while handling the case of Markeith Loyd, who is accused of killing his ex-girlfriend and an Orlando police officer. Scott removed Ayala from the Loyd case as well as 21 additional first-degree murder cases and reassigned them to Brad King, a Republican state attorney. Sen. Randolph Bracy, an Orange County Democrat and chairman of the Florida Senate Criminal Justice Committee, defended Ayala’s right to make that call and criticized Gov. Rick Scott’s reaction in an op-ed in the New York Times. "As a black man, I see the death penalty as a powerful symbol of injustice in which race often determines who lives and who dies, especially in Florida," Bracy wrote. "The state has the second-largest number of death row inmates in the country, after California, and African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Florida’s death row." Related: Did the U.S. Supreme Court ban all state laws that make executions mandatory for murderers? We decided to look at the statistics and see if they back up Bracy’s statement. Florida’s death row statistics Sheer numbers don’t say very much about racial discrepancies of death row inmates. (There are more white inmates than black inmates among the 371 members of Florida’s death row.) Bracy’s point about overrepresentation compares African-American inmates on death row compared to African-Americans’ share of the general population. African-Americans in Florida comprise about 17 percent of the population, according to the 2015 census. But they make up about 39 percent of the death row population. Based on the data, African-Americans make up twice as large of a share of death row inmates as a share of the state population. Other ways to crunch it There is a lot of research that shows racial disparities in sentencing for death penalty cases, in Florida and around the country. The leader of a pro-death penalty group quibbled with Bracy’s point, saying it disregards the race of people who commit homicides. Michael Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, said more African-Americans are convicted of homicide. "There are far fewer women than men on Florida's death row; this does not indicate a bias against men, it indicates a disproportionate percent of men who commit capital murder compared to women," he said. The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that nationally between 1980-2008, 52.5 percent of homicide convicts were African-American while 45.3 percent were white. In 2015, 36.7 percent of homicide convicts were African-American while 30.2 percent were white. "The difference between the makeup of death row and the makeup of the general population is attributable to the difference in offending rates, not bias in the system," said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. Evidence for racial disparities Studies show sentencing in death penalty cases often depends more heavily on the race of the victim than the killer. No white person has ever been executed for killing a black person, said Michael Radelet, a University of Colorado professor who has studied death penalty sentencing in Florida. In a 1991 study, Radelet (then at the University of Florida) found the odds of a death sentence for those who kill white people are about 3.4 times higher than for those who kill African-Americans in Florida. "All the research in Florida has found that the race of the victim is a more powerful predictor of death sentencing than the race of the defendant...," he told PolitiFact Florida. "It is true that every homicide cases is different, but even after looking at roughly similar cases (multiple murders, murders that have accompanying felony circumstances, etc.) we find the patterns of bias." Brandon L. Garrett, a University of Virginia School of Law, reached a similar conclusion in his research at the national level. Garrett analyzed data on all death sentencing by county from 1990 to 2016, seeking to answer the question of why a few counties, but not the bulk, still impose death sentences. He found that death sentences are strongly associated with urban, populous counties as well as counties that have large black populations. Garrett also found that counties with more white victims of homicide have more death sentencing. Frank Baumgartner, a University of North Carolina political science professor, described a similar pattern in a 2016 Albany Law Review article after he examined national data on race and homicide between 1976 through 2014. In Florida, Baumgartner found "tremendous disparities" depending upon the race and gender of the victim. He found that 72 percent of all executions in Florida were for crimes involving white victims despite the fact that 56 percent of all homicide victims are white. He argues that bias can enter the system at many points -- starting with a prosecutor’s decision about how to charge the crime and ultimately decisions by juries. It isn’t just a Florida problem. One of the key pieces of analysis cited in this area is by University of Iowa law professor David Baldus, who examined a sampling of death penalty cases in Philadelphia from 1983 to 1993. He found average death sentencing rates were 38 percent higher for black defendants than for other defendants. Baldus, who died in 2011, played a role in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1987 McCleskey vs. Kemp decision, in which the court determined Baldus’ research showing statistical evidence of racial discrimination in Georgia death penalty cases did not make the death penalty unconstitutional. In a report for the American Bar Association, Baldus found that race-of-defendant disparities existed in several other states, too, including California, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Our ruling Bracy said, "African-Americans are grossly overrepresented on Florida’s death row." African-Americans are overrepresented in terms of their population; black inmates make up twice as large of a share of death row inmates than their share of the state population. The "why" isn’t as easy to answer. National data show that more blacks than whites are convicted of homicides. However, research repeatedly shows that the victim’s race affects a defendant’s sentence: no white person has been executed for killing a black person in Florida.

pomt-05917	In 1992, Mitt Romney "gave money to Democrats for Congress."	true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/31/newt-gingrich/Gingrich-Romney-campaign-contributions-Democrats/	With two days to go before Florida’s Republican primary, Newt Gingrich appeared on Face the Nation in Miami Jan. 29, 2012 and lashed out at Mitt Romney for giving dollars to Democrats. "It is a fact in 1992, (Romney) gave money to Democrats for Congress, (and) he voted in the Democratic Primary for Paul Tsongas who was the most liberal candidate," Gingrich said. We fact-checked Romney’s claim from the Jan. 26 Jacksonville debate, "I’ve never voted for a Democrat when there was a Republican on the ballot," and gave that a Half True. Romney acknowledged that he voted for Tsongas in the 1992 presidential primary; he could have voted in the Republican primary instead. In this fact-check, we will focus on whether Romney gave money to Democrats running for Congress in 1992. We emailed Romney spokespersons and did not get a response. But we found plenty of news articles and data that related to Gingrich’s claim. Romney mostly donated to Republicans When we searched the Federal Election Commission website we found Romney donations only going back to 1997. At our request, the FEC ran a report for us that included donations from 1998 back to 1988. That data showed three donations to Democrats in 1992: $1,000 to Douglas Anderson, $250 to John LaFalce and $250 to Richard Swett. (More on these candidates in a bit.) That information was in line with what the Gingrich campaign provided us, as well as election contributions gathered by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. We couldn’t help but notice, however, that during the past 20 years the bulk of donations made by Romney were to Republican candidates or committees. We found the easiest way to search his donations was by looking at the Center for Responsive Politics’ Open Secrets website -- searching both by Mitt Romney and his actual first name, Willard Romney. Searching this way, we found donations to about 23 individuals, and only three were Democrats. Sometimes Romney gave to the same individual more than once so ultimately there were far more than two dozen donations to candidates. Romney also gave thousands to state and national Republican committees. Interestingly, he also made donations to one of his current rivals for the Republican nomination -- Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. What the three Democrats said about Romney Even though the donations to Democrats were exceptions to the rule, let’s take a closer look at the three Democratic candidates: • U. S. Rep. Richard Swett was a U.S. Representative from New Hampshire from Jan. 3, 1991 to Jan. 3, 1995. Swett was later the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark and now is CEO of Climate Prosperity Enterprise Solutions in New Hampshire. • Douglas Delano Anderson was a Harvard Business school professor who lost a Democratic U.S. Senate primary in Utah in 1992. Anderson is now a Dean at the Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University. • U.S. Rep John J. LaFalce: was a U.S. Representative from New York Jan. 3, 1975 to Jan. 3, 2003. He is now special counsel at a law firm. The Truth-O-Meter spoke with all three Democrats. Swett said that he knew Romney since young adulthood -- both had homes on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. Swett also said that like Romney, he is a Mormon. "I’m a fiscally conservative, socially progressive Democrat," Swett said. "I’ve had a lot of Republicans give in my political career." Anderson responded in a short email that he and Romney have "been close personal friends for 38 years." LaFalce told us "I haven’t the vaguest idea" why Romney donated to him. LaFalce said he doesn’t recall meeting Romney personally and speculates that Romney gave to him because LaFalce was an active member of the banking committee. LaFalce said he received a lot of donations from individuals in the financial services industry. Our ruling Gingrich said that in 1992, Romney "gave money to Democrats for Congress." We should note that for the past 20 years, Romney has given the majority of his donations to Republican candidates and committees. But Gingrich was specific in his attack here, and Romney did give money to three Democratic candidates that year. We rate Gingrich's claim True.

pomt-05989	Rep. David Cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, the failed solar company	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/22/national-republican-congressional-committee/rep-david-cicilline-responsible-federal-loan-guara/	There’s been a lot of finger-pointing lately in Washington over the Obama administration’s 2009 decision to give a $535-million federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, a now-defunct solar power manufacturer. The Republican-controlled House has launched an investigation into how the Department of Energy could guarantee such a large loan to a company that would file for bankruptcy only two and a half years later. What sort of examination of the California start-up company’s finances did the government do before taking such a big risk? According to a news release we received the other day, the National Republican Congressional Committee has found a scapegoat for the debacle: U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island. "Once the poster child for David Cicilline's stimulus boondoggle, the bankrupt Solyndra company is now a symbol of how his failed scheme wasted taxpayer money on political payback and failing companies instead of creating the jobs promised," the Jan. 13 release said. The NRCC sent out the release in response to a Washington Times report that senior Solyndra executives were set to receive bonuses despite the company’s troubles. "It’s outrageous enough that David Cicilline supported a $1-trillion failed stimulus package, but it’s even more outrageous that hundreds of millions were spent to fund a failing company like Solyndra," NRCC communications director Paul Lindsay went on to say in the release. "Not only is Cicilline responsible for this irresponsible investment, but he’ll also have to explain to his Rhode Island constituents why Solyndra’s senior employees are receiving bonuses at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers." We’ve heard a lot of allegations in connection to Solyndra’s problems, but never one laying the blame at Cicilline’s doorstep. This puzzled us because Cicilline took office in 2011, well after the federal stimulus package that financed Solyndra’s loan guarantee was passed and well after the decision was made to award Solyndra the loan guarantee. How could he be responsible? We checked the NRCC’s website and saw that the same news release had been sent out to 49 other Congressional districts, but each time, the name of the Democrat in office was inserted where Cicilline’s name was. (The Democrats included Rep. Bill Keating, of Massachusetts, who also took office in 2011). We then called the organization seeking an explanation of how Cicilline made it on the list. (Curiously, Rep. James R. Langevin, Rhode Island’s other congressman who is also a Democrat, wasn’it on the list even though he was in office at the time the stimulus bill was passed and voted for it.) An NRCC spokesman said the release was accurate because Cicilline voiced support for the stimulus package when he was campaigning for Congress. "I think the important thing to note is we didn’t say Cicilline voted for the stimulus," Nat Sillin said. "We say he supported it." It’s true that Cicilline did back the stimulus package. When he was mayor of Providence, he was quoted numerous times saying that the bill would create sorely needed jobs. And although it’s technically true that the release didn’t say that Cicilline voted for the stimulus, it did say that he’s responsible. That didn’t add up to us. Let’s run through some dates to make it clear why: Feb. 13, 2009: Congress passes the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Under the $787-billion stimulus package, Solyndra received its loan guarantee. March 20, 2009: Solyndra receives conditional approval for the loan guarantee, according to a timeline from the Department of Energ,. Sept. 3, 2009: The Department of Energy makes the final decision to approve the loan guarantee for Solyndra. Nov. 2, 2010: Cicilline elected to Congress. Jan. 5, 2011: Cicilline takes office. Our ruling The full name of the legislation under which the stimulus package was approved gives this one away -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Cicilline took office in January 2011, a full 23 months after passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited Solyndra. The National Republican Congressional Committee has every right to call the stimulus a "boondoggle." And it’s fair to say that Cicilline supported the stimulus before taking office. But Lindsay said that Cicilline is "responsible for this irresponsible investment." No, he’s not. We’d say that Lindsay and the National Republican Congressional Committee simply used overheated rhetoric, but that’s an understatement. Their claim is so wildly inaccurate that we give it a Pants on Fire. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-10259	"John McCain wants to privatize Social Security."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/26/hillary-clinton/mccain-not-committed-to-privatization/	In a much-anticipated address at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Rodham Clinton praised former rival Barack Obama and launched a strong attack against Republican nominee John McCain, tying him to President George W. Bush. "We don't need four more years of the last eight years," Clinton said, launching into a litany of attacks. One line jumped out at us: "John McCain wants to privatize Social Security." "Privatizing social security" is how Democrats refer to George W. Bush's plan to allow workers to divert a portion of the program's payroll taxes to personal investment accounts. (Republicans prefer the nomenclature of " personal accounts .") Though McCain has repeatedly warned that the Social Security system is going broke and needs to be fixed to meet the needs of future generations, he is not proposing anything as ambitious — or as concrete — as what Bush attempted in 2005. At the time, Bush tried to make the case that his plan would keep the system solvent as tens of millions of baby boomers retire. The thinking was that private accounts would give younger workers the ability to manage their retirement nest eggs without government interference. Though Bush did a good job convincing the public that the program was in trouble, he couldn't sell them on his solution. Call it privatization or personal accounts, the plan failed to garner support. McCain, mindful of the passions Social Security debates tend to arouse, is vague about his plans for the program. His Web site says he wants to supplement the current system with personal accounts but that the accounts will not be a substitute for addressing overall solvency. It also notes McCain wants to work with Democrats on a Social Security plan but is prepared to go it alone if they don't want to play. Experts say McCain appears to back allowing workers to invest a portion of their paychecks in new tax-advantaged investments without tapping money currently dedicated to Social Security. "That's very different from taking money out of Social Security and making a personal account part of today's benefit structure," said David C. John, a senior research fellow and Social Security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, in an interview earlier this year . "Politically, (the charge) is understandable, but factually, what McCain is proposing is different." In July, McCain was asked more specifically about Social Security. "I cannot tell you what I would do, except to put everything on the table," he told reporters. A few weeks later, he was asked at an event about new taxes to shore up Social Security. "There is nothing that's off the table. I have my positions, and I'll articulate them. But nothing's off the table," McCain said. "I don't want tax increases. But that doesn't mean that anything is off the table." That sounds to us to fall considerably short of Clinton's statement that McCain "wants to privatize Social Security." She stretches things when she equates his currently vague designs for the program with Bush's failed policy proposal, so we judge her statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14430	Says Donald Trump said the government is going to pay for everybody to have health care.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/09/keep-promise-1-pac/pro-cruz-pac-wrongly-says-trump-wants-government-r/	In the days leading up to the South Carolina Republican primary, Palmetto State voters who tuned in to the game show Jeopardy or the evening news had a good chance of seeing an anti-Trump ad called "Trumpcare." It comes from Keep the Promise I, a political action committee that backs Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The ad, and others like it, weren’t enough to thwart Donald Trump, who took the state by a hefty 10-point margin. (Thanks to the Political TV Ad Archive, anyone can dip into the archive’s database to learn where and when it and dozens of other ads have run.) This ad makes the case that Trump supports a government-run health care program in which Washington pays for everybody. The last half is an edited version of an interview Trump did on CBS News’ 60 Minutes with Scott Pelley in September last year. Here’s the full text: Voiceover: "First there was Hillarycare." Clinton video clip: "We have to get to universal health care." Voiceover: "Then there was Obamacare." Obama video clip: "Moves us in the direction of universal health care coverage in this country." Voiceover: "We can't afford TrumpCare." Trump: "Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say." Pelley: "Universal health care?" Trump: "I am going to take care of everybody." Pelley: "Who pays for it?" Trump: "The government's gonna pay for it." Voiceover: "Donald, don't you know Hillarycare, Obamacare and Trumpcare are all government-run health care?" We compared the ad’s version of the 60 Minutes interview to the actual transcript and it’s clear that some artful editing took place. Here’s the complete segment on health care between Trump and Pelley on 60 Minutes. We bolded the words the ad kept in. Trump: "Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced. Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what's going on with premiums where they're up 45, 50, 55 percent." Pelley: "How do you fix it?" Trump: "There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, ‘No, no, the lower 25 percent that can't afford private.’ But--" Pelley: "Universal health care?" Trump: "I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now." Pelley: "The uninsured person is going to be taken care of how?" Trump: "They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably--" Pelley: "Make a deal? Who pays for it?" Trump: "--the government's gonna pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything." So now we can see what the ad left out. It left out Trump saying that he was talking about people of limited means, the lower 25 percent, who can't afford private insurance. It left out Trump saying that for the most part, he sees people picking the deal they like from competing private plans. By omitting those key phrases, the ad delivers the message that Trump backs government-sponsored health care for everyone. That said, Trump did lay out the goal of making sure that everyone got health care. But using his rough percentages, the country would get there with about three-quarters of the public taking care of themselves. Given that one of the details of his health care proposal is to eliminate government regulations that prevent insurance companies from selling policies across state lines, to some degree, Trump advocates a smaller role for government, not a larger one. We reached out to the coordinator of the PAC that produced the ad and did not hear back. Lastly, as we've said many times, Obamacare is not government-run health care. Our ruling A pro-Cruz PAC, Keep the Promise I, ran an ad that appeared to have Trump saying he wanted the government to pay for everyone’s health care. That ad relied on very selective editing of an interview Trump had on CBS News. The edits left out very important words. Trump said most people would buy their insurance privately and that the government would help those of limited means, which he roughly described as the lower 25 percent. The ad omitted key details that would have conveyed a very different meaning. We rate this claim False.	None	Keep the Promise 1 PAC	None	None	None	2016-03-09T18:13:50	2016-02-17	['None']
pomt-14661	Says his much-discussed boots are "made in Wisconsin."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2016/jan/19/marco-rubio/rubios-infamous-boots-were-made-india-not-wisconsi/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is trying to stamp out criticism from other presidential candidates about his slick, zip-up boots by saying he’s giving American business a leg up. Rubio’s ankle boots became the subject of Internet scrutiny after he was photographed wearing them in New Hampshire on Jan. 3, 2016. Pundits and fashion columnists commented on them ad nauseam. Rubio drew fire from his GOP rivals for being perhaps a bit too chic for the campaign trail. Some speculated they were to make the 5-foot-10 senator appear taller. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul called the boots "cute" and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise super PAC made a commercial mocking them. While Rubio initially called the focus on his footwear "craziness," he’s worked at thinking on his feet. At a Jan. 18 campaign event in Waverly, Iowa, a voter jokingly asked about the boots. Rubio declared his boots, appropriately outfitted with a Cuban heel, are a patriotic choice. "They sold out of those boots online," Rubio said. "They’re made in Wisconsin. Florsheim! You know what that means? That means I did more for American business in one week than Barack Obama did in seven years!" He’s right that Florsheim’s website says some sizes of their $135 Duke boots are out of stock, but they should be available by Feb. 1. A Florsheim spokesman told us sales of that style have "increased significantly" since Rubio was shown wearing them. As for the part about being made in Wisconsin, well, Rubio probably should have watched his step. Like all of the Glendale, Wis., company’s shoes, Rubio’s boots aren’t made in the United States. The company did recently collaborate with designer George Esquivel to create a luxury shoe line that is made in California, but Florsheim said their products are made in Asia, mostly from China. That trend goes back to the 1970s, when Florsheim’s then-owner, St. Louis-based International Shoe Co., moved production to India, where Rubio’s Duke boots were manufactured. The company also makes some items in Italy. Founded in 1892 in Chicago, Florsheim once had five U.S. factories and 2,500 employees by the 1920s. While at one time holding 70 percent of the men’s shoe market, the company eventually suffered from lackluster sales and a stodgy image, declaring bankruptcy in 2002. It was resurrected by Florsheim family scions through Weyco Group, the same company that distributes shoe brands like Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams (also foreign-made). No shoes are made at Weyco’s headquarters in suburban Milwaukee. It’s not really surprising that the American company’s boots are imports, as shoe manufacturing in the United States is on shaky footing these days. The American Apparel and Footwear Association said that domestic production has started to increase in recent years, but U.S. boot and shoe sales are still around 98 percent imports. Rubio’s campaign didn’t respond when we pointed out the boots were not made in America. There are still bootmakers in Wisconsin, however. Weinbrenner Shoe Company, for example, makes work boots in two central Wisconsin factories, and Allen Edmonds makes most of its high-end shoes and boots in Port Washington, about 20 miles north of Glendale. Our ruling Rubio said his much-discussed boots are "made in Wisconsin." His Florsheim ankle boots aren’t made in the Badger State, where the company is headquartered. Florsheim told us most of their products are made in China, but Rubio’s boots came from India. We have to put our foot down on this one. We rate Rubio’s statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-11007	"US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans"	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/10/blog-posting/conservative-website-wrong-purpose-effects-un-conf/	A conservative website falsely claimed that U.S. representatives to the United Nations promised to push for gun-control policies at home. "US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans," said a July 5, 2018, headline from the Conservative Daily Post website. The report cited a similar story from the New American, a bimonthly magazine for "freedom-loving Americans" who support "limited government under the Constitution," according to its about page. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook’s News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is not the first time we have encountered falsehoods concerning the U.N. and gun control. We previously looked at the claim that a U.N. treaty would mandate a "new international gun registry" and a chain email that wrongly accused the Obama administration of planning to use international treaties to ban all weapons. As with these past statements, there is also a lot wrong with this new report about the U.N. conference. The report said U.S. representatives attending the Third Review Conference for the June 2018 U.N. Program of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons agreed "to begin developing ‘legal frameworks’ … that will enforce ‘proper management’ of ‘small arms and light weapons’ stockpiles." The report went on to say, misleadingly, that the United States pledged to help the U.N. track and confiscate firearms, including stockpiles owned by private citizens. "In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people," the story said. "If they don’t push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the U.N. will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not. This agreement is wildly unconstitutional." Citing six points spelled out in the "implementation at the national level" section of the conference’s outcome document, the story said the meeting resulted in the United States’ willing violation of Second and Tenth Amendment rights. But the story erred in its understanding of the conference. In reality, the conference provided an opportunity for participating countries to review their progress and reaffirm a commitment made in 2001 to limit the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons. According to the website for the U.N. Office of Disarmament Affairs, the original meeting in 2001 saw governments agree "to improve national small arms laws, import/export controls, and stockpile management — and to engage in cooperation and assistance." Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., attended this year's conference along with several advisers, according to the U.N.'s list of participants. The State Department and the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the role of U.S. representatives at the conference. Caroline Dorminey, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute and an expert with the Forum on the Arms Trade, explained that the U.N. program focuses on the illegal flow of small arms and light weapons, meaning any subsequent measures enacted by the United States would not violate Second or Tenth Amendment rights. "The purpose of the Third Review Conference is to make progress on stopping the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons," Dorminey wrote in an email. "The trade being targeted in particular is dispersion/diversion — especially across borders — that fuels black markets and conflict in unstable regions." "Any measures enacted by the UN program would not infringe on Second or Tenth Amendment rights because they are inherently focused on illicit trade — not the legal trade within American borders that those amendments provide the basis for." Conservative Daily Post did not respond to a request for comment submitted via its contact page. Our ruling A headline stated, "US representatives promise implement of UN gun-control plans." The story said U.S. representatives at a U.N. conference pledged to adopt new gun-control measures that would threaten Second and Tenth Amendment rights. U.S. representatives at the conference did reaffirm the nation’s agreement in 2001 to work toward limiting the illicit international trade of small arms and light weapons. But the United States’ continued participation in such an agreement should have no effect on its citizens’ constitutional rights, given the focus on illegal actions in global trade.

pomt-04646	Says President Barack Obama "built this $16 trillion debt."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/12/reid-ribble/president-obama-built-nations-16-trillion-debt-gop/	When President Barack Obama said "If you’ve got a business, you didn’t build that," he meant that success in business was the result of government, not hard-working people, according to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. In late July 2012, PolitiFact National rated the claim False, saying Romney took Obama’s words out of context. But barely a month later, the Republican National Convention was replete with referencesto Obama’s "you didn’t build that" comment. Among those sounding the theme from the Tampa, Fla., gathering was U.S. Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., a first-term congressman serving the Green Bay area. During an Aug. 30, 2012 interview, Ribble and Jerry Bader, host of a conservative radio talk show on WTAQ-AM and -FM in Green Bay, talked for several minutes about the Obama comment. The interview was done the day after U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Romney’s running mate, spoke to the convention. Ribble said: "What the president did build, though -- and (Ryan) talked about this last night -- is he built this $16 trillion debt. He did build that." Wait. All of it? At first glance, Ribble’s claim may appear way off. But let’s examine the numbers. How much we owe We checked the U.S. Treasury Department’s "debt to the penny" meter for the day Ribble made his statement. The debt was a few hairs under $16 trillion, although it crossed that threshold several days later. We then spun the meter back to Jan. 20, 2009, the day of Obama’s inauguration. The debt was $10.6 trillion. That means debt rose $5.4 trillion under Obama -- about one-third of the $16 trillion total. By saying Obama "built this $16 trillion debt. He did build that," Ribble suggested Obama was responsible for the entire amount. Ribble spokeswoman Ashley Olson disagreed, saying it’s obvious the $16 trillion accumulated over many years. Her boss’ point, she said, was that it reached $16 trillion because of Obama. But even if that was what Ribble meant in blaming Obama, he cited the $16 trillion debt figure, not the roughly $5 trillion accumulated during his presidency. Obama’s role As for what role Obama played in the accumulation of debt, Olson cited a number of news articles about how much debt and spending increased during Obama's time as president. Let’s look at two of them. 1. "Obama is the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents" That line is from PolitiFact National, although it is a bit dated. It’s from May 2011, when our colleagues rated as Pants on Firea claim by then-U.S. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that Obama "increased the debt" 16 percent while President George W. Bush raised it 115 percent. In saying Obama was the debt king among the last five presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan, PolitiFact National found that under one measure -- debt as a percentage of gross national product -- Obama ranked highest. As of December 2010, the ratio under Obama had risen nearly 22 percentage points; Reagan was second at 14.9. (However, using raw numbers, our colleagues found that at the time, the debt had increased by 34 percent, or $3.66 trillion, under Obama -- well below the 86 percent increase, or a total of $4.9 trillion, under George W. Bush.) 2. Obama budgets and spending up each year A May 2012 analysis by The Washington Post Fact Checker found that Obama's budgets have increased each year, from $3.27 trillion in 2009 to $3.65 trillion in 2012; and that Obama proposed more in spending each year than Congress ultimately approved. So, the debt has increased significantly under Obama. But, despite Ribble’s claim, the responsibility goes far beyond the White House. Other factors When Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said at the GOP convention that $5 trillion in debt had been added over the past four years, PolitiFact National rated his statement Mostly True. Our colleagues pointed out that while the figure was on target, the blame is bipartisan. Democrats had majorities in the Senate and House for two years of Obama’s presidency, but Republicans have controlled the House since January 2011. Moreover, our colleagues noted, much of the debt stems from entitlement spending policies that were set under past presidents and Congresses. PolitiFact Ohio made similar points in June 2012 when it rated as Half True a statement by Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, that debt under Obama had risen $5 trillion -- more than any other president. Our Buckeye colleagues noted that although Obama approved the stimulus bill and a deal to extend tax cuts, both of which contributed to the debt, Obama’s administration has cited decisions made under GOP President George W. Bush -- including tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Medicare prescription drug program -- as major contributors to the debt. Our rating Ribble said Obama "built this $16 trillion debt." His spokeswoman said Ribble meant that the debt had reached that level because of Obama. But Ribble used the $16 trillion figure, not the roughly $5 trillion that the debt has increased under Obama. Moreover, the debt grew not only due to Obama’s actions, but those taken by present and past presidents and Congresses. We rate Ribble’s statement False.

pomt-14312	Despite the passage of HB2, "towns, cities and counties in North Carolina are still allowed to set stricter non-discrimination policies for their own employees if they choose."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/31/pat-mccrory/mccrory-local-governments-can-have-house-discrimin/	In what he dubbed a "myths vs. facts" press release addressing news reports on North Carolina’s new LGBT law, Gov. Pat McCrory made multiple statements that caused us to raise our eyebrows. In general McCrory has been trying to downplay the effects of the state’s new law, commonly referred to as HB2. We already checked one of his statements, on the possibility of North Carolina losing $4.5 billion in federal education funding due to Title IX violations. McCrory said there’s no threat, citing a federal judge’s opinion. We rated that claim Half True. We also checked McCrory’s statement that this law didn’t take away "any rights" in "any city in North Carolina." We rated that claim False. Now we’re turning our attention to a claim of his about the ability of cities to strengthen employment policies. The state now recognizes discrimination only against certain groups, not including gay or transgender people. The new law does allow cities and counties to set in-house rules on minimum wage, work hours and other employment-related issues. They can’t impose any such rules on private businesses, but they can make the rules for themselves. When it comes to discrimination rules, however, the issue is much murkier – even despite the governor’s promise that there’s nothing to worry about. "Does this law prohibit towns, cities or counties in North Carolina from setting their own nondiscrimination policies in employment that go beyond state law?" McCrory asked in his press release. "Answer: No. Town(s), cities and counties in North Carolina are still allowed to set stricter non-discrimination policies for their own employees if they choose." However, the actual wording of the law seems to say the exact opposite. Let’s hear it: "... the General Statutes supersede and preempt any ordinance, regulation, resolution, or policy adopted or imposed by a unit of local government or other political subdivision of the State that regulates or imposes any requirement upon an employer pertaining to the regulation of discriminatory practices in employment, except such regulations applicable to personnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law." The end initially appears to say local governments can protect their own employees ("personnel employed by that body") from discriminatory firing – a phrase that would appear to back up McCrory’s point. But the sentence doesn’t stop there. It continues on: "except such regulations applicable to personnel employed by that body that are not otherwise in conflict with State law" (emphasis added). And the new state law says the only discrimination protections recognized in North Carolina are "race, religion, color, national origin, age, biological sex or handicap." It defines biological sex as "The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate." In Greensboro, town officials are skeptical that McCrory is correct in saying they’ll be able to keep their old, stricter policies that protected transgender people. A memo from the office of City Attorney Tom Carruthers said "the recent amendments in city policy and ordinance to protect gender identity and gender preference are now probably eliminated." Carrboro had similar discrimination protections. Like in Greensboro, town leaders think they may now be moot – particularly the protections for transgender employees – despite what McCrory said. "The bill calls into question – and I’m being careful with my word choice there – it calls into question the ability of local government to ban discrimination based on gender identity (because) that’s not the same as biological sex," Carrboro Town Attorney Nick Herman said. Other town, city or county governments had gender identity discrimination protections that are now in question, including Raleigh, Charlotte, Asheville, Boone and Chapel Hill, and Buncombe, Mecklenberg and Orange counties. According to the News & Observer, Chapel Hill Mayor Pam Hemminger cited the loss of in-house anti-discrimination rules as one reason why the town passed a resolution calling for the law’s repeal. "The greatest sentiment was the loss of local control," Hemminger said. Asking law professors So the law says that cities and counties can have stricter discrimination policies, unless they conflict with state law. Most of the affected cities previously had discrimination rules regarding gay and transgender employees. And yet it appears that any attempt to restore their protections – especially for transgender people – would conflict with state law. Why is that exception even included in the bill, if it appears to nullify itself? "That is a savings clause that saves nothing," said Enrique Armijo, a constitutional law professor at Elon University School of Law. Essentially, Armijo argued, it looks important but means nothing. He said it’s "farcical" for McCrory to argue that the law allows local governments to set stricter, internal anti-discrimination policies. "The governor's interest here is in making the law seem like it does a lot less than it does," Armijo said. Unfortunately, we don’t know exactly what legal interpretation McCrory was using when he put together his "myths vs. facts" press release, which is on his state website, campaign website and was distributed by numerous state agencies. His office did not respond to multiple requests for help clarifying the reasoning behind his statement, or the seeming contradictions in the law. So we went and talked to more law professors. Katharine T. Bartlett, a former dean of Duke University Law School who is now a professor there, said McCrory’s claim seems true. Bartlett teaches and writes about subjects including employment discrimination, gender and the law, gender theory and social change. "This ‘except such regulations…’ language is very vague," she said. "Perhaps intentionally so, perhaps a result of the rush in which it was enacted. That said, I would read this language to allow local governments to have their own nondiscriminatory policies, as long as they do not impose them on any other employers." On the other hand is Michael Gerhardt, the Samuel Ashe Distinguished Professor in constitutional law at UNC-Chapel Hill and the director of the school’s Law and Government program. "I think (McCrory’s) reading is disingenuous," Gerhardt said. "... It seems like (HB2) was motivated to produce a law that was going to override whatever the localities did." Our ruling Local government leaders are worried they’ll lose local discrimination protections, and two of the three legal experts we spoke with said they have good reason to be. The consensus isn’t unanimous. Bartlett, the former Duke Law dean, argued that McCrory is correct. And even some of the municipal leaders couched their fears, not willing to say their policies are definitely gone. It might be that no one will know for sure until a judge rules one way or the other. But in the meantime, McCrory is telling local governments that they can absolutely keep doing something that the local governments themselves, and several constitutional law professors, don’t necessarily think they can. But McCrory doesn’t offer any legal reasoning for his claim, his office didn’t respond when asked to clarify the seeming contradictions, and the majority of people we spoke to who are involved in the issue directly, or are looking at it from the outside as professors, believe that it’s not nearly so cut-and-dried. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-03-31T12:48:04	2016-03-26	['North_Carolina']
pomt-14756	"On a single night in January 2015, state and local planning agencies in Rhode Island reported the following estimates of homelessness … 107 veterans were homeless."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/dec/13/us-department-housing-and-urban-development/trouble-counting-rhode-islands-homeless-veteran-po/	The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development calls it a "Point in Time" count. It’s the number of homeless people counted on "a single night in January," according to the agency’s "Annual Homeless Assessment Report," which was submitted to Congress on Nov. 19. To get the tally, HUD works with local observers in each state to count homeless people on the streets, in shelters and in other locations. This year’s assessment, which reported an estimated 107 homeless veterans in Rhode Island, has drawn criticism from Operation Stand Down Rhode Island, a veterans advocacy agency, which says HUDs measurement is flawed and minimizes the numbers of homeless veterans in the state. A press release issued Nov. 19 by HUD’s New England region office in Boston provides a list of "estimates" on homelessness reported by state and local planning agencies in Rhode Island, including an estimate about the number of homeless veterans. "On a single night in January 2015, 107 veterans were homeless," it says. HUD’s 75-page report cites the 107 number in several exhibits, including one table that shows just two of 107 homeless veterans living without shelter, a rate of 1.9 percent. This is lower than any other state, it says. The news release qualifies certain limitations of the data, referring to the data as a "snapshot" and saying that the number does not reflect who is eligible for HUDs homeless assistance grants programs. It says the "point-in-time count only captures those persons sleeping in sheltered and unsheltered locations on the night of the count." So the count reflects all homeless veterans in unsheltered locations that night? "It’s not an exact science," acknowledges HUD spokeswoman Rhonda Siciliano. "Obviously, going out and counting people on the street you’re not going to be 100 percent accurate." Siciliano told PolitiFact that HUD’s counting method would probably generate two different numbers if it was done on two nights instead of one. "It’s a very fluid situation," she said. "People go in and out of homelessness." Erik Wallin, executive director of Operation Stand Down Rhode Island, is among critics who say the methodology of the assessment significantly minimizes the actual number in this case. Wallin argues that many homeless veterans are unlikely to acknowledge their background when approached in a shelter or on the street. Some veterans known to the Veterans Administration are not known to HUD, he said. Wallin’s organization served 57 veterans who were homeless when they approached Operation Stand Down for help in January of 2015. Wallin says that homeless veterans who aren’t in shelters aren’t likely to hang out where other homeless people congregate. Wallin talks about one veteran who chose to live in his van as Operation Stand Down worked with him to find housing. Eric L. Hirsch, a Providence College sociology professor who coordinated the count, said he believes the assessment, which was conducted in the wintertime, did not miss a lot of homeless people who were living outside. "If someone feels we did, they needed to document that," he said. "If they had documented it and there was evidence of it, then they would have been included in the count." The nature of homelessness -- a condition that many people cycle in and cycle out of -- can make it very hard to quantify the homeless over the course of a full year, especially in warmer climates where homeless people live outside year round. But for the same reason, the point in time approach might give the impression that fewer numbers of people are affected by homelessness. "The point in time count is really a snapshot and shouldn’t be interpreted as a prevalence measure," says Dr. Thomas O’Toole, a physician who cares for Rhode Island veterans and also directs the Veteran Administration’s National Center for Homelessness Among Veterans. HUD’s definition of homelessness also affects the count. Some critics, including Wallin and Hirsch, also say the definition doesn’t include individuals who are forced to live with a friend or with a relative because they don’t have resources for their own home. Hirsch said he estimates there could be hundreds of homeless veterans living under such circumstances but HUD doesn’t count this segment of the homeless population due to concerns about who is voluntarily living with someone else and who is forced to do so. Hirsch provided one other piece of info to consider when evaluating HUD’s claim of 107 homeless veterans in Rhode Island on a night in January 2015. Rhode Island’s Point In Time count was conducted on Feb. 25, 2015. That’s not a night in January. Our ruling Some vocal critics, who are knowledgeable about the extent of homelessness in Rhode Island’s veteran population, question the usefulness and accuracy of HUD’s point in time count. They weren’t able to provide hard evidence, for example an alternative count based on logs or records, of more than 107 homeless veterans in Rhode Island in January of 2015. But while HUD’s press release describes how the point-in-time count works, calling it a "snapshot," it could say more about the possibility that the count missed homeless veterans who might not have been in shelters. The claim is partially accurate but it leaves out important details. For that reason, the ruling is Half True.

pomt-00851	Uber and other ride-share firms are not required to carry auto insurance under Georgia law.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/20/rich-golick/there-gap-rideshare-insurance-coverage-georgia/	Ride-sharing services have become ubiquitous in Georgia, especially in metro Atlanta’s urban core where millennial and party-goers often tap the app-based services to get around. State lawmakers last year failed to pass legislation to regulate Uber, Lyft and other similar services. A study committee last fall recommended specific regulations that have become two bills that have already cleared the House this session. House Bill 190 takes up the insurance gap raised in the committee report. It would require the firms to maintain $1 million in insurance coverage for service drivers and also mandates $300,000 coverage for bodily injury or death and $50,000 for property damage for drivers. Both apply to drivers when they are logged into the company’s system. State Rep. Rich Golick, R-Smyrna, said the proposal is about passenger safety, not regulation. "Under Georgia law, there is no requirement for these companies to carry insurance related to their business activities," Golick, the chairman of the House Non-Civil Judicial Committee who works in the private sector as a regional attorney for Allstate Insurance company, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Golick also mentioned that the firms do carry similar insurance, but it is voluntary and with different coverage limits. So PolitiFact Georgia wondered, is Golick right, or does the Peach State already tell ride-share companies to insure their drivers? The answer is not a surprise given the relative youth of the ride-share industry. The independent contractors who drive their own cars for the services are of course required to have personal insurance for their vehicles. But insurance officials told the study committee that those individual policies don’t apply once the contractors begin making money driving for the services. State law even lets insurance companies cancel policies on drivers found to be conducting commercial activity, like the ride shares, on personal insurance. Put simply, your personal auto insurance won’t cover an incident when you’re driving for Uber or Lyft, whether when picking folks up or tooling around looking for fares. Uber and Lyft testified that they remedy that problem by offering $1 million in coverage every time one of their drivers has passengers. Ube also lists its insurance coverage on a company blog. The coverage amounts are higher in the Georgia proposal for times when there are no passengers, but the company has a $1 million policy in place for its drivers any time they are heading to pick up a fare or passengers are in an Uber-contracted vehicle. Golick’s pending bill is more strict, though. It would mandate that coverage begin the moment a driver turns on the app – the ride-share equivalent of taxi drivers turning on their lights to signal they’re available for fares. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has called for such action. And the Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens has endorsed Golick’s bill. "The state has a safety obligation to make sure there is coverage when the personal policy of these drivers doesn’t apply," Golick said. "And it heads off the problem of a gap in coverage before a tragic situation occurs." There have been tragedies elsewhere. In 2013, a 6-year-old girl was killed after she, her younger brother and mother were hit by a car in a San Francisco crosswalk. The driver was logged into Uber’s app at the time and was between fares at the time. Uber has acknowledged the driver was logged into its system. But it is fighting a lawsuit that seeks for its insurance to pay for medical and burial expenses because the driver was not carrying a passenger, about to pick one up or responding to a fare request at the time of the accident. Company spokesman Taylor Bennett said Uber’s coverage applies the moment a driver accepts a request. Uber also provides contingent coverage between trips, so that, "for whatever reason their personal coverage doesn’t kick in, we will cover that." The ride-share industry opposes HB 190 and is instead more supportive of House Bill 225, which requires ride-share drivers to pass background checks and makes the companies themselves pay taxes or annual fees, which they do not pay now. At least 21 other states are weighing some kind of regulation for the ride-share firms this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five have enacted new laws, including one in California that puts the same mandates on the companies as HB 190 would in Georgia. At the same time, insurance companies are developing policy options that would allow individuals to add on ride-share coverage to their private insurance. Those policies are not yet available in Georgia. "The industry is moving in the direction that is evolving with the innovations taking place in the insurance arena, yet (Golick) he is proposing a law that ignores these innovations," Bennett said. "That makes it more difficult to operate in the state of Georgia and therefore more difficult for folks there to start their own businesses and partner with us." In other words, the bill remains a source of debate. But even the Uber and Lyft acknowledge their popular services are too new for there to be existing regulations on how they operate. Lawmakers and ride-share firms may differ on what regulations will work or are needed. But Golick said simply that Georgia doesn’t have any regulations on the firms at this point. On that point, he’s dead on. We rate his claim True.	None	Rich Golick	None	None	None	2015-03-20T00:00:00	2015-03-03	['None']
pomt-11196	Says he’s not a politician.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/16/randy-bryce/randy-bryce-has-never-held-public-office-his-4th-r/	"IronStache" Randy Bryce, then a little known ironworker, burst onto the national political scene in June 2017 with an online ad that went viral. Standing at a job site in a hard hat, Bryce announced his run for the U.S. House seat that Paul Ryan has held for nearly 20 years. With a distinctive Wisconsin tone, Bryce said: "Let’s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I’ll go to D.C." At least in Democratic circles, Bryce became a sensation. Ten months later, his prospects improved dramatically when Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, announced he would not seek re-election to his southern Wisconsin seat. But despite Bryce’s everyman image, which he has continued to cultivate in the campaign, a claim he made on the May 6, 2018, edition of "The Circus," a weekly political program on the Showtime cable network, caught our attention. It came during this exchange with co-host Mark McKinnon, as Bryce made a reference to President Donald Trump: Bryce: Last year at this time, I was working on a parking structure, and just talking with the co-workers, just really ticked off at what's going on, and they're like, what are you going to do? And I was like, well, I'll show you. McKinnon: So you're not a politician? Bryce: No, and I think that's what people like. But I mean, people voted for Trump because he was seen as a non-establishment type guy. Nationally, Bryce is a newbie; but this isn’t his first electoral rodeo. So, let’s check his claim that he is not a politician. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc No clear definition Dictionaries aren’t much help on this claim, given how widely the definitions of politician vary: Merriam-Webster A person experienced in the art or science of government; especially one actively engaged in conducting the business of a government. Dictionary.com A person who is active in party politics. Safire’s Political Dictionary One who engages in a career either in government or in a political party on a full-time, usually professional basis. Vocabulary.com A person who campaigns for or holds a position in government. But the more, and more deeply, involved you become in politics, the closer you are to being a politician -- a label many want to avoid. "In common current parlance, the word definitely has taken on a pejorative connotation," said Wendy Scattergood, a political science professor at St. Norbert College in DePere, Wis. "People use it as an easy way of calling somebody a bad name." On his fourth run For Bryce’s part, his campaign defended Bryce’s claim by saying he has been an ironworker and union member for 20 years. On one level, it’s easy to argue that the Racine-area resident is not a politician — he has never held public office. But in the space of just over two years, Bryce ran for three different offices, including two that are partisan: 1. August 2012: Bryce lost, 70 percent to 30 percent, in the Democratic primary for an open seat in the Wisconsin Assembly. 2. February 2013: Ten candidates, including Bryce, ran for three seats on the Racine Unified School Board. Four of them, including Bryce, were eliminated in the primary. 3. November 2014: Bryce lost in the general election for an open seat in the state Senate. He was defeated, 61 percent to 39 percent, by a Republican who formerly held the seat. To Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee political science professor and former Democratic state lawmaker, Bryce seems more like "a wanna-be politician." "It’s easier to say who is a politician," Lee said, referring to current elected officials in jobs that pay more or less a full-time salary. "Short of that, it sort of becomes a rhetorical somersault." But his current campaign means Bryce is now making his fourth run for public office in six years — arguably, enough to make him a perennial candidate. And running for Congress is a much larger venture than school board, or even the statehouse. "There’s not an obvious point when a person becomes a politician," said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist, "but Bryce has done enough things that he’s clearly moving toward that category." Taegan Goddard, publisher of Political Wire, was stronger. "If you continue to run, you’re spending a decent amount of effort trying to win public office — you’re a politician in that case," he said, adding: "If you’re going to spend that much time running for a congressional seat," he added, "that is a full-time job." Indeed, for Bryce to flatly reject the label of politician as he did on Showtime, verges on disingenuous. In the eyes of a typical ironworker who has never run for public office, Bryce’s four runs might make him look very much like a politician. And he hasn’t been working the iron during 2018, his campaign told us, as he runs full time for Ryan’s seat. More Randy Bryce fact-checks: His campaign staff "first to unionize in the history of politics." Mostly True. Under his own bill, Trump's family could not have come to U.S. Half True. Ryan hasn’t held a public town hall in the district in 600 days. Mostly True. Moreover, Bryce’s campaign says it has raised $5.5 million, while winning endorsements from the likes of a former presidenetial candidate -- U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders -- and national unions such as the United Auto Workers. That’s high-level stuff, not just a citizen tossing his hat in the ring for a part-time gig on the local school board. And while Bryce hasn’t won public office or held a government position, he has been active in party politics; he is currently chairman of the veterans caucus of the Wisconsin Democratic Party and first vice chairman of the Racine County Democratic Party. Our rating Bryce says he is not a politician. The ironworker and candidate for Ryan’s U.S. House seat has not been elected to public office and has not held a government position. And there is no universal definition of politician. But Bryce, who is active in the Democratic Party, is making his fourth run for public office in the past six years. And his current run is by far the most involved -- as the nearly $5 million he has raised, his national endorsements and leaving his job to campaign full time would attest. Bryce’s statement has some element of truth but is misleading. We rate it Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Randy Bryce	None	None	None	2018-05-16T06:00:00	2018-05-06	['None']

pomt-06627	"The Green Bay Packers are a socialist organization."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/18/scott-keyes/left-leaning-think-tank-writer-says-green-bay-pack/	An opinion article by a left-leaning think tank kicked off the National Football League season by positing a provocative theory about the defending Super Bowl champions. The Sept. 10, 2011 column was written by Scott Keyes of ThinkProgress.org, a website of the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The fund, a Washington, D.C. think tank, is run by John Podesta, who served as chief of staff for President Bill Clinton. Keyes argued that the NFL is strong partly because it employs what he described as seven progressive policies, such as revenue sharing and a salary cap. He closed with a bolder statement, declaring: "Last year’s Super Bowl champions, the Green Bay Packers, are a socialist organization." Wait a minute. Curly Lambeau and Karl Marx kin? We’ve never heard socialism discussed much by cheese head-wearing tailgaters or the ex-jocks on ESPN. So, let’s examine the makeup of what some football fans regard as America’s Team and see if Keyes’ claim, which might seem like a Hail Mary pass, scores a touchdown. Socialism -- at least some form of it -- has a significant history in Wisconsin. In 1910, Milwaukee elected the first Socialist mayor of a major U.S. city and the nation’s first Socialist congressman. But socialism isn’t easily defined. Merriam-Webster says it advocates "collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and the distribution of goods." Encyclopedia Britannica says socialism "calls for public rather than private ownership or control of property and natural resources." The definitions vary enough that, in August 2011, 29 percent of New Jersey registered voters polled by Rutgers University said President Barack Obama is a socialist. As for what might make the Packers a socialist organization, Keyes asserted in his column that the team has three unique traits: It is community owned, nonprofit and has rules to prevent any individuals from taking control of it. We asked the 24-year-old Stanford-educated reporter, who hails from Cincinnati Bengals territory, if he wanted to elaborate on his theory. He correctly noted that the Packers’ 112,158 shareholders receive no dividend on their original investment. But he wasn’t quite right when he said they have no voting rights -- they have limited rights, including voting for members of the team’s board of directors. So, that’s the case made by Keyes. We posed the question to Jason Wied, the Packers’ vice president of administration/general counsel. He said that, although the team is community owned in the sense that it is owned by shareholders, the shareholders cannot benefit financially in any manner from the team. "In some way, I suppose we are a blend of the best of the various economic systems/theories -- our structure and system results in a self-sufficient, community-focused enterprise that can’t be bought, sold, or otherwise leveraged for personal gain," Wied said in an email. "Instead, this is an organization whose only business is staying in business. Any profits are reinvested in the organization or given to charity." So, Wied emphasized that while the Packers are community owned, Packers shareholders cannot benefit tangibly from the team. That’s different from a socialist enterprise, in which owners or members would expect to receive a share of what that enterprise produces. Beyond the joy of Super Bowl victories and the agony of near-misses, Packers shareholders get little more than the opportunity to buy "exclusive shareholder merchandise" and tours of team facilities as part of the annual shareholder meeting. Next, we consulted two experts. University of Wisconsin-Madison sociologist Erik Olin Wright, who teaches about socialism and is president of the American Sociological Society, called Keyes’ claim a "perfectly reasonable characterization." Here are three points he made. 1. Community ownership kept the Packers in Green Bay. Had the team been privately owned in the 1940s and 1950s, when the franchise was in financial jeopardy, profit motive would have led a private owner to move the team to a larger market. Perhaps. It’s certainly easier for an individual owner to move a franchise than it would be convincing shareholders to approve a move. But shared ownership is only one facet of a socialist organization. 2. Under the team’s bylaws, if the Packers were ever sold, proceeds would go not into someone’s pocket, but to support the Green Bay Packers Foundation, which distributes grants to organizations in Wisconsin. (Shareholders voted to change the beneficiary -- which had been an American Legion Post in Green Bay -- in 1997. That was the same year they decided to hold the fourth and most recent stock sale in team history, although another is being considered.) This Packers characteristic is somewhat socialistic -- members of the organization wouldn’t benefit from a sale of the team but, through the foundation, the community at large would. 3. The team is not a capitalist organization because "it doesn’t maximize profits. It’s organized to support the sporting needs of the community." It’s true that, rather than making an owner more rich, Packer profits support "the community" in that they are reinvested in the team. But the Packers, like for-profit NFL teams, take advantage of market-driven revenue options such as season ticket seat licenses and upgrading Lambeau Field to make it a year-round tourist destination. In 2011-2012, the Packers generated a franchise-record $282.6 million in revenue and made $12 million in profit from operations. Those gains weren’t made by pursuing socialist principles. We also spoke to Marquette University law professor Matthew Parlow, whose specialties include sports law. He made three points in stating the Packers are not a socialist organization: 1. Reinvesting profits into the operation makes the Packers not a socialist organization, but simply a nonprofit one. As we’ve established, the profits certainly are not shared with the shareholders, as they would be in a socialist organization. In that sense, the Packers are like most any nonprofit that seeks to maximize contributions and minimize expenses. 2. The owners of a socialist organization have a significant say in running the organization, but Packers shareholders have virtually none. Indeed, when it comes to day-to-day operations, Packers shareholders have no say. 3. The members of a socialist enterprise draw benefits from the enterprise, but Packers shareholders can’t sell or otherwise derive benefits from their stock. After our consultations, we checked back with Keyes. He acknowledged that, although he’s a football fan, he’s not an expert on the Packers’ form of ownership. He admitted, for example, that he had wrongly assumed that season tickets came with being a shareholder. He said his main point was that the Packers, while "not a perfectly or purely socialist" organization, were far more socialistic than all of the other NFL teams, primarily because they are owned by 112,000 people, not controlled by a single owner. So, Keyes is moving the goal posts a bit, now characterizing the Packers as more socialistic than other NFL teams, rather than stating flatly that the team is a socialist organization. Well, did Keyes complete his Hail Mary pass? The reporter for a left-leaning website said the Green Bay Packers "are a socialist organization." His argument gains some support from the team’s community ownership, nonprofit status and the fact that the team’s assets would go to a charitable foundation if the unthinkable ever happened. Even a Packers executive acknowledged that the Packers organization is a blend of economic systems. But the fact that the Packers are different than any other NFL team doesn’t make it a socialist organization. Although it pours profits back into the operation, the team is highly capitalistic in its pursuit of maximum revenue. Moreover, if the Packers were a socialist organization, its shareholders would have a significant say in running the team and derive tangible benefits from it. But their say is small and the tangible benefits are token. Upon further review, Keyes’ long pass was completed -- but for a first down, not a touchdown. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-01458	Says Bruce Braley "threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto (his) property."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/02/joni-ernst/did-bruce-braley-threaten-sue-over-rogue-chickens/	We know why the chicken crossed the road, but what happened after it crossed into Bruce Braley’s yard? A televised debate on Sept. 28 (and a later mention on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show) brought a months-old incident involving a congressman from Iowa, a lawyer and some rogue chickens back to the national stage. It’s one of Iowa Republicans’ favorite anecdotes -- that Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Bruce Braley got into a dispute with a neighbor because her chickens wandered onto his vacation property, a lake house in Holiday Lake, Iowa. There’s a website, BraleyChicken.com, and reports of promotional rubber chickens. Karl Rove’s conservative political action committee American Crossroads released an ad in July attacking Braley over the dispute. In Des Moines on Sept. 28, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst was well prepared with a quip about what the chicken incident says about Braley as a leader. Ernst and Braley are vying to succeed retiring Democrat Tom Harkin in one of the nation’s tightest and most-watched Senate contests. "Congressman, you threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto your property," Ernst said. "You’re talking about bipartisanship. How do we expect as Iowans to believe that you will work across the aisle when you can’t walk across your yard?" "That’s just not true," Braley replied. "I never threatened to sue anyone." The chicken incident, which came to light in July, has been well reported. But we wondered about their disagreement at the debate. Did Braley actually threaten to sue or not? There was a real dispute over chickens, but we didn't find evidence for a lawsuit threatened against the neighbor. The backstory The Braleys’ neighbor, Pauline Hampton, keeps chickens in her backyard as pets and therapy animals. These chickens were previously unfenced and would occasionally wander onto the Braleys’ property, and Braley’s wife, Carolyn, claimed she could smell them. Hampton says she did not know that the chickens were bothering her neighbors until this past spring, when Carolyn Braley told Hampton that she would be filing a complaint to the neighborhood homeowner’s association. The neighborhood rules say, "No animals or birds, other than household pets, shall be kept on any lot." (The Braleys weren’t the only Holiday Lake residents who had problems with the chickens, according to Yahoo and the Washington Post, both of which interviewed other Holiday Lake residents.) Carolyn Braley’s complaint came up at the neighborhood association board meeting in May. The board ruled that the chickens are indeed pets and Hampton could keep them, as long as she fenced them into her yard. Problem solved? Well, not quite. The lawyer It doesn’t appear that any legal action was taken, so why do Republicans keep saying Braley threatened to sue over the chickens? After the matter was settled, the conservative Iowa Republican, broke the story after it acquired a series of emails. They show that Braley contacted the neighborhood association’s lawyer about a week after the board’s decision about Hampton’s chickens, complaining about the board’s "lack of action" and saying he believes "chickens are not pets and should not be permitted at Holiday Lake." The Iowa Republican treated these emails as a smoking gun. However, these emails -- among the lawyer, the neighborhood association board and Braley -- do not say anywhere that Braley was considering a lawsuit. In fact, they say the opposite. The lawyer, Thomas Lacina, writes: "The implication from Mr. Braley was that he wants to avoid a ‘litigious situation.' " Iowa Republicans say that the fact that Braley, a former trial lawyer, hinted at a "litigious situation" is evidence enough that he was considering a lawsuit -- but it still doesn’t definitively prove it. One interpretation of the email is that Braley said to the lawyer he wants to "avoid a litigious situation," but he will sue if he has to. But another interpretation is that Braley told the lawyer he planned to "avoid a litigious situation" under all circumstances. Point is, we don't know what was going on in Braley's head or the details of private conversations he had with his wife and the lawyer -- and neither does Ernst. (By the way -- Jeff Patch, the author behind the Iowa Republican story, is now the communications director for the Iowa Republican Party.) A spokesman for Braley told us that "a lawsuit was never part of the picture at all -- nor was there ever any threat of a lawsuit. Any claims to the contrary are false." "I just reached out to somebody I knew expecting to get a phone call back and instead this thing blows up," Braley told the Washington Post. In an interview with PolitiFact, Hampton said Braley never threatened to sue her -- though she was under the impression that he threatened to sue the neighborhood association board. In a local newspaper, the Quad City Times, one board member said he thought a lawsuit was in the air, while the board’s vice president said he never thought that was a serious possibility. We called the neighborhood association board, but they declined to comment and hung up the phone. We also want to note that the original Iowa Republican story says the association’s lawyer billed the board nearly $1,700 over the dispute, but the budget document does not specify that the costs directly pertained to Braley’s interaction with the lawyer. Additionally, the board vice president told the Quad City Times that the figure wasn’t entirely accurate, and the association's lawyer "handles a number of chores and has a monthly budget." Our ruling Ernst said Braley "threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto (his) property." Some might not like the way Braley and his wife handled a dispute with a neighbor -- by going to the neighborhood association and then consulting the association's lawyer. Even so, there is no material evidence that Braley threatened a lawsuit against the neighbor or was even considering one. Even the neighbor says that. We rate Ernst’s claim False.

pomt-14332	Stephen Zappala is "the only DA in our state to convict an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/28/stephen-zappala/messy-case-center-western-pa-attorney-general-cand/	A candidate for attorney general from western Pennsylvania has spent a quarter of a million dollars running ads in the Philadelphia area branding himself as a former prosecutor who’s tough on cops. In a new TV advertisement for Stephen Zappala, a Democrat and the district attorney of Allegheny County, a narrator says Zappala is "the only DA in our state to convict an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide." The idea that only one police officer in Pennsylvania had been convicted of criminal homicide was surprising. So we decided to check the claim. The ad refers to the 1995 shooting death of Jerry Jackson, an unarmed black man stopped by police for driving the wrong way on a one-way street in Pittsburgh. Investigators said John Charmo, a white former police officer with the Pittsburgh Housing Authority, shot Jackson 13 times with his service weapon in a tunnel following a high-speed chase. Charmo wasn’t immediately charged under the previous district attorney. But the case was re-opened by Zappala in 1999 after Jackson’s family discovered video evidence of the shooting via a civil case. The officer was subsequently charged with homicide. In 2001, a jury deadlocked and Zappala feared another jury would acquit, so he worked out a plea deal with Charmo. The officer pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 11 1/2 to 23 months behind bars -- a fraction of the amount of time he would have been sentenced to had he been convicted on a murder charge. Zappala’s campaign for attorney general contends that under Pennsylvania law, a guilty plea of involuntary manslaughter is legally a conviction of criminal homicide. In this case, it resulted in what his campaign manager called "substantial" prison time that kept Charmo off the police force. "This case happened more than a decade before Ferguson or any of the other high profile incidents that sparked the Black Lives Matter movement," Zappala’s campaign manager Marty Marks said. "Which is the point of the ad’s message." Zappala’s campaign made the $250,000 ad buy and commercials began running this week in the Philadelphia area. His primary opponent Josh Shapiro, a Montgomery County commissioner, also began airing TV ads this week. Northampton District Attorney John Morganelli is also seeking the Democratic nomination while Joe Peters, a former prosecutor, and John Rafferty, a state senator, are running on the Republican side. Zappala’s campaign claims the guilty plea on the Charmo case sets their candidate apart, but the Pittsburgh Citizen Police Review Board that analyzes complaints against police officers says the claim is "a stretch." "[The Charmo case] was so very, very messy," said Beth Pittinger, executive director of the Review Board. "To compress that accurately into a political ad would be very difficult." Marks pointed to a Washington Post analysis of 5,000 police-involved shootings since 2005 that found 54 officers nationwide were criminally charged and, of those, 11 were convicted. None of those convictions were in Pennsylvania. At least two other officers in Pennsylvania besides Charmo have pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter on charges related to actions they took on duty that resulted in the death of another person. In both of those cases -- one in Coopersburg and one in Williamsport -- the officers were guilty of hitting and killing a person while drive at a high rate of speed in their police cruisers. Marks said it’s a "false equivalency" to compare officers who got into a car accident that resulted in a loss of life with the case of Charmo who shot Jackson 13 times. Additionally, Easton police officer Scott Cameron pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter after he shot and killed John E. Rapp in 1998. But that case was prosecuted by the state attorney general, not a district attorney. Our ruling Zappala’s campaign made the claim that he is "the only DA in our state to convict an on-duty police officer of criminal homicide." That claim was referring to the case of Officer Charmo, who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in 2001 and ultimately spent less than a year in prison. Two other police officers in different counties have also pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, but both were after an officer hit someone with their vehicle. Zappala’s campaign left out context that Charmo pleaded guilty and that two other officers also were guilty of the same charge as Charmo. But he does appear to be the only DA in Pennsylvania who won a conviction of an on-duty police officer in a shooting incident. We rule the claim Half True.

pomt-00254	Says marijuana is "legal in most states in this country."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/oct/05/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-marijuana-legal-most-states/	During a stump speech at country music superstar Willie Nelson’s September 29, 2018, rally in Austin, for U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman told a crowd of more than 50,000 supporters that marijuana use is legal in most states. O’Rourke set up the claim at the "Turn out for Texas" rally by describing the nation's "war on drugs" as a "war on people, and some people more than other people." He was talking about people of color, he explained. "Only some are getting arrested," said O’Rourke, the Democrat challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. "Only some are doing time. Only some are checking a box on an application form that makes it that less likely that they'll get that job. Only some will not qualify for Pell Grants for possession of a substance that is legal in most states in this country." The way O’Rourke summed up marijuana laws, which vary by state, territory and depth, made our ears perk, so we asked his campaign about the claim. Chris Evans, communications director for O’Rourke’s campaign, shared with PolitiFact Texas in an email Business Insider and ABC News reports to support the congressman’s claim, but their evidence doesn’t show that marijuana use is legal across-the-board in most states. "As of today, marijuana is illegal in only 20 states," Evans said in the email. "That's less than half of the states. Beto has called for ending the federal prohibition on marijuana and co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to achieve this." The articles explain that using marijuana recreationally is legal in nine states, while medical marijuana is legal in 30. Oklahoma in June became the 30th and latest state to authorize medical marijuana. In a deep dive on marijuana legislation across the country, the National Conference of State Legislatures reaches the same count. Voters in North Dakota and Michigan this November will have the choice to approve adult use of marijuana, while voters in Utah and Missouri will decide whether to authorize medical marijuana, according to Forbes. We also posed questions to Mason Tvert, spokesman with the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington D.C.-based organization whose mission includes increasing "public support for non-punitive, non-coercive marijuana policies." Tvert told us that if we're talking legal marijuana use for individuals 21 and older, that's the case in only nine states (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts) plus Washington, D.C. and the Northern Mariana Islands. Also, 30 states allow medical marijuana use with a doctor's recommendation, he said. Nineteen states "have laws on the books that acknowledge the medical value of medical cannabis, but fall short," the organization states on its website. Tvert explained that in those states some marijuana use is legal when it's for medical purposes, but there are limits on products authorized and who can access them. More specific, in some states, medical marijuana may be legal, but "they don't have a legal form of production," or it's only available for a tiny number of people and for certain conditions, he said. After we read O’Rourke’s claim to Tvert, he said the claim doesn’t strike him as incorrect. But how could O'Rourke have been more clear? Had he said most states have made marijuana legal in some form, "it would be undeniably 100 percent accurate," Tvert said. Our ruling O’Rourke said marijuana is legal in most states. Only nine states have legalized marijuana use for all adults. But 30 have some form of legal use for medical purposes, giving O'Rourke's statement an element of truth.

pomt-01867	Says Congressman Jack Kingston voted to "raise his pay seven times."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/11/david-perdue/perdue-pay-raise-claim-falls-short/	Veteran U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah and millionaire businessman David Perdue are stepping up their attacks as decision day rapidly approaches in the GOP primary runoff for the U.S. Senate. Kingston and Perdue are locked in what’s arguably the most contentious and closely watched Georgia contest on the July 22 primary runoff ballot. Charges and countercharges are flying. One of the charges being leveled by Perdue, the front-runner in the May primary, is that Kingston has wasted tax dollars on earmarks "all while voting to raise his own pay seven times." PolitiFact has already examined the claim about Kingston’s record on earmarks. Now, we’ll delve into the second part of the claim that’s currently airing on television and radio and answer the question: Did Kingston, a member of Congress since 1993, vote to raise his own congressional pay seven times? With public opinion of Congress in the tank, House and Senate members have been loath to raise their own pay. That’s likely why congressional raises are a campaign issue, not just this year and not just in Kingston’s race. That also may explain why fact-checking the claim is more complicated than simply pulling legislation and checking individual House and Senate members’ votes. First, a little history. Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution requires members of Congress to set their own pay. From 1789 to 1968, members of Congress passed specific bills that raised their pay 22 times, according to a June 2014 report by the Congressional Research Service. Members of Congress were initially paid a daily rate -- $6 a day in 1789 -- and drew their first annual salary -- $1,500 -- in 1815. Forty years later, they were drawing $3,000 a year. But since passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, members of the House and Senate have been eligible for annual raises without having to be on-record voting for them. The raises are calculated by a formula that involves changes in private-sector wages and salaries. They are automatic each Jan. 1 unless Congress votes to reject the adjustment or votes to change the amount. According to the Congressional Research Service, lawmakers have let their pay be increased automatically 13 times. They’ve also voted to decline or delay their raises during 11 years, including in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Kingston voted with the majority eight times. That is, Kingston voted to limit his pay, not increase it. In January 2009, congressional salaries went from $169,300 to their current $174,000. (And unless they vote again to decline a raise, lawmakers’ pay is set to increase 1.6 percent, or $2,800, in January, according to recent estimates.) So how can Perdue say that Kingston voted to raise his own pay seven times when automatic pay raises were established in 1989 and Kingston’s only been in Congress since Jan. 3, 1993? Here’s the simple answer: Perdue’s not counting Kingston’s votes in favor of raising congressional salaries. Instead, Perdue’s counting procedural votes Kingston cast. Those votes blocked efforts to nix the automatic pay raises. PolitiFact checked a similar claim in 2011 when U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV came under attack by Republican rival George LeMieux in Florida’s U.S. Senate race. That was rated a Half True. Perdue’s claim, like LeMieux’s, is based largely on procedural votes. The votes by Kingston took place in 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007, Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said. We'll try to explain a complicated process as simply as we can. A member of Congress -- for years it was U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah -- pushes for an up-or-down vote on continuing the automatic pay raises. In most years, a procedural vote is used to effectively block that effort. Alyson Heyrend, Matheson's then-spokeswoman, explained the procedural move to PolitiFact in 2011. "Matheson each year sought a 'no' vote on a procedural vote on Ordering the Previous Question," she told Politifact in an email. "Had a majority voted 'no' he would have then offered the amendment to deny the annual congressional pay raise." Matheson was concerned "that the public isn't able to see Congress take an open, up-or-down vote on whether or not to raise their salaries," Heyrend said. Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union and Foundation, said it’s important to understand that any efforts on the pay raises are always tied to larger bills dealing with appropriations. "People of varying ideologies and causes would have numerous reasons for supporting or opposing the bill," Sepp said, meaning that votes for or against a bill could have something or nothing to do with the pay raise. In 1999, for instance, Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R, Ky., argued that lawmakers shouldn’t take a $3,800 raise, boosting their pay to $145,000 a year, saying: "I have a hard time voting to increase my pay when people in my district are earning an average income of $25,000 a year." According to press reports from the time, Fletcher’s move was defeated on a procedural vote, 250-173. House journals show Kingston voting with the majority. The journals also show Kingston voting "Yes" with the majority on similar procedural votes in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Those votes blocked efforts by Matheson, Fletcher and others to put forth an amendment to stop the pay raise. And even if they had not been blocked, a majority would have still had to go along with their amendment, several congressional experts told us. So, did Kingston vote seven times to give himself a raise? No. He didn’t have to because the raises are automatic unless Congress votes to turn them down as they have for five years. Did he vote to stop a push for an up-or-down vote on accepting or rejecting the raises? Yes. He did that seven times. But he also voted with the majority to deny or delay the raises eight times. Greg Dolan, Kingston’s congressional spokesman, said: "Representative Kingston was not ‘voting to increase his pay’ any more than he was voting against renaming the moon." "Just because a potential amendment may have been introduced, voting to get on with the work of the House is not equivalent to voting against any and all other extraneous issues," he said. Dickey, Perdue’s spokesman, said the pay raises were inappropriate and Kingston knew that as far back as 1992 when he told a Savannah paper that congressional raises should be tied to passage of a balanced budget Our ruling Congress has created a system that allows its members to receive annual raises without having to vote on them. Perdue is off base to say Kingston voted to raise his pay seven times. Kingston cast procedural votes -- with the majority -- that effectively allowed Congress’ automatic pay raises to stand in some years. Kingston did not cast direct votes to raise his pay as Perdue’s ads imply. When there was a direct vote to decline pay increases, Kingston voted with the majority to do just that eight times. There’s a bit of truth to Perdue’s claim. But there’s even more context missing. We rate Perdue’s claim Mostly False.	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2014-07-11T00:00:00	2014-07-08	['None']
pomt-01543	"You have 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/sep/16/rhue-reis/congressional-candidate-rhue-reis-says-200000-4000/	During a recent broadcast of "State of the State," a Rhode Island public access TV show, the subject of homeless veterans came up, in a round about sort of way. The show, which aired Sept. 7, 2014, featured a debate between U.S. Rep. James Langevin, a Democrat, and Rhue Reis, the Republican who would like to replace him. The two were talking about what to do about the children coming across the U.S.-Mexico border. Reis said they should be sent back to their respective countries because the United States has too many problems of its own. "It needs to stop for their safety and because we cannot handle the influx. We have a much more difficult time taking care of our own," he said. "When you have 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day, we can't take care of them and yet we want to bring in another influx of tens or hundreds of thousands of people, illegal immigrants? We can't even take care of our own." We wondered whether Reis was correct about the number of homeless veterans. When we asked him for his source, Reis referred us to a web page from the National Coalition for the Homeless, which featured a fact sheet written in 2009. It pegs the count at 130,000 to 200,000 per night -- substantially less than Reis’s 200,000 to 400,000 number. .As we searched for more information, we found several different and equally dated estimates from other advocacy groups for veterans and the homeless, some lower, some higher For example, in 2007, the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the Homelessness Research Institute used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to estimate the numbers at 192,000 in 2004, 194,254 in 2005 and 195,827 in 2006. But that same group now says the nightly number of veterans who are homeless is just under 50,000. That’s far lower than Reis’ number. Why the dramatic drop? It turns out that the newest numbers come from the U.s. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. Since January 2009, they've conducted an annual "Point-in-Time Count" of the homeless who spend the night in shelters or are on the street. It's done by groups that regularly work with the homeless and who have become very good at tracking them down. "The bottom line is, until 2009 we didn't have accurate counts for veteran homelessness," said Emanuel Cavallaro, spokesman for the National Alliance. Before direct counting was done, and the people doing the counting became adept at identifying whether a homeless person was a veteran, the estimate was done by the VA. "That [VA] data was very problematic and wasn't very reliable." So while the VA was estimating 131,000 homeless veterans per night in 2009, the point-in-time census of the homeless put the number at 75,609. It rose to 76,329 the following year in the midst of the Great Recession and has been declining ever since, according to the point-in-time counts. The count for January 2014: 49,933. The number has been declining, said HUD spokesman Patrick Rodenbush, because there has been a concerted effort in recent years by the Obama administration and Congress to get housing for homeless veterans. "In an era of budget cuts, this is one area where Congress has been fully funding the president's requests," he said. "This gets bipartisan support." Our ruling Rhue Reis said, "You have 200,000 to 400,000 military veterans on the street in this country on any given day." Reis inaccurately cited a 2009 study, which said the number at that time wasn’t more than 200,000. The latest, best data suggests that the current number is closer to 50,000. Homelessness among veterans is a serious problem, but the numbers are much lower than Reiss claimed. We rate his statement False.

pomt-00866	Says "Ted Kennedy sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/13/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-ted-kennedy-undercut-reagan-back-door-lin/	The balance of power between Congress and the president has been topic No. 1 this week after 47 Republican senators signed a letter designed to undercut a nuclear deal with Iran. That deal has yet to be written, but the senators warned Iran that any agreement could be reversed "by the stroke of a pen" by a future president or by an act of Congress. In the war of words that followed, one newspaper tagged the senators as traitors, while conservatives shot back that Democrats have also meddled in foreign policy in the past. A reader asked us about an example making the rounds in conservative media. Fox News host Megyn Kelly, the Newsbusters website, and Rush Limbaugh all have pointed to an episode involving Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and Republican President Ronald Reagan that purportedly took place in 1983. In Limbaugh’s account, "Ted Kennedy sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact, essentially saying that Reagan was a reckless cowboy and worse, that the Democrats are gonna do their best to rein him in." In the past, we have reached the Limbaugh show through the company that distributes the program. We did so again and did not hear back. Still, we were able to find much of the story through our own reporting and research, and there’s a lot more uncertainty to the episode -- including if it ever happened at all -- than Limbaugh’s comments suggest. Step back to 1983 In early 1983, Reagan’s plan to place medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe generated great concern among voters in the West and within the leadership of the USSR. In this tense period, Viktor Chebrikov, then head of the Soviet spy agency, addressed a memo to Yuri Andropov, the general secretary of the Communist Party and the USSR’s top leader. The memo purports to convey what Kennedy’s "close friend and trusted confidant J.Tunney" had to say about Kennedy’s views when visiting Moscow. J. Tunney would be former U.S. Sen. John Tunney, D-Calif. "Kennedy believes that, given the current state of affairs, and in the interest of peace, it would be prudent and timely to undertake the following steps to counter the militaristic politics of Reagan and his campaign to psychologically burden the American people," the memo said. Those steps included Andropov inviting Kennedy and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., for a meeting in Moscow. The purpose "would be to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA." In addition, Kennedy’s middleman suggested that Andropov come to the United States where he could do interviews on the big three broadcast networks and speak to the "peaceful intentions of the USSR." According to the memo, Kennedy’s goal was to "root out the threat of nuclear war, and to improve Soviet-American relations, so that they define the safety of the world." As a parting thought in the memo, Tunney said that Kennedy planned to run for president in 1988. Is the memo accurate? First of all, we note that while Limbaugh talked about a letter, there is no evidence that Kennedy ever sent one to Andropov. We asked the Senate Historical Office and the Reagan Library for any record of either a letter or overture made by Kennedy’s office to the Soviet leadership in 1983. Both found nothing. At the end of the day, without any independent documentation, assessing Limbaugh’s claim hinges on whether you believe the memo is telling the truth. The memo gained attention when it was the basis of a news report published in the Times of London in 1992. When the report came out, Tunney told the Times that it was "bullshit." We reached Tunney and he emphatically repeated that. "The idea that I would be handling contacts with Andropov is preposterous," Tunney said. "This memo is completely false." At the time, Tunney was no longer a senator but a private businessman; his friendship with Kennedy dated back to law school. He said that while he had made many trips to Moscow over the years and knew people in the KGB, the only political topic Kennedy ever asked him to broach with the Soviets was a deal to release dozens of dissidents. In exchange, Kennedy would make a speech at a university in one of the USSR’s republics in Central Asia. That took place several years earlier. Tunney said that some time after the memo emerged, Kennedy asked him if he knew anything about it and Tunney said "this is crazy." In 1992, a Boston Herald reporter reached Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan. Donovan said Kennedy’s office had made other efforts to meet with Andropov, but nothing ever came of it. According to the Herald, Donovan said "The rest of the memo is KGB fiction." Denials from anyone tied to Kennedy might be expected, but Kennedy does have a sort of character reference in the arena of foreign relations from a Reagan insider, the administration’s disarmament negotiator Max Kampelman. In his memoirs Entering New Worlds, Kampelman wrote that the Soviets liked working with Kennedy as a back-door conduit of information, and Kampelman welcomed the arrangement. "I learned that the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency of official," Kampelman wrote. In 1985, Reagan himself approved using Kennedy this way and a working relationship grew between Kampelman and Kennedy. While it is possible that the administration never caught wind of any contacts Tunney had with the KGB, it is worth noting that when the archivists at the Reagan Library searched the White House files on Kennedy, no episode involving the USSR in 1983 popped up. Smoke but no fire? In the Reagan years, Kenneth Adelman served as deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and then director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. We asked Adelman what he made of the KGB memo, and he dismissed it. He had no idea if an overture might have been made, but even it had, Adelman said it didn’t matter. "We knew senators were doing this sort of thing all the time and we ignored it," Adelman said. "We didn’t think it was important, and it wasn’t. The administration didn’t care about it." Stephen Cohen, a political scientist at Princeton University and New York University, suggested that KGB memos shouldn’t be taken at face value. "As someone who has worked for years in once closed Soviet-era archives, I can tell you that many false documents can be found there," Cohen told PunditFact. "As the saying goes, rubbish in, rubbish out." Our ruling In the context of a Republican letter to Iran, Limbaugh said that Kennedy sent a similar letter to Andropov in the 1980s that apologized for Reagan and begged the Soviets not to overreact. There is no evidence there ever was a letter from Kennedy. Limbaugh’s statement rests on a 1983 KGB memo that said there was a verbal overture from a friend of Kennedy's to meet with Andropov. Whether the memo was accurate or a KGB invention is deeply contested. We have a firm denial from the man who allegedly made the overture, and a Soviet archive researcher told us that memos of this sort are not always reliable. So Limbaugh was wrong about the letter, and spoke with great certainty about an event when its authenticity is very much in question. Overall, we rate the claim False.

pomt-02919	"Health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-health-insurance-more-expensive-m/	When President Barack Obama went to Boston on Oct. 30, 2013, to give a speech supporting his health care law amid a troubled website rollout, he chose the location carefully: Massachusetts was the state that enacted a universal health care law that Obama’s own proposal was based on. So it was natural that elected officials and pundits would begin to compare the Massachusetts plan with Obamacare. For the Nov. 3 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, host David Gregory invited Mitt Romney -- the former Republican governor who enacted the law and the 2012 presidential nominee -- to discuss the laws. Gregory noted that in 2007, when Romney was making his first presidential bid, he encouraged other states to consider the Massachusetts model, even though in the 2012 race, Romney became -- like most others in his party -- a fierce critic of Obama’s law, which was passed in 2010. Romney said the two laws are not identical, and he added that he still believes that states should be able to choose the approach that fits their circumstances. Some will like the Massachusetts approach, and some won’t, he said. The Massachusetts approach "teaches some important lessons some states are not going to want to follow," Romney said. "One lesson is health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country. Now, that’s something that Texas and Minnesota and Montana are not going to necessarily want to adopt." Is it true that health insurance is "more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country"? There are a number of ways to measure the cost of what Romney termed "health insurance." For answers, we turned to research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Here are a few of the categories that would seem to fit Romney’s definition. (Note: None of the categories here include the District of Columbia.) Employer-based health insurance for individuals • Employee share: Massachusetts ranks 1st among all states. • Employer share: Massachusetts ranks 10th among all states. • Combined employee and employer share: Massachusetts ranks 2nd among all states. (Only Alaska is higher.) Employer-based health insurance for families • Employee share: Massachusetts ranks 11th among all states. • Employer share: Massachusetts ranks 5th among all states. • Combined employee and employer share: Massachusetts ranks 2nd among all states. (Only Alaska is higher.) Individual-market insurance per person • Monthly premiums: Massachusetts ranks first. So, overall, health insurance costs are indeed higher in Massachusetts than almost anywhere else. Still, it’s worth noting that while Massachusetts’ universal health care plan is likely a factor in producing high costs, it’s probably not the only factor. The state ranked second nationally in per capita personal income in 2012 (Connecticut was first), and it ranked eighth in the nation in highest cost of living. Whenever residents of a state make a lot of income and pay a lot for consumer goods generally, it’s likely to follow that health care will be relatively expensive as well. In addition, Massachusetts ranks first among states in health care expenditures per capita, and most of the rest of the top 10 consists of other relatively affluent, northeastern and mid-Atlantic states: Connecticut, Maine, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. (The others are Alaska and North Dakota.) Our ruling Romney said, "health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country." The numbers show he’s basically correct that Massachusetts does have higher premiums than almost every other state. On some measures, though, Alaska outranks Massachusetts. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2013-11-03T13:40:35	2013-11-03	['Massachusetts']

pomt-01523	Says Tom Steyer is a "California billionaire who stands to profit by blocking Keystone" and "is spending big to help" Bruce Braley.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/19/american-crossroads/would-billionaire-environmentalist-tom-steyer-prof/	It’s Republican strategist Karl Rove versus billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer in Iowa. Rove’s group, American Crossroads, is up with a new ad that claims the Democratic Senate candidate there, Rep. Bruce Braley, is doing the bidding for Steyer by voting against the Keystone XL oil pipeline. "Now, a California billionaire who stands to profit by blocking Keystone is spending big to help Braley’s campaign," the ad says. "Bruce Braley, he’s on the side of billionaire special interests, not Iowa workers." Steyer is identified in the ad as the California billionaire. He has run ads helping Braley and against his opponent, Republican Joni Ernst. Rove’s group is a super PAC backed by millions of dollars in undisclosed donors, so American Crossroads warning voters about "special interest" dollars in the race sounds a little to us like, "Pot, meet kettle." But regardless, we wanted to review American Crossroads' attack against Steyer. Would he "stand to profit" if Keystone is killed? We reviewed the evidence. For those unfamiliar with Steyer, he’s the billionaire behind NextGen Climate Change who has promised $100 million to Democrats in the midterm elections. Some have called him the Democrats’ Koch brothers of the election cycle. How, exactly, would an environmentalist make money by blocking Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry oil from the Alberta tar sands through Nebraska to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico? American Crossroads sent us quite a few news stories that showed Steyer wasn’t always the hardcore environmentalist he now portrays himself as. Steyer made his fortune at Farallon Capital Management, an investment group he started in the 1980s. According to a Washington Post profile and other reports, Farallon Capital heavily invested in energy throughout Steyer’s time there, including fossil fuels. Steyer left the company in the fall of 2012. "Investments included BP and mining companies in the United States and around the world," the Post wrote. "Farallon's second-largest holding in September 2012, a month before Steyer announced his departure, was a $220 million investment in the oil-and-gas giant Nexen." Also included in Farallon’s investment portfolio was Kinder Morgan, a company that owned a pipeline connecting the Alberta tar sands to the Pacific coast. The pipeline is considered a rival to Keystone XL. So case closed, right? Not so fast. As we said, Steyer left Farallon Capital in 2012. But it wasn’t just that he left, it’s how he left. When he stepped down as a co-managing partner, Steyer directed Farallon Capital to divest his investments in the company from any of its holdings in tar sands and coal. That would have included the Kinder Morgan pipeline. Later in 2013, Steyer called for the company to divest his money from fossil fuels entirely. A spokeswoman for Steyer told the Post in June that process would conclude that month. Around the same time, Steyer took heat from Republicans for investing in an energy source he was simultaneously vilifying. In response, Steyer vowed to donate all the profits he made from Kinder Morgan pipeline to a charity. He announced in June he was donating $2 million to that cause. We don’t know if that was the full amount of the profit Steyer earned from his investment in the rival pipeline. But the ad from American Crossroads is prospective anyway, claiming that Steyer "stands to profit" from blocking Keystone. Steyer no longer has any way to directly earn money from the Kinder Morgan pipeline. And here’s the kicker: As of today, Farallon Capital Management no longer has any investment holdings in Kinder Morgan. Security and Exchange Commission filings for Farallon show $45 million worth of investments in Kinder Morgan through the end of 2013. But Kinder Morgan does not show up on the investment group’s portfolio for the first or second quarter of 2014. Our ruling American Crossroads said Steyer "stands to profit by blocking Keystone" and "is spending big to help" Braley’s Senate campaign. At one point, this might have been an accurate ad. Steyer’s former hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, had significant holdings in a company that owned a pipeline considered a rival to Keystone XL, and under Steyer’s direction, his investment group had a large stake in fossil fuels. However, Steyer has since left the investment group he started, and asked his company to divest any of his holdings from fossil fuels, including tar sands. He also donated his profits from the Kinder Morgan pipeline to charity. Further, as of 2014, Farallon is no longer invested in Keystone’s competitor, according to SEC filings. As far as we can tell, Steyer would not directly profit from Keystone’s demise going forward. So the evidence from American Crossroads falls short. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-00540	Says the California flag was supposed to be a pear, not a bear.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/18/breitbart/no-pear-was-not-original-symbol-california/	Did the conservative website Breitbart get snagged by a hoax? It sure looks that way. Breitbart’s man in California, senior editor Joel Pollak, posted a short item on June 14, 2015, about a Los Angeles Times op-ed that cast the state flag as the legacy of thieves, deserters and genocidal maniacs. We’ll skip the history lesson, but the bottom line of the op-ed was that the flag and its picture of a grizzly bear should be given the heave-ho. Pollak observed that ardent liberals have shown the bear some love, but what caught our eye was his closing line. "According to snopes.com, the inclusion of a bear in the flag was a mistake; it was supposed to be a pear." Soon after the article went live, a few readers commented that Breitbart had been snookered. The Snopes article, they said, was a ruse. The item Pollak cited held that the original founders of the California Republic wanted to use a pear as the central image on their new flag, but through a typo or bad penmanship, the first mock-up used a bear instead. The website provided its rendition of the initial concept. The Snopes article laid in some heavy hints that it was hokum. For starters, it listed the California rebel leaders as "Captain Jebediah Bartlett and his two lieutenants, Albert Bosc and Emmanuel d'Anjou." Snopes, the grand-daddy of the fact-checking sites in America, was founded in the 1990s to counteract the spread of rumors on the Web. This raises the question, why did it post a hoax of its own? Snopes' founders say it is to combat what they call False Authority Syndrome. "No single truth purveyor, no matter how reliable, should be considered an infallible font of accurate information," they wrote. "Folks make mistakes. Or they get duped. Or they have a bad day at the fact-checking bureau. Or some days they're just being silly." That message is on a page on their site, with the link posted at the bottom of the article about the California flag. To keep their own readers on their toes, Snopes seeded its website with a few ringers. It has written that Mr. Ed the talking horse was actually a zebra, that passengers on the Titanic watched a silent version of The Poseidon Adventure as their own ship went down, and that mobile homes were named after the city that first built them. Co-founder David Mikkelson told us that team Snopes put a lot of effort into making these articles as ridiculous and humorous as possible. The California pear item, posted around 2003, was one of the last to go up, and there are no plans to add more. "Given the plethora of fake news sites on the Web these days, our creating more stories to illustrate the pitfalls of false authority would seem awfully redundant," Mikkelson said. The pear story has been snagging the unwary since at least 2005. According to this blog post, the Long Beach Press Telegram repeated the tale in February that year. The blogger who reported that also wrote that he went to the trouble to research Captain Bartlett and Lieutenants Bosc and d’Anjou. After, dare we say, a fruitless effort, he ultimately found the link to the disclaimer on Snopes. Via Twitter, we asked Pollak at Breitbart about the pear reference. "Reported, at end, that @snopes said it," Pollack replied. "You’re ‘fact-checking’ me instead of @snopes? You need to put away the Fruit Loops." Here, we’re actually fact-checking the claim that Snopes in any way took the pear fable seriously. Pollak isn’t the first to pass along this hoax, nor likely will he be the last.

pomt-11839	"The No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing."	true	/florida/statements/2017/nov/08/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-right-about-need-more-nurses-state/	In the Florida governor’s race, both Republicans and Democrats have highlighted an issue facing the Sunshine State: a shortage of nurses. For months now, Republican Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam has highlighted a surprising factoid about Florida’s nursing workforce, often while emphasizing the importance of trade education and career training outside of a four-year bachelor’s degree. "The No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing," Putnam said Oct. 31 during a campaign stop at Whitey's Fish Camp in Fleming Island. Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (and Putnam’s possible opponent) has also mentioned a nursing shortage in the state, so we wanted to take a look at it. We found that Putnam’s claim is backed up by state data, and experts in Florida agreed that the shortage of nurses has been a problem since the 1990s. Nurses (most) wanted Data from the Department of Economic Opportunity shows that registered nurses have consistently topped the lists of monthly online job advertisements and annual job openings. Department spokeswoman Karen Smith told PolitiFact Florida the top online job advertisement in Florida has been registered nurses every month for the past seven years. We asked for a sample of that data and got a year’s worth of monthly reports for Help Wanted OnLine, a tool used by the Department to measure real-time labor demand. These reports are posted on the DEO’s site and updated monthly. The most recent month of data (October 2017) shows there were 13,619 online ads placed for registered nurses. The second-most popular ads sought retail salespersons at 7,207 postings, followed by "first-line supervisors" for retail sales workers with 6,467 ads. Putnam has also talked about the need for truck drivers, which place fourth for online job ads. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In addition, Florida's Statewide Demand Occupations List shows that registered nurses have consistently ranked as the most in-demand occupation since at least 2011. Mary Lou Brunell is the executive director of the Florida Center for Nursing, which was set up in 2001 by the Florida Legislature to address the nursing shortages in the state. In recent years, she said the problem has been exacerbated by a lack of students studying to become nurses, a shortage of faculty teaching future students, and an aging workforce and state population. "You put all those pieces together, and it’s just not getting better," said Dianne Morrison-Beedy, the former dean at the University of South Florida College of Nursing. The nursing workforce is also aging. According to a 2017 report from the Florida Center for Nursing, 44 percent of registered nurses are over the age of 50 and expected to retire in the next 5 to 10 years. The economic turnaround in the late 2000s also decreased the number of nurses in the workforce. When the economy plummeted in 2008, many people trained in nursing but not working returned to their job or delayed retirement. As the economy improved, there were once again more vacancies because those nurses returned home or retired. Brunell also said she’s also concerned about the need for licensed practical nurses, which work under the guidance of registered nurses or physicians. She said there’s been an increase in home care facilities, which is why she predicts more licensed practical nurses (LPNs) will be needed in the future. Morrison-Beedy said that in order to fix the problem, the focus has to be on the how to develop faculty and support for people who want to become nurses. In Florida, becoming a registered nurse requires either a two-year associate degree or a bachelor’s of science degree in nursing. "We need more students in the baccalaureate program, we need to provide financial support for students to go to school, and in order to do that we have to have enough faculty to teach those students," she said. "We want the best educated and the best kind of nurses because that’s where we’ll see better outcomes." Our ruling Putnam said the No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing. He’s right. The top online job advertisement in Florida has been registered nurses every month for the past seven years. Experts agreed that the shortage has been an issue for awhile in Florida.

pomt-03323	"The income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family’s incomes barely budged."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-top-1-percent-saw-incomes-quadru/	A reader asked us to check a dramatic statistic on income inequality from President Barack Obama’s recent speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill. "The income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family’s incomes barely budged," Obama said in the July 24, 2013, speech. When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, a spokesman pointed us to a study published in late 2011 by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan budget-analysis arm of Congress. The study looked at income trends between 1979 and 2007 for various income levels, including the top 1 percent. CBO found that over that period, the top 1 percent’s inflation-adjusted, after-tax income rose by a cumulative 275 percent. Over 28 years, that averages to almost a 10 percent increase each year. That’s not quite quadrupling -- a 300 percent increase would have been a quadrupling -- but Obama did say "nearly quadrupled," and we think that qualifies. As for Obama’s claim that the "typical family’s incomes barely budged," that seems on target, too. For the 60 percent of the population in the middle of the income scale -- that is, excluding the top one-fifth and the bottom one-fifth of earners -- the cumulative growth in inflation-adjusted, after-tax household income was just under 40 percent. That may sound like a healthy increase, but it actually averages to just 1.4 percent per year. While an income increase of 1.4 percent a year above inflation does mean the middle 60 percent advanced economically during the period studied, the increase was only about one-seventh as fast as it was for the top 1 percent. In this context, we think the description "barely budged" is reasonable. We should point out that the CBO’s findings about the top 1 percent were a little different than the conclusions we drew in a previous fact-check. But there’s a good reason why. We calculated that income for the top 1 percent grew between 1979 and 2008 by 169 percent, well below the 275 percent the CBO found. Our calculation was based on data compiled by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who are specialists in income inequality. However, the Piketty-Saez data set excluded capital gains. Capital gains refers to income earned from investments such as stocks, and the lion's share of the nation’s capital gains go to the very wealthy. The CBO data, unlike the data from Piketty and Saez, included capital gains income, so that explains the discrepancy. Our ruling Obama said "the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family’s incomes barely budged." Calculations by the CBO, a highly credible agency, show an increase of 275 percent for the top 1 percent, which is pretty close to quadrupling. And for average households, income rose by comparatively modest amounts. We rate the claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-07-25T16:58:50	2013-07-24	['None']
pomt-01234	Georgia ranks No. 9 in the rate of women murdered by men.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/nov/19/violence-policy-center/study-correct-georgias-gender-based-murder-rate/	Anyone who follows the constant drum beat of crime news in metro Atlanta might not be surprised by a new study that puts Georgia among the most dangerous states for a very specific crime: women who are murdered by men. A Violence Policy Center report released in September shows Georgia ranks ninth among all states, with a homicide rate of 1.66 per 100,000 women in 2012, the last year data is available. The national rate is 1.16 per 100,000. "We call on Georgia’s lawmakers to make it an urgent priority to keep guns away from domestic abusers and protect women from harm," Kathryn Grant, co-founder of GunSense Georgia said in a statement related to the study. "This is literally a matter of life and death." PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know if our state really ranks that high on the list for women murdered by men. We went straight to the website for the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Supplementary Homicide Reports. That data showed Georgia had 102 homicides in 2012 – 19 percent more than the 84 tallied in the Violence Policy Center report. The VPC’s study has a lower overall number because it takes that data and then weeds out crimes with more than one victim or perpetrator, said VPC policy analyst Marty Langley, who authored the report. An analysis of the SHR data, available only in hard copy from the FBI, confirms those numbers are accurate for incidents where one woman is killed by one man. James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor who has studied and analyzed such data for decades, said the adjustment oversimplifies the information. Taking a more narrow slice of victims also allows for further analysis of their characteristics such as age (the victim in Georgia was 38) and race (51 were black and 30 were white in Georgia). And for homicides where the data could be found, 69 percent of victims were killed with guns and 93 percent of them were murdered by someone they knew, the study found. "An overarching point we want to make with this study is that it’s a myth that a woman’s risk of homicide comes from being attacked by a stranger," said Kristen Rand, the group’s legislative director. "The risk of stranger homicide is really quite low." But missing from the report is another key fact: the risk of homicide in Georgia is among the highest for any victims. It’s easier to see in lists: Rank State 2012 Homicide Rate per 100,000, Females Murdered by Males 1 Alaska 2.57 2 South Carolina 2.06 3 Oklahoma 2.03 4 Louisiana 1.92 5 Mississippi 1.89 6 Nevada 1.83 7 Missouri 1.73 8 Arizona 1.70 9 Georgia 1.66 10 Tennessee 1.60 (Source: Violence Policy Center) Rank State 2012 Homicide Rate per 100,000, Overall 1 Louisiana 10.8 2 Mississippi 7.4 3 Alabama 7.1 4 Michigan 7.0 5 South Carolina 6.9 6 Missouri 6.5 7 Maryland 6.3 8 Delaware 6.2 9 Tennessee 6.0 10 (tie) Arkansas, Georgia 5.9 (Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics) Southern states such as Georgia dominate both lists, Fox said, because of factors beyond gender. Gun ownership rates are higher here. The South also has a long history of people solving personal conflicts with violence versus lawsuits, Fox said. And, he added, the region is also more diverse than much of the country, and murder rates by and against blacks are higher than those among whites. "The fact that most of the states on (the VPC) list are in the south is not so much an issue of male-female violence," Fox said. "It’s about homicide, generally." In summary, the data bears out the study’s findings that rank Georgia ninth in the nation for the rate of women killed by men. One caveat is that tally counts only single victims and perpetrators. It ignores some crimes it hopes to draw attention to, such as a former partner killing a woman before committing suicide or a man killing his ex-partner and a new love interest, if there are two victims. More importantly, the tally also fails to acknowledge Georgia’s dismal rank for the risk of homicide overall, and the other factors that contribute to it. The numbers are right, but it’s also true that there is more to the story. We rate the claim True.	None	Violence Policy Center	None	None	None	2014-11-19T00:00:00	2014-09-08	['None']
pomt-04436	Says Joe Biden "went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn't second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/biden-sympathized-and-wouldnt-second-guess-forced-/	Did Vice President Joe Biden really endorse forced abortions and sterilizations in China? That’s the accusation made by Paul Ryan, who said Biden "sympathized and wouldn’t second guess (China’s) one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations," during their Oct. 11, 2012, vice presidential debate. Ryan’s statement about China came after moderator Martha Raddatz asked for the candidates’ views on abortion. Ryan talked about his Catholic faith and the Romney campaign’s anti-abortion position (which includes exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother). He characterized the Democratic Party as increasingly supportive of abortion, "without restriction and with taxpayer funding." Then he got to China. "The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn't second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations," Ryan said. "That to me is pretty extreme." We decided to fact-check whether Ryan was describing Biden’s position accurately. First, a little background: China’s one-child per-couple policy dates back to 1979, when the government became alarmed by its rapid population growth during the prior 30 years. As a response, it restricted the number of children to one per family, with some exceptions. China’s population growth rate slowed with each ensuing decade. But the population-control measure has received widespread criticism from the international community because government officials in localities have been known to force women with unauthorized pregnancies to get abortions and sterilizations. Forced abortions are illegal in China, and recent news reports suggest they became less frequent in the last decade, but they still happen. What Biden said In a 2011 visit to Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, Biden answered a student’s question about the United States’ downgraded credit rating and its plan for reducing the deficit. The solution, Biden said, was to reform U.S. entitlement programs such as Medicare. He said as the Baby Boomer generation retires, a relatively small working population will be left to support those retirees. Then he likened the situation to China’s growing inequity in the ratio of workers to seniors -- a consequence of its one-child policy: "As I was talking to some of your leaders, you share a similar concern here in China. You have no safety net. Your policy has been one which I fully understand -- I’m not second-guessing -- of one child per family. The result being that you’re in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable." So Biden did make a trip to China and said he fully understood and did not second-guess the country’s one-child policy. Reproductive rights advocates have room for displeasure here -- he had an opportunity to condemn the policy and he didn’t. But that’s far from an affirmative endorsement that Ryan’s words imply. Shortly after Biden’s China visit, the White House argued that he called the one-child policy unsustainable. He didn’t though: He said a situation in which one worker takes care of four retired people is "not sustainable." In response to criticism about Biden’s remarks at the time, a White House spokeswoman said Biden "strongly opposes all aspects of China’s coercive birth limitation policies, including forced abortion and sterilization" and "believes such practices are repugnant." Our ruling Ryan accused Biden of going to China and saying he "sympathized and wouldn’t second-guess their one-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations." Biden did not use the word "sympathize" and didn’t endorse the one-child policy. Instead, he said that he understood it and wouldn’t second-guess it. Days after the speech, his spokeswoman said he specifically condemned "coercive birth limitation policies." Ryan’s claim contains a kernel of truth, but it ignores critical context that would leave a different impression. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-07780	Since Sherrod Brown and the Democrats "rammed" the economic stimulus bill through, "Ohio's unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/22/national-republican-senatorial-committee/national-republican-senatorial-committee-raps-sher/	Out of work? Angry? Want to blame somebody? Assigning blame to politicians appeared to work for Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections, just as it did for Bill Clinton, a Democrat, when he ran for president in 1992. And if the current economic recovery isn’t robust enough, it could be a political liability in 2012, too. That’s when U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, is up for re-election. So it came as no surprise that on Feb. 17, the second anniversary of the $787 billion economic stimulus bill, Republicans highlighted Brown’s vote for the bill. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, or NRSC, picked out a number to attach to Brown’s name: 9.6. That’s Ohio’s latest unemployment rate -- 9.6 percent -- and it is higher than the 9.1 percent unemployment rate that Ohio had when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 passed. "The Obama White House projected that their massive stimulus spending would cap national unemployment at 8 percent, and Brown promised Ohioans that it would ‘go a long way toward putting Americans back to work and our economy back on track,’ even claiming last September that the stimulus has worked," the NRSC said in a news release. "But since Brown and the Democrats rammed the bill into law on a party-line vote, Ohio's unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average." Brown’s office doesn’t dispute those numbers, nor did we when we looked on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website. But Brown’s office cites an array of other numbers -- if the NRSC can pick some, then so can Brown -- that tell a different story. We checked out some additional numbers ourselves. The bottom line: Ohio’s unemployment rate was higher than the nation’s before the recession. It was that way for years. Had it somehow fallen below the nation’s now, there might be cause for the state (and Democrats) to sing the "Hallelujah" chorus. The national unemployment rate was 8.2 percent when the stimulus bill passed. The Obama administration’s plan was to funnel the money to states, cities and counties for various job-boosting projects over the course of two years rather than right away. As this occurred, the national unemployment rate rose, peaking at 10.1 percent in October of 2009. Then it vacillated down and up in small increments, hitting 9.8 last November before dropping rapidly to 9.0 in January of 2011. There are other ways to measure the economy, including reports of private-sector job growth, but this drop in the unemployment rate signaled an improvement, although it is too uneven for some. Ohio lagged the national recovery, then caught up -- and then fell behind again. The state’s unemployment rate kept rising through 2009, peaking at 11 percent in March of 2010. But then it started falling, as it has for nine straight months, according to BLS data. This puts Ohio in the minority of states seeing such a steady drop. In fact, Ohio’s rate drew even with the national rate, then at 9.8 percent, in November. As PolitiFact reported in January, when Ohio had seen eight straight months of improvement: "Ohio and Illinois are the only two states that have shown a drop in unemployment — typically by one-tenth of a percentage point, but a drop nonetheless — for every month from April through November." The problem is, the national rate then had a healthy decline for two straight months while Ohio had only a small decline. That difference explains why Ohio’s unemployment rate, which was even with the nation not long ago, is above the national rate again. So we go back to the NRSC claim: that since Brown and Democrats "rammed the bill into law on a party-line vote, Ohio’s unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average." The vote was not entirely along party lines, since two Republicans in the Senate (Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine) voted for it on final passage, as did independents Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And it’s unclear how Brown did any ramming. On the House side, the vote was along party lines. Not a single Republican voted for passage. The Truth-O-Meter says a statement is Half True if it leaves out important details or takes things out of context. The NRSC claim gives too much credit to Brown for "ramming." And it suggests that Ohio’s unemployment rate has risen above the national average since the stimulus bill passed. With the brief exception of last November, you’d have to go back to 2002 to find a time when Ohio didn’t lag the nation in employment. And it ignores that Ohio’s unemployment rate has fallen for nine straight months. Context is important here because numbers can be cherry-picked too easily. And these facts are important for a listener to put the statement in proper context. That’s why we say the NRSC’s claim is Half True.

pomt-06865	A Waushara County school closed because of state budget cuts supported by Republican Wisconsin state Sen. Luther Olsen.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/02/progressive-change-campaign-committee-and-democrac/progressive-change-campaign-committee-and-democrac/	The small elementary school in the Waushara County Town of Poy Sippi opened in 1962 and harks back to a bygone era. It’s not a one-room school house, but it’s not far from that. A total of 75 students attended the K-4 school in the 2010-’11 school year, said Robert Eidahl, administrator for the Berlin Area School District, which includes Poy Sippi. That compares with 650 students at the other elementary school in the district, Clay Lamberton, located in Berlin, west of Oshkosh. In May 2011, the school board made a wrenching decision for any small community: It voted to close Poy Sippi. The decision was followed by a tearful last day that was covered on local television where small children and their teachers said goodbye to their school, and focused on a move to the much larger facility about 15 miles away. Yet, as sorrow melted into summer, the school-closing issue flared up again, thanks to an ad in one of the high-stakes state Senate recall races. Poy Sippi Elementary plays a starring role in a TV ad from the Progressive Change Committee and Democracy for America targeting Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon), one of six GOP state senators facing recall elections on Aug. 9, 2011. The ad blames Olsen for the closing of the school. "I'm standing here in front of Poy Sippi Elementary School where Luther Olsen's kids went to school," local resident Jay Jones says in the ad. "All of my kids have gone here. Two of them still do. But next year, because of budget cuts Luther Olsen voted for, my kids are not going to get the opportunity to go to this little school." He later adds: "Republicans have found a way to find multimillion dollar tax cuts for rich corporations, but they can't find a way to keep my kids' school open." Jones, a social studies teacher at Wautoma High School, declares at the end that he will vote for Olsen’s challenger, state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo) So, did Olsen and the budget he voted for close the school? When asked to back up their claim, Democracy for America provided a May 24, 2011 letter to parents announcing the closing, signed by Eidahl and Poy Sippi Elementary principal Scott Bartol. "This decision was made after discussions and planning over the last two months precipitated by the historic budget cuts required by the new governor’s budget," the letter said. "The decision to close Poy Sippi was a very difficult one for everyone involved but it proved to be the best alternative to handle our financial problems." However, the school had been operating for years on borrowed time. In an interview, Eidahl said closing Poy Sippi has been contemplated for more than a decade. He said the decision was the result of declining enrollment -- there was one class for each grade and 14 or 15 students in each -- and the cost of operating the tiny stand-alone facility. "We just couldn’t afford to keep it open any longer," he said. The school board voted 7-2 to close the school at a meeting May 23, 2011, a move that will cut district costs by about $500,000. He noted that school districts across the state have closed other lightly attended schools in recent years. So, the decision has been in the works for a while. But was the 2011-’13 budget the tipping point? The Berlin district had a number of retirements that made this a good time to close Poy Sippi, said Eidahl and school board president Mark Finger. The 13 retirements allowed the district to transfer Poy Sippi teachers and merge the two schools without any layoffs. Finger said the transfers and closing made more sense than filling the open jobs and then possibly having to fire those new teachers in a year or two if the Poy Sippi closing came then. We’ll return to those retirements in a minute. But let’s look at how the state budget affected the school district’s finances. The Berlin district has a $14.9 million budget for the 2011-’12 school year. Of that, about $10.2 million is in the form of state aid, and $4.7 million is from local property taxes, Eidahl said. The amount of state aid that the district received was cut by $943,000 in the 2011-’13 state budget. At the time of the school-closing decision, the board thought the aid cut could be as high as $1.1 million, Eidahl said. The aid cut was offset, however, by other measures. The district switched from the WEA Trust insurance plan to a different carrier, saving $320,000. Union staff members paying toward their retirement -- one of the components in a separate measure advanced by Gov. Scott Walker and approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature -- cut district costs by $410,000. Both measures were adopted as part of a one year contract extension with the teachers, Eidahl said. That covered about $730,000 of the aid cut, leaving the district with a shortfall of about $210,000. "That had to be made up somehow," Eidahl said. The retirement of the 13 people also presented the school board with a chance to reduce costs. District officials say the number of retirements was unusually high. Some -- if not all -- were linked to the changes that curtailed collective bargaining for public employees … the same changes that allowed the district to require them to pay more for pensions and health care. So, what does that mean for the claim in the ad? The Progressive Change Campaign Committee says budget cuts advocated by Olsen led to the closing of a small town’s elementary school. District officials said in interviews that Poy Sippi Elementary has been on life support for years, due to the low enrollment and cost of operating the building, but that the timing of the closing was due in part to a high number of retirements. Some of those were driven by the GOP-backed collective bargaining changes. But that’s only one piece of the picture. Much of the district’s cut in direct state aid was offset by budgetary changes allowed by the "tools" Walker and the GOP advocated. But the school district still had a shortfall -- and told parents that the time had come for closing Poy Sippi because of the "historic budget cuts" advanced by Walker and supported by Olsen. What’s more, the wave of retirements prompted by the changes contributed to the timing. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-12419	"What Trump is alleged to have done is actually no different than what Barack Obama did in April last year when he made it known that he didn’t want Hillary prosecuted."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/18/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-donald-trump-barack-obama-also-/	Amid accusations that President Donald Trump may have obstructed justice, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said President Barack Obama did the exact same thing. The New York Times and others have reported that back in February, Trump took FBI director James Comey aside and asked him to scale back the FBI’s investigation into former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and payments he received from foreign countries. Trump fired Comey several weeks later. Limbaugh said Obama took similar action during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Other conservative outlets have mirrored this point. "What Trump is alleged to have done is actually no different than what Barack Obama did in April last year when he made it known that he didn’t want Hillary prosecuted," Limbaugh said on his show May 17. "In fact, the Obama situation is actually worse." We reached out to Limbaugh but did not hear back. Limbaugh is likely referring to an interview Obama gave to Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace in April 2016. During the interview, Obama briefly discussed the ongoing FBI probe into Clinton’s email use. Here is the key exchange between Obama and Wallace (read the full transcript here): Wallace: "Can you still say flatly that she did not jeopardize America’s secrets?" Obama: "I’ve got to be careful because, as you know, there have been investigations, there are hearings, Congress is looking at this. And I haven’t been sorting through each and every aspect of this. "Here’s what I know: Hillary Clinton was an outstanding secretary of state. She would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy. … "I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America’s national security. Now what I’ve also said is that — and she has acknowledged — that there’s a carelessness, in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes. "But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective. This is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state, and did an outstanding job. And no one has suggested that in some ways, as a consequence of how she’s handled emails, that that detracted from her excellent ability to carry out her duties." This interview and Trump’s private conversation with Comey are not the same. Obama, speaking in a public setting, said he believed Clinton "has not jeopardized America’s national security." But he never said outright that the FBI should end its investigation, nor did he say Clinton was innocent. In fact, Obama acknowledged the ongoing FBI investigation. In contrast, reports by the New York Times and others say Trump told the director of the FBI, explicitly and directly, what he hoped he would do regarding an ongoing investigation. According to the reports about Comey’s memo of the private White House conversation with Trump, Trump said, "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go." For the record, the White House denies the reports. There are clear differences between the situations. "Obama was speaking to the press and expressing his confidence in the integrity of Secretary Clinton, which is not the same thing as asking the director of the FBI not to pursue an investigation," said Rebecca Lonergan, a University of Southern California law professor and former public corruption prosecutor. A reasonable person could critique Obama for offering his opinion on an ongoing investigation instead of saying "no comment." Indeed, some legal commentators and conservative pundits accused Obama at the time of subtly putting his thumb on the scale. But legal scholars’ reaction to Trump’s reported actions has been much more robust. Trump’s private meeting with Comey, coupled with Trump’s decision to fire him, raises legitimate questions of impropriety. Peter Henning, a Wayne State University law professor and white collar crime expert, said he isn’t convinced that Trump’s actions count as obstruction of justice. (Obstruction of justice, presidential immunity, impeachment: What you need to know) But Obama’s remarks — delivered in a public setting without addressing a particular agent, witness or other involved party — are much less significant, he said. "The difference between them is (that Trump’s actions are) probably enough to initiate an investigation," Henning said. Limbaugh’s assertion misses another obvious point: Trump has gone beyond what Obama said about Clinton’s ongoing investigation. Trump has repeatedly defended Flynn in media interviews and on Twitter, without expressing caution about ongoing probes. "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!" he tweeted March 31. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation," he said in a Feb. 16 press conference. "He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn't have to do that because what he did wasn't wrong." Our ruling Limbaugh said, "What Trump is alleged to have done is actually no different than what Barack Obama did in April last year when he made it known that he didn’t want Hillary prosecuted." Obama did say that he didn’t believe Clinton harmed national security amid an ongoing FBI investigation into her email setup. But he never said she was innocent of all crimes, nor did he say the FBI should drop its investigation. And he made these remarks in an on-camera news interview, during which he made a point to distance himself from the investigation. Trump’s situation is different: In a secret, one-on-one conversation, Trump explicitly told Comey that he hoped the FBI would back off from its Flynn investigation, according to reports. It may not have been an order, nor a clear example of obstruction of justice, but the exchange raises red flags. Limbaugh’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

Steven Smith) allowed to serve?"	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/28/reader-email/unfit-serve-congressman-isnt-even-real/	Oh, our dear PolitiFact Georgia readers. Bless your hearts. That’s not a socially polite insult. We have sincere concerns after hearing from a reader, alarmed at the outlandish statements posted on Twitter by "Rep. Steve Smith" of Valdosta. "Please check out hate-filled (timeline) of @RepStevenSmith," the reader asked us. "How is a misogynist bigot of epic proportions allowed to serve? Dangerous." Our worry is not with Smith’s timeline. True, it is littered with (cough) liberal use of "boy" to demean those who try to engage and plenty of media baiting, along with the promised "partisan" thoughts of someone claiming Tea Party membership. But our reader has, sadly, joined journalists Christiane Amanpour and Ezra Klein in becoming the latest victim of the parody Twitter account. Simply: "Rep. Steven Smith" is not real. The account, and the Congressman, are fakes. How do we know? We expect to hear protests from our bogus politico on Twitter, so let’s break down how you can trust us on this one. Step One: Read Twitter Smith’s Twitter bio is succinct and looks pretty official. It reads, "Republican Representative of Georgia's 15th Congressional District. Tea Party Patriot. Constitutionalist. Partisan." It’s also worth noting that Smith’s followers on the account include a chief of staff, @TJMitchJohnson. That adds to credibility, right? Step Two: Read some government stuff We’re paid to do the research for you, true. But it’s not hard to find an official list of Congressional representatives from the Peach State. Our friends at the government transparency website GovTrack have set up web pages showing the elected representation for every state. Georgia, it shows, is represented by two Senators (like all the other states) and 14 members of Congress. The Congressmen (Georgia has no female representatives) hail from districts made up of about 710,000 people each. For those keeping score, then, there is no 15th district in Georgia. There are only 14. Step Three: Find the real guy A Congressman does of course represent Valdosta. His name is Austin Scott, a Republican whose 8th Congressional District stretches from that south Georgia city, through Scott’s hometown of Tifton and into middle Georgia. Scott was elected in 2010, riding on an anti-Democratic sentiment that swept national elections that year and flipped control of the House from D to R. While Scott is not a member of the Freedom Caucus that has pulled the GOP to the right in the past year, he is a clear conservative. He has co-sponsored a bill to repeal Obamacare, and he earned a True on the Truth-O-Meter for his claim that 97 percent of Americans aren’t receiving the premium subsidies under that law. Scott also has signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge from the Americans for Tax Reform, promising to oppose any effort to raise taxes and has been especially vocal in his opposition to any new federal gun laws. Scott’s main Twitter account (he also has a campaign account) focuses not only on some of those issues but also the more meat-and-potatoes work you’d expect, like Medicaid workshops in the district and a recent trip to a pecan farm. Step Four: Never forget Google Still not convinced? There is one other way to check your facts. As anyone who has ever watched "Catfish" knows, you can look up your Cyrano, or anyone, in Google image. When you drop the photo of the man claiming to be Steven Smith into the search engine, no name will appear. Instead, it takes you to the website of a big-and-tall men’s store in New Hampshire using that photo. But at least the store is called George’s. That’s almost like Georgia. In that same way, Rep. Steven Smith is almost a Congressman. The outrageous statements in question come from a parody account, not a real U.S. representative. How can someone like that serve? The U.S. Constitution says the only rules to serve are to be at least 25, a citizen for seven years and a resident of the state electing you. Of course, all those requirements mean you do have to be real. We rate this as Pants on Fire.	None	Reader	None	None	None	2015-10-28T00:00:00	2015-10-24	['United_States']

pomt-00950	Say George Washington said that "when government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/20/facebook-posts/did-george-washington-offer-support-individual-gun/	Would George Washington have been an ally to modern-day gun-rights groups? A social-media meme suggests that he would have. Around the time of Washington’s 282nd birthday, a reader sent us the meme, which includes a painting of Washington and a quote purportedly written or uttered by the nation’s first president: "When government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern." But are those really Washington’s words? We contacted Edward Lengel, editor in chief of the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia. He said "there is no evidence that Washington ever wrote or said these words, or any like them." Lengel cautioned that it’s impossible to prove a negative, but he added that he’s "as certain as he can be" that the quote did not originate from George Washington. This is not the first time a similar claim has popped onto our radar screen. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated False a claim made two days after the Newtown elementary school shooting. When U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, appeared on Fox News Sunday, he was asked why he believed ordinary Americans should be able to buy semi-automatic weapons designed for military use. Gohmert answered in part, "For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government." PolitiFact Texas contacted Gohmert’s office to seek details on the Washington quotation but didn’t hear back. The closest statement they could find was one Washington made in his first State of the Union address on Jan. 8, 1790: "A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined." The academic consensus is that Washington was referring to a trained militia to defend the new nation, rather than anticipating citizens seeking to head off perceived governmental tyranny. Ron Chernow, whose Washington: A Life won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for biography, told PolitiFact Texas that Washington was "talking about national defense policy, not individuals arming themselves, and the need for national self-sufficiency in creating military supplies." Some post-Revolutionary lawmakers did expect citizens to own firearms, but Washington does not appear to have been among them, experts said. "The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington," Lengel told PolitiFact Texas. "Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians." Indeed, during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, "citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced," said Mary Thompson, research historian at Washington’s Virginia home, Mount Vernon. Washington was "concerned that success by the rebels would lead to a diminishment of the central/federal government," and directed state militias to counter the insurrection -- "citizen-soldiers," she said, "acting on behalf of the government against their fellow citizens." Our ruling The meme said George Washington said that "when government takes away citizens’ right to bear arms it becomes citizens’ duty to take away government’s right to govern." Experts say there’s no evidence that Washington ever said that -- and there are indications that Washington, if anything, favored the arming of trained militias rather than wide swaths of the population.

pomt-00807	People buy more items during Georgia’s sales-tax holidays, boosting economic activity.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/01/rick-mcallister/retailers-overstates-impact-tax-holidays/	State lawmakers have struggled this legislative session, trying to figure out how to raise up to $1 billion a year to fund statewide transportation needs. The House came up with a plan. But the Senate approved a very different version of House Bill 170, killing more than $200 million in fees associated with the plan. Lawmakers reached a deal late Tuesday that will get close to the original $1 billion goal. The compromise also killed a Senate attempt to elminate Georgia’s tax holidays that nix sales taxes on certain back-to-school and energy efficient items. The president of the Georgia Retail Federation recently wrote an editorial that warned eliminating the popular incentive could curb the state’s economic activity. An association-funded study showed that "consumers often used the additional savings from their tax-free purchases to buy additional items," Rick McAllister wrote in an editorial in the Savannah Morning News. That in turn creates demand for additional workers, he added, either hired as temporary labor or paid through increased overtime. "We recognize the value these sales tax holidays have in saving families money while also producing needed jobs," McAllister wrote. Could it be that those perks exist and wold have been lost in lawmakers’ scramble to find cash for roadwork? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. Luckily, Georgia has a history of years with, and without, the holidays. The state first exempted clothes, school supplies and computers from state and local sales taxes for two weekends in 2002. It added a similar holiday for energy-efficient appliances in 2005. Conventional wisdom held that the breaks were at best a wash for state coffers, while remaining popular among voters. But the state canceled the holidays in 2010, due to worries about revenue declines. McAllister said the association hired the consulting firm, Washington Economic Group, to look at retailers’ books for all of the years to divine the impact. Researchers found that the years with the sales tax holidays showed an increase in all sales, not just on exempted items, for that entire quarter. In the years without the break, sales were generally stagnant or lower. Indeed, the report concluded that sales tax revenue is actually up for governments during holiday years, because of those additional sales. "There is a stimulus effect in general," McAllister said. That runs counter to an annual analysis by the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning nonprofit that examines the tax holidays nationwide by reviewing anecdotal and scholarly reports. Those findings have never waned: shoppers mostly adjust when they make purchases but rarely buy significantly more or less because of breaks. "In some states, you will see some element of impulse purchases," said Joseph Henchman, the foundation’s vice president of state projects and author of the annual report. "Generally, it’s just a shift in when people buy things. People don’t typically buy that much more for just 5 or 6 percent off." In other words, one analysis finds tax holidays prompt shoppers to buy more. A broader study concludes the breaks are ineffective in spurring any significant bump. So which is it? Probably more the latter, said Robert Buschman, a senior research associate at the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University. Buschman, an economist, has studied the specifics of the holidays in Georgia. He acknowledged at least one study that found some people do make big-ticket purchases such as computers because of the tax break and sales prices that tend to accompany the holiday. But his 2011 study on the Peach State showed that Georgians behave the way other consumers do during the tax holidays: They buy mostly what they would have bought anyway, just during one weekend. A model that only counts sales in that period would show an increase, the way the association’s report does. But that’s because it assumes there is not an offsetting reduction in another period – which is how most shoppers behave. "Obviously consumers do go shopping with the sales tax holidays. But if not for the holiday, would they have gone to back-to school sales anyway," Buschman asked. "Most likely they would." Most studies then, including one specific to Georgia, show that the sales tax holidays do increase sales. But there is not much of an incremental increase over what shoppers would spend anyway, if not for the break. The retail association’s consultants failed to take all of that into consideration. McAllister claimed that the tax holidays spur sales and boost the economy. It’s true that the breaks are popular with shoppers, who do respond to the sales. But the overwhelming evidence is that people are buying what they would need with or without the break. We rate McAllister’s claim Half True.

pomt-00483	"A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%" and "that would require the release of thousands of violent felons."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/09/scott-walker/cutting-wisconsin-prison-population-50-wouldnt-req/	So, are some of the Democrats running for governor planning to open prison doors to release thousands of thugs? It’s a picture Republican Gov. Scott Walker painted with a tweet on Aug. 7, 2018, one week before the primary election that will determine which one of eight Democrats will run against him in the fall. Walker issued more than a dozen tweets on prisons that day, including this one: A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%. That would require the release of thousands of violent felons. Walker also issued a news release and did a news conference the same day. The next day, Walker went on conservative radio talk shows to press his points more, and the 50 percent reduction proposals were part of a debate in Madison for the Democratic candidates. What we found is Walker is right on the first part of his claim, but not on the second. Who supports 50 percent cut At least two of the Democrats have called for cutting the state’s prison population in half — by some 12,000 inmates — according to a July 2018 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article. Kelda Roys, a former state lawmaker, and liberal activist Mike McCabe both said they want such a cut -- with Roys saying she wants to do it within four years and McCabe not stating a time frame. (The Wisconsin Republican Party has attacked Roys for her proposal in a radio ad.) Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Two of the other candidates have expressed support for the idea. State Sen. Kathleen Vinehout has said cutting the inmate population in half is an "absolutely doable statistic," while state schools superintendent Tony Evers has said a 50 percent cut is "a goal that’s worth accomplishing." So, Walker is correct on the first part of his claim. Violent offenders But what of the second part? Would a 50 percent cut would "require" the release of thousands of violent felons. Walker’s news release said that according to the state Department of Corrections, 67 percent of state prison inmates have committed at least one violent offense, including crimes such as murder, rape and assault; but also offenses such as intimidation, illegal abortion and extortion. His campaign argued to us that, therefore, it would be impossible to achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing violent offenders (although Walker’s statement referred to violent felons). All our fact checks in the governor’s race That suggests the only way to achieve a 50 percent cut is to release violent offenders who are already in prison. But none of the Democrats has stated they would achieve this instantly. What’s more, there are other ways over time to reduce the prison population. If the 50 percent cut were to be done immediately, or in short order, that would require releasing violent felons, according to Kenneth Streit, a clinical professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin Law School. He has studied corrections policy since 1990 and has assisted the Legislature and the Department of Corrections in developing and evaluating adult community corrections programs. In contrast, Streit said, the 50 percent cut could be achieved by reducing the population by about 5 percent annually over the next decade through steps such as changing sentencing guidelines and tripling funding for treatment-based probation that would reduce the number of people going back to prison for probation revocations. That could be done, he argued, without the early release of any current inmates. As far as the candidates, Roys has said she could achieve a 50 percent reduction with steps including releasing more inmates who are eligible for parole, releasing ill and aging inmates, expanding diversion programs and overhauling the truth-in-sentencing law. Similarly, McCabe called for sending fewer people to prison through steps such as ending parole revocations when new crimes have not been committed and by boosting prison alternatives for nonviolent offenses and mental health and drug addiction treatment. It’s unknown, of course, whether Roys’ or McCabe’s plans would achieve a 50 percent cut without releasing violent felons. But it’s also not clear that a 50 percent cut would necessitate such a release. Our rating Walker says: "A number of Democrats running for governor want to cut the prison population by 50%" and "that would require the release of thousands of violent felons." Two Democrats have called for a 50 percent cut and two have said that should be a goal. But evidence is lacking that such a cut would require the release of thousands of violent felons. While a short time frame might require that, a longer time frame — and reducing incoming inmates as well as releasing some others — would not. We rate Walker’s statement Half True.

pomt-09772	"For the first time in history, the Democratic Congress will not allow an increase in the social security COLA (cost of living adjustment)."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/28/chain-email/e-mail-claims-democratic-congress-blame-no-cola-in/	So every year you've gotten a little bump in your Social Security check due to inflation. Maybe you've come to consider it an annual raise from Uncle Sam. Well, this January, you might not get one. And a chain e-mail making the rounds tells you to blame Democrats in Congress. "For the first time in history, the Democratic Congress will not allow an increase in the Social Security COLA (cost of living adjustment)," the e-mail states. There are actually two versions of this e-mail floating around. One pins the blame generically on "Congress," while the other says "the Democratic Congress." The second version seems to have gotten more traction on the Web, so we focused on the latter version. Up until 1975, it took an act of Congress to adjust Social Security payments for inflation. But a law enacted in 1972 — and signed by President Richard Nixon, a Republican — created a formula to automatically calculate the COLA every year. The Social Security cost of living adjustment was tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The government compares that index in the third quarter (July, August and September) of the current year to the third quarter of the previous year. Every year since the formula was put into effect (1975), it has resulted in a cost-of-living increase . High oil prices last summer contributed in large part to a sizable COLA increase in January of 5.8 percent , the highest increase in more than 25 years. This year, the CPI-W is expected to decrease. That's due in part to lower consumer prices and low inflation from the recession. But mostly, it's tied to oil prices, which fell markedly from last summer's highs. As a result, a Social Security Trustees report last fall forecast no COLA next year. And the Congressional Budget Office recently projected that the formula will fail to yield a COLA in 2010 or 2011. The law does not allow COLA to be adjusted downward , so the effect is that Social Security payments would remain stagnant next year. This all has consequences for Medicare as well. For the three-quarters of seniors who have premiums for Part B of Medicare withheld from their Social Security checks, the COLA freeze will also mean a freeze in Part B premiums. That's because of a "hold-harmless" provision in the law. But millions of seniors exempt from the provision — some wealthy people, people new to the program and those who don't have Part B premiums withheld from their Social Security payments — could actually see smaller Social Security checks. "It has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans," said Mark Hinkle, a spokesman for Social Security. "It's been the law since 1975, and it's based strictly on the numbers." Congress could vote to increase Social Security payments even though the COLA formula doesn't call for it. And, in fact, several pieces of legislation have been offered with that very goal. One is the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act, introduced in the Senate by Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and in the House by Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. It would provide a one-time payment of $250 to Social Security recipients next year. Another is the Emergency COLA Bill, introduced earlier this week by Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C. It would provide a COLA for 2010 equal to the average of the COLA over the past 10 years — roughly 3 percent. Obviously, these bills are coming from both sides of the aisle. If this e-mail had merely gotten some facts wrong, we'd be comfortable rating it False. But given that it targets senior citizens on an important pocketbook issue with an incorrect allegation that has no basis in fact, we have to go one more notch and set the meter ablaze.

pomt-04792	"I haven't raised taxes in the time I've been the governor of New Jersey."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/23/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-he-hasnt-raised-taxes-new-jers/	Gov. Chris Christie said he vowed to the people of New Jersey that he would not raise their taxes and that’s the only oath that matters. But his allegiance to that pledge falls into murky territory. "I haven't raised taxes in the time I've been the governor of New Jersey and I didn't need to sign a pledge not to," Christie said at an Aug. 20 news conference in Asbury Park when asked about an anti-tax oath signed by many Republicans. "I made a pledge to the people of the state not to. I don't need to make a pledge to anybody else." With Christie expected to flaunt his New Jersey credentials in the keynote address at the Republican National Convention next week, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered whether his tax claim is accurate. Rates for the state’s three biggest revenue generators -- income, sales and corporation business taxes -- have not gone up under Christie. But the governor has cut funding for tax credit programs and several experts said those reductions are, in effect, tax increases. "For practical purposes decreasing tax credits is the same as a tax increase. The person's effective tax rate goes up," David Brunori, a research professor of public policy at The George Washington University, said in an e-mail. "Still, most people think of tax increases as rate hikes." So rates haven’t increased, but some homeowners and certain low-income individuals are receiving less money to offset their tax bills. New Jersey scaled back the state’s earned income tax credit -- which the state Treasury Department website says "reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey" -- in Christie’s first year in office. Also, Christie cut spending for two property tax relief programs. Budget analyses from the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services shows homeowners who qualify for one of those programs, what is now called the Homestead Benefit program, received an average rebate of more than $1,000 in fiscal year 2010. Now, the average credit is less than half that amount. State Treasury Department officials argued that these tax credit programs are payments from the state and so reductions in credits do not represent tax increases. Bill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, said "the Earned Income Tax Credit in most cases really represents a subsidy payment to low income citizens," pointing out that more than 76 percent of earned income tax credit recipients in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax. But Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said that a reduction in a tax credit is "absolutely a tax increase." "Tax credits reduce tax liability for eligible claimants. Thus, cutting, restricting, or repealing a tax credit for an otherwise eligible individual or business would -- absent other changes to the tax system such as a reduction in rates -- result in higher taxes owed," Ventry said. Richard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said, "why are we fighting the semantic issues? To someone who has had a benefit cut that is less money they have to spend," whether you call it a tax increase or a spending cut. However, Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, said it’d be a mistake to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. "They have elements of both and are strictly neither," he said. Our ruling Christie said, "I haven't raised taxes in the time I've been the governor of New Jersey." The rates for the state’s three major taxes have not increased during the governor’s tenure. But Christie reduced funding for several tax credit programs. The governor’s administration argues those tax credits are spending programs, but several experts said reductions in tax credits amount to tax increases. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04315	"Women in Barack Obama's White House are earning less than men."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/29/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-women-white-house-employees-earn-/	As part of his campaign to court women voters, President Barack Obama has repeatedly noted that one of his first acts in office was his signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for workers who claim pay discrimination to sue for relief. But Mitt Romney’s campaign is using a clever counter-attack -- charging that Obama’s own White House pays female employees less than male employees. "Under President Barack Obama, women are lagging behind," says a mailer distributed to homes in northern Virginia, a key battleground in a leading swing state. "Barack Obama promised us change. … Women today under President Obama are earning less. Single women are earning less than married people and single men. Even women in Barack Obama’s White House are earning less than men. … Barack Obama hasn’t earned a second term." Many readers have asked us to check this claim, so we will. For months, conservative bloggers and news outlets have been touting the statistic that women working for the White House earn 18 percent less than men do. The statistic stems from calculations published in April 2012 by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online publication. "According to the 2011 annual report on White House staff, female employees earned a median annual salary of $60,000, which was about 18 percent less than the median salary for male employees ($71,000)," the Beacon wrote. Put another way, that means women in the White House earned 85 percent of what the men earned. The statistic got a second round of attention as the discussion of women’s pay disparities increased during the Democratic convention (where Ledbetter spoke) and in the debates. When we downloaded the same statistics from the White House website and ran the numbers, we came up with similar results -- $63,240 for women and $72,876 for men. So women in the White House, by our calculations, earn 87 percent of what their male colleagues at the White House do, not far off from what the Free Beacon found. (Some of the variation may be explained by differences in determining the sex of the 454 employees on the list. We were able to determine the sex of all but 18 employees.) The gender pay gap we found provides support for the Romney mailer’s claim that "even women in Barack Obama's White House are earning less than men." However, we think it’s worth pointing out a couple caveats. Women at the White House fare better than women in the economy at large We’ve previously rated Mostly True the claim that women "receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." By that standard, women working for the White House suffer from a smaller gap than do women who work elsewhere. The 77-cents and 87-cents figures don’t reflect apples-to-apples comparisons This is an issue that has tripped up Obama in the past: When Obama claimed earlier this year that "women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men," we rated it Mostly False, since the 77-cent statistic does not factor in what occupations are held, how many hours are worked or how long someone has been in the job. When women do the same job as men, the pay gap narrows quite a bit. And in fact, this is exactly what happens when you look deeper into the White House data. Even when you just control for one factor -- people who have the same job title -- the gap narrows significantly. We found 36 titles for full employees held by more than one person, including at least one man and woman. Of these 36 job categories, there was no difference in pay between men and women in 22 job categories, affecting 121 employees. In another six categories affecting 29 employees, the highest earner in the category was a woman who out-earned at least one man. In only eight cases affecting 22 employees -- in other words, a small fraction of all employees -- was the highest earner a man who out-earned at least one woman. In a large majority of job categories, there was no salary edge for men. And even in the cases where men did have an edge, it was a small edge -- the lowest-paid women mostly earned between 92 percent and 98 percent of what the top-paid men did. And don’t forget that we’re only adjusting the data using one factor -- job title. There are other factors that could explain different salaries for people who hold the same job title, such as prior work experience, specific skill sets and the number of years they have spent in the job. The White House pointed PolitiFact to several conclusions in an analysis of the 2011 salary data by the Washington Times, which has a reputation as a conservative-leaning newspaper. "President Obama’s top female White House aides earn more on average than their male counterparts, a reversal from the pattern in the George W. Bush administration," the newspaper wrote. "Top female employees on average earned nearly 4 percent more than top male employees under Mr. Obama, compared with a deficit of 12 percent under Mr. Bush." However, the analysis also said that the further you go down in seniority, the more "mixed" Obama’s record becomes. The median salaries calculated by the Washington Times mirrored those in the Free Beacon’s analysis, which in turn were close to what PolitiFact found. Our ruling In the broadest sense, the Romney campaign is on solid ground when it says that "women in Barack Obama's White House are earning less than men." But the closer you look at the data, the less striking this conclusion becomes. First, the Obama White House has more equitable pay rates than the economy as a whole. And second, when you look at employees who have the same titles, only a small fraction of women are out-earned by men, a difference that might be explainable by differences in experience and longevity rather than discrimination. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-29T10:42:19	2012-10-26	['White_House', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-06808	Virginia has a responsibility to fund 55 percent of public education and is paying just 41 percent.	false	/virginia/statements/2011/aug/12/ken-plum/plum-says-virginia-shirking-school-funding-require/	Del. Kenneth R. Plum says Virginia is not paying its required share for public education. Plum, D-Fairfax, takes issue with Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell’s announcement that the state ended its budget year on June 30 with a $311 million surplus. "To call it a surplus is misleading," Plum wrote in an Aug. 3 newspaper column in the Reston Connection. Plum, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party, argued that Virginia is still in the hole because of actions it took to balance the budget during the recession, such as skipping more than $600 million in scheduled pension contributions and withdrawing $783 million from the Rainy Day Fund. He also said the state has been short-changing schools. "How could a state that has a responsibility to fund 55 percent public education costs get by with saying it has a surplus when it is funding just 41 percent?" Plum wrote. Is Virginia really shirking its obligations to fund public schools? We thought we’d check. Public education money comes from the state, localities and the federal government. Plum, a longtime lawmaker who once served on the House Appropriations Committee, told us the state law callls for Virginia to pay for 55 percent of all education costs. That statement is inaccurate and conflates complicated components of education funding. Virginia is required by law to pay 55 percent of the costs needed to fund minimum state education guidelines called the Standards of Quality. The benchmarks, set every two years by the state Board of Education and the General Assembly, lay out pupil-teacher ratios, cover various benefit costs for educators, and mandate basic curricula. Based on their wealth, localities are required to contribute between 17 percent and 80 percent of the cost of the standards. Each municipality’s wealthy is determined by a formula takes into account the value of its real estate, the taxable income of its residents, and its taxable retail sales. lA rich city, such as Falls Church, pays 80 percent. A poor municipality, such as Lee County in Southwest Virginia, pays 17 percent. The amount each community contributes is adjusted so that the state pays a 55 percent overall share of the SOQ costs and localities shell out 45 percent. Because the overall contribution levels for the standards are written into the state budget, they are law. For this fiscal year, which began July 1, the state will pay a total of $6.35 billion towards meeting the SOQ requirements and localities will pay about $5.2 billion. So the state is footing its legally required share of public education. But most localities in Virginia are not satisfied with just attaining minimum standards and fund their schools at far greater levels than the state demands. This is where Plum’s statistics become shaky. When you take the total spent on public education -- not just the amount to meet minimum standards -- localities do foot most of the bill. Plum points to a 2010 annual report from the state superintendent of education showing a total of $13.3 billion was spent on public education in fiscal 2010. Local governments paid $6.5 billion, or 49 percent; the state paid $5.3 billion, or 40 percent; and Washington kicked in $1.5 billion, or 11 percent. A 2006 report by Senate Finance Committee said that between 1996 and 2005, localities paid 50 percent of total education costs and the state contributed 43 percent. But when it came to meeting the Standards of Quality costs, the report said the state did pay its 55 percent share. Plum said Virginia needs to go beyond funding minimum requirements and his broad point is that the state is not living up to its commitment to fund high-caliber education. "The Standards of Quality are totally unrealistic," he told us. To sum up: Plum says the state is responsible for paying 55 percent of education costs but is only covering 41 percent of the cost. His statement is based on a faulty premise that Virginia has a responsibility to pay for 55 percent of all education costs. State law merely requires Virginia to provide 55 percent of the money needed to fulfill minimum education standards. The state is meeting that demand. Most localities are not satisfied with achieving minimum standards and fund their school systems at far greater levels than the state requires. As a result, Virginia only pays 41 percent of total education costs. Plum mixes apples with oranges to prove the state is not meeting its education obligations. We rate his statement False.

pomt-04010	Wisconsin state lawmakers worked seven days in 2012 but got "paid for a whole year."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/06/leon-young/wisconsin-legislator-says-he-and-colleagues-worked/	We're often asked at PolitiFact Wisconsin how we choose statements to fact check on the Truth-O-Meter. The answer is: Really? As in: Did a politician, pundit or organization make a claim that would make an average person stop and wonder: Really? On Jan. 19, 2013, the Wisconsin State Journal reported on a proposal by state Rep. Leon Young, D-Milwaukee, to make state lawmakers part time and cut their pay by 75 percent. Why would Young want to gore his own ox? "After reviewing the number of days that we were in session during the course of the 2011-’12 biennium, I realized that we met a total of only 34 days out of a possible 122 session days," Young told the Madison newspaper. "It is fair to say that we actually function as a 'de facto' part-time legislature now." When you look only at the number of session days in 2012, Young added, the number drops to seven. "Who works seven days and gets paid for a whole year?" he asked. State lawmakers worked seven days in 2012 but got "paid for a whole year"? Really? Cue the Truth-O-Meter. Young's proposal Young has served in the state Assembly since 1993 but has not always won easy re-election. Beset by two foreclosure judgments and restraining orders involving two women, the former Milwaukee police officer faced three challengers in the 2008 Democratic primary. Young prevailed, arguing he had worked hard to bring investment in infrastructure and jobs to the city. In 2010, Young defeated a Democratic challenger and in 2012 he ran unopposed. Young’s proposal is for a constitutional amendment to have lawmakers meet only during the first three months of the year. Their salary would be cut by 75 percent — to $12,000 a year from the current $49,943 an amount last raised in 2009). In Wisconsin, most state lawmakers list something besides full-time legislator as their occupation. But in terms of pay and benefits, the Legislature certainly could be considered full time. The $49,943 salary is more than the median household income in Wisconsin, which was $49,001, according to the 2010 U.S. census. And state lawmakers enjoy benefits that are at least on par with full-time workers. The benefits include a pension, and health, life, vision insurance, each of which require contributions by the lawmakers. But what about their workload? Young's evidence When we asked Young for evidence that lawmakers worked only seven days in 2012, he referred us to the office of the Assembly chief clerk. It confirmed the full Legislature was in session on seven days in 2012. But Young is doing a bit of cherry-picking to make his broader point -- something he acknowledged when we contacted him. The Legislature meets in two-year sessions. In the first year, lawmakers work on and adopt a two-year state budget. They meet less often the second year, when all Assembly members and half of the senators are up for re-election. In 2011-2012, with Republicans controlling the Assembly and the Senate, the full Legislature met a total of 34 days -- 27 days in 2011 plus the seven in 2012. In the previous two-year session, with Democrats in charge of both chambers, the Legislature met on 37 days -- 25 days in 2009 and 12 days in 2010. Although state lawmakers’ main responsibility is to make policy by adopting laws, they do more than attend full sessions of the Legislature, right? Let’s start with Young. He lists his occupation as a full-time legislator and claims to put in more time in Madison than nearly all of his colleagues. In 2012, Young claimed $11,792 in expenses, the third-highest reimbursement in the 99-member Assembly. The reimbursements, known as per diem payments, are $88 per day, an amount that has been in place since 2001; the reimbursements are meant to cover food and lodging costs while lawmakers are in Madison on state business. In 2011, Young ranked 12th, collecting $12,056; he ranked similarly high in reimbursements in previous years. Young acknowledged that in making his seven-days-of-work claim he wasn’t counting time lawmakers spend attending committee meetings in Madison, working on legislation, studying issues, handling constituent matters or spending time back home in their districts. Indeed, committee meetings alone can be a significant workload. Young is assigned to four committees for the 2013-2014 session. Other lawmakers serve on six or more committees; Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Shorewood, serves on nine. An independent research group, the National Conference of State Legislatures, also regards the Wisconsin Legislature as essentially a full-time body. A 2009 analysis, which the group said remains up to date, found that 10 states -- including Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois -- "require the most time of legislators, usually 80 percent or more of a full-time job." Now, critics may say state lawmakers don’t work hard enough, or aren’t worth their pay, or should spend most of their time at home. But that’s a lot more than seven days. Really. Our rating Young said Wisconsin legislators worked only seven days in 2012 but got "paid for a whole year." The veteran Assembly member admitted his statement didn’t account for all the duties lawmakers have. In fact, it didn't come close. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, we rate Young’s statement Pants on Fire!	None	Leon Young	None	None	None	2013-02-06T09:00:00	2013-01-19	['Wisconsin']

pomt-00324	"I think I received more votes in the Democratic primary than any governor in history."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/sep/20/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-says-he-got-more-votes-democratic-primary/	In case anyone doubted the decisiveness of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s primary win, he emphasized the point in a post-election news conference. "I haven’t analyzed all of the results," Cuomo told reporters gathered in New York City on Sept. 14, 2018, the day after the primary election. "But I believe it was a record turnout. I believe it was one of the highest turnouts in history. I think I received more votes in the Democratic primary than any governor in history. And it was all across the state, all age groups, all demographics. So I think it was a very loud and clear and powerful statement." Cuomo defeated actor and activist Cynthia Nixon, garnering 64 percent of the vote, according to unofficial returns from the state Board of Elections. But did he receive more votes in a Democratic primary than any of his predecessors? To evaluate his claim, we researched Democratic primary results in years where the winner went on to become governor. We searched Board of Elections records, newspaper clippings, and academic journals. Cuomo received more than 960,000 votes in the 2018 primary, according to unofficial results. How did that compare with other Democratic primaries? It was better than his showing in 2014, when he defeated Zephyr Teachout with 361,380 votes cast for him. In 2006, Eliot Spitzer won with 624,684 votes in his race against Tom Suozzi. In 1982, Mario Cuomo won with 678,900 votes over Ed Koch, according to the state Board of Elections. Mario Cuomo received fewer than 600,000 primary votes in 1994, the year he ultimately lost to George Pataki in the general election. Hugh Carey won 600,283 votes in the Democratic primary in 1974 and 376,457 votes in the primary in 1978, according to the state Board of Elections. Until the 1974 primary, it had been decades since a Democratic primary in which the winner went on to the governor’s office. Al Smith, the Democratic primary winner in 1918, received 199,752 votes. A Democratic primary in 1914 saw Martin Glynn, who had been elevated to the governorship in 1913 and ultimately lost the general election that year, received fewer than 200,000 votes, according to an article from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Glynn’s primary was the first for Democratic candidates for governor, as New York enacted direct primaries in December 1913. We were also curious about Cuomo’s claim that his win was "all across the state." So we turned to a county breakdown of unofficial results from the Board of Elections. Cuomo beat Nixon in 49 counties, and Nixon won in 13 counties. Nixon was successful in eleven counties surrounding and including Albany; Tompkins County, which includes Ithaca; and Lewis County, northeast of Syracuse. We chose not to include this part of his statement in our ruling because his phrasing could be interpreted different ways by readers. He did outpoll Nixon in counties in most regions across the state. Without exit polling data, we could not evaluate Cuomo’s claim that he won all age groups and demographics. Our ruling Cuomo claimed he won more votes in a Democratic primary than any other governor in the state’s history. The first Democratic primary for governor was in 1914, and an evaluation of results since then shows he is right. We rate his claim True.

pomt-09771	"The Defense Department received only one-half of 1 percent of the nearly trillion-dollar stimulus package funding."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/29/sarah-palin/palin-says-defense-spending-was-tiny-portion-stimu/	President Barack Obama's recent decision to halt plans for a missile defense system in Eastern Europe has opened the door for Republicans to rekindle an attack they've used before: that Democrats are weak on defense. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, in a Sept. 23, 2009, speech to investors in Hong Kong, joined Fox talk show host Sean Hannity, Republican chairman Michael Steele, and others in attacking Obama for being too soft on defense. "Though we are engaged in two wars and face a diverse array of threats, it is the defense budget that has seen significant program cuts and has actually been reduced from current levels!" she said. She added, "the Defense Department received only one-half of 1 percent of the nearly trillion-dollar stimulus package funding — even though many military projects fit the definition of 'shovel-ready.' " She went on to cite examples of defense projects that she said Obama wants to cut. We recently examined a claim by Hannity that Obama has cut defense spending (we found it Half True), but we wanted to see if Palin was right that a tiny sliver of stimulus spending will go toward defense projects. The total cost of the stimulus, known officially as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is $787 billion. According to the Defense Department, $7.4 billion will be spent on defense projects when the spending from the economic stimulus package is all said and done. That works out to slightly less than 1 percent of its total cost. That's slightly higher than Palin's "one-half of 1 percent," but still very much in the ballpark. The White House says that the $7.4 billion for the military in the stimulus bill comes on top of an already increased military budget (indeed, when we checked Hannity's claim, we found that Obama increased defense spending 3.9 percent from 2009 to 2010, while the budgeted amount for future years would essentially be flat). And the goal of the package was to directly stimulate the economy. So Palin's underlying point that Obama is going soft on defense is a bit of a stretch. The amount of defense spending in the stimulus bill is not a good measurement of the administration's overall commitment in that area. But she is correct that defense was a small portion of the stimulus and her number is off only slightly. So we find her statement to be Mostly True.

pomt-15324	Despite keeping distance from national media interviewers, "I did local press all along, the last three months."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/jul/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-shes-engaged-local-media-all-/	In an segment that aired July 7, Hillary Clinton sat down for her first nationally televised interview since announcing her second bid for president in April. Toward the end of the roughly 19-minute conversation, CNN senior political correspondent Brianna Keilar asked Clinton about her "arm’s length" relationship with the media so far. Pointing to the decision to hold off on national interviews until this point, Keilar asked, "What's changed? Why now?" Clinton began by telling Keilar that "nothing’s really changed." All along, Clinton said, she wanted to focus the first phase of her campaign on conversations with average Americans, particularly because it had been several years since she was actively engaged in domestic policy issues. "I'm not running my campaign for the press. I'm running it for voters," Clinton said. "I totally respect the press and what the press has to do. But I wanted and was determined to have the time that I needed to actually meet and listen to people." Later, Clinton said she would continue to do "more press" and added, "I did local press all along, the last three months because, again, it was interesting to see what questions the local press would be asking me." Given the scrutiny surrounding Clinton’s national media strategy, we decided to take a closer look at this statement: Had she consistently opened herself up to local reporters throughout the first three months of her campaign? Politifact New Hampshire first asked her team for documentation of all media availabilities since she announced her campaign on April 12. Clinton’s New Hampshire staff provided a list that included all media availabilities in New Hampshire so far this year as well as additional interviews conducted with local news outlets in South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. We also took a look at pool reports compiled by journalists who have been following Clinton since she announced her candidacy, as well as reports from national journalists who kept track of how many press questions Clinton answered at the beginning of her campaign. As we looked into this claim, we relied on the historic practice of "doing local press" in the New Hampshire primary, which includes some or all of the following: on-camera interviews, one-on-one questions with reporters and editorial board meetings with local or state news organizations. During her inaugural campaign visit to Iowa on April 14 and 15, Clinton did not offer any official media availabilities but did respond to stray questions from reporters who were shadowing her outside of a community college and other stops. Questions included one asking her what she’d say to Americans who want to know why she’s running, some others on campaign finance and the significance of the Iowa caucus, as well as, "How are you liking Iowa?" The following week in New Hampshire, Clinton responded to several questions from reporters — including two from a reporter for WMUR, a New Hampshire TV station — after a roundtable at Whitney Brothers in Keene, N.H., on April 20. And the press corps took notice. "Despite being bombarded with press questions at every chance, Clinton has only personally answered a handful of inquiries since formally launching her campaign April 12," National Journal’s Zach C. Cohen noted in a story published April 27. "Instead, she has spoken directly to voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, taking their questions in small-scale events." In total, as documented by Tamara Keith at NPR, Clinton responded to 13 questions from reporters between April 14 (her first campaign visit in Iowa) and May 13 (one month and a day after she announced her campaign in a video posted online). Then, on May 19 in Iowa, following an event in Cedar Rapids, Clinton took another seven questions from journalists, according to follow-up reporting from NPR. (That included one question about whether Clinton would be taking journalists’ questions.) Clinton didn’t appear to distinguish between local and national media during that first month, responding to questions shouted from journalists representing ABC and the Associated Press, as well as from WMUR and an Iowa political television show. Almost exactly two months into her campaign, Clinton’s team started offering more access to local and state news outlets. On June 14, Clinton began sitting down for interviews with local news outlets in Iowa. She followed up with additional local media interviews in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina in the days ahead. One of those interviews was with the Concord Monitor, a Politifact affiliate. In that case, Clinton answered six questions in an interview that lasted a little less than 10 minutes after speaking at a June 15 rally in Concord. Since then, Clinton has conducted additional interviews with local reporters during July visits to New Hampshire and Iowa. In New Hampshire, for example, she gave interviews to WKXL Concord News Radio, the Conway Daily Sun, the Coos County Democrat/Berlin Reporter and the Berlin Daily Sun on July 3 and 4. As pointed out by National Journal’s Emily Schultheis in a story about Clinton’s media strategy in May, "national headlines were never the point" for her campaign team. "Instead, they're betting—and given the subject of the national conversation, almost certainly hoping—that what matters right now is happening much closer to the ground: the connections she makes with early-primary state voters, the persona she builds in key areas, and the buzz she generates with local activists," Schultheis noted at the time. In her sit-down interview with CNN, Clinton reflected on that strategy. She pointed to the "ramp-up" phase of the campaign, which centered on discussions in small-group settings over large-scale rallies or other events — and said they caused her to more seriously prioritize issues like substance abuse and mental health in her campaign. Our ruling In her first sit-down interview with a national television reporter, Hillary Clinton said, "I did local press all along, the last three months." A review of Clinton’s interactions with the media during the first three months of her campaign shows that she offered numerous interviews with local news outlets during the third month of that time frame. Prior to that, however, her interactions with with local news outlets were just about as scarce as they were with national outlets. It’s an exaggeration for her to say that she had been engaging with reporters at the local level for three months. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-02084	"It's been nearly three weeks since the president has commented" on questions about possible hidden wait lists at veterans hospitals.	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/20/major-garrett/garrett-va-troubles-nothing-public-obama-3-weeks/	As pressure builds for a clear accounting at Veterans Affairs over allegations of hidden wait lists and delays that cost veterans their lives, the Obama administration’s response has been roundly criticized. In an interview with CBS News, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said President Barack Obama is "madder than hell" about the possibility that care was denied to people who needed treatment. But CBS chief White House correspondent Major Garrett pushed McDonough on what Obama is doing about it. "It's been nearly three weeks since the president has commented on this publicly," Garrett said."Where's the president been? McDonough never really provided a clear answer to Garrett, so we wanted to see exactly what the president has said since the story broke. The White House press office pointed us to Obama’s answer during a press conference in Manila, Philippines, on April 28. A reporter asked if Obama would pledge to fix things. "The moment we heard about the allegations around these 40 individuals who had died in Phoenix, I immediately ordered the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Gen. (Eric) Shinseki, to investigate," Obama said. "We also have an IG (inspector general) investigation taking place. And so we take the allegations very seriously." Since that day -- just about three weeks ago -- the president has made no public statement. His press secretary Jay Carney invoked the president’s name when he announced the resignation of the under secretary for health at Veterans Affairs on May 16, but Obama himself has not spoken since. News of problems at the VA While troubles at VA hospitals have been covered for months -- CNN reported in January that veterans were dying due to health care delays -- a House hearing on April 9 drew broader attention. Chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., revealed that between the VA’s own investigation and that of the committee’s staff, delays may have caused the deaths of about 40 veterans who sought care at the VA hospital in Phoenix. Soon after, a retired clinic director from that hospital came forward and described how administrators used hand-written lists to conceal the long wait-times that over 1,000 veterans endured. More reports came in from the VA Office of the Medical Inspector that managers at a facility in Fort Collins, Colo., also had falsified wait-time records. Obama assigned deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors to oversee the VA review. Shinseki, meanwhile, faced a tough session in front of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on May 15. At the hearing, Shinseki said three top executives in Phoenix had been put on administrative leave and that a full investigation and audit was underway. On Monday, May 19, the White House said the public would hear from the president soon. Our ruling Garrett said it had been about three weeks since Obama had spoken in public about the problems at the VA. The White House confirms that Obama addressed the issue last April 28. That’s three weeks as of Monday. We rate the claim True.	None	Major Garrett	None	None	None	2014-05-20T17:08:35	2014-05-18	['None']
pomt-00396	"Colin Kaepernick immediately loses Nike endorsement after anti-white rant."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/05/blog-posting/no-colin-kaepernick-hasnt-lost-his-nike-deal/	Colin Kaepernick still has his Nike deal, though some bloggers want you to think he lost it the same day he announced it. Nike made Kaepernick one of the faces of its "Just Do It" campaign 30th anniversary and debuted the first ad Sept. 3. Kaepernick confirmed the new deal by posting the ad on his personal Twitter and Instagram, a move that generated praise from some, while prompting others to use the hashtag #NikeBoycott and cut the Nike logo out of their Nike products or burn them. It also prompted a false article from Conservative Columns claiming Kaepernick made an "anti-white rant" that resulted in him losing the deal. The Conservative Columns website has since been taken down. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Kaepernick started kneeling during the national anthem before games in 2016 to protest the treatment of people of color in the United States. "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick told NFL Media in 2016. "To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder." Since then, other NFL players have continued to protest, either by kneeling or by other gestures. President Donald Trump has weighed in numerous times, saying that the NFL should fire or suspend protesting players. "Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts," Trump tweeted Wednesday. "I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!" The Nike deal comes after Kaepernick has not had an NFL contract for more than a year-and-a-half. Last week, an arbitrator denied the NFL’s request to dismiss Kaepernick’s collusion complaint that claims NFL owners have kept him off the field because of his protests, not because of his football ability. The false Conservative Columns story was copied from the website America’s Last Line of Defense, which self-identifies as a satire site. Conservative Columns did not include a disclaimer on its home page or on the story. Conservative Columns copied another story from America’s Last Line of Defense earlier this week with a similar headline: "UPDATE: Sasha Obama’s racist anti-white rant just got her expelled." We rated that claim Pants on Fire. In addition to the identical content, the America’s Last Line of Defense article appears under the same headline as conservativecolumns.com, and it’s filed in the site’s category of "Political misinformation under the guise of ‘satire.’" We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06614	"In the month of July alone, EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent. A lot of that is our market share. Those are our farmers and our service providers who are suffering."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/21/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-trade-agreement-korea-helped-/	As former U.S. Trade Representative during the presidency of George W. Bush, Sen. Rob Portman has become a Republican point man on trade in the U.S. Senate. The day before President Barack Obama announced a $447 billion proposal to boost the economy and create jobs, Portman joined a group of GOP Senators Sept. 7, 2011, at a Capitol Hill news conference to suggest that Obama could create jobs quickly by sending pending trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama to Congress, where all three would likely pass with bipartisan support. Portman argued countries which have adopted trade pacts are gaining market share in those three nations that would go to U.S. farmers and companies but for the stalled trade agreements. Noting that the European Union passed a trade agreement with Korea in July, he backed up his point by citing Korean customs service statistics that he deemed "startling." "In the month of July alone, EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent," Portman said. "A lot of that is our market share. Those are our farmers and our service providers who are suffering. By the way, during that same period, U.S. exports to Korea increased only 2.9 percent." Observing that it’s now easier for Korea to import vehicles from Europe rather than the U.S., Portman declared: "We need to move and move quickly here before we lose even more market share." Did EU exports really jump that much while U.S. numbers dropped? And was it at the expense of U.S. farmers and our service providers? PolitiFact Ohio decided to check into Portman’s claim. We contacted his office to ask where he got his statistics. They passed along an August 25 statement from South Korea’s embassy. "Merely one month after the Korea-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect on July 1, 2011, EU exports to Korea rose 36.7 percent compared to the same month last year," the statement said. "Meanwhile U.S. exports to Korea increased by just 2.9 percent over the same period, according to Korea Customs Service. In July 2010, U.S. exports were greater in value than EU exports to Korea. One year later, however, the opposite is true, as the U.S.Korea FTA (KORUS FTA) remains unratified." It went onto urge passage of the trade agreement, claiming that "continued KORUS FTA delay is placing U.S. farmers, manufacturers, service providers and workers at a significant disadvantage in the Korean market, jeopardizing potentially billions of dollars in sales opportunities and tens of thousands of American jobs." That statement certainly backs up the numbers that Portman used. But the situation grew murkier after we examined trade data for other months to see whether the trade agreement’s passage actually escalated EU trade with Korea, as the news release claimed. Embassy spokesman John Brinkley supplied trade figures from Korea’s "Ministry of Knowledge Economy," which is similar to the U.S. Commerce Department. He said that Korea’s Customs Service releases its data in the Korean language - which PolitiFact doesn’t understand - while the Ministry of Knowledge Economy releases English language data. Brinkley said the agencies use slightly different methodologies to compute their statistics, so their numbers are a bit off from each other, but often show similar trends. For instance, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy data sheet for July shows a 44.9 percent growth rate in goods that South Korea obtained from the EU, (instead of the customs service’s 36.7 percent) and an 8.5 percent uptick in goods from the U.S (instead of the other agency’s 2.9 percent). It also showed that Korea got 8.4 percent of its imports from the United States that month, and 10.3 percent of its imports from the European Union. If the July trade agreement had rapidly escalated the EU’s share of exports to Korea, one would expect that trend to continue in August. It did not. August statistics released Sept. 5 from the Ministry of Knowledge Economy show U.S. exports were 22 percent greater than last August, outstripping the EU’s 14.8 percent growth rate. That month, 9.2 percent of South Korea’s imports came from the United States, 8.8 percent came from the European Union. What’s more, Ministry of Knowledge Economy statistics for the first half of the year, showed South Korea got 8.9 percent of its imports from the EU in the six months before the trade agreement kicked in, and 8.6 percent of its imports from the United States. The EU’s year-over-year growth rate in those months was 25.5 percent, compared with 11.5 percent for the United States. Brinkley said it would be impossible to prove the July surge in exports from the EU resulted from the trade agreement, although plenty of anecdotal evidence to that effect was reported in the Korean press, such as EU companies saying they’d lower their wholesale prices in Korea, and Korean retailers saying they would lower prices on EU goods after the trade agreement was approved. "Why the US/EU ratio was less pronounced in August is anybody's guess," Brinkley said in an email. Brinkley supplied Korean Customs Service data that also showed U.S. exports to South Korea outstripping that month’s EU exports. He indicated U.S. exports to South Korea for August rose 33.8 percent "year-on-year," while EU exports rose 17.1 percent. Still, he said the "average July-August 2011 export growth" was 17.8 percent for the U.S, and 26.5 percent for the EU. He attributed August’s uptick in U.S. exports to Boeing’s delivery of three F-15 fighter planes to South Korea, as well as increased U.S. grain exports occasioned by South Korea’s unusually severe August monsoon season. Brinkley said both trade agreements are structured in such a way that grain tariffs are phased out over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years, "so EU grain is not yet significantly cheaper than US grain." Todd Tucker, who is research director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, which opposes trade agreements, noted that Portman and other trade agreement advocates focus only on exports, and ignore imports that could cost U.S. jobs. He also said "so-called FTAs" do not necessarily increase exports. "In both Thailand and Taiwan (also not FTA partners), the U.S. is selling more in dollar terms than it was in 2005," Tucker said in an email. "In contrast, the U.S. has lost rank and market share in Australia since 2005, and the U.S. has had an FTA in place with Australia over that entire time period. In sum, there are a lot of ways to boost exports, but history shows that FTAs are not one of them." So where does that leave Portman’s statement? The senator accurately quoted the trade stats he obtained from the Korean embassy’s August 25 news release. But the data doesn’t support the other part of his claim -- his underlying point that countries which have adopted trade pacts are gaining market share that would go to U.S. farmers and companies. It is contradicted by the data for August trade available from Korea’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy released two days before Portman spoke. And statistics for the six months before the EU trade agreement kicked in show EU trade growth. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Portman’s claim Half True.

pomt-13149	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That’s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/31/donald-trump/trump-says-clinton-would-bring-650-million-people-/	One of Donald Trump’s signature lines at campaign rallies are his promise to secure the border in contrast with Hillary Clinton’s "open borders." "She wants open borders. We could have 600 million people pour into our country. Think of it. Once you have open borders like that, you don’t have a country anymore," Trump said in Greeley, Colo., on Oct. 30, according to CBS News. By the time Trump spoke in Albuquerque, the number had jumped to 650 million people. And Trump said it would happen "in one week." "She wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in, and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That’s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week," Trump said. Both claims are ridiculous and should be discarded immediately. Some numbers, for context The worldwide population is about 7.3 billion people, and the United States is home to about 324 million. The U.S. immigrant population in 2014 was more than 42.4 million, or 13.3 percent of the nation’s total population, according to Migration Policy Institute estimates using Census Bureau data. That represents millions of people who have migrated to the United States over decades. There are about 1 million daily legal crossings between the United States and Mexico -- that’s a count of people going back and forth into each country. Mexicans represent the single largest share of the U.S. total migrant population, about 27 percent in 2015, according to Migration Policy Institute. Yet, more Mexicans have left the United States than have come in since the end of the Great Recession, according to Pew Research Center. To get close to Trump's 650 million migration, every single person from South America, Central America and Canada would have to move to the United States (about 633 million people), the Washington Post noted. To do it, as Trump said, in one week, 3.87 million people would have to enter the country every hour for 168 straight hours. That's equivalent to the entire population of the city of Los Angeles entering the country every hour for a full week. Clinton’s immigration stance While Trump's claim is logistically impossible, it's also in no way what Clinton proposes. We asked Trump’s campaign where the candidate was drawing his information from and they circled back to their claim that Clinton is for open borders, something we've rated False or Mostly False depending on the particulars of what Trump said. The Clinton campaign said she did not support allowing 650 million people into the country. "This is just demonstrably false," said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign. So what is Clinton’s policy? At campaign events, presidential debates, press conferences and on the immigration reform page on Clinton’s campaign website, there has been no mention of Clinton wanting millions of people to pour into the United States, much less in a week. She has not called for open borders. In September 2015, Clinton said in a CBS’ Face the Nation interview the United States should accept 65,000 Syrian refugees afflicted by that country’s civil war. "We're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II and I think the United States has to do more," Clinton said. She has stressed a need for thorough refugee vetting. Based on Clinton’s September 2015 comment, Trump recently made the False assertion that Clinton would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term. Clinton has not said that, and Trump’s statement was based on assumptions. Clinton does support increasing immigration for high-skilled workers and entrepreneurs. But there's been no reference to millions of people migrating to the United States. Finally, the Democratic presidential nominee has widely spoken about offering a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally and to introduce comprehensive immigration reform within her first 100 days in office. Clinton has said she would focus on deporting those who pose a violent threat to public safety. In 2013, Clinton supported legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship, billions for border security, fencing along the Mexican border and adding 20,000 border agents. Our ruling Trump said Clinton "wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in, and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That’s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week." Clinton has never said that, nor is this a realistic possibility. Clinton has spoken in favor of bring in 65,000 Syrian refugees, but that’s nowhere near hundreds of millions of people, and not in a week. Trump’s claim is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-02235	"A lot of the move to free the slaves ... did not come from the federal government. It came from a growing movement among the people, particularly people of faith."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/15/jim-demint/demint-people-faith-did-more-end-slavery-federal-g/	Historians study the past so they can understand it. But when pundits start talking history, you can bet that they are likely using the past to talk about the present. A new book by former Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., features his conversations with average Americans about the country’s founding principles. DeMint now heads the Heritage Foundation, a leading conservative think tank and advocacy group. Christian radio host Jerry Newcombe had DeMint on his show "Vocal Point" to talk about that book Falling in Love With America Again. DeMint defined conservatives as people who want to retain principles that have proven to move the country forward. The conversation turned to the Civil War and whether that showed that the nation’s founding guidelines didn’t always produce good results. DeMint argued that the Civil War vindicated conservative principles. He first credited the Constitution for leading to the end of slavery, then he took a different tack. "But a lot of the move to free the slaves came from the people, it did not come from the federal government," DeMint said. "It came from a growing movement among the people, particularly people of faith, that this was wrong... So no liberal is going to win a debate that big government freed the slaves." We thought we should check with historians to see whether a lot of the move to free the slaves came from people of faith rather than the federal government. There are two elements to run down -- the role of Washington and the role of religion. We contacted the Heritage Foundation for information that would back up both parts of DeMint’s statement. DeMint himself was unavailable and a spokeswoman sent us material only about the role of religion. The federal role Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia University and a leading Civil War scholar rejected DeMint’s conclusion and invited him to attend the class he is teaching this semester. "He will learn that the federal government was central to emancipation," Foner said. "The Second Confiscation Act, Emancipation Proclamation, and Thirteenth Amendment originated with the federal government, not to mention the role of the army in freeing slaves. Of course, many other actors were involved, not least slaves themselves who seized freedom. But it was a context created by the federal government -- the war -- that enabled them to do so." The Second Confiscation Act of 1862 declared that the federal government would seize the slaves of any rebel and they "shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves." The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, declared that slaves in the Confederate states -- but not states loyal to the Union -- "are, and henceforward shall be free." The Thirteenth Amendment, passed while the fighting still raged and ratified about six months after it ended, declared that "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States." Another prominent Civil War researcher, Bruce Levine, a historian at the University of Illinois, said DeMint was "mixing apples and pears." "It was one, very important, thing to advocate abolition," Levine told PunditFact. "It was another thing to legislate and impose it. It was obviously the federal government that actually did decree and enforce the abolition of slavery, first of all through the Union war effort and finally through enforcement of the thirteenth amendment." Faith and slavery The role of faith is a complicated picture, more nuanced than what DeMint described. His office pointed us to an interview with Rob Rapley, the writer of a PBS series on the abolitionists. "Every one of the abolitionists was shaped very much by their faith," Rapley said. "In fact, they would have defined themselves first by their faith before any other category." The historians we reached, and others whose work we read, don’t share such a monolithic view of the abolitionists. "White abolitionists included people who were less influenced by religious than by secular outlooks," Levine said. "The earliest and most determined enemies of slavery were African-Americans themselves, some of whom were pronouncedly religious and some were not." Still, the majority of the leaders of the American Anti-Slavery Society, a powerful voice for emancipation in the decades before the war, identified with some branch of faith. They drew their inspiration from the Bible. In 1845, two theologians debated the biblical view on slavery. Jonathan Blanchard spoke for the abolitionist position. "Abolitionists take their stand upon the New Testament doctrine of the natural equity of man," Blanchard said. "The one-bloodism of human kind [from Acts 17:26]: -- and upon those great principles of human rights, drawn from the New Testament, and announced in the American Declaration of Independence, declaring that all men have natural and inalienable rights to person, property and the pursuit of happiness." Whatever the specifics on the abolitionists, DeMint made a broader point. He said that faith powered a growing movement among people to free the slaves. Even the source his office sent us reveals that faith cut both ways. While it fueled those who condemned slavery, the Bible was also the bulwark for the most ardent defenders of slavery. Rapley talked about a Christian woman abolitionist who made her appeal directly to Southern women. "She thought that if the women of the South turned against slavery, it would lead very quickly to the end of slavery, that men would follow suit," Rapley said. "That was roundly rejected. The gentle appeal to her kinfolk resulted in a violent backlash." Manisha Sinah, adjunct professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, said the religious justification for slavery was well formed. "The defense of slavery in the Southern states, especially South Carolina, rested on a Biblical -- fundamentalist and literal reading of the Bible -- argument," Sinah said. There are many examples of this. Presbyterian minister James Henley Thornwell, a co-founder of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America, wrote, "Certain it is that no direct condemnation of slavery can anywhere be found in the Sacred Volume. The master is nowhere rebuked as a monster of cruelty and tyranny; the slave is nowhere exhibited as the object of peculiar compassion or sympathy." Thornwell declared that the church could never go beyond what the Bible said. "And apart from the Bible she can never speak. Her only argument is, Thus it is written." According to John Kaufman-McKivigan, professor of history at Indiana University, Southern ministers favored one line above all others. "Almost invariably, these writers noted that Saint Paul in several of his epistles, admonished slaves to be obedient to their earthly masters," McKivigan wrote. Paul’s words were, "Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord." Some in the North also believed that slavery was divinely ordained. Nathan Lord, who was president of Dartmouth College from 1828 to 1863, "warned that any human reproach to the institution of slaveholding was ‘dishonorable to God and subversive to his government,’" McKivigan wrote."Despite the efforts of thousands of antislavery men and women, both inside and outside the churches, all but a few small denominations balked at a commitment to uncompromised abolitionist principles and programs." Our ruling DeMint said that the federal government played less of a role in the freeing of the slaves than did a movement among people, especially those of faith. DeMint has a point that people of faith played a part in supporting the end of slavery. But the historical record is clear that people of faith also played a role in trying to defend slavery. More critical, leading historical scholars we consulted were unanimous that the federal government was the necessary and decisive force that ended slavery. DeMint's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-14479	"We work longer hours than any people in the industrialized world, including the Japanese."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/feb/29/bernie-sanders/contrary-sanders-us-workers-dont-put-most-hours-wo/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders told supporters at a Feb. 23 rally in Norfolk, Va. that Americans are the hardest-working people in the developed world. "Here’s something else I want everybody here to know: Japanese are very hard-working people," the Democratic presidential candidate said. "We work longer hours than any people in the industrialized world, including the Japanese." We asked Warren Gunnels, the policy director for the Sanders campaign, for the basis of the candidate’s statement. He pointed us to a January post by a personal finance blog, 20somethingfinance, which said the U.S. is "the most overworked developed nation in the world." The post said that the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency that tracks global workforce trends, has found that U.S. workers on average work more hours than the Japanese, French and British. But those are only three developed countries. We found a list from the Central Intelligence Agency and another from the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund - better known as UNICEF - showing there’s about three dozen industrialized nations. Most of those countries are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 democratic nations - almost all with advanced economies - seeking to improve trade relations. The OECD keeps data on the average yearly hours put in by workers in each of its member countries. The statistics show that in 2014, the latest year available, the average U.S. worker toiled 1,789 hours on the job, higher than the average of 1,770 hours among all the countries in the OECD. Employees in Japan, whom Sanders mentioned in his remarks, put in an average 1,729 hours a year - or 60 hours less than their American counterparts. Workers in many other nations, including all of the other members of the G-7 major developed countries of Canada, United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany, also worked fewer hours than Americans. But it’s clear there is a group of industrialized countries where workers put in greater average hours than those in the U.S. They are: •Greece, 2,042 hours worked; •Iceland, 1,864 hours; •Portugal, 1,857 hours; •Israel, 1,853 hours; and •Ireland, 1,821 hours. Workers in Hungary, South Korea, Poland and Turkey also logged more hours than U.S. employees. Some international organizations list those four countries as industrialized, while others do not. Let’s get back to Sanders, who long has maintained that most Americans are putting in longer hours as part of his argument that the nation’s economic system is tilted to benefit the very wealthy. PolitiFact National last fact-checked a Sanders statement on working hours in March 2011 and gave a False rating to the senator’s claim that Americans "now work the longest hours of any people around the world." We should note that Sanders made a narrower statement in Norfolk, where he limited his comparison of American workers to those from other industrialized nations. Our ruling Sanders said, "We work longer hours than any people in the industrialized world, including the Japanese." No doubt, American workers put in more hours than their cohorts in most of the roughly three dozen industrialized nations. But Sanders goes too far in putting the U.S. as No. 1. Depending on whose list of developed nations you use, there are at least five, and as many as nine, countries with workers spending more time on the job than those in the U.S. We rate Sanders’ statement Mostly False. Editors Note: The original version of this story listed an incorrect figure for how many fewer hours Japanese employees worked compared to Americans in 2014.

pomt-14887	"When President Obama was running for re-election … Senator Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/martin-omalley/fact-checking-martin-omalleys-claim-bernie-sanders/	Bernie Sanders didn’t have Barack Obama’s back in 2012, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley suggested at the First in the South Democratic Presidential forum. "When President Obama was running for re-election, I was glad to step up and work very hard for him, while Sen. Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him," O’Malley said on Nov. 6, adding that he’s "a lifelong Democrat" unlike Sanders, a former independent, and Hillary Clinton, a former Republican. That’s "categorically false," Sanders said on ABC’s This Week two days later: "Somebody asked me years ago, do you think there should be a primary opponent to Barack Obama? And I don't know exactly the words that I -- I'm not sure -- what's wrong with a primary situation?" So who’s right? The Sanders campaign didn’t get back to us, but O’Malley’s spokesperson sent us several examples of Sanders saying a primary challenge wouldn’t be a bad idea. We also searched Google, Nexis and CQ for comments Sanders made on the topic of a primary challenge. Here’s what he said: • March 16, 2011 WNYC: "If a progressive Democrat wants to run, I think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues, and people have a right to do that. I've been asked whether I am going to do that. I'm not. I don't know who is, but in a democracy, it's not a bad idea to have different voices out there." • July 22, 2011 Thom Hartmann Radio Program: "I think one of the reasons that the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing. … At this point, I have not (encouraged anyone), but I am now giving thought to it. There are a lot of smart, honest, progressive people who I think can be good presidents." • Aug. 12, 2011 C-SPAN: "If you’re asking me, do I think at the end of the day that Barack Obama is going to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2012? I do. But do I believe that it is a good idea for our democracy, and for the Democratic Party — and I speak, by the way, as an independent — that people start asking the president some hard questions about why he said one thing during his previous campaign and then is doing another thing today on Social Security, on Medicare? I think it is important that that discussion take place." • Nov. 13, 2011 Politico: Sanders refused to say whether he would back the president in 2012, but said he hopes "the president never forgets who elected him to the White House. It was not Wall Street, although they contributed. It was not the big money interests. It was working families, lower-income people and the middle class." He also urged Obama to "stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people. ... I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it’s a little bit early in the process." So it’s clear that Sanders was suggesting a primary challenge to move Obama to the left, experts said, but not exactly the way O’Malley phrased it. "I'm not sure if he was actually actively ‘trying to find someone,’ but it is clear that he thought it would be a good idea if someone did decide to challenge him," said Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political discourse at Texas A&M University. (Sanders’ comments sparked a rumbling in the media as well as the question of whether that someone would be Hillary Clinton.) Kathleen Kendall, a communications professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in presidential campaign rhetoric, noted that Sanders was expressing strong dissatisfaction with Obama’s policies -- a point that didn’t go unnoticed by the White House. Four anonymous senior officials for Obama’s 2012 campaign told BuzzFeed that Sanders was "either attacking the president from the left or doing little to get him elected." "Every indication we had was that he was considering a primary challenge," one unnamed official said in the BuzzFeed story. Sanders eventually endorsed Obama over Mitt Romney, telling CNN in May 2012, "I think Obama is by far the preferable candidate. Is Obama doing everything I want? Absolutely not, and among other things, he has not been as strong as he should standing up to Wall Street." Our ruling O’Malley said, "When President Obama was running for re-election … Sen. Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him." As a sitting senator, Sanders' comments at a minimum were provocative: He didn't think it was a bad idea for a candidate to run against Obama in the primary. He spoke positively of such a scenario several times. When Sanders endorsed Obama, Sanders said it was because Obama was preferable to Romney. That doesn’t mean Sanders was actively searching for a candidate to actually run against Obama. We rate O’Malley’s claim Half True.

pomt-13049	"There is long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/nov/23/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-long-historical-precedent-smaller-su/	Before Republican Donald Trump bested Hillary Clinton for president, Sen. Ted Cruz sparked a fresh line of speculation when he hinted that the Senate in 2017 might not even vote to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The Texas Republican, an attorney and former Supreme Court clerk who went on to represent Texas before the court, asserted that the court’s current composition of eight justices -- following the February 2016 death in Texas of Justice Antonin Scalia -- was consistent with other times the court had fewer than nine members. Cruz, addressing an October 2016 campaign rally for Darryl Glenn, the Republican U.S. Senate nominee in Colorado, said: "There is certainly a long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with few justices." We asked Cruz’s Senate office what he meant by a court with fewer than nine justices. Did a specific historical period back his claim? By email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack didn’t offer detail, saying instead: "The key here is that Cruz said there is time to debate the issue." Speaking of debate, we spotted objections from two justices to the court not regaining a member. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in May 2016 that eight members "is not a good number for a multimember court." In September 2016, Justice Elena Kagan opined that an eight-member court would become a "problem" over time because of the potential for tie votes, according to a U.S. News & World Report news story. At the Colorado rally, though, Cruz noted that Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, who joined the court in 1994, had "observed that the vacancy is not impacting the ability of the court to do its job." Cruz was referring to an Oct. 24, 2016, interview of Breyer on MSNBC’s Morning Joe in which the justice said the Supreme Court occasionally has functioned with fewer than nine members. "The court, when it began at the time of the Constitution’s writing, had six members," Breyer said. "They had six members for several years. They had 10 members for several years after the Civil War." The Supreme Court without nine members The court can act without an odd number of members. But if a majority cannot agree on an opinion, it’s as if the court never took up the case. "If the Court divides 4-4, the lower court opinion is affirmed without creating any Supreme Court precedent," Jeffrey Fisher, a Stanford University law professor, told Business Insider. And the even number of justices after Scalia’s death altered the trajectory of a few major decisions during the court’s latest term, which ran from October 2015 to June 2016. Consider Fisher v. University of Texas in which the court decided 4-3 that the University of Texas at Austin’s race-conscious admissions program and others like it around the country were constitutional. If Scalia were alive to cast a vote in the case, court observers agree, he likely would have made it a 4-4 decision--with the court still upholding the UT program but not creating a national precedent. "The thing is that the court gets the hard cases where you got legitimate arguments on both sides," Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, told us by phone. "Those are exactly the cases where it needs not to split 4-4."For months, filling Scalia’s seat has been a topic of fierce partisan fighting. Democrats have criticized the Republican-majority Senate for refusing to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, a federal appellate judge, to fill the vacancy. Senate Democrats argue that the court needs a full contingent of nine justices to settle legal disputes of consequence. Court’s size through history Breyer was correct that the court didn’t start with nine members. Also, we learned, the court’s size is set by statutory law, not in the Constitution. There also have been long stretches where the court remained short a justice. Most recently, 257 days elapsed between Scalia’s death and Cruz’s statement. After Scalia’s death, Roll Call published this chart showing how long high court vacancies lasted the previous 116 years of the court’s history: To our inquiry, James O’Hara, chairman of the Library Committee at the Supreme Court Historical Society, told us by phone that when there is divided government in Washington, fighting over a vacant court seat is to be expected. Since the Constitution is mum about how many judges can sit on the high court, any change to the number requires federal legislation. O’Hara, a retired history professor from Loyola University Maryland, said: "When it comes to Supreme Court vacancies, Congress and the president play hardball and this is not the first time. It’s something that has happened multiple times, usually because the president is from one party and the other party is in control of the Senate." We asked about specific years when the number of Supreme Court justices fluctuated, and O’Hara advised that twice in the court’s history, it operated for months with fewer than nine justices. O’Hara talked us through this history: In 1789, the first Congress set the number of justices at six -- an even number. O’Hara told us the court’s early cases weren’t concerned with broad national issues, so an even number of judges likely was not a pressing matter for the earliest lawmakers who designed the court. Plus, some court observers long have argued that a smaller, even-numbered set of justices would force them to find compromise and write narrower opinions. Save for about 30 years, during which the Civil War occurred, the court has had nine justices for much of its history. Its membership, first set at that number in 1837, fluctuated a few times before Congress set it again at nine starting in 1869. In 1801, Congress’ majority Federalist party shrank the court by one in the hopes of stopping President Thomas Jefferson, a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, from filling a vacancy. But Congress went the other way toward the end of Jefferson’s two terms by expanding the court to seven members. Later, in 1837, Congress made the court a nine-person body, according to several court histories. We couldn’t immediately divine the reason for the expansion. The Civil War period saw a spike in Supreme Court membership; Congress bumped the court up to 10 justices in 1863. Three years later, with the war over, the Republican majorities in both chambers did not want President Andrew Johnson -- the Democratic successor to Abraham Lincoln who would be impeached by the House two years later -- to appoint any new justices, so they lowered the number to seven. The decrease was to take effect as each seat became vacant. In 1869, with Johnson out of office, Congress increased the court’s membership to nine, where it has stayed ever since. In the late 1980s, the court temporarily shrunk to fewer than nine justices. Two of President Ronald Reagan’s court nominees failed before his third choice, Anthony Kennedy, won Senate confirmation in 1988. The president’s first nominee, Robert Bork, did not win Senate approval and his second nominee, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew from consideration after reports surfaced that he had smoked marijuana. When Kennedy joined the court, his colleagues ordered new arguments in four cases that had been evenly split, 4-4, so he could break the tie, according to journalist Jan Crawford Greenburg’s book, Supreme Conflict. Arguments for and against a nine-member court Next, we looked for research into whether an even-numbered court has affected the court’s quality of work--finding that debatable. After all, the last time the court was statutorily set at fewer than nine justices, America did not have 50 states and slavery was a major legal issue. The court’s membership has not permanently dropped below nine for more than a century, making it difficult to compare whether it is more or less able to do its work with fewer than nine. Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center, argued in a February 2016 Huffington Post piece that an even-numbered court would promote stalemates. "By hearing cases in which lower courts are divided, the Court can settle the dispute and establish one rule of law to govern the entire nation," she wrote. "But there will be many cases in which the Court cannot do that when it has only eight members. There’s no question that on this sharply divided Court, the potential for 4-4 decisions will be strong." Meanwhile, Eric Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law, argued in an April 2016 Salon blog that an even-numbered court would champion compromise. "First, with eight Justices equally divided between the two major political parties, the winning side must convince at least one Justice to side with Justices from the other party to form a majority. Over time, this requirement would lead to more public confidence in the final outcomes and also likely generate more moderate arguments and decisions (which is a good thing given that the Court is composed of life tenured, elite lawyers who the people don’t elect and cannot vote out of office)." Our ruling Cruz said: "There is long historical precedent for a Supreme Court with fewer justices." In fact, Congress has kept the court at nine members for all but a handful of years since lawmakers set that number of justices in 1837. A few extended vacancies later left the court operating with eight members, but they occurred because the Senate was resisting nominees rather than committing to an even-steven smaller court.

pomt-07218	"A few months into office, (President Barack Obama) traveled around the globe to apologize for America."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-traveled-around-glob/	During the formal announcement of his presidential candidacy on June 2, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney repeated a shot at President Barack Obama that he had taken in the title of his 2010 book, No Apology. "A few months into office, (Obama) traveled around the globe to apologize for America," Romney said during his kickoff speech at a farm in Stratham, N.H. Did Obama really do that much apologizing? We published a fact-check of a similar charge by Romney on March 15, 2010. Here’s the claim from Romney’s book that we checked back then: "Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined," Romney wrote. "It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." In the book, Romney specifically named the speeches he was referring to: "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." At the time, we rated the claim False. Seeing Romney make the charge again during his announcement speech, we thought it would be worth seeing if what he said this time was any more or less accurate. (His staff did not answer a request for comment.) Let’s first recap our findings from March 2010. What Obama said For starters, as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: "sorry." Merriam-Webster defines an apology as "an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret." We read the seven Obama speeches cited in Romney’s book and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks, and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together. At a town hall meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. "On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated," Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team. "Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable," Obama said. "I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the United States and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply "move forward." Here are his exact remarks: "In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward." Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in the fact we're checking. Typically, Obama would say that the United States must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; we’ve rated it a Promise Broken.) Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism. Obama said that after 9/11, "our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions." He also said that the Guantanamo prison "likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies." Did Obama apologize? We sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing. • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the United States has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. "There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation," he said. • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret." Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. "There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will," Murphy said. "The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that. • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society, and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." Other presidential apologies Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. "The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well," Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. "We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope." Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. "The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong," Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. "To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry." Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. "My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy, and it is not over," he said. "The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all." Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. "We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America," Bush said. "I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America." Obama's praise and motivations While Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledged as much when he wrote that Obama, "always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there." In Cairo, Obama called the United States "one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world." At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, "What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history." And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama said: "Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity." What’s new from the announcement speech The two statements we’ve checked -- the one from Romney’s book in 2010, and the one from his announcement speech in 2011 -- are similar, but not identical. They share substance -- a portrayal of Obama’s comments in his early months in office as "apologies." But we note an added emphasis in the announcement speech that sharpens Romney’s charge. He said Obama "traveled around the globe to apologize for America," which suggests that the apologies didn’t merely happen during Obama’s travels, but that the travels were undertaken for the specific purpose of apologizing. Some of the Obama speeches that Romney cited in the book certainly laid out the newly inaugurated president’s foreign policy ideas, and it seems fair to say that a less confrontational approach was among Obama’s goals. After all, Obama had made no secret during the campaign that he intended to set a different course on foreign policy than Bush -- a committed unilateralist -- had pursued. Still, we think it’s incorrect for Romney to portray these early speeches as part of a global tour undertaken "to apologize for America." Using Romney’s standard, you could argue that any change in foreign policy that’s undertaken after a presidential transition and announced to the world would constitute an "apology" for the previous policy. Our ruling On the substance of Romney’s charge, we believe that what we wrote in March 2010 still stands. While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, those passages were typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries have erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch. And on the new angle he added -- that the trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries -- we think it’s a ridiculous charge. There’s a clear difference between changing policies and apologizing, and Obama didn’t do the latter. So we rate Romney’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-10775	"I've seen (life) from the factory floor when I was working the graveyard shift ...and I'd be ankle-deep in water at the Murray Ohio bicycle plant where I was running a machine that was so loud I couldn't hear myself yell if I wanted to."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/18/fred-thompson/humble-and-mostly-accurate/	On the campaign trail, Fred Thompson is quick to tell the story of his humble beginnings. In his announcement speech in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sept. 7, 2007, he said this: "My story is an American story one that's happened many times across this great nation of ours, where a kid of modest means from a little town without a whole lot of resources or even a whole lot of ambition when he was a kid, had the opportunity to do some great things… "I've seen it from a lot of different standpoints. I've seen it from the factory floor when I was working the graveyard shift and we'd have lunch there on the change of the shifts and I'd be ankle-deep in water at the Murray Ohio bicycle plant where I was running a machine that was so loud I couldn't hear myself yell if I wanted to. And I've had the opportunity to dine with foreign leaders in foreign capitals around the world and just about everything in between." Confirming an often-repeated story from nearly 50 years ago is not easy and the Thompson campaign couldn't provide any independent verification of the details. His spokesman, Jeff Sadosky, said the campaign office people "don't know anything beyond the stories I've heard him tell." It's tough to imagine these circumstances for a former U.S. Senator, high-paid lobbyist and Hollywood actor. But his blue-collar claims hold up pretty well to scrutiny. To check the story, we called more than a dozen folks in Thompson's hometown of Lawrenceburg, Tenn., who either knew him or worked with him during his brief stint at the Murray manufacturing plant in 1960. Most of those we talked to can't actually remember seeing Thompson work on the assembly line. But they recall knowing that he worked as a temporary employee for one summer — as many local boys did — before leaving for Florence State College (now University of North Alabama) in the fall. These employees would typically work the third shift (11 p.m. to 7 a.m.) that none of the full-timers wanted, said Bobby Alford, who started at the factory the year it opened and worked for 37 years. Former workers also agree that many sections of the massive factory were extremely loud. But they said they never worked in ankle-deep water. "I don't know why he said that," said Doyce Shaddix, who worked at Murray for 43 years and said the roof did sometimes leak in the rain. "It wasn't like it happened all the time." We couldn't verify the ankle-deep water conditions, and you'd never know from his speech that Thompson's view of life from the factory floor lasted just one summer before college. But the point of his story is accurate and so we find this claim Mostly True.	None	Fred Thompson	None	None	None	2007-10-18T00:00:00	2007-09-07	['None']

pomt-13225	Says Hillary Clinton "wanted the wall."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-fought-wall-betw/	When the topic turned to immigration in the Oct. 19, 2016, presidential debate, Donald Trump suggested that Hillary Clinton supported his signature proposal: a massive wall on the U.S-Mexico border. "Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall, in 2006 or thereabouts," he said. "Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn’t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall." Clinton, alluding to her time as a U.S. senator from New York, responded by saying she voted for border security, which she said included a wall in "some limited" places but also measures such as new technology. So, did Clinton support the type of wall Trump wants? Wall to wall PolitiFact National has examined how Trump plans to build, and pay for, the wall. Trump has said the wall could cost $8 billion to $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. He’s said the wall doesn’t need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. As Trump suggested in the debate, Clinton did vote for a barrier. But it was not to the extent he supports. As we previously reported, the Trump campaign cited Clinton’s vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed into law by President George W. Bush, which authorized about 700 miles of fencing to be installed along the country’s southern border, along with other security measures. It was the beginning of an attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform. So it’s fair to say Clinton supported a barrier. For our purposes, the differences between a wall and a fence in this claim are not significant — both block people. But the fence Clinton backed is not as extensive as the wall Trump is promoting. And in his phrasing, Trump equated the two. The Associated Press has reported that the fencing, placed largely in urban areas, is not the type of solid wall that Trump has pledged to construct at Mexico’s expense. The fence has miles-long gaps and gates built in to allow landowners access to their property on the south side of the fencing. Immigrants have been known to go over and around the fence. Indeed, Trump himself has said the fencing "was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall." Our rating Trump said, Clinton "wanted the wall." Clinton voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, but not for the taller, longer concrete wall that he vows to build. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

pomt-05269	Says under President Barack Obama there’s been "the lowest discretionary spending we’ve had in decades in the United States."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/28/cory-booker/cory-booker-claims-obama-has-overseen-nations-lowe/	Newark Mayor Cory Booker drew national attention last week for criticizing a campaign ad from President Barack Obama, but even praising the president was problematic for the Brick City leader. Before weighing in on the campaign ad, Booker argued May 20 in a roundtable discussion on NBC’s "Meet The Press" that Obama needs to remind Americans of his accomplishments, such as overseeing the lowest level of discretionary spending in decades. "First of all, I think it’s a race for President Obama to remind the American public (of) the kind of things he’s been doing and stop letting the other side steal his narrative," said Booker, a Democrat and a representative for the Obama campaign. "He’s a guy that’s cut taxes on small business, the lowest discretionary spending we’ve had in decades in the United States." It’s actually the other way around, PolitiFact New Jersey found. As a percentage of gross domestic product -- which is a measure of the nation’s economy -- discretionary spending under Obama reached its highest level in about two decades, according to figures released by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Discretionary spending is projected to drop to a level not seen at any point in the last several decades, but that would not occur for a few more years. Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres acknowledged that the mayor’s statement was wrong. "You’re correct," Torres told us. "He misspoke." First, let’s explain discretionary spending. There are two main categories of federal spending: discretionary and mandatory. Discretionary spending is controlled by lawmakers through annual appropriation acts. Mandatory spending is generally based on program parameters, such as those for Social Security and Medicare, without specific amounts being appropriated each year. Discretionary spending represents nearly 40 percent of all federal outlays, and is comprised of defense and non-defense items. Over the last decade, military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have largely contributed to the growth in defense spending, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Non-defense spending has increased during Obama’s tenure, in part, because of the stimulus bill he approved in February 2009, the budget office said. Since Booker’s claim refers to discretionary spending in general, we’ll look at the total amount. In fiscal year 2010 -- Obama’s first complete fiscal year as president -- discretionary spending hit 9.4 percent of GDP, marking the highest amount since fiscal year 1987. In fiscal year 2011, which ended last September, discretionary spending dropped to 9 percent. Before fiscal years 2010 and 2011, discretionary spending had not reached 9 percent since fiscal year 1991. In a deal to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, Obama and Congress agreed last summer to set caps on certain types of future discretionary spending. Due in large part to those caps, discretionary spending is projected to reach historic lows in the years ahead. According to the White House, discretionary spending would fall to 5.9 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2016, marking the lowest level since at least the early 1960s. The Congressional Budget Office has offered slightly different estimates, placing discretionary spending at 6.5 percent in fiscal year 2016 and 5.9 percent in fiscal year 2019. Our ruling In his May 20 appearance on NBC’s "Meet The Press," Booker cited a couple of Obama’s accomplishments, including "the lowest discretionary spending we’ve had in decades in the United States." But during Obama’s tenure, discretionary spending hit 9 percent of GDP for the first time in about two decades. Discretionary spending is projected to drop significantly in the years ahead, but Booker made it sound like that had already occurred. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04592	Says President Barack Obama is responsible for pending defense cuts.	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/21/mitt-romney/obama-blame-defense-sequestration-says-romney-ad/	A new Florida-centric ad for Mitt Romney says "Obama’s defense cuts" are set to "threaten thousands" of jobs. The ad opens with Romney speaking at the Republican National Convention in Tampa: "This president can ask us to be patient. This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. But this president cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office." A narrator then takes up the story line: "Here in Florida, we’re not better off under President Obama. Over 100,000 jobs lost, and Obama’s defense cuts threaten thousands more. Romney’s plan? Reverse Obama’s defense cuts, strengthen our military, create over 700,000 jobs for Florida." Is President Barack Obama planning large defense cuts? (We contacted both campaigns for this report, but didn’t hear back.) Actually, Obama has said he opposes the major defense cuts set to take effect in fiscal year 2013. The Romney ad takes one piece of information from a larger, more complicated story about the federal budget. That story goes back to the debt limit debate of 2011, so let’s start there. Looking for a budget deal in 2011 Last year, the United States government was reaching its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing. Raising the debt limit (also called the debt ceiling) was in some ways symbolic: Congress has the power of the purse, and the decisions to spend the money had already been made. In prior administrations, Congress approved higher debt limits with some partisan sniping (including from then-Sen. Obama against President George W. Bush) but without too much fuss. But in the summer of 2011, House Republicans insisted that actual spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner led negotiations with the Obama White House, and at first the two sides seemed to be moving toward a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget, referred to in the media as a "grand bargain." The closed-door negotiations fell apart, though, and since then journalists have been sorting through a lot of finger-pointing. Some blame Boehner for being unable to deliver his own Republicans on a deal, thanks to tea party opposition to any new taxes. Others blame Obama for his inexperience, for not cultivating relationships with congressional Republicans and for tactical mistakes at negotiating. Some blame both. At any rate, Republicans and Democrats came to a less ambitious agreement to raise the debt limit through the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law found approximately $1.2 trillion in budget cuts spread over 10 years. But it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion through a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. This 12-member committee became known as "the super-committee." The super-committee was supposed to meet and agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 23, 2011. Their proposal -- which could include tax increases, spending reductions or both -- would then get a filibuster-proof, up-or-down vote in Congress. As an incentive to the super-committee, the law included an unusual kind of budget threat: If the super-committee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted it down, then automatic, across-the-board cuts would go into effect, with half of those cuts hitting defense. These automatic cuts are referred to as "sequestration." Lo and behold, the super-committee didn’t agree on a deficit reduction package, so Congress never voted on it. Sequestration is now set to take effect with the 2013 budget. And that’s what the ad is referring to when it mentions "Obama’s defense cuts," according to press releases from the Romney campaign. "Obama’s" sequester? Does Obama support the sequester? Well, yes and no. Some of the most detailed reporting on sequestration is from Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his new book The Price of Politics. Woodward’s reporting shows clearly that defense sequestration was an idea that came out of Obama’s White House. But the intention was to force Republicans to negotiate, not to actually put the cuts into effect. Woodward summarizes the thoughts of the Obama team: "There would be no chance the Republicans would want to pull the trigger and allow the sequester to force massive cuts to Defense." Democrats, meanwhile, didn’t want to see their favorite domestic programs cut. As the negotiations proceeded, Republicans seemed to think the same thing. "Boehner told the House Republican leadership and other key members not to worry about the sequester … ‘Guys, this would be devastating to Defense,’ he said. ‘This would be devastating, from their perspective, on their domestic priorities. This is never going to happen.’ " But sequestration is now looming. In August 2012, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a reported detailing how sequestration will affect different departments. In its introduction, the OMB repeats the Obama administration’s opposition to the process. "The specter of harmful across-the-board cuts to defense and nondefense programs was intended to drive both sides to compromise. Congress can and should take action to avoid it by passing a comprehensive and balanced deficit reduction package. "As the Administration has made clear, no amount of planning can mitigate the effect of these cuts. Sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument. It is not the responsible way for our Nation to achieve deficit reduction." Still, some say that the Obama White House proposed sequestration, so that means Obama owns it. "While both parties are culpable for sequestration because the Budget Control Act passed Congress, the president proposed it originally and ultimately owns its outcome," said Mackenzie Eaglen, an expert on defense with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an adviser to the Romney campaign. "That is because he alone can lead by calling the party leaders together for a resolution today if he wanted as president." Other see the two parties as co-owners of sequestration, especially since Republicans in Congress voted for the law that set up its possibility. In the House, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted for the law, while 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 269-161.) In the Senate, 28 Republicans and 45 Democrats voted for it, while 19 Republicans and 6 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 74-26) "The logic that lays the blame for sequestration at Obama's feet, because he negotiated the BCA with GOP leaders in Congress, could just as easily apply to those other negotiators, or, indeed, any member of Congress who voted for the BCA in August 2011," said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Preble favors reductions to the defense budget. "I do not believe it accurate to refer to the cuts that will occur in both defense and non-defense discretionary spending under sequestration as ‘Obama's cuts,’ " he said. Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense also noted that sequestration results from a law passed in the usual manner. "I think the fact that Congress passed it means it is not a presidential mandate. It was a law that originated in Congress and was sent to the president’s desk," she said. Our ruling The Romney campaign ad refers to "Obama’s defense cuts" that could threaten jobs. But in short-handing the looming defense cuts, the ad gives only one piece of a much larger story. Obama’s negotiating team came up with the idea for defense cuts in 2011, but they were intended to motivate Congress to come up with a better deal for reining in the deficit, not as an effort to make those cuts reality. Meanwhile, both parties voted for the legislation that set up the chain of events leading to defense cuts. Obama’s position is that Congress should now act to avoid those cuts. We rate the statement Half True. Update: This report has been updated to include Eaglen's position as an adviser to the Romney campaign.

pomt-03873	"In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/08/scott-walker/wake-mass-shootings-scott-walker-says-half-wiscons/	In the wake of mass shootings in Wisconsin and around the country, it may have been alarming to hear Gov. Scott Walker explain why he proposed more spending for mental health care in his 2013-2015 budget. "Nationally, serious mental illness costs at least $193 billion a year in lost earnings," Walker said during his Feb. 20, 2013, budget presentation. "In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication." In the course of his remarks, Walker used two different terms -- "serious mental illness" and "serious psychological distress." He used the second to illustrate lack of care. Is he correct that only half of Wisconsin adults with "serious psychological distress" receive care? Backdrop: mass shootings Walker didn’t mention mass shootings in his budget address, but he alluded to them two weeks earlier when he revealed his plan to boost mental health spending by $29 million over two years. The National Alliance on Mental Illness Wisconsin praised the spending boost, which would be done from several different pots of money.But the advocacy group said Walker’s rejection of a federal proposal to expand Medicaid "reflects a shallow understanding" of "crucial means to affordable mental health care for Wisconsin residents." In revealing his plans, the governor stopped short of drawing a clear link between treating mental illness and preventing mass shootings, but indicated his plan took on greater urgency after mass killings in 2012. Those incidents included the shooting deaths of six worshippers at a Sikh temple outside of Milwaukee and of 26 children and adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. To be clear, only about 1 percent of people with mental illness considered to be severe are regarded as dangerous. But a 2011 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report found that this group can pose a dilemma for policy-makers, who lack the data to develop a sound system for dealing with it. Walker’s budget, which could be modified by the Legislature, includes $12.6 million to treat more patients who have been committed to mental hospitals, $10.2 million to expand community-based care programs for people with severe mental illness and $3.8 million for more coordination of care for children with behavioral issues. Walker’s evidence When we asked Walker’s office for evidence to back his claim, we were initially referred to a January 2013 report by his Department of Health Services. The report estimated, based on a federal survey of American adults, that in 2011, 49 percent of the 1 million adults in Wisconsin who had "any mental illness" did not get treatment. Any mental illness refers to people who have a "diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder." The disorder causes impairment -- ranging from mild to moderate to substantial -- in carrying out major life activities. The 49 percent figure cited in the health department’s report might appear to support Walker’s claim. But his claim about Wisconsin didn’t use the term mental illness. It used the phrase "serious psychological distress." We pointed out the difference to Stephanie Smiley, spokeswoman for the department. She then cited federal survey data showing that over a two-year period -- 2010 to 2011 -- an estimated 51 percent of Wisconsin adults with "serious psychological distress" did not get treatment in the previous year. (She also said that in 2008-2009, 31 percent of state adults with serious mental illness got treatment.) So, the 51 percent figure about serious psychological distress appears to back Walker’s claim. But let’s understand serious psychological distress as compared to serious mental illness, given that mental illness was the focus of Walker’s comments and his proposed spending increase. Other evidence Based on definitions pertaining to adults from the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which oversees the surveys Walker cited: there are differences between serious mental illness -- the first term Walker used in his budget speech -- and serious psychological distress, which he mentioned second. Serious mental illness refers to a "diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder" that involves substantial impairment in carrying out major life activities. Serious psychological distress refers to how a person responds to six questions in a federal survey about whether they feel nervous, hopeless, restless or fidgety, sad or depressed, "that everything was an effort" and "no good or worthless." Experts we consulted said that serious mental illness was a more precise term used to identify a person after thorough diagnosis and that serious psychological distress was an intentionally vague term used by researchers doing surveys. "It kind of casts a wider net," Annabelle Potvin of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Wisconsin said of the serious psychological distress term, which she said indicates a need for a person to get a mental health assessment. Serious psychological distress can encompass people anywhere on a scale from mild to serious mental illness, but tends to be lower on the scale. That’s according to the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Tim Connor, who evaluates mental health programs across the state; and Walter Laux, behavioral health division director of Community Advocates, a Milwaukee-based nonprofit agency. Indeed, the state Department of Health Services, in a 2010 report, also made a distinction. Serious psychological distress is a "non-specific category of distress" characterized by a "mood or anxiety disorder and a lesser degree of functional impairment than serious mental illness." It is considered to be "an indicator of possible serious mental illness, with similar but less strict inclusion criteria." In other words, people with serious psychological distress might have mental illness, but that distress is generally regarded as lower on a scale than serious mental illness. Our rating After making a reference to serious mental illness, Walker said: "In Wisconsin, only half of all the adults with serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication." Strictly speaking, Walker’s statistical claim is accurate, at least based on estimates derived from a federal survey. But his statement needs clarification, given that people with serious psychological distress may have mental illness, but have not been diagnosed as being mentally ill. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-03-08T09:00:00	2013-02-20	['Wisconsin']
pomt-12344	Says his campaign has received donations from "more than 7,000 contributors."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jun/14/andrew-gillum/democratic-candidate-governor-andrew-gillum-overco/	Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum says he outperformed his rivals for Florida governor in a key fundraising metric despite having less name recognition and taking time off from the campaign. His campaign issued the following statement to media under the headline, "Gillum Leads Gov. Field in Donors, $1.2M Raised YTD," on June 9: "Our campaign was thrilled for the mayor’s family to welcome their third child last month, and he took some well-deserved time off the campaign trail. We’re excited to have more than 7,000 contributors, the most in the race, and we’re raising the resources to compete in all 67 counties. "The mayor doesn't have a famous last name or personal wealth, but we're proud to have the support of thousands of Floridians." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The number of contributors was repeated by a few news outlets. Gillum, the first major candidate to enter the 2018 governor’s race, wasn’t claiming to be the fundraising frontrunner in terms of dollars through May, but only in the number of donors -- often cited by campaigns as a measure of grassroots support. In terms of dollars raised, Republican Adam Putnam has raised the most overall while former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham raised the most on the Democratic side. Gillum raised about $1.1 million, excluding in-kind contributions: almost $500,000 for his campaign account and $600,000 through his Forward Florida PAC. Gillum has a point that he has more donors. But Gillum’s donor count is exaggerated. We looked at individual contributions to Gillum’s campaign and his Forward Florida PAC. At a glance, Gillum’s point nearly checks out, with a combined total of 6,933 contributions between both lists. The problem: Several people gave multiple times. By removing individuals who donated more than once, we got a smaller number. We found 5,383 unique names on individual contributions and 70 on Florida Forward PAC for a combined total of 5,453 donors. (The total includes a few donors who gave in-kind contributions as well for food and beverages.) We counted nine donors who gave money to both Gillum’s account and the PAC, including actress Jane Fonda and Allison Tant, the former Florida Democratic Party chair. Take out people and entities who gave to both the campaign and committee, and the donor count goes down to 5,444. Other donors gave multiple times in small increments -- for example Marilyn Bailey, a Sanford resident, gave 10 times in amounts ranging from $5 to $20.18. We sent those numbers to spokesman Geoff Burgan and asked how he arrived at "more than 7,000." "Our campaign has 6,933 total contributions from more than 5,300 people across Florida and the country,’ Burgan told PolitiFact in an email. "After further reviewing our in-kind contributions, we realized we slightly misstated the total in our press release." Our ruling Gillum says his campaign has received donations from "more than 7,000 contributors." Gillum has raised more individual donations than leading competitors. But his donor total was wrong by more than 1,500 individuals because he counted some donors more than once. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13638	Says that under the Obama administration, "the debt has nearly doubled."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/aug/09/mike-pence/mike-pence-claims-national-debt-has-nearly-doubled/	Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, Mike Pence, reiterated many of his campaign partner’s promises at a recent town hall in Phoenix. From building a wall along the Southern border to fixing the economy, Pence also attacked Democrats, saying Hillary Clinton in the White House would equal a third term for President Barack Obama. And that wouldn’t be a good thing, he said. "Under this administration, the debt has nearly doubled," Pence said Aug. 2. Obama took office in January 2009 while America continued to reel from the recession. We fact-checked a similar statement in April 2015. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., claimed the debt doubled under George W. Bush and is tripling under President Obama. We rated it Half True -- the debt under Obama has tripled since Bush took office, but other factors affect debt. But, we wondered, as Obama’s presidency comes to a close, where are we now in terms of debt? Important context Pence spokesman Marc Lotter pointed us to the Treasury Department’s Debt to the Penny clock, a real-time look at the nation’s debt that goes back almost two decades. On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the gross federal debt (which includes both public and intragovernmental debt) was $10.63 trillion. As of Aug. 3, 2016, it is $19.4 trillion. So the numbers check out. But experts we spoke with still note that the debt cannot be pinned on just Obama. For one thing, Congress signs off on spending and taxation. And, reining in government spending during the recession would have been a bad idea, economists told us. George Washington University law professor Neil Buchanan noted that the economy was in "free-fall" when Obama took office. In Arizona, the housing market crashed and key sector jobs, such as construction, dried up. "Tax revenues were plummeting, because incomes were falling, while spending had to go up (for unemployment benefits, Medicaid, and so on)," Buchanan said. "Had we tried to balance the budget during that time, it would have accelerated the downturn, and there could have been a depression." Moreover, according to Bucknell University economics professor Gregory Krohn, the Congressional Budget Office projected in January that debt held by the public would increase to 75.6 percent - up from 39.3 percent in 2008. "Debt held by the public, a more meaningful measure, more than doubled from $6.4 trillion to $13.9 trillion over the same period," Krohn said. Our ruling Pence said that under the Obama administration, "the debt has nearly doubled." His numbers are on the mark. But it is important to note that the debt cannot all be blamed on Obama. Congress has a role in approving spending. And, experts told us that money needed to be spent in a free-falling economy. We rate Pence’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74377f97-8d5a-4dd0-b0c1-12c13563759c	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-08-09T17:20:38	2016-08-02	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-01826	"More women are graduating from college now than men."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/18/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-more-women-graduate-college-m/	The Senate race between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, is turning out to be one of the most closely watched and expensive in recent years. Given that his opponent is portraying him as anti-woman, McConnell’s recent comments on women’s issues to a group of Kentucky voters were bound to attract media attention. McConnell was speaking at Fastline Publications, which produces catalogs for farm equipment. When an audience member asked him about "the most important issues facing Kentucky women," McConnell said, "We’ve come a long way" and added that "most of the barriers have been lowered." "I think virtually everything I have mentioned today applies to both genders equally," McConnell said. "We’ve come a long way with pay equity. There are a ton of women CEO’s now running major companies, and more women are graduating from college now than men." He also said he received 50 percent of the women’s vote the last time he was elected, and he cited Xerox as an example of a company with a woman CEO. After the event, McConnell received criticism from some liberal commentators for his comments that workplace sexism and inequality between the sexes was a thing of the past. Some of his claims are too subjective to fact-check. But we decided to look at his claim that "more women are graduating from college now than men." According to a study by the Pew Research Center, women have outpaced men in pursuing postsecondary education in recent years, partly because of a growing acceptance of women in a wider variety of jobs, meaning that "the benefits of a college education grew more for women than men." The Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit organization that produces information for academic and research purposes, published a study that validated McConnell’s comments. "Simply put, young women are now more likely to enroll in, and graduate from, college than young men," Kevin Pollard wrote. The graph below, which was included in Pollard’s analysis, shows the percentage of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 29 with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Throughout the 1970s, the chart shows, men graduated from college at higher rates than women did. However, that trend reversed in the early 1990s, when women began to outpace men. And since then, this pattern for bachelor’s degrees has held steady. In 2012 women earned 1,025,729 bachelor’s degrees, or 57 percent of all degrees conferred that year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal office. Women also earned a majority of master’s degrees and doctoral degrees in the 2011-12 academic year. Women received 60 percent of all master’s degrees, compared with 40 percent for men. In doctoral studies the margin was narrower, with 51 percent of PhDs being awarded to women and 49 percent being given to men. Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell, provided PolitiFact with a wide variety of support for McConnell’s claim, including an op-ed written by President Barack Obama for the 40th anniversary of Title IX, a statute that banned discrimination in educational programs on the basis of sex. "In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men," Obama said in the article. So Obama’s comments square with those made by McConnell last week -- though they draw different conclusions. Obama’s concludes that "there are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make," while McConnell said "most of the barriers have been lowered." Our ruling McConnell said that "more women are graduating college now than men." We found that since the early 1990s, women have earned more postsecondary degrees than men -- and in the 2011-12 academic year, women earned more degrees of all types -- bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral -- than men did. We rate this claim True.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2014-07-18T14:08:44	2014-07-10	['None']

pomt-13440	"I finished" the controversy about where President Barack Obama was born.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/16/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-he-finished-obama-b/	After years of promoting the theory that President Barack Obama was born in a foreign country -- one that has been consistently debunked by fact-checkers -- Donald Trump reversed course on Sept. 16, 2016, and said Obama was born in the United States. "President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period," Trump said while briefly addressing the subject at the end of a campaign event at his newly built hotel in Washington. We’ve separately ruled this a Full Flop. But Trump’s other remarks on the so-called "birther" controversy have inspired fact-checks of their own. Trump prefaced his statement about Obama’s birthplace by saying, "Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean." We rated the first part of that claim that "Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy" False. Here, we’ll fact-check the assertion that Trump "finished it." We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign, but the evening before Trump’s announcement in Washington, Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser with the campaign, sent out a news release saying in part, "In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised." So it appears that the campaign’s argument is that Trump pushed for Obama to release the long form of his Hawaii birth certificate on April 27, 2011, several years after the birther controversy bubbled up. Previously, a shorter version of the document had been available, but skeptics had been calling for the full document to be released. Trump himself had made this case as early as Aug. 22, 2013, when he tweeted, "Why are people upset w/ me over Pres Obama’s birth certificate? I got him to release it, or whatever it was, when nobody else could!" But for Trump’s argument to hold water, we see two conditions that have to be met. First, did Trump "finish" advocating for the birther viewpoint once Obama released the long-form birth certificate? And second, did Obama’s release of the long-form certificate "finish" the idea among American voters that Obama was born outside the United States? In both cases, the answer is no. Trump’s continued birther tweets Slate has produced a comprehensive index to the tweets by Trump -- all made after Obama’s document release in 2011 -- in which the real-estate magnate either openly advocated birtherism or promoted skepticism about the official story of Obama’s birth. The list includes about three dozen examples between November 2011 and November 2014. Here’s a sampling: July 17, 2012: "I wonder what the answer is on @BarackObama's college application to the question: place of birth? Maybe the same as his book cover? Release your records, Mr. President!" July 20, 2012: "With @BarackObama listing himself as "Born in Kenya" in 1999 http://bit.ly/JaHQW0 HI laws allowed him to produce a fake certificate. #SCAM" Aug. 6, 2012: "An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud." Aug. 27, 2012: "Why do the Republicans keep apologizing on the so called "birther" issue? No more apologies--take the offensive!" Sept. 13, 2012: "Wake Up America! See article: "Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake" http://bit.ly/UIfG7B." June 29, 2014: "Always remember, I was the one who got Obama to release his birth certificate, or whatever that was! Hilary couldn't, McCain couldn't." Sept. 6, 2014: "Attention all hackers: You are hacking everything else so please hack Obama's college records (destroyed?) and check ‘place of birth’" Public opinion about Obama’s birthplace The birther controversy never actually ended, either, judging by the polls. For starters, the birth certificate release itself didn't eliminate skepticism within the public about Obama’s birthplace -- not even close. At least two surveys looked at the question shortly before and shortly after Obama’s document release. Gallup asked whether respondents would say Obama was "probably or definitely born in another country" and found that the number dropped from 24 percent before the release in April 2011 to 13 percent after the release in May 2011. And YouGov asked whether "Barack Obama was born in the United States." Before the release, 15 percent of respondent said "false," a number that dropped to 13 percent after the release. Thirteen percent is not a trivial number of people in a nation of more than 300 million people. As time went on, polls by YouGov actually found rising numbers of respondents answering "false" "Barack Obama was born in the United States" -- 17 percent in January 2012 and 20 percent in July 2012. And as recently as September 2015, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found 13 percent answering "another country" when asked, "Where was Barack Obama born, as far as you know?" That poll was taken more than four years after Obama released his long-form birth certificate. Our ruling Trump said of the birther controversy, "I finished it." In no credible sense is this true. Trump didn’t "finish" fanning the flames of birther conspiracies once Obama released his long-form birth certificate in April 2011 -- he kept tweeting about it for at least another three and a half years. And a core group of Americans hasn’t "finished" expressing birther sentiments. As recently as a year ago, various polls have found that 13 percent of Americans supported the viewpoint.

pomt-10131	"I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/09/john-mccain/5000-for-couples-but-half-that-for-every-american/	Candidates often try to place their proposals in the best possible light. But John McCain went a step too far in saying at a debate in Nashville on Oct. 7, 2008, that he wants to give "every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit." It's actually half that: $2,500 for singles and $5,000 for couples. The tax credit is part of McCain's health proposal, which seeks to increase competition for health care by reducing reliance on employer-provided health insurance. Most Americans who have health insurance get it through their employer. Usually, the premiums are split so that the employer pays part and the employee pays part. Strictly speaking, the part that the employer pays is compensation, and workers would owe taxes on it if there wasn't a tax exemption in federal law. The exemption makes employer-provided health insurance more attractive to both workers and employers. McCain's idea is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by tax incentives. So under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer-provided health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit to spend on any health insurance they wish. They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own. Another caveat about McCain's tax credit: You can't get cash for it. To ensure that it goes to health care, the credit is payable directly to insurance companies. Any remainder would go into a special health spending account. We've seen Barack Obama talk about a $1,000 tax cut for working families, when it's actually a $500 per person tax credit. McCain would be accurate if he had said $5,000 per family, but his statement in the debate takes things too far. It's $2,500 for single people. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-07578	"Every taxpayer owes about $130,000 to pay off the national debt."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/29/young-americans-liberty/congress-doing-little-slow-debt-student-group-says/	Congress just doesn’t get it. That’s the message from Young Americans for Liberty, a group of college students that is very worried about the growing federal debt, $14 trillion and counting. Clayton State University has a chapter that is trying to raise awareness about the issue. Its main target is U.S. Rep. David Scott, an Atlanta Democrat whose district includes the Clayton State campus, located in Morrow. Members of the group planned to place a sign on campus Monday announcing the size of the debt. The group offered some interesting statistics in a news release. "Every taxpayer owes about $130,000 to pay off the national debt." Scary thought unless you’re the lucky son of a gun who won Friday’s $319 million Mega Millions lottery jackpot. So is this debt estimate true? Young Americans for Liberty said it got its numbers from a website called www.usdebtclock.org. The website has a page with numbers on federal government data that change by the second. It estimated the debt at close to $14.3 trillion and had the debt per taxpayer at $128,371. It says there are 111,087,453 U.S. taxpayers with taxable income. The people who maintain the website apparently divided the debt total by that 111 million figure to come up with that $128,371 total. We tried to ask them how specifically they came up with that total. The website had no telephone number. We sent them an e-mail and got an automatic response. "Thank you for your comments," the message said. "Although we can't respond to all emails we really appreciate your input and Thank You for your support!" This left us to our own devices to figure this one out. If you divide the debt estimate by their estimate of taxpayers, that equates to about $128,000 for each taxpayer. But is the information the group used to come up with that total correct? According to TreasuryDirect, a federal website, the total public debt is about $14.2 trillion. About $9.6 trillion of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies, and state, local and foreign governments. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. According to the Internal Revenue Service, it will receive an estimated 140 million tax returns this year. The agency received an estimated 144 million returns for 2009. The IRS notes that some filers do not have taxable income because of various credits and deductions. If you divide the $14.2 trillion debt estimate by 140 million taxpayers, that equates to about $100,000 for each taxpayer. But is it best to use the total public debt? Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the federal government typically uses the debt held by the public, currently about $9.6 trillion, when it issues Treasury bonds. If you use that figure, the total per taxpayer is just under $87,000. That sounds better, doesn’t it? So it is wrong to use the $14.2 trillion figure? "You can argue it either way," he said. Peuquet added, "Ultimately, this $14 trillion figure is going to have to be repaid." Economists note that it is good for the government to have some debt, primarily because the global economy "depends on some of that money floating out there," Peuquet said. Economists say the amount of public debt becomes a major concern once it grows to more than 90 percent of America’s gross domestic product. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that could happen in about 10 years, as health care costs rise and an aging population puts more demands on Social Security. The current public debt-to-GDP ratio is 69 percent, according to the CBO. The debt is typically reduced when the U.S. economy improves, Peuquet said. A so-called "Gang of Six," a group of U.S. senators that includes Georgia’s Saxby Chambliss, is meeting regularly to consider long-term solutions -- some suggested by President Barack Obama’s bipartisan committee -- to lower the debt. Young Americans for Liberty used figures from a group that had most of its numbers right. The IRS uses a different standard to calculate the number of taxpayers. We’ll give the students the benefit of the doubt on whether it’s better to use the total debt figure or debt owed by the public. This claim needs some clarification, and under our guidelines, it rates as Mostly True.	None	Young Americans for Liberty	None	None	None	2011-03-29T06:00:00	2011-03-24	['None']

pomt-02417	Says "Bill Clinton and George Bush both say build the Keystone XL."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/05/american-petroleum-institute/do-bill-clinton-and-george-bush-support-keystone-x/	March 7 is the last day the U.S. Department of State will hear public comments on Keystone XL, a proposed pipeline that would carry diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast. With the closing of the 30-day comment period, six years of contentious debate between environmentalists and pipeline supporters is expected to come to a head when President Barack Obama makes a final decision on whether to proceed. In an attempt to sway public opinion, the American Petroleum Institute relaunched an ad campaign backing the pipeline. The 30-second spot, which is airing in the District of Columbia, Montana, New Mexico and North Carolina, claims that in the land of deadlock, the pipeline is one of few projects to win support from both sides of the spectrum. "Washington. It’s gridlock, division, bitter partisanship," the ad says. "But one jobs plan brings both sides together. Bill Clinton and George (W.) Bush both say build the Keystone XL." A ringing endorsement of the Keystone pipeline from 42 and 43? That sounds like something worth looking into. Bush backs it The American Petroleum Institute ad clearly identifies sources backing up their claim for viewers. For Bush, the ad references an article from Bloomberg published in March 2012, in which the former Republican president calls the pipeline "a no-brainer," according to the report. "The clear goal ought to be how to get the private sector to grow," Bush said. "If you say that, then an issue like the Keystone pipeline becomes an easy issue." We weren’t surprised Bush supports the plan. Republicans have been overwhelmingly supportive of the proposal and Bush has ties to the oil industry. Heck, he made the aforementioned remarks during the keynote speech of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers conference. But what about Clinton? Clinton’s backing of Keystone did cause us to raise an eyebrow. The ad points to a Feb. 29, 2012, article from Politico. In it, Clinton calls for Americans to "embrace" the pipeline. We tracked down the original speech. It was given at the 2012 ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit, a conference held by the U.S. Department of Energy. Here’s what Clinton had to say: "One of the most amazing things to me about this Keystone Pipeline deal is that they ever filed that route in the first place since they could've gone around the Nebraska Sandhills and avoided most of the danger, no matter how imagined, to the Ogallala (aquifer) with a different route, which I presume we'll get now, because the extra cost of running it is infinitesimal compared to the revenues that will be generated over a long period of time. "So, I think we should embrace it and develop a stakeholder-driven system of high standards for doing the work modeled on what was done with auto mileage agreement." Clinton’s remarks are somewhat hard to follow. But he seems to say that Americans should "embrace" the Keystone pipeline and the government should work with the oil industry and environmentalists to develop standards for implementing and overseeing the project, similar to how all the stakeholders got together to develop higher standards for gas mileage in new vehicles. That’s how media reports characterized his comments, and Clinton made no attempt to correct them in the two years since. Within a year, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman approved a new route for the pipeline that largely avoided the Nebraska Sandhills, as Clinton predicted. If he was not placated by the route change, Clinton never said so publicly. In fact, we couldn’t find any more public statements by Clinton regarding the Keystone XL pipeline. Several environmental groups we contacted said they had no recollection of Clinton speaking on the issue since 2012. We reached out to Clinton through the Clinton Global Initiative to see if his position had changed or could be affirmed for us. We didn’t hear back. Putting Clinton’s speech in context So we’re left with one public comment made two years ago. But we can deduce a few things based off what he said. First, in his remarks, Clinton was largely endorsing an all-of-the-above energy approach that focused on greener and sustainable methods. And while he expressed support for the Keystone project, he also said that tapping into homegrown natural resources was not a panacea. "There are some hazards to the innovation project, right now," Clinton said. "We have massive new recovery technologies in oil and gas which could lead us down the primrose path of thinking we don't have to keep using less energy and developing clean energy and technologies." But Clinton’s call to "embrace" the pipeline also came as the U.S. State Department was deciding whether to recommend the project’s approval. The State Department, at that time, was headed by his wife. Indeed, not hours after Clinton gave his speech in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was testifying before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where she fielded questions about the State Department’s oversight of the pipeline proposal. In the hearing, Secretary Clinton was even asked about her husband’s comments from earlier that day. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fla., noted, "Even the former President, Bill Clinton, says, ‘Embrace it and we need to move forward with the Keystone XL pipeline.’ " Clinton respond, "He is a very smart man," inciting laughter. She then added, "But unfortunately he is not bound by the laws and regulations and longer of the United States to make decisions that follow a certain procedure. And that is what we have to do." "So is it a mistake for the former president to say, ‘embrace it’?" Mack then asked. "Of course not," Clinton replied. "This is America. People say they embrace it, people say they hate it. Our job is to take a very clear-eyed look at what the facts are." So not only did Bill Clinton come out in favor of the pipeline in 2012, he did so during a public speech hosted by the U.S. Energy Department just hours before his wife, who oversaw the administration’s review of the pipeline, was set to testify in front of a Republican-controlled House committee. For her part, Hillary Clinton has gone back and forth on the pipeline. In 2010 she said she was "inclined" to approve the project. But under her command, the State Department also recommended Obama deny approval of the pipeline in 2012 after congressional Republicans forced a decision from the White House within 60 days. At the time, Clinton said the window was too short to review the environmental impact of the project. Our ruling The American Petroleum Institute ad says, "Bill Clinton and George Bush both say build the Keystone XL" pipeline. While their evidence is two years old, it’s not fabricated. Since voicing support of the pipeline in 2012, Clinton has not publicly weighed in on the controversy. But his backing of the project was not an offhand comment. It came during a publicized energy speech on the same day his wife was testifying before Congress. It seems unlikely he would endorse the proposal on such an occasion if he did not mean it.

pomt-05677	Says "my plan is a property tax cut."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/15/stephen-sweeney/stephen-sweeney-claims-his-tax-cut-proposal-would-/	In radio and TV interviews last week, Senate President Stephen Sweeney said what should come as a relief to most New Jerseyans: he has a plan to cut property taxes. But a closer look at his proposal shows that the potential tax savings are more complicated than the senator made it sound. While Gov. Chris Christie is pushing an across-the-board income tax cut, Sweeney unveiled a plan to provide a 10 percent tax credit for certain households based on their property tax bills. The plan would mean a credit of up to $1,000 for households earning less than $250,000 a year. In a March 8 interview with former New York Gov. David Paterson on WOR-AM, Sweeney (D-Gloucester) claimed: "I put a plan together that cuts property taxes 'cause that is the issue that's most pressing in this state." That same day, Sweeney appeared on NJToday and compared his proposal to Christie’s: "My plan is a property tax cut. His is an income tax cut." However, Sweeney’s proposal would actually lower income taxes, not property taxes, PolitiFact New Jersey found. It’s accurate to say the proposed tax credit would be based on the amount of property taxes paid. For instance, someone earning less than $250,000 a year and paying $8,000 in property taxes, would receive a credit of $800. But here’s why Sweeney’s statement is flawed: that credit would be applied to one’s income taxes. That point is backed up by the description of Sweeney’s plan on a website set up by the Senate Democrats -- www.realreliefnj.net. Under the headline "How Our Plan Works," here’s part of the explanation: "It gives every household with income under $250,000 a new 10 percent property tax credit that can be taken every spring when income taxes are filed," according to the website. "A family that pays $7,500 in property taxes would receive a $750 credit against their income taxes." So, those households would receive a "credit against their income taxes." The property tax bill may be the basis for the credit, but that’s not the bill that will be cut. But David Brunori, a research professor of public policy at The George Washington University in Washington, DC, told us "property tax cut" is a reasonable description. "NJ is proposing to deliver property tax relief through the income tax. Most public finance folks would call this a property tax cut since you have to be paying property taxes to get it," Brunori, who writes a column on state taxation, said in an e-mail. "It is certainly aimed at relieving the property tax burden. So its mostly semantics after that." In response to our findings, Sweeney spokesman Chris Donnelly provided this statement: "What Democrats have proposed is direct relief for middle class New Jersey residents based solely on their property tax burden. What the governor has proposed is an income tax scheme which gives money to millionaires. The numbers and facts we have provided are clear enough: folks making less than $250,000 a year would get up to $1000 off their property tax burden. It is that simple." Our ruling In radio and TV interviews, Sweeney claimed his proposal "cuts property taxes" or represents a "property tax cut." The senator’s proposal would provide a tax credit of up to $1,000 for households earning less than $250,000 a year. The credit would be based on the amount of property taxes paid, but the credit would be "against their income taxes," as the Senate Democrats’ website states. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08146	A National Football League lockout would cost Atlanta $160 million in lost jobs and revenue.	false	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/06/nfl-players-association/nfl-players-claim-gets-sacked-experts/	(Want to discuss this story? Go to our Facebook page.) Imagine Sunday afternoons next fall without the Dirty Birds. The organization that represents the Atlanta Falcons' players and those from the National Football League's 31 other teams recently warned it could happen next year if the players and owners don't reach a labor agreement. And what could the financial impact be to Atlanta? "The conservative estimate is that every team city will lose over $160 million in lost jobs and revenue in the event of a lockout by NFL owners," the players association wrote in a Nov. 22 letter to Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. "As you well know," the letter continued, "this is not what Atlanta area families need in these dire economic times." The association wrote similar letters to Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue and Gov.-elect Nathan Deal. The players are attempting a blitz on NFL owners such as the Falcons' Arthur Blank by lobbying Deal, Perdue and Reed to pressure Blank into working out a new collective bargaining agreement. Since we're always ready for some football, the prospect of no pigskins being tossed around troubled us. The economic impact on Atlanta piqued our interest. Would the economic impact of no Falcons season in 2011 be $160 million? "It's not going to lose that activity," said a skeptical Mark Rosentraub, the Bruce and Joan Bickner Endowed Professor of Sports Management at the University of Michigan. "If you can't spend that money on football, you will spend it on something else." The NFL Players Association arranged a conference call with reporters late last week to explain how it came up with the estimate. An economist hired by the association based its estimate on economic impact studies done about 10 different NFL franchises since 2000. Falcons spokesman Reggie Roberts said the team has not commissioned any economic impact studies. The economist, Jesse David of Edgeworth Economics, concluded that the average economic impact for a city when an NFL game is played is $20 million. David multiplied that by eight, the number of regular-season games each team hosts, and reached his conclusion of $160 million. He told reporters that anywhere from 30 percent to 50 percent of the total economic impact could come from player salaries. Greg Aiello, the NFL's communications director, sent AJC PolitiFact Georgia a list of more than a dozen economic impact studies of NFL franchises done between 1987 and 2004 by researchers, consultants, professors and accountants. The more recent estimates ranged from $144 million from a 2000 study of the Green Bay Packers to $402 million from a 2002 study of the New Orleans Saints. The estimates include money spent by people inside that city's metro area and outside the region. Aiello cautioned that these studies are often debunked by experts. Aiello called the players association's findings "fairy tales." We went in search of the truth in that black hole of research, the Internet. The city of Santa Clara, Calif., hired a company to study the potential economic activity from a proposed football stadium there for the San Francisco 49ers. The researchers generally agreed with the 49ers' findings that the activity could be as much as $85 million a year, but that included $19 million for non-49ers events at the stadium. A study in March found the Minnesota Vikings' playoff victory against the Dallas Cowboys in January was a financial win for the region of about $13 million. Using that estimate for eight regular-season games (we know a playoff game may bring more activity), would equal $104 million. We could find no similar studies for the Atlanta Falcons. In 2006, three professors looked at the economic impact of strikes in professional sports in Florida because it is one of the few states with all four major American sports leagues. They focused on sales-tax data, determining that none of the labor disputes in recent years had a significant reduction in taxable sales. Another group of researchers reached a similar conclusion that work stoppages in sports have little economic impact on a city or region. They made a point similar to Rosentraub's. "Attending a professional sporting event is one of many entertainment options in metropolitan areas," Dennis Coates and Brad R. Humphreys of the University of Maryland-Baltimore County wrote in a 2000 study. "Fans could alternatively go out to dinner and a movie, or bowling, during a sports strike." We asked David about the research that there's little negative economic impact from sports strikes. He conceded that there are a range of assumptions about the idea, but he maintained "football is not substitutable for some other economic activity." Robert Baade disagreed. He was one of the three authors who wrote the 2006 study. Baade, an economics and business professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois, did research several years ago that found little to no economic impact when Los Angeles lost both of its pro football teams, the Raiders and Rams. He also questioned the players association's argument that there could be a major loss in economic impact from stadium workers who may lose their jobs if there is a work stoppage, saying most of those jobs are part-time. "Are you going to support a family on selling parking tickets or beer?" Baade asked us. Baade said a more likely annual economic impact estimate is $16 million, citing his past findings that the Super Bowl brings in one-tenth of the financial impact experts claim. Regarding the likelihood of no NFL action next season, Baade deadpanned, "if you're following a losing team, it might be a relief." We've found an array of research and opinion on this topic, and it is across the spectrum. We wish there were some concrete research by the NFL, but it is apparently wary from past criticism of such studies. The lowest recent estimate of annual economic impact on a city we found was the $85 million for the San Francisco 49ers. Each independent expert we talked to believed there will be little economic impact if there is no NFL action next season, since they believe people will find other ways to spend their money. We rate the NFL Players Association's claim as False.	None	NFL Players Association	None	None	None	2010-12-06T06:00:00	2010-11-22	['None']

pomt-01527	Says Fox News gave Republican senators twice the air time as Democrats during a hearing about the Islamic State.	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/18/media-matters/media-matters-says-fox-gives-gop-senators-twice-mu/	The president’s request to arm some Syrian rebels and conduct an air campaign against the forces of the Islamic State, a group also known as ISIS or ISIL, has found bipartisan support in Congress. But the liberal media analysis group Media Matters says the partisan divide is alive and well on Fox News. At least in terms of minutes of air time. In a blog post Sept. 16, the group charged that Fox News gave Republican senators twice as much time as Democrats during live coverage of the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on U.S. policy in Syria and Iraq. There were only two people giving testimony, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey. Fox News "aired more than 16 minutes of GOP questions, while showing less than eight minutes of Democratic questioning," the Media Matters post said. We decided to check their math, and compare Fox News to MSNBC and CNN, the two other cable news channels that carried the hearing. We used the subscription-based service Critical Mention to review coverage minute by minute on all three networks. Here’s what we found: The Media Matters reporter added up the minutes correctly. Fox News provided 16 minutes of Republican questioning, compared to eight minutes of Democratic questioning. The other networks provided more of the raw feed of the hearing than did Fox News, thus more balance. CNN and MSNBC included the opening statements from the chair Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and the vice-chair Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and questions from more senators from both parties. We counted each senator’s time based on the period when he or she had control of the microphone, not based on how long their lips were moving. The length of their questions had no effect on the tally. We rounded to the closest minute mark so the one-minute differences in the MSNBC and CNN coverage might not reveal very much. CNN had about a 90-second technical glitch that cut out about a minute of Inhofe’s time. Only MSNBC offered continuous coverage, although not from start to finish. The full hearing lasted almost four hours. Both Fox News and CNN pulled away at some point and rejoined the hearing in progress. Fox News rejoined to air questions from South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. CNN cut away twice, rejoining once for questions from Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, and again to carry Graham’s question session. Our ruling Media Matters said that Fox News gave Republican senators twice as much air time as Democratic ones during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. They said Republicans got 16 minutes compared to the Democrats’ eight. That matches our count. We also found that other networks provided more time and more evenly divided time to members of both parties. We rate the claim True.

pomt-07463	Milwaukee is "the most segregated city in America."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/18/jesse-jackson/rev-jesse-jackson-says-milwaukee-most-segregated-c/	The legislative offensive launched by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker against public employee unions has galvanized national debate for months. Perhaps no national figure has engaged the controversy as consistently as the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson and staff from his Chicago-based Rainbow PUSH Coalition have traveled to Madison, Milwaukee and out-state Wisconsin to attend demonstrations and register voters. On April 4, 2011, Jackson appeared on MSNBC-TV’s "The Ed Show" via satellite from Madison, where he was attending a workers rally held on the 43rd anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. In 1968, Jackson was with King, supporting striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tenn., when King was killed. In his interview with host Ed Schultz, Jackson said he supported collective bargaining powers for workers. Then, reiterating that he was in Wisconsin, he called Milwaukee "the most segregated city in America." It was unclear why Jackson linked collective bargaining to segregation, but he repeated his claim about Milwaukee the next day on WMCS-AM (1290), which serves Milwaukee’s African-American community. And he repeated it the following day, in a news release cheering the election of liberal philanthropist Chris Abele to Walker’s former post as Milwaukee County executive. Milwaukee as long been considered one of the nation’s segregated cities. But we wanted to know if Jackson’s claim, that Milwaukee is the most segregated, is true. In repeating his statement to Milwaukee radio host Eric Von, Jackson cited data he said had been released the previous week. A Rainbow PUSH spokeswoman told us Jackson was referring to an article that was posted on the Chicago Tribune website on April 1, 2011. The article was actually text from a story that aired the same day on WITI-TV (Channel 6) in Milwaukee. The TV story mentioned new census data, but it actually relied on an article from Salon.com, a news and entertainment website. Salon reported March 29, 2011, on segregation rankings made four days earlier by William Frey and John DeWitt of the University of Michigan’s Social Science Data Analysis Network, which analyzes census data, and the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal Washington, D.C. think tank. The rankings used 2010 census data and a "dissimilarity index" for 102 metropolitan areas with a population of over 500,000. Let’s pause here to be clear on what part of the Frey-DeWitt study that Jackson used in making his claim. The part of the study Jackson cited measured segregation only between white and black residents. Asians, Hispanics and other minorities are not accounted for. Jackson called Milwaukee the nation’s most segregated city, but the Frey-DeWitt study -- like other studies on the subject -- measured segregation in large metropolitan areas. For metro Milwaukee, that included racially mixed Milwaukee County, plus largely white Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties. While racial segregation doesn’t have a precise meaning, Frey defines it with the dissimilarity index, which uses a scoring system in which zero is "complete integration" -- blacks and whites are distributed equally across neighborhoods; and 100 is "complete segregation" -- blacks and whites live in completely separate neighborhoods. The Milwaukee metropolitan area scored 81.5 in the Frey-DeWitt study. In other words, 81.5 percent of black residents in metro Milwaukee would have to move to other parts of the metro area in order to achieve "complete integration." That score ranked Milwaukee No. 1 on the black-white segregation list. The New York metro area was second at 78 and metro Chicago, which includes the Kenosha area in Wisconsin’s southeastern corner, ranked third at 76.4. So, in using Frey’s definition of segregation, Jackson was correct in saying that Milwaukee ranked as the most segregated -- except the Frey rankings are not for all cities, but rather large metro areas. What we’re testing, however, is not whether Jackson accurately quoted a study, but whether his statement is accurate -- that segregation is highest in Milwaukee. So, let’s examine some other recent segregation rankings. Another March 2011 study of 2010 census data, done by John Logan of Brown University and Brian Stults of Florida State University, also used a dissimilarity index. It found that the Milwaukee metro area tied for first with Detroit in black-white segregation. Another Frey study using the dissimilarity index, done in December 2010 with 2005-2009 census data, put metro Milwaukee No. 1 in black-white segregation rankings. So, in three studies from December 2010 through March 2011, Milwaukee ranked first in black-white segregation twice and tied for first once. The dissimilarity index -- sometimes called the segregation index -- is also used by Harvard University’s DiversityData project, the Mumford Center at State University of New York-Albany and other universities. It is the most common measure of racial segregation, said Frey, although he acknowledged it has its limitations and its critics. Two critics, John Pawasarat and Lois Quinn, happen to be senior scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Pawasarat and Quinn first took aim at the dissimilarity index in a 2003 research paper, published shortly after the Milwaukee metro area was ranked the third most segregated in the United States. They acknowledged that researchers have repeatedly used the dissimilarity index since it was popularized by two University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers in 1965. The Pawasarat-Quinn paper argued that the index "seeks an even distribution of the black population in the metro area as the ideal condition." They wrote: "For example, if the black population in a metro area makes up 10 percent of the combined black and white populations, the goal of the segregation index would be to have each census tract with a 90 percent white and 10 percent black population out of the combined black-white total. Under the one-way-movement approach, if a census tract has 1,000 black residents and 18 white residents, all but 2 of the black residents would be expected to move out of the tract so that the tract could be 90 percent white." Pawasarat and Quinn proposed in their paper an alternative measure of segregation, analyzing city blocks rather than metro areas. They said Milwaukee ranked 43rd with that measure. The pair reiterated their criticisms of the widely used dissimilarity index to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Pawasarat said that even though the index is "the Bible now," it would view an area as integrated if it is 80 percent white and 20 percent black, but as segregated if the percentages are in reverse. Quinn said that "far more interesting" are attempts, such as a 2008 study made by DePaul University in Chicago, to measure ethnic, income and age diversity by neighborhood. Jackson’s claim, however, was strictly about white-black racial segregation. Let’s sum up the evidence. Jackson claimed Milwaukee is the nation’s most segregated city. He didn’t define what he meant by segregated, but he referred to a study that measured segregation among whites and blacks. While some may disagree with the measure used in the study, the approach has been recognized as a standard for decades. By that measure Milwaukee ranked No. 1 in white-black segregation. Jackson’s claim was accurate, although it needed some clarification, particularly in that the segregation measure is for the metropolitan area, not just the city. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07378	In a lawsuit between private citizens, a Florida judge "announced the decision was going to be based on Islamic Law."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/may/04/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-says-florida-judge-using-islamic-law-c/	Adam Hasner may have announced he is officially running for U.S. Senate on April 26, 2011, but the former state House Republican leader had already been campaigning weeks before his announcement. On March 20, Hasner spoke before members of South Florida 9-12, an offshoot of conservative talk show host Glenn Beck's 9-12 Movement, which aims to unite "communities back to the place we were on 9/12/2001," according to the group's website. The South Florida chapter was hosting a two-year anniversary celebration in Palm Beach County and in speaking to the group, Hasner touched upon what he called the "warped sense of foreign policy" held by President Barack Obama's administration. "We cannot allow political correctness or multiculturalism or appeasement (to) cripple our defenses at home or abroad," Hasner said. "Because these threats don't only exist on foreign soil, but these are threats from those who seek to destroy us from within." Earlier, Hasner had told the group that: "The enemy has a name, and that name is Sharia-compliant Islam." (For a video of the speech, click here.) Sharia law is the code of conduct for Muslims, based on elements of the Qur'an , teachings from the Prophet Mohammad, and centuries-old judges' rulings from Islam, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. "A judge within the state of Florida ... in judging in the litigation between private citizens in a Florida state court, announced the decision was going to be based on Islamic Law," Hasner said. "That is not supporting the U.S. Constitution, or the Constitution of the state of Florida. We need to make sure that these threats do not continue to grow and do not continue to infiltrate our state and our government." We wondered if Hasner was right, has a Florida judge announced that his decision was going to be based on Islamic Law? We found a March 22, 2011, article by the St. Petersburg Times headlined "Judge Orders Use of 'Sharia' in Suit." We will explain the case first before we get into Hasner's comment. The case In November 2010, Hillsborough Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Nielsen took up a lawsuit filed against the Islamic Education Center of Tampa by former trustees. In dispute were issues related to the corporate governance of the IEC, a learning and community center for Muslims in the Tampa Bay area. In 2002, the center changed its bylaws to eliminate a provision allowing trustees to serve for life, according to a St. Petersburg Times article. The deposed trustees sued individual mosque leaders in 2008, arguing that they were unfairly removed. In January 2009, Ghulam Hurr Shabbiri, an Islamic scholar from Houston, came to speak at the IEC at the center’s invitation. In speaking to some of those involved in the lawsuit, the scholar (dubbed an A’lim in Islamic culture) agreed to arbitrate the dispute matter so long as both sides agreed to drop the lawsuit and acknowledge his decision as binding. On Dec. 28, 2009, the A’lim ruled that the trustees were removed improperly, according to the St. Petersburg Times. But the center countered that his ruling was not binding because only one of the four new trustees signed the agreement to enter into arbitration. To sort out the mess, enter Nielsen, who oversees complex business litigation for the 13th Circuit Court of Florida in Hillsborough County. At stake in this leadership tussle is who controls $2.2 million the center received from the state, after the state used some of the center’s land for a road project. On March 3, 2011, Nielsen, issued an order in the case in which he wrote: "The case will proceed under Ecclesiastical Islamic Law." He wrote: "Under Ecclesiastical Islamic Law, pursuant to the Qur’an brothers should try to resolve a dispute amongst themselves. When the brothers are unable to do so, they can agree to present the dispute to the greater community of brothers within the mosque or the Muslim community for resolution. If that is not done or does not result in a resolution of the dispute, the dispute is to be presented to an Islamic judge for determination, and that is or can be an A’lim." Nielsen went on to explain that "the remainder of the hearing will be to determine whether Islamic dispute resolution procedures have been followed in this matter." Nielsen, a registered Republican appointed to the bench in 2000 by Gov. Jeb Bush and subsequently elected in 2003, soon found himself facing a firestorm of criticism from conservative bloggers and media outlets. On March 22, 2011, he issued a five-page opinion on the case outlining his reasons for basing his decision on Islamic Law. He noted that the Islamic Education Center is "governed by a 'constitution' drafted by an Islamic A’lim. Part of the evidence considered by the court was a document entitled 'Organizational Structure of the Islamic Education Center of Tampa as described in its constitution which was adopted on September 25, 1993' … This document guides the operation of the IEC." Nielsen wrote: "Decisional case law both in Florida and the United States Supreme Court tells us that ecclesiastical law controls certain relations between members of a religious organization, whether a church, synagogue, temple or mosque." The judge went on to cite a 1992 Florida District Court of Appeals ruling (Franzen v. Poulos) that said trial courts can't intervene in internal church disputes -- or synagogue, temple or mosque. He explained that the DCA ruling said the First (freedom of religion) and 14th Amendments (due process and equal protection) allow religious organizations to set their own rules and regulations, including "creating tribunals to adjudicate disputes." After Nielsen’s March 3 ruling, the defendant in the case, the Islamic Center of Tampa, petitioned the Florida District Court of Appeal to intervene. The center contends that Nielsen should base his decision on state law, not religious doctrine, said their attorney Paul Thanasides. For now, the case remains stalled until the DCA reaches its decision, Thanasides said. Foreign law in U.S. courts We were curious how often judges use something other than state law in ruling in American courts, so we consulted with two international law experts. "It's much more common than you would think," said Markus Wagner, a professor of international law at the University of Miami's School of Law. Wagner said that in deciding what laws to base his decisions on, a judge will look at the provisions agreed to between the two parties when they entered their contract. "If we both sign a contract agreeing to be governed by German law, then Florida courts will interpret German law," Wagner said. Wagner said the only time a judge will not consider upholding a decision based on foreign law is if it "contravenes public policy." "There are certain fundamental principles that every country holds dear," Wagner said. For example, "If the punishment included bodily injury, that's not our public policy. If certain rules say you may no longer speak your mind, that would go against the First Amendment rights ... Those penalties would not be enforced." While the use of Sharia laws in the courtroom seems to have captured the most interest from the media and bloggers, Wagner said judges can make rulings based on religious laws. But again, only if the parties involved entered into an agreement under those religious laws from the beginning. "It happens all the time, it's just that no one writes about it," Wagner said. "We could use Jewish law, Canaanite law, so long as it doesn't contravene public policy." We also checked with Ed Mullins, chairman of the international law section of the Florida Bar, to gauge how common it is for a judge to use foreign law in a Florida court. "This is very common and uncontroversial," Mullins said. "It's something lawyers are familiar with, but the lay person may not realize that this is very common." Our ruling So back to the Hasner’s statement: In a lawsuit between private citizens, a Florida judge "announced the decision was going to be based on Islamic Law." The current case is still being played out in Hillsborough County District Court, and Judge Nielsen’s own written opinions show that Hasner is correct about the judge's reliance on Islamic Law in the case. However, the judge's point is that it's not simply a dispute between two private parties. The issue involves religious law, and the legal experts support Nielsen turning to that body of law to resolve it. Whether Nielsen's decision will stand up after review by Florida District Court of Appeal is still unknown. For now, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-07394	Says that while his plan would narrow the time for early voting, "it still will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/may/02/jon-husted/jon-husted-says-under-his-plan-ohio-would-be-among/	Secretary of State Jon Husted says he’s on a quest to balance "access and accuracy" when it comes to a package of election reforms he is hoping to get Ohio lawmakers to enact. But that hasn’t stopped critics of the Republican’s plan from pointing out that Husted’s proposal to change Ohio’s election laws would narrow the time during which voters can cast ballots through in-person early voting as well as reduce the days in which to request absentee ballots. Under Husted’s proposal, the voting window would allow 21 days to request absentee ballots and 16 days for in-person early voting -- down from 33 days for absentee voting and 35 days for in-person voting under Ohio’s current voting law. Hoping to blunt criticism, including the notion that his plan goes too far in restricting access to voters, Husted appeared April 7 at an event held by the Ohio League of Women Voters. During his remarks, Husted touched on the issue of the shrinking window for early voting and absentee ballot requests contained in his plan. Husted said under his plan "it still will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America," according to a report from Gongwer News Service, a Statehouse-based paid information service. Given the criticism of Husted’s plan, Politifact Ohio decided to check into Husted’s statement. There are two forms of early voting in Ohio: in-person early voting and absentee ballot voting. For information on in-person early voting and absentee voting across all 50 states, we turned to the National Association of Secretary of States. Only 33 states plus the District of Columbia offer in-person early voting. Further research revealed that two of those states — Georgia and North Dakota — only do so on a county-by-county basis so we threw those two states out for the purposes of this analysis. Among the 31 remaining states (and the District of Columbia), Ohio ranks either sixth or seventh for time available to vote in-person, depending on how you rank Wisconsin’s 30-day period compared to Ohio’s. That’s because while Ohio’s early voting window is 35 days long, it excludes certain weekend days so really there are only between 27 and 31 days when early voting can actually occur. And, it can vary from county to county, depending on their policies concerning weekend hours. Hamilton County, for example, was open for in-person early voting all five Saturdays in October 2010 while Pike County allowed it only on the last Saturday in October thus the range of four days across Ohio counties. Husted’s proposal would open up a 16-day in person voting window, however, his proposal has specific guidelines for all counties to follow regarding weekend hours. His plan would allow in-person voting locations be open only one Saturday. They would be closed on all Sundays and in-person voting would halt the Friday before Election Day. That means there would be 11 possible days for early voting under Husted’s plan. Under Husted’s proposal, Ohio would drop to have the 21st biggest window for in-person voting among the 31 early voting states plus the District of Columbia, according to the NASS data. Put another way, only 11 states that allow early voting statewide would have shorter periods than Ohio to vote early in-person. Husted’s communications director, Maggie Ostrowski, said that Ohio’s top elections officer was trying to make the point that even with a condensed window Ohio "will provide more opportunities than many other states." In large part that’s because Ohio has a "no-fault" law — a provision in Ohio law which allows voters to request an absentee ballot without having to cite any reason. States with longer windows may have fewer voters able to take advantage of it if they don’t have a "no-fault" policy in place, she said. "Longer time frame is one way to look at it, but we have more opportunities for more people," Ostrowski said. "They may have longer windows, but you have to have an excuse to vote. They aren’t no-fault. I don’t think it’s fair to compare Ohio to states that don’t have no-fault voting." While it may be a fair point about comparing no-fault voting states with those without easy access to absentee ballots, we return to Husted’s words which were that Ohio would still have "one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America." His statement doesn’t offer any qualifier about no-fault voting, and uses the phrase "time frame" which clearly means span of days. Ostrowski also noted that many states are changing their early voting period, and said it’s not a totally fair to compare what Ohio would look like in the future to what other states look like today. We checked with the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) and there are 16 states actively considering adding or changing their in-person early voting periods, according to a legislation tracker on the NCSL website. And some state legislatures have as many as 10 competing bills pending, making it impossible to determine where Ohio would stack up relative to other states in the future. So while it’s possible that Ohio could move a great deal up or down the scale depending on what happens in more than a dozen other states regarding in-person early voting, Husted’s remarks on April 7 weren’t made in the context of what could possibly happen in other states in the future and where Ohio could rank in the future. Next we looked at how the time frame for Ohio’s absentee voting would stack up against other states if his plan became law. Because NASS doesn’t track when the absentee ballot request window begins in all 50 states, we turned to information collected by a non-partisan academic research center at Reed College known as the Early Voting Information Center. Three states -- Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Utah are toss outs, as as they appear to have no starting points in their windows for requesting absentee ballots. Of the remaining 47 states and the District of Columbia, Ohio’s current absentee ballot window of 33 days would rank roughly in the middle, 26th among the eligible states, according to the Early Voting Information Center. If Husted’s plan were adopted, the absentee ballot request window would shrink to 21 days, which would make Ohio 39th among the eligible states. That means there would be only be eight states with a shorter time frame for absentee ballot requests if Husted’s plan became law—excluding the trio of toss-out states. So how does Husted fare on the Truth-O-Meter. He said if his plan were put in place, the voting window "will be one of the most aggressive early voting time frames in America." But Husted isn’t even close. Ohio would rank 21st among 34 states that offer early in-person voting and 39th among 47 states that offer absentee voting. His assertion is so wrong, it’s ridiculous. And as the top elections officer in the state of Ohio, he has a responsibility to get it right. For that kind of statement, PolitiFact Ohio "aggressively" strikes a match to his well-tailored trousers. We rate Husted’s claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-13421	"We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/sep/21/donald-trump/trump-us-spends-more-almost-any-other-major-countr/	While Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was campaigning recently in Cleveland -- not for the first time, and surely not the last down the election’s home stretch -- he made a stop at a charter school. Public schools, he said, are wasting taxpayers’ money. "Let’s run through the numbers. At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion dollars on K-12 education each year," Trump said on Sept. 8, 2016. "That’s an average of about $12,296 dollars for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools. The federal government pays for about 10 percent of the K-12 costs. The other roughly $560 billion dollars spent on K -12 education comes from the states themselves. We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. And we’re doing very poorly in terms of A-list." Back in January, Trump made a similar statement about U.S. education spending, saying we were "No. 1 per-pupil by a factor of four." PolitiFact rated the statement Mostly False because it is exaggerated. This new claim is a bit more tempered. Does the United States spend more per student than other major countries? "The question is, how do you define ‘major?’" said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom. He is a proponent of cutting federal involvement in K-12 education. McCluskey relies on data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a consortium of 34 member countries that share internationally comparable statistical, economic and social data. Their education statistics from 2012 were the most up-to-date available at the time of Trump’s statement. According to the OECD, Switzerland spends the most per student at $15,500 per student, followed by Norway, and then the United States. Switzerland ranks first on the Global Competitiveness Index, which ranks economic strength. Norway is a not-too-shabby 11th place. The United States is third. The United States’ per-student expenditure at the elementary/secondary level was 31 percent higher than the OECD’s average of $9,000. "It certainly is the case that we spend more than almost any country except Norway and Switzerland," McCluskey said. "Very few countries outspend us in terms of absolute numbers. The United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, they all spend less than we do. I suppose you could say they’re all major." Trump’s financial figures -- $620 billion on K-12 education nationally, $12,296 per student, on average -- match the totals reported by the National Center on Education Statistics. A conclusion from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, a test administered to 15-year-old students in 65 countries, called out the United States for high spending and underperforming. "While the U.S. spends more per student than most countries, this does not translate into better performance," it read. American students’ scores on the test were mediocre. In math, American 15-year-olds ranked No. 26 out of the 34 participating countries. That concurs with Trump’s assessment that "we’re doing very poorly," education-wise. "For a country that spends as much as we do, you’d think we’d have better outcomes," McCluskey said. Our ruling Trump said that in the United States spends "more per student than almost any other major country in the world." Trump’s assertion that U.S. taxpayers don’t get enough bang for their relative buck, when our students’ test scores are ranked worldwide, checks out. The most recent numbers put the United States at third for government spending on education, behind Switzerland and Norway. We rate Trump’s claim True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/93229a59-9bef-456f-937a-ddedc1dfca1e	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-21T10:18:40	2016-09-08	['None']
pomt-15206	"One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/12/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-social-security-imperiled-drama/	During the Aug. 6 Republican debate, Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie engaged in one of the calmer exchanges of the evening, discussing how best to reform Social Security and Medicare. Christie laid out his position first: raising the retirement age and cutting benefits for those who maintained a steady stream of high income into their old age. Huckabee countered with his own vision of a "fair tax" on consumption, which, he memorably claimed, would apply to everyone, "including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now." As part of his follow-up, Huckabee said, "One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and capital gains." We decided to check whether the funding stream for Social Security is in danger because the number of people receiving wages is declining dramatically. Sources of funding for Social Security While payroll taxes comprise the bulk of the program’s income -- making up about $750 billion in revenue in 2014 -- Huckabee ignores two other sources of revenue that provided support for Social Security. One is that wealthier beneficiaries pay taxes on their Social Security income. For 2014, the revenue collected this way came out to $29.7 billion. Another method of funding for Social Security comes from interest earnings on investments on the $2.8 trillion worth of reserves in Social Security. This amounted to $98.2 billion in 2014. More significantly, has there been a "dramatic" decline in wage-earners? It’s unclear exactly what kind of timeline Huckabee was using when he referred to the "dramatically declining" number of people getting wages, and Huckabee’s campaign did not respond to us. But going by the raw numbers, at least, there’s been no decline in the ranks of wage-earners at all. The total civilian labor force has been steadily increasing since 1948, the first year the Bureau of Labor Statistics started counting it, with a brief stagnation at the height of the recent recession. The labor force participation rate — which measures people who are working age and either employed or looking for a job — has fallen since the Great Recession, partly due to economic trends but also due to the aging of the Baby Boom generation. More useful for the purposes of Huckabee’s claim is a look at the total number of people paying into Social Security. In 2013, the number of wage and salary contributors to Social Security (a different category from those who are self-employed, though their earnings are also taxed for Social Security) was virtually the same as in 2007, and one expert predicted that it had probably continued to go up in 2014 and 2015. So the total number of people in the labor force and paying into Social Security is about the same as it was before the recession, not a dramatic decline. However, Jagadeesh Gokhale of Wharton School’s Public Policy Initiative said Huckabee would have been more accurate if he had phrased his claim more carefully. The number of wage-earners is indeed decreasing in relation to the number of Social Security beneficiaries. This is happening due to the increase of Baby Boomer recipients. When a Boomer retires, it’s a double whammy -- the retirement shrinks the number of wage earners while increasing the number of beneficiaries. So Huckabee has reason to be concerned about the number of wage-earners supporting Social Security. It’s just that he didn’t correctly describe the problem. What’s the impact of earnings from capital gains and dividends? Huckabee also suggests another reason why insufficient money is being funneled into Social Security: that the richest people are accumulating a significant portion of their wealth from capital gains and dividends, profits that aren’t taxed for the benefit of Social Security. We wanted to see how well this theory held up. One study that we found on this issue came from the Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that analyzes tax policy. The center looked at the composition of income reported on tax returns in 2012 and found that the highest-income earners make up a disproportionate share of non-wage earnings, said Roberton Williams, who co-authored the study. The study found that for those with an adjusted gross income above $5 million, capital gains made up nearly half their income, with dividends and interest accounting for another 14 percent. According to a calculation we did with the same data set — 2012 income statistics from the IRS — capital gains and dividends make up an even larger percentage of income for those earning more than $10 million. For those, capital gains, interest and dividends make up 62.7 percent of their adjusted gross income, while salaries and wages only account for 16.1 percent. (Business income and retirement funds round out the rest.) So there’s something to what Huckabee says on this point. But it’s important to keep it in context. There were only about 17,000 Americans making more than $10 million in 2012; combined, their adjusted gross income totaled about $546 billion, or just 6 percent of the country’s total pool of income. You have to adjust the cut-off point all the way down to $100,000 before you can include half of the income in the United States for 2012. Cumulatively, that group earned 56.5 percent of the nation’s income. And the further you extend the pay scale downward, the smaller the role capital gains and dividends play. For those earning $100,000 and up, non-wage income only accounts for 17 percent. Salaries and wages make up 59 percent. It’s also important to remember that wage and salary earnings are only taxed by Social Security up to $118,500. Our ruling Huckabee said that "one of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically." Several aspects of this claim are problematic, starting with the inaccuracy that only wages support Social Security. In addition, Baby Boomer retirements are shifting the ratio of recipients to workers in the wrong direction, but it’s not as simple as there being a dramatic decline in the number of people who get their income from wages. In fact, Huckabee overstates the impact of non-wage income on Social Security’s fiscal health; the shift from wage income to non-wage income is happening among the richest Americans, but this group still accounts for a fraction of all income earned in the country. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2015-08-12T16:39:58	2015-08-06	['None']
pomt-10135	John McCain "is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/08/barack-obama/high-earners-get-a-break-under-mccains-plan/	In a debate in Nashville on Oct. 7, 2008, Barack Obama and John McCain tussled over tax policy. Obama, responding to a question about fiscal responsibility, said the federal debt needs to be reduced in a way that shares the burden fairly. "Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, that's not sharing a burden." To come up with that number, the Obama campaign cites an average CEO salary of $12.8-million and a tax savings of 5.5 percent for the top earners during the year 2012 under a McCain administration. That comes to about $705,000. The math is accurate, but the numbers require a small amount of explanation. The $12.8-million comes from a Forbes magazine study of the average CEO compensation in 2007 for the 500 largest companies. Technically speaking, this would not be the Fortune 500, a listing compiled by Fortune magazine. An extremely minor point, but we note it to give Forbes its due for compiling the study. The 5.5 percent tax savings comes from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which estimated tax impact for income brackets under the McCain plan. They created an analysis that draws on the candidates' campaign stump speeches, and found that according to those proposals, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would get a 5.5 percent decrease in their tax rates in 2012 under McCain's plan. That comes to $700,000. But the center also did an analysis based on information from the candidates' economic advisers, and those policies are slightly more conservative than what the candidates say in their stump speeches. For example, the candidates will talk about a proposal as if it will begin immediately, when the advisers say it will actually be phased in. Using the more conservative analysis, CEOs would receive a tax rate decrease of 2.1 percent, or about $270,000. That's still a big number, but not quite as big as $700,000. It's not surprising that candidates select the numbers most advantageous to their argument, but it's worth noting that there is a different way to look at this calculation that is also valid. Still, Obama is using credible numbers from independent sources to make his point. It does seem that high earners do better under John McCain's plan. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-12566	Says Ohio Gov. John Kasich said, "If a woman is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed, how can we entrust the abortion decision to her?"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/13/blog-posting/fake-news-story-falsely-quotes-kasich-saying-some-/	A fake news story that made Ohio Gov. John Kasich appear to degrade women while discussing abortion actually is a bogus story first posted on an often-cited parody website. The headline on a March 28, 2017, post on WalkWithHer.com read, "Kasich: ‘If a woman is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed, how can we entrust the abortion decision to her?’" The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear fake news from users’ news feeds. Kasich allegedly made the remarks after vetoing the so-called "heartbeat bill," a bill that would have outlawed abortion in Ohio once a fetal heartbeat could be detected. At the same time, he signed a bill that made abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy illegal, unless the mother’s life was in danger. The post, which is fake, said Kasich defended his actions by saying women weren’t as strong as they were in "the old times." They made poor decisions for themselves, including abortions, so Kasich had to take action, the article said. "If a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they’re supposed to be closed, if she doesn’t have the foresight to make sure she doesn’t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion," the post quoted Kasich. While Kasich did take those actions on both of those bills on Dec. 13, 2016, the quote attributed him is made up entirely, as is the rest of the story. It’s another example of a story taken from Newslo.com, which first ran the parody post on Dec. 15. Newslo.com is the umbrella site for a family of online parody outlets, and refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." Newslo.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, at an address in Greece. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know. We attempted to contact WalkWithHer.com through an email address with a Russian domain code, but didn’t receive a reply. The site is privately registered, with no other address available. WalkWithHer.com doesn’t link to the Newslo.com story, although it does note the site as their source. WalkWithHer.com’s post doesn’t indicate the story is made up. But WalkWithHer.com does have a feature we haven’t often seen on fake news sites: A link to information on how to make a Digital Millennium Copyright Act removal request. Readers are invited to send the site a written claim that copyrighted material from the Internet is being improperly reproduced. The link gives an address in the country of Georgia.

pomt-07179	Says Panasonic stayed in New Jersey because of the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant (BRRAG) program.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/10/kim-guadagno/lt-gov-kim-guadagno-says-business-retention-and-re/	The Panasonic Corporation of North America recently threatened to break off its relationship with New Jersey and leave the Garden State. New Jersey, not willing to end the relationship, offered up tax credits to coax Panasonic to stay. The offer worked. Instead of moving its North American headquarters to Atlanta, Brooklyn, California or Chicago, Panasonic is relocating to Newark from Secaucus -- a move that will net the company up to $102.4 million in tax breaks through the Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit program. Did that grant ultimately sway Panasonic? Not according to a recent radio interview with Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. On WNYC, Guadagno touted the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant, or BRRAG, program as the initiative that kept Panasonic in New Jersey. Near the beginning of a more than 20-minute interview, WNYC host Brian Lehrer asked Guadagno specifically about the BRRAG program, which was revised in January to increase the amount of tax credits companies can receive. "I read that, as we go down some of your initiatives, that one of your programs is to beef up the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant program so that it's $2,250 annually for six years for every job retained in New Jersey, compared to $1,500 for just one year in the past. Do I have the numbers right and is that an important change?" Lehrer asked. Guadagno said "it’s a crucial change" and confirmed the numbers. "It's a very lucrative program. We're winning that game based on the program," she said. "For example, I think you've probably read, Panasonic is staying in New Jersey based on that program and some other incentives." Guadagno then talked about other companies that are choosing to stay in New Jersey. Lehrer shifted the conversation back to Panasonic. "I know Mayor (Cory) Booker called that a game-changer for the City of Newark the other day. But on the retention, how much do you think those dollar figures matter? Because some people question whether a per job ... payment program just makes businesses that don't plan to leave threaten to leave and we've seen in other states that they're not binding anyway. So then some businesses abolish some jobs in a few months or even a few years and then they get paid for pretending to retain others. I'm sure you've seen those kind of things go on. So how do you cost it out in a way you know you are not going to get scammed?" Guadagno answered: "Well, there's a couple of issues there. First of all, let's stick with Panasonic for just a minute. Panasonic is a multi-national company who was leaving New Jersey, certified in their records that they were out the door ... It's not a surprise that they could go anywhere in the world. So we went to them and said, ‘Stay in New Jersey; use these incentive programs.’ So, we were able to keep Panasonic solely because of the existence of this incentive program." Really? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check, and found Guadagno was wrong to brag about BRRAG. "We did not apply for that grant," said Peter Fannon, vice president of technology policy at Panasonic. But, he said, "with the help of the transit credit we were able to stay in New Jersey." Panasonic applied for a $102.4 million Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit. If the company doesn’t create an additional 200 jobs at the Newark site during the next 10 years, it will qualify for 80 percent of the tax credit, or $81.9 million, according to a state Economic Development Authority memo. The EDA, which administers tax credit programs, approved Panasonic’s application on Feb. 16. Laura Jones, spokeswoman for the state agency, said companies that receive Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits aren’t eligible to get BRRAGs. "You can’t get both a hub and a BRRAG," she said. PolitiFact New Jersey went back to Guadagno’s staff with the conflicting information. The lieutenant governor’s spokesman, Fred Snowflack, said Guadagno wasn’t trying to deliberately mislead listeners during the radio interview. "You can understand the overall point that she was trying to make: that it was from incentives from the state that kept Panasonic in New Jersey," he said. Let’s review. Guadagno claimed BRRAG helped Panasonic stay in New Jersey. Panasonic said BRRAG wasn’t a factor in the company’s decision and the state EDA confirmed Panasonic is not eligible for any tax credits through that program. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10558	Barack Obama said "he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace (Iranian President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/12/george-w-bush/bush-gets-obama-wrong-on-foreign-policy/	In an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, President Bush was asked what he thought of Sen. Barack Obama. The president used the question to take a jab at some of Obama's foreign policy positions that are at odds with those of the Bush administration. Here's the full exchange: Wallace: "Do you think there's a rush to judgment about Barack Obama? Do you think voters know enough about him?" Bush: "I certainly don't know what he believes in. The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace Ahmadinejad, which — I think I commented that in a press conference when I was asked about it." Wallace: "I hope not. But you don't think that we know enough about him or what he stands for?" Bush: "It doesn't seem like it to me, but in campaigns there's plenty of time for candidates to get defined. He is not yet his party's nominee." Wallace: "So why do you think he's gotten this far if people don't know what he stands for?" Bush: "You're the pundit. I'm just a simple president." We find that the president is distorting Obama's position. On Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major policy speech on fighting global terrorism at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. He spoke about the problem of terrorists at large within Pakistan. He said he would continue to provide military aid to Pakistan as long as the authorities there work to close terrorist training camps and prevent the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan. Then Obama added: "I understand that President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will." The speech received significant press coverage. At that time, Republican candidate John McCain criticized Obama for having "a simplistic view of a very complex situation." McCain advocated the use of covert action "before we declare that we're going to bomb the daylights out of them." We won't take sides here on the advisability of Obama's foreign policy, but it seems some distance from Bush's synopsis that Obama would "attack Pakistan." It seems clear that Obama does not advocate attacking the country itself, but rather wants to target terrorists within the country whether he has the permission of the Pakistani government or not. The second part of Bush's statement concerns Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. We couldn't find any statements from Obama praising the Iranian leader. We suspect Bush is remembering a point that Sen. Hillary Clinton attacked Obama on last year. During the CNN/YouTube debate on July 23, 2007, in South Carolina, the Democratic candidates were asked whether, if elected, they would meet "separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?" Obama said he would. Clinton said she would not, because she didn't want such meetings to be used for propaganda purposes. She later attacked Obama's answer as "irresponsible and frankly naive." Obama, however, has stood by his position, saying it represents a dramatic turn away from the Bush administration's minimal diplomatic efforts. "As president of the United States, my job is to look out for the national security interests of this country. Iran, in particular because of the bad decision this administration has made by invading Iraq, is a major player in the Middle East," Obama said to reporters in September 2007. "If it is in the United States' interest to make certain that we can stabilize the situation and avoid further military confrontation and curb state-sponsored terrorism they've been involved with, that's something we should be willing to do." It's clear that Obama wanted to meet with Ahmadinejad as part of an aggressive effort to engage opponents, not to praise him or "embrace" him. Obama called some of Ahmadinejad's comments about Israel and the Holocaust "hateful lies." George W. Bush may be president, but he's not a stranger to the bare-knuckled world of politics. In this case, he's taking significant liberties with the position of a candidate who could be his party's opponent for the presidency come fall. Taken individually, Bush's characterization of Obama's remark on Pakistan and his remark on Iran are each inaccurate. Taken together, Bush's statements summarize Obama's foreign policy position — that he would attack an important ally and "embrace" an enemy — in a way that just isn't accurate.

pomt-15175	Under Scott Walker, "the Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/24/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-under-scott-walker-middle-class/	Joining a chorus of criticism of Scott Walker's record on jobs, liberal talk show host Rachel Maddow made a striking claim about the middle class. "Under his leadership as governor, Wisconsin has had a really bad time of it when it comes to jobs and the economy," Maddow said on her MSNBC program on July 13, 2015, the day Walker announced his run for the Republican presidential nomination. She added: "The Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country." Maddow cited a respected source to back her claim. But it made a comparison back to 2000 -- a decade before Walker was elected governor. So we generated data that measures the middle class -- in Wisconsin and nationally -- during Walker's time in office. Maddow’s evidence As Maddow made her claim, a graphic on the screen showed a Washington Post article referencing a March 2015 report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a widely respected nonpartisan research organization. Maddow's staff told us the report was the source for her claim. Pew defined middle class as households earning between 67 percent and 200 percent of each state's median income. Its report found that in all 50 states, the percentage of middle-class households was lower in 2013 than it was in 2000. For Wisconsin, the middle class covered income ranging from $34,500 to $103,000 in 2013. Pew found that 48.9 percent of Wisconsin households were middle class in 2013, down from 54.6 percent in 2000 (the 2000 income was adjusted for inflation.) Wisconsin’s drop was the largest of any state. But as we noted, Pew's starting point was 2000. And Walker didn’t become governor until January 2011. That means we don’t know from the Pew report how much of the shrinking of Wisconsin’s middle class occurred under Walker, versus any of the three previous governors dating back to 2000. That would include two Republicans (Scott McCallum and Tommy Thompson), as well as Democrat Jim Doyle, who served for eight years before being succeeded by Walker. Indeed, there's an indication that Wisconsin's shrinking middle class has been in the making for more than a few years. Trend years in the making A blog post on the Pew findings by the Wisconsin Budget Project, a program of the left-leaning Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, and has studied income inequality in the state, said: "There’s no single reason why the decline in economic security for Wisconsin middle-income households has been so much greater than in most other states. One contributing factor is that Wisconsin’s population is growing more slowly and is on average older than the populations of many other states. Also contributing is the decline of manufacturing in the U.S.; Wisconsin’s economy relies more heavily on manufacturing than nearly any other state." The blog post also cited the declining share -- since 2000 -- of Wisconsin workers who belong to unions, saying the higher wages paid to unionized workers vs non-union workers "help push additional households into the middle class." Walker's tenure For Maddow's claim, the question is how the middle class has fared versus other states since Walker has been governor. The answer is: Not great, but quite a bit better than last place. Using the same University of Minnesota data that Pew used, we compared 2010, the year before Walker took office, to 2013, the latest year for which data is available. Nationally during that period, the percentage of middle-class households grew in 15 states, including neighboring Iowa. But it fell in the other 35 states, including Wisconsin. As we noted, 48.9 percent of households in Wisconsin were middle class in 2013. We found that was down from 49.4 percent in 2010. That drop of 0.5 percentage points meant Wisconsin ranked 24th among the 50 states. Montana’s drop of 2.65 percentage points was the largest for that period. Our rating Maddow said that under Walker, "the Wisconsin middle class is shrinking at a faster rate than any other state in the country." A study by a nationally respected research group found that -- comparing 2000 to 2013 -- the percentage of households in Wisconsin that were middle class dropped by a larger percentage than any other state. But 2000 was more than a decade before Walker took office. Using the same data, we compared 2010, the year before Walker took office, to 2013, the latest year for which data are available. In that comparison, Wisconsin ranked 24th in terms of shrinkage of its middle class. We rate Maddow's statement False.

pomt-02978	"Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time at every grade level on informational texts."	false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/21/sandra-stotsky/common-core-expects-english-teachers-spend-half-th/	With full implementation of the Common Core State Standards just a year away, Florida is taking last-minute feedback from supporters and critics alike. Gov. Rick Scott, whose tea party base has been among the most vocal critics, called for three public hearings in October to garner input. Education officials have said that the comments could be used to "tweak" the standards, which already are being used in the state’s schools. Education Commissioner Pam Stewart listened during the first hearing on Oct. 15 in Tampa as dozens of people spoke. The first speaker was Sandra Stotsky, an education professor at the University of Arkansas and staunch critic of the Common Core. One of Stotsky’s complaints was that literature and fiction would be replaced with nonfiction informational texts. "Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time at every grade level on informational texts — a percentage from which students cannot benefit intellectually," she said We decided to check the part of her statement about what kind of texts English teachers will be required to use in their classes. There’s plenty of evidence that the Common Core standards emphasize informational texts. The introduction says, "The standards are not alone in calling for a special emphasis on informational text." The Common Core also states that it follows the lead of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in "balancing the reading of literature with the reading of informational texts, including texts in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects." Common Core follows a NAEP framework that spells out percentages of literary versus informational texts by grade level. It calls for a 50 percent/50 percent split in grade four, with an increasing emphasis on informational texts in later grades. In grade eight, there’s a 45 percent/55 percent split, while in grade 12, the split is 30 percent/70 percent. Some news stories suggest that English teachers are using more informational texts in their classrooms as they move to the Common Core. An Oct. 15 story in The Hechinger Report found that some English teachers in Florida have replaced some classic works of literature with nonfiction books or added informational texts to their instruction. One teacher replaced the novel The Great Gatsby, with a memoir, The Glass Castle. Another said she would assign students Martin Luther King Jr.’s "I Have a Dream" speech alongside the novel To Kill a Mockingbird. In a piece for The Heritage Foundation last year, Stotsky pointed to such stories as evidence that the Common Core is damaging the English curriculum. "Anecdotal reports from high school English teachers indicate that the amount of informational or nonfiction reading they are being told to do in their classroom is 50 percent or more of their reading instructional time—and that they will have time only for excerpts from novels, plays, or epic poems if they want students to read more than very short stories and poems," she wrote. Stotsky said her remarks were based on the number of reading standards in Common Core. There are 10 standards for informational text and nine for literature in every grade level. "That is approximately 50/50," she wrote in an email sent after publication. "Many departments of education and superintendents have told local school districts to spend 50 percent of their reading time on 'informational texts' and 50 percent on literary study. They have interpreted the 10/9 numbers in exactly the same way." However, Stotsky’s claim that English teachers must spend at least half their reading instructional time on informational texts is a misread of the Common Core standards and the percentages it outlines. The Common Core website specifically states that the "percentages on the table reflect the sum of student reading, not just reading in (English) settings." It goes on to say that "teachers of senior English classes, for example, are not required to devote 70 percent of reading to informational texts. Rather, 70 percent of student reading across the grade should be informational." So those percentages also count what students read in their science, math and history classes -- which would likely be all, or nearly all, informational. To meet the 30 percent threshold for literary reading at grade 12, an English teacher would have to focus on stories, novels and plays, said Timothy Shanahan, a retired education professor from the University of Illinois at Chicago and a member of the English Language Arts Work Team for the Common Core State Standards Initiative. "Depending on how a school is organized, it would be possible for an English teacher to never touch an informational text," he said. Kathy Short, a professor at the University of Arizona, discussed the issue in a blog item about misconceptions about the Common Core, writing, "English teachers are encouraged to use more short informational texts, such as primary sources that can be found online and in newspapers to surround their reading of a novel, but not to switch their reading to primarily informational text. In fact, students need to primarily read literary texts in English in order to have the 30 percent of their day be fiction reading." The Common Core website also says that the English classroom "must focus on literature (stories, drama and poetry) as well as literary nonfiction." Because of that, "a great deal of informational reading in grades 6–12 must take place in other classes if the NAEP assessment framework is to be matched instructionally." Finally, Common Core leaves most of the decisions about what should be taught to the states and local school districts. It requires, for instance, the inclusion of "classic myths and stories from around the world, America’s founding documents, foundational American literature and Shakespeare." All other content decisions are left up to the local education officials. Teachers can replace The Great Gatsby with The Glass Castle if they want to, but they don’t have to, Shanahan said. "That’s all local decision making," he said. Our ruling Stotsky stated that the Common Core expects English teachers to spend at least half of their reading instructional time at every grade level on informational texts. The Common Core does emphasize informational texts. But it specifically counts reading informational texts in science, math or history classes, and it says that English classes must focus on literature as well as literary nonfiction. Most of the decision-making about what students read in English classes is left to the local and state levels. We find this statement False. Editor's note: This report has been updated to include Stotsky's comments, which we received after our initial publication. The ruling is unchanged.

pomt-08915	Kendrick Meek was "#1 in Florida in taking tobacco cash and then opposed a tax on cigars that would have helped pay for children's health care."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/27/jeff-greene/greene-attacks-meek-cigar-ties/	Congressman Kendrick Meek relishes a good cigar -- Padrons are his favorite, he told Cigar Aficionado magazine in a 2008 profile. He hosts an annual cigar party and is known to hand out cigars to members of Congress and their staff, and the cigar industry has helped fund his recent campaigns, the magazine reported. Padron Cigars, a longtime family business, is headquartered in Little Havana in Miami. Meek's U.S. Senate Democratic primary opponent, Jeff Greene, attacks Meek for his ties to the tobacco industry in a campaign flier accusing Meek of standing with special interests. Specifically, Greene wrote in a campaign flier that hit mailboxes around July 23, 2010, that Meek was "#1 in Florida in taking tobacco cash and then opposed a tax on cigars that would have helped pay for children's health care." Greene this week introduced a new TV ad that stated "Meek lobbied for big tobacco against children's health care." We decided to examine the campaign flier. Did Meek rake in more money from the tobacco industry than anyone else in Florida and then oppose a tax on cigars that would pay for children's health care? Greene's campaign cited the Center for Responsive Politics -- an organization that analyzes campaign donations -- as part of its proof, so we turned there first to check tobacco donations for Meek's 2008 Congressional race and 2010 U.S. Senate race. The website shows that Meek received $77,325 from the tobacco industry in his 2010 race and $63,727 in his 2008 race. Those amounts put him at No. 1 among Florida candidates for House or Senate and Florida members of the House and Senate. But Greene's flier said Meek was "#1 in Florida" and did not specify whether that was only among federal candidates. There is no simple way to thoroughly check tobacco donations to all candidates across Florida including for state Legislature. Next we checked Meek’s voting record on the U.S. Library of Congress website, particularly in 2007 and 2009, on bills that would raise taxes on the tobacco industry to help pay for children's health care. Meek voted for the bill each time – but the background is more complex. While Meek touted the law, behind the scenes he helped Miami cigar maker Jorge Padron get a meeting with top Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi so Padron could lobby against higher taxes, the Miami Herald wrote on March 24, 2008. Padron later hosted a fundraiser for Meek. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 would have increased excise tax rates on cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers and tubes, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco. Meek voted for the bill, referred to as the Small Business Tax Relief Act in the House, on Feb. 16, 2007. President George W. Bush vetoed the bill. Meek voted again for the bill on Oct. 25, 2007, and again Bush vetoed it. The taxes on cigars would have soared from 5 cents to $3, a 6,000 percent increase, the Miami Herald wrote. That tax hike was too high, Meek said in the 2008 article, but he also supported the health care legislation by voting for it. The Miami Herald wrote, "Asked why he would take a seemingly contrary stance by voting twice for the legislation, Meek explained that expanding healthcare was vital, adding, 'We knew it was going to be vetoed. ... My advocacy on behalf of the legislation is well documented in the congressional record. At the same time, I am sensitive to the fact that business owners facing a giant tax increase want to make sure that legislative leaders understand exactly what is going on. [The insurance program] is going to pass one day with my vote, but [I] don't want the small businesses in Florida and in my community run out of business.'" Meek also explained his concerns in the Cigar Aficionado magazine profile. "The goal of government is not to put small businesses out of business," Meek told Cigar Aficionado. "Speaker Pelosi and Chairman (Charles) Rangel are not about putting small businesses out of business. I thought that the tax increase (from 20.7 to nearly 53 percent) on the handmade cigar industry went a little bit too far. Well, not a little bit too far; it went too far. This would have hurt not only a lot of businesses in South Florida, but also those countries where the tobacco comes from. The Dominican Republic would have felt a direct effect of such a large tax [increase]. Also Honduras. Also Nicaragua." In 2009, the children’s health care legislation came up again, this time to raise the federal excise tax on cigarettes 61 cents, from 39 cents a pack to $1.01 a pack, and raise taxes on other tobacco products. Meek voted in favor of the bill, along with nearly every Democrat in the house, according to a Jan. 14, 2009, press release from Meek. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in February 2009. Cigar makers credited Meek with helping reduce the amount of the tax on cigar manufacturers, according to a Jan. 15, 2009, Tampa Tribune article. The article quoted Eric Newman, president of the Cigar Manufacturers Association of Tampa, as saying Tampa Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor "and Meek were very helpful and supportive of our positions." So where does that leave us? Meek was clearly No. 1 in tobacco donations among Florida candidates for House or Senate in his 2008 race and 2010 race and is at the top among Florida's members in the House and Senate. But Greene's flier didn't specify that the No. 1 label applied only to federal races and there is no simple way to check the tobacco dollars given to candidates across the state for various offices. Greene also claimed that Meek "opposed" a tax on cigars that would have paid for children's health care. Meek thought that the 2007 version was too high of an increase for businesses and he scored key meetings for a cigar maker with member of Congress, but he voted for the legislation anyway -- twice that year. Meek again voted for the version that passed in 2009 when the cigar industry credited him with helping reduce the amount of their tax burden. We recognize he worked to lower the amount of the tax, but we think it's misleading to say that Meek "opposed" a tax when he voted for it three times. Politicians are ultimately judged on their votes, and that's why Meek’s votes for the legislation is crucial information here. We considered both parts of Greene's claim and rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02083	"The average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/21/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-says-minimum-wage-workers-are-35-yea/	U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat in her first term, is a vocal supporter of raising the national minimum wage to $10.10 over a three- year period and then indexing it to inflation. The issue was on her mind May 8, 2014 during an appearance on the Devil’s Advocates radio show (92.1 FM in Madison). Baldwin was discussing the importance of a college education for earning better wages and gaining upward mobility. "I just had to smile during some of these debates we had on the minimum wage and I’m sure we’ll have again," Baldwin said. "A lot of people pointed to and brushed it aside and said, ‘These are teenagers.’ " She added: "First of all, they’re not. The average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old. That said, even if it involves a lot of people who are young, when we look at the cost of college, don’t we want them to be able to join their parents in helping save some money for that opportunity?" Let’s examine whether Baldwin’s correct that "the average person who gets the minimum wage in America is 35 years old." Her press office pointed us to a December 2013 briefing paper by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that has studied the $10.10 proposal. "The workers who would receive a raise do not fit the stereotypes of low-wage workers: Among affected workers, the average age is 35 years old, nearly 88 percent are at least 20 years old, and more than a third (34.5 percent) are at least 40 years old," the institute’s paper concluded. President Barack Obama, who is pushing for $10.10, used the same lines -- and evidence -- less than two weeks before Baldwin. In his April 26, 2014 weekly radio address, Obama said: "Right now, there’s a bill that would boost America’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country. 28 million. And we’re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs." PolitiFact National rated Obama’s comment about the average age Mostly False. Both Baldwin and Obama were trying to counter wage-hike critics who have said that it’s primarily teenagers who work in minimum-wage positions. In April, we rated Mostly False a claim by the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce that "typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families." We found that by one definition of minimum-wage workers, teenagers make up the largest sub-group compared with other age groupings. But teenagers are less than a third of all minimum wage workers, and hard data is scarce on how many live in middle-class families. Baldwin, too, tripped up here. She framed her claim around people currently making the minimum wage. But the EPI study that put the average age at 35 looked at the larger universe of all workers who would receive a raise from the boost to $10.10. Many are making more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, but less than $10.10. In fact, the EPI research also factored in people currently earning up to $11.10, on the theory that those workers would probably also be given raises if the minimum were set at $10.10. So what is the average age of the pool of workers currently at the minimum wage, the group Baldwin mentioned? David Cooper, who authored the EPI study, put the figure at 30 among those right at the federal minimum, based on his research. It’s not that simple, though, because more than half the U.S. workforce toils in states that have raised the minimum wage above the current federally mandated $7.25, according to Cooper. To address that, Cooper studied the demographics of workers "at or near their effective state minimum wage," defining that as within 3 percent of the minimum-wage level, Cooper told PolitiFact National in April 2014. The average age is 31 in that group, Cooper found. Our rating Baldwin’s remarks contained an element of truth about the demographics of minimum-wage workers. But the average age of 35 holds for those who would benefit from a change to $10.10, not the group Baldwin spoke of -- current minimum-wage workers. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-13314	Says Hillary Clinton "promised, running for the Senate years ago, 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. ... Not only didn't they come, but they lost so many jobs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/07/donald-trump/trump-clinton-promised-add-200k-jobs-upstate-new-y/	Donald Trump charged Hillary Clinton with "doing nothing" for 26 years at a campaign stop in Florida, highlighting a jobs pledge she made during her 2000 Senate campaign. "She promised, running for the Senate years ago, 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. It was a disaster," Trump said Sept. 27 in Melbourne, Fla. "Not only didn’t they come, but they lost so many jobs and you have it see it now. It’s so sad when you see what’s happened to upstate New York. It is a disaster." During her 2000 Senate race against Republican Rick Lazio, Clinton ran ads that said, "Hillary has a plan to create 200,000 jobs." She also made the promise campaigning in the region, according to news reports from the time. Clinton, of course, won the race and went on to serve eight years before being named secretary of state. But did she deliver on her promise? The Trump campaign referred us to a Washington Post analysis of Clinton’s pledge. The story concluded that her efforts fell flat, but it doesn’t say the area lost jobs, either. The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, forwarded us numbers compiled using data from New York’s Labor Department. By this count, upstate New York added about 100,000 jobs from the year before Clinton’s first year in the Senate (2000) to her last year (2008). It’s worth noting, though, that this tally counts all jobs, including those in state and local government. The Clinton camp is also counting the Hudson Valley region, which includes five counties that the state government does not consider to be upstate New York. Furthermore, the data comes from a sample survey of unemployment that locates a job based on where someone lives rather than where the job is based. For example, a Westchester County resident who works in New York City government would be counted as employed in upstate New York by the Clinton camp’s tally. If we look at just private-sector jobs and a universal count that locates a job based on where it actually is, upstate New York’s net gain in jobs is less impressive. We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ quarterly census of employment and wages, and three different definitions of upstate New York. In the broadest sense, the region refers to everywhere in the state but New York City and Long Island. Another definition also excludes Westchester County in the Hudson Valley. And a third, the one used by the state government, pinches off four more downstate counties. No matter how you slice and dice the state, Trump is right that Clinton didn’t meet her jobs target in the private sector. And his claim that the region actually lost jobs is accurate for the two stricter definitions. Folding in public-sector jobs, Trump is still right that Clinton failed to live up to her pledge, but he’s wrong that the region lost jobs. By all three definitions of upstate New York, the area actually added jobs, though not nearly as many as Clinton promised. Upstate New York didn’t make as strong of a recovery from the 2000 recession as the rest of the state or the country overall. During Clinton’s Senate tenure and before the 2008 recession hit, New York state gained about 134,000 jobs (85,000 in the private sector) while the country added almost 5 million jobs (3 million in the private sector). "The Clinton campaign proposal to create 200,000 jobs appears to be pulled from thin air, not backed up by any calculation or details related to any particular policy proposal," said E.J. McMahon, research director of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative think bank in Albany. David Shaffer, former president of the Albany-based Public Policy Institute, told the Washington Post that the 200,000 jobs goal was unrealistic, but "to her credit," Clinton did try. In her first year as senator, Clinton introduced a number of bills intended to spur jobs creation in the state, such as enacting a small business tax credit, updating technology infrastructure, providing financial and training assistance for local businesses and entrepreneurs. None of these proposals went anywhere. She tried again a few years later, but again to no avail. In her 2006 re-election campaign and her 2008 bid for the White House, Clinton said she couldn’t deliver because of opposition from the Bush administration and a Republican Congress. "When I made the pledge, I was counting on having a Democratic White House, a Democratic president, who shared my values about what we needed to do to make the economy work for everyone and to create shared prosperity," she said in 2008. She continued, "And as you know, despite the difficulties of the Bush administration and a Republican Congress for six years of my first term, I have worked very hard to create jobs, but obviously as president I will have a lot more tools at my disposal." Our ruling Trump said Clinton "promised, running for the Senate years ago, 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. ... Not only didn't they come, but they lost so many jobs." Trump is right that Clinton failed to bring 200,000 jobs to upstate New York, whether you’re counting all jobs or just jobs in the private sector. His claim that the region actually lost jobs is accurate for private-sector jobs. But looking at the total employment picture, the region actually added between 3,800 and 52,000 jobs depending on how you define upstate New York. We rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3c423d39-1e30-4f66-90eb-8a816d2eeb0e	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-07T10:00:00	2016-09-27	['New_York_City']
pomt-10695	Romney said "'No' to in-state tuition" for illegal immigrants.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/05/mitt-romney/yes-romney-said-no/	On several occasions, Mitt Romney has criticized former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for supporting a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants who graduated from Arkansas high schools to be eligible for in-state tuition rates at state schools. Romney, on the other hand, has said repeatedly that he opposed a similar measure when he was governor of Massachusetts. He does so in a television ad. That claim is accurate. Romney vetoed a bill in 2004 that would have allowed illegal immigrants who graduated from Massachusetts high schools to pay in-state tuition at state-run colleges and universities. "I hate the idea of in any way making it more difficult for kids, even those who are illegal aliens, to afford college in our state," Romney said at the time. "But equally, perhaps a little more than equally, I do not want to create an incentive to do something which is illegal." In 2006, the Massachusetts legislature tried to pass the measure again in order to override his veto, but was unsuccessful. The Truth-O-Meter says Romney's statement is True.

pomt-00140	Says explosive devices mailed to prominent Democrats and Trump critics confirm the "deep state (is) launching false flag against (mainstream media)/Dems to blame Trump & pro-America forces."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/oct/25/alex-jones/no-evidence-deep-state-behind-explosive-packages/	No known arrests have been made in connection with a wave of explosive devices mailed in recent days to prominent Democrats and critics of the Trump administration, and federal law enforcement agencies have not disclosed a motive. But that didn’t stop conspiracy-minded pundits like Alex Jones of InfoWars from claiming the suspicious packages were a politically-motivated plot to derail President Donald Trump ahead of the midterm elections. "Confirmed: Deep state launching false flag against MSM/Dems to blame Trump & pro-America forces," reads a post on InfoWars. "Suspicious packages sent to top Democrats and leftist media are a setup to blame on pro-Trump Americans ahead of the crucial 2018 midterms." There is simply no evidence to support this claim. Baseless claim A nationwide manhunt is underway to find the person or persons responsible for sending envelopes containing explosive materials to the following recipients: Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former Vice President Joe Biden Former Attorney General Eric Holder Former CIA Director John Brennan Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California Billionaire activist George Soros Actor Robert De Niro Media network CNN The outward appearance of the envelopes and the contents of the explosive devices are similar, according to law enforcement. None of the devices detonated. The identity of the perpetrator and their motive is not known, and a spokesman for the FBI said the bureau has no comment. Despite an absence of evidence, Jones of InfoWars laid the blame on the so-called "deep state," a supposed cabal of anti-Trump government bureaucrats, who loom large in the minds of conspiracy theorists.

pomt-01913	The Export-Import Bank "doesn’t cost taxpayers anything."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/30/vicky-hartzler/rep-hartzler-says-export-import-bank-free-taxpayer/	One of the tea party’s newest pet peeves is the Export-Import Bank -- a little-known government agency that the party is hoping to abolish. What’s the Export-Import Bank? It’s a government agency that gives low-interest loans and guarantees to foreign buyers in hopes of promoting American exports. The tea party calls it crony capitalism. We decided to tackle a striking claim that the bank’s supporters, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, frequently tout -- but one critics say is misleading. We heard it most recently from Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., in a June 24 Roll Call interview. She said the Export-Import Bank "doesn't cost taxpayers anything." A government agency? That doesn't cost taxpayers anything? How can that be? In contrast, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who has been leading the current effort against the bank, told the House Committee on Financial Services on June 26, 2014, "We should examine where the money comes from to finance Ex-Im. Whose money is it? Obviously, it’s taxpayers’ money." What is the Export-Import Bank? The Export-Import Bank is a federal agency founded in 1934 that finances foreign buyers with loans, guarantees and other products -- at lower interest rates than they would get from a private bank -- to help them purchase American products. About 60 other countries have similar agencies. Overall, the bank finances less than 5 percent exports annually. In 2013, the bank supported about $37.4 billion in exports. Its biggest, and thus most controversial, beneficiary is Boeing. Those who support it say the bank makes American companies more competitive globally by incentivizing foreign buyers. Those who are against it say it is corporate welfare that helps hand-picked companies while disadvantaging businesses that don’t use the bank. It's a hot topic because the agency's charter is up for congressional reauthorization in September. Its current three-year term ends in 2015. How much does it cost? Every year Congress sets a limit on the bank’s financial activities. The bank then borrows money from the Treasury to give out direct loans, which it pays back with interest. Since 2008, the bank has not relied on taxpayer dollars to cover its operational costs and loan loss reserves. Instead, the bank charges customers fees and interest that it uses to cover those costs in full. Often, the fees generate a surplus, which the bank gives back to the Treasury. In the past five years, the bank has given back $2 billion. Additionally, the bank’s default rates have historically been lower than private financial institutions -- the current default rate is less than 0.25 percent. The bank hasn’t been completely without losses, though. In 1987, several straight years of losses of more than $250 million to $300 million forced the bank to ask Congress for a $3 billion bailout. The most recent losses were in the 1990s, following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, said Export-Import Bank Advisory Board member Gary Hufbauer, also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank. Still, the bank has generated an overall profit of more than $5 billion for the Treasury since 1990. But just looking at cash flow doesn’t give us a full picture. Long-term costs The bank’s overall revenue isn’t as high as it could be because the interest rates are lower than market rate, said Charles Calomiris, a finance professor at Columbia University. This means there is a cost to taxpayers in terms of lost opportunity, and it will eventually become a loss in cash flow. Some economists believe that the incoming revenue will not be able to keep up with defaults adding up over the long term. It may take 100 years to see the costs in terms of cash flow, but they are always there, Calomiris said. "Loan subsidies don't come from thin air. They are paid for by the taxpayers. So, saying that the Export-Import bank is free is wrong," he said. He noted that federal mortgage loan providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rarely reported cash flow losses until 2008, when their monumental losses contributed to the Great Recession. Adding to the debate is a Congressional Budget Office report from May that gives a 10-year projection for the Export-Import Bank using two different accounting methods -- yielding two disparate outcomes. One shows the program operating at a $14 billion surplus, the other shows it with a $2 billion loss. The positive results from the method the government has traditionally used to assess the program. The loss results from a fair-value method of examining the program the way a private financial institution would, taking more risk into account. The bank's proponents say it’s wrong to treat government lenders like private lenders because the conditions are so different. The bank’s accepted accounting method better reflects factors like the Export-Import Bank's high credibility, lower tax burden and lower interest rates. "Comparable private market interest rates and guarantee fees seldom exist as benchmarks for Ex-Im Bank financing," Hufbauer said in a Peterson Institute blog. Our ruling Hartzler said the Export-Import Bank "doesn’t cost taxpayers anything." It’s true that in recent years, the bank has actually made a net profit on its loans and turned in money to the U.S. Treasury. But in the past, the bank has had years of losses and actually cost taxpayers money. Some economists think that could easily happen again, even if it doesn’t seem like an immediate danger. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Vicky Hartzler	None	None	None	2014-06-30T11:24:03	2014-06-24	['None']
pomt-07244	"Obama-Nelson economic record: Job creation ... at slowest post-recession rate since Great Depression."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/may/30/adam-hasner/hasner-says-post-recession-job-creation-worst-grea/	As U.S. Senate candidates in Florida gear up their 2012 campaigns, job creation is a hot topic. Republican and former state legislator Adam Hasner criticizes the Democratic incumbent -- Sen. Bill Nelson -- and President Barack Obama for sluggish job creation. "Obama-Nelson economic record. Job creation ... at slowest post-recession rate since Great Depression," Hasner tweeted on May 23, 2011. Many politicians and experts have talked about the "jobless recovery" -- when the economy rebounds but with lackluster job creation. But we wanted to check whether job creation after the most recent recession has lagged behind job creation after every other recession since the Great Depression? On May 26, Hasner adviser Rick Wilson e-mailed us a May 20 USA Today article linked to in the tweet, which stated "Nearly two years after the economic recovery officially began, job creation continues to stagger at the slowest post-recession rate since the Great Depression. The nation has 5% fewer jobs today — a loss of 7 million — than it did when the recession began in December 2007. That is by far the worst performance of job generation following any of the dozen recessions since the 1930s. In the past, the economy recovered lost jobs 13 months on average after a recession. If this were a typical recovery, nearly 10 million more people would be working today than when the recession officially ended in June 2009." We wanted to do our own checking on job recovery. First, we obtained the dates of recessions back to the Great Depression from the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan research organization based in Cambridge, Mass. NBER's website has a chart listing the dates of the recessions (written as "peak and trough"). The "contraction" line is the length of each recession. According to NBER, there have been 13 recessions since the one that started August 1929 and lasted for 43 months, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has month-by-month jobs data for 12 of them. The most recent recession was from December 2007 to June 2009, or 18 months. It's worth noting that although voters may judge Obama on job creation, that recession was well under way before he was elected president in November 2008. We contacted economic experts to ask them about Hasner's claim. Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal, labor-backed think tank in Washington, D.C., disagreed with Hasner's claim about job growth: "It’s not as fast as it could be, but he’s wrong, job growth after the early-2000s recession was slower, the slowest on record," she wrote in an e-mail. Shierholz sent us a chart she created based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which on the left side shows percentage job growth over 22 months (because we are now 22 months from the end of the 2007 recession) following a recession for the last four recessions: 1981, 1990, 2001 and 2007. The chart shows the most sluggish job creation was following the 2001 recession, when the number of employees on non-farm payroll dropped by 976,000. Economists referred to the period as a "job-loss recovery," she said. "You are not going to find anything that is slower than early 2000 recession," Shierholz said in an interview. But in the 22 months following the 2007 recession, the number of employees increased by 535,000. And Shierholz sent more in an e-mail: "The sluggish jobs recoveries following the last three recessions were due (to) slow output growth caused in large part by the fact that they were, to varying degrees, balance sheet recessions. (Balance sheet recessions are caused by real estate or financial asset bubbles bursting –- meaning that people and/or firms have assets that are worth less than their liabilities, so they will opt to pay down their debts rather than invest and consume, which slows growth.)" We asked Shierholz about the claim in the USA Today article on which Hasner based his tweet. The USA Today article cited job losses since the start of the recession -- that's not the same as the "post-recession rate" that Hasner referred to, after the recession was over. It's simply two different ways to look at job losses or growth. "The recovery has not been the slowest," Shierholz said of the most recent recession. But she agreed that "starting from the beginning of the recession, we are down more jobs ... than any other recession since the Great Depression; that is true." We sent Shierholz's chart to James Sherk of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He suggested measuring from the start of the recession rather than the end otherwise "you ignore the severity of a recession." He created his own chart starting from the beginning of the recession, which shows that the job picture is worse for the most recent recession than the previous three. We e-mailed Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin to ask for a response. He didn't address the accuracy of Hasner's claim comparing job creation after recessions, but argued that Nelson has tried to create jobs by, for example, advocating for high-speed rail in Florida. We sent Shierholz's chart to Wilson and he responded by e-mail: "I'm not going to cherry pick obscure economic data: we quoted a sourced USA Today piece for the matter at hand." Hasner said that job creation has been at the slowest post-recession rate since the Great Depression. Words matter to us, and we think most readers understand "post-recession" to mean after the recession is over. When counting after the recession, the 2001 recession had a slower job recovery. And Hasner isn't providing a complete picture when he labels this the "Obama-Nelson economic record" -- the recession started before Obama was elected president and an individual senator can't be blamed for sluggish job recovery any more than Hasner, a former state legislator, can be blamed for unemployment in Florida. Still, Hasner's off by only one recession out of 12. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Adam Hasner	None	None	None	2011-05-30T10:30:36	2011-05-23	['None']

pomt-14337	Says her representation of an ex-boyfriend "who was then my friend" in a family law case is "something that lawyers do on a regular basis."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/25/rebecca-bradley/justice-rebecca-bradley-says-lawyers-regular-basis/	Critics of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley say her decision to represent a former boyfriend in a contested family law case raises questions about her judgment. Bradley counters by noting that the judge in the case determined Bradley’s representation didn’t violate any ethical rules. And she contends that what she did is done by lawyers on a regular basis -- which is something we want to check. Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardin asked Bradley, who is being challenged by state Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg in the April 5, 2016 Supreme Court election, about the case. "I was helping out a friend," Bradley responded in the March 21, 2016 interview. "This is something that lawyers do on a regular basis, to help out friends or family members who need assistance in these types of cases." We know it’s common for a lawyer to represent a friend or family member in more mundane cases, such as a speeding ticket or a real estate transaction. But in this instance we’re talking about a business lawyer, as Bradley was, representing a former boyfriend in a family law case in which a couple was fighting over child placement. The case About a week and half before the interview, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the family law case involving J. Andrew Bednall. Case records show Bednall’s ex-wife had objected to Bradley representing Bednall. The court-appointed attorney for their son also expressed concerns. Ethics rules prevent lawyers from having sexual relationships with clients. However, they do not prevent lawyers from representing clients if a romantic relationship existed prior to the attorney-client relationship. Bradley responded in court papers filed in 2005. She said she and Bednall previously had a romantic relationship that "we both believed might result in marriage." She wrote that that part of the relationship ended in November 2002, but that they continued to date "on a nonexclusive basis" at the time of the custody case. The judge on the case declined to remove Bradley from the case on ethical grounds, according to the public filings. Bradley’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests to back the statement we’re checking. Family law experts We talked with five lawyers, four from the Milwaukee area and one from Madison, who have more than 100 years of combined experience in family law cases. Retired Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Lee Wells, who headed the family law division for eight years and still handles family cases as a reserve judge and mediator, said he has seen non-family law attorneys handle family cases and has seen lawyers in family cases represent someone they had or were having a relationship with. But he said he couldn’t characterize how common it is, partly because there likely were instances where lawyers didn’t disclose their lack of family law experience, or didn’t disclose that they were representing someone they had been involved with romantically. The other four lawyers, however, said that in their decades of experience, they could not recall even one case like Bradley’s, in which a lawyer represents a former boyfriend in a contested family law case. Our rating Bradley says her representation of an ex-boyfriend "who was then my friend" in a family law case is "something that lawyers do on a regular basis." But we found no evidence of that. Four of five longtime family law lawyers told us such representation is not done regularly -- they had never seen a lawyer represent a former boyfriend in a contested family law case. The other expert said he could recall cases similar to Bradley’s, but couldn’t say whether they occurred on a regular basis. We rate Bradley’s statement False.

pomt-02058	"Less than 5 percent of registered users in states allowing medical marijuana have cancer or AIDS."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/may/29/dont-let-florida-go-pot/less-5-percent-registered-users-states-allowing-me/	One of the biggest question marks over Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment is over who will use it. According to an opposition group, it’s not who you may think. Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot, a campaign run by a coalition of more than 40 organizations opposing Amendment 2, says on its website that most patients don’t suffer from the life-threatening diseases often associated with medical marijuana use. "Less than 5 percent of registered users in states allowing medical marijuana have cancer or AIDS," it says. The site ramped up earlier in May, and is run by St. Petersburg lobbyist group Save Our Society From Drugs. They use information from the Florida Sheriffs Association. Cancer and AIDS are often cited by proponents of medical marijuana as the diseases that marijuana can help. We were curious to know if it’s true that only 5 percent of patients who use the drug have those two diseases. Let’s check the registries and find out. Playing percentages Florida’s Amendment 2 specifically names cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis as eligible for treatment. It also allows for "other conditions for which a physician believes that medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient." That provides doctors plenty of latitude to make recommendations for things not on the list, like chronic pain or muscle spasms. Marijuana is typically recommended to cancer patients to treat nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy treatments. AIDS patients often use it to treat nausea, pain and loss of appetite. The big problem with tracking why medical marijuana patients use the drug is that the rules and record-keeping vary widely among the 21 states that allow it. Eric Pounders, spokesman for the Florida Sheriffs Association, said the 5 percent figure comes from an average Save Our Society From Drugs calculated from data from 15 states, which all report things in different ways. For example, statistics from Rhode Island say 4 percent of users there have cancer, and 1 percent have HIV/AIDS. New Jersey says 2.3 percent use marijuana for a terminal illness. Vermont allows conditions to remain confidential. Washington has no database of users or their conditions. California has no mandatory patient registration. The Marijuana Policy Project, a national group that tracks state regulations and favors the Florida amendment, says only six states routinely update comprehensive user data, so Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot’s list of 15 states is suspect. Karen O’Keefe, the project’s director of state policies, says a state like Alaska (which Pounders cited) doesn’t keep very accurate records on patients at all. At any rate, the numbers reflect a trend among the states that report conditions: A very small number of medical marijuana patients have cancer or AIDS. Opponents think that’s a big problem. "We want to show Floridians that the disease groups they are constantly hearing about, are not the ones that marijuana is primarily treating," Pounders said. He said pro-marijuana groups often use those two diseases to appeal to people’s sympathies. Dr. Gary Reisfield, from the University of Florida’s psychiatry department, agreed. While he said the 5 percent was comparable to research he’d seen, the outsized use of the two diseases as an example was a smokescreen by advocates. "Cancer and HIV are the camel's nose under the tent," he told PolitiFact Florida. "Physicians, most of whom favor medical cannabis legislation, will acquiesce to their patients' demands for cannabis for other ‘debilitating conditions,’ like pain, muscle spasm, headaches, insomnia and anxiety." Those are the kinds of conditions for which most patients are treated, said Dr. Barth Wilsey of the University of California Davis Medical Center. He pointed to a University of Michigan study last year that found 87 percent of sample patients from a Michigan clinic sought medical marijuana for pain relief, either on its own or in conjunction with other conditions. Cancer was cited as 3.4 percent of the sample and people with AIDS were combined with hepatitis C under "chronic infection," and totaled 2.3 percent. Wilsey added that doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with patients wanting to relieve pain, especially because most medical marijuana patients turn to the drug only after exhausting other options. He said he thought Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot was "trivializing" patients suffering from very real medical issues. "The significance of this statement is tempered by the fact that millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain. One type, neuropathic pain, is particularly difficult to treat," Wilsey said. "One thing is certain, we need more research on medical marijuana and less decision-making by legislatures and referendums." Our ruling Don’t Let Florida Go To Pot said "less than 5 percent of registered users in states allowing medical marijuana have cancer or AIDS." The medical marijuana opponents that run the website said they estimated their total using figures from states with current laws allowing the drug. Not all states report figures the same way, however, or may not report them at all. Patients who don’t have cancer or AIDS still may have legitimate reasons to use medical marijuana, including for pain relief. So the statistic Don't Let Florida Go to Pot cites isn't perfect. But the available evidence does suggest fairly strongly that the people who use medical marijuana for cancer or AIDS is a small percentage of all users. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02162	Says "Scott Brown’s carrying some big oil baggage" because he "collected over $400,000 in campaign contributions."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/may/01/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-says-scott-brown-got-400k-big-/	The Senate Majority PAC is going all out fighting attacks on Democratic candidates by libertarian businessmen Charles and David Koch. The group’s latest target is former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who is now trying to unseat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. "Scott Brown’s carrying some big oil baggage," the narrator says in an April 27 TV ad. "In Massachusetts, he voted to give oil companies big tax breaks. They make record profits. He collects over $400,000 in campaign contributions." We already fact-checked Brown’s "big oil" votes. Here we’ll take a closer look at the breakdown of contributions to his campaign. The Senate Majority PAC pointed us to OpenSecrets.org, a website run by the independent Center for Responsive Politics that tracks money in politics. The site tracks donations of at least $200 to show how money impacts congressional elections. OpenSecrets logs $455,760 in campaign contributions from oil and gas industry donors for Brown over the course of his career, according to the most recent data available. That’s the 15th most popular area Brown receives donations from. The biggest sectors Brown receives money from are retired individuals, securities and investment, lawyers and law firms, and real estate, each of which account for at least $1 million. OpenSecrets defines oil and gas companies as "multinational and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, natural gas pipeline companies, gasoline service stations and fuel oil dealers." That categorization includes what some people would consider "big oil": the political action committees and top executives of companies like Exxon and BP. But it also includes smaller, independent companies, and low-level individuals who happen to work for an oil company. In fact, by the center’s definition, global "big oil" companies only accounted for $52,550 of the $455,760 total. That’s just 11.5 percent. In addition, the ad makes it sound like the companies themselves are donating. Overall, $168,000 came from PACs -- which pool the money of employees and donate it in the employer’s name -- but the rest comes from individuals associated with oil and gas companies. The reasons for an individual’s donation may have everything or nothing to do with the industry’s policy agenda. Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad said that "Scott Brown’s carrying some big oil baggage" because he "collected over $400,000 in campaign contributions." Independently collected data shows that Brown received at least $455,760 in donations from donors associated with the oil and gas industry. However, the ad’s wording is somewhat misleading, since just 11.5 percent of that total came from PACs and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what viewers would reasonably consider "big oil." On balance, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2014-05-01T14:43:46	2014-04-27	['None']
pomt-07876	The military has spent $500 million enforcing the "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" policy regarding gays and lesbians in the military.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/07/joe-morrissey/del-joe-morrissey-says-military-spent-500-million-/	Gays and lesbians will soon be allowed to serve openly in the United States military and a bill by Republican Del. Bob Marshall to ban them from the Virginia National Guard has been squashed in committee. But that didn’t silence Del. Joe Morrissey, D-Henrico, who tried to counter Marshall by introducing legislation that would have barred the state from banning gays. His bill was killed by the same panel that snuffed Marshall’s. Morrissey, still wanting to speak on the subject, rose on the House floor on Feb. 2 and said the military spent "half a billion dollars to drum [gays] out of the service." Is he right? Morrissey told us he based his statement on a report from The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The organization studies laws and public policies regarding sexual orientation. A May, 2010 report from the group projected costs between $290.7 million and $555.2 million from 1994 and 2008. The research relied on information from the Government Accountability Office and the Palm Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Palm Center studies gender and sexuality in the military. We found two Government Accountability Office reports on the "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" policy. The first, released in 2005, examined the costs of the policy over its first decade, from 1994 through 2003. It said 9,488 soldiers and sailors were kicked out of the military under the policy during those years. The study said the dismissals cost the government about $95 million, using 2004 values, to recruit replacements. The GAO said it was unable to obtain the cost of replacing Marines and 136 ousted officers. Administrative costs were not calculated as well. In the GAO’s most recent report, released last month, the government watchdog reviewed dismissals from 2004 through 2009. That report found 3,664 expulsions and estimated the replacement cost at $193.3 million, in 2009 dollars. The GAO said this study contained more detailed information than the previous report, including data on administrative expenses and the price of replacing officers, who are far more expensive to train because the military often pays for their education at a service academy or through the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program. But Zina Merritt, who spearheaded the GAO’s latest report, said these two studies don’t necessarily allow us to determine a total cost of dismissals over the entire life of the "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" program. "In fact, we somewhat discourage doing that because there were a number of different factors on data we got this round that we didn’t get the last round," she said. "In 2005 the data didn’t include the Marine Corps, medical personnel and some other costs." Merritt said it would be better to view the reports as a base-line estimate of costs associated with the program. She acknowledged the true expenses were likely higher, given the GAO’s inability to gather all of the data it sought. The Palm Center tried to establish a more comprehensive cost figure with its 2006 report, which was authored by a commission that included former Defense Department officials, including William Perry, the Secretary of Defense from 1994 until 1997. Also serving on the panel were faculty members from the U.S. Military Academy and the Naval Postgraduate School. The commission said the GAO’s 2005 report accounted for the cost of replacing soldiers but did not adjust for any value received by the military over the course of a discharged soldier’s service. The Palm Center study said the military underestimated the price of training soldiers. It noted that while a 1998 report said the average cost of training an enlistee is $28,800, the 2005 paper found that the Navy, which had the highest per-capita training cost, said it spent just $18,000 training a new enlistee. The Army and Air Force said they spent even less. After speaking with an Army research analyst, the Palm Center group reported the average cost of training an Army recruit was between $45,600 to $56,400. Given that information, the Palm Center said it believes the GAO report underestimated training costs. The commission also sought to calculate the costs of training officers. If found some officers, such as jet pilots, can cost more than $1 million to train, though most are not as expensive. The commission considered several other costs, such as money spent by the military on travel costs for discharged soldiers. The group ultimately estimated a $363.8 million price for the policy’s enforcement between 1994 and 2003. When the Williams Center’s estimate for next five years is included, the total cost is reported at $555.2 million for 1994 through 2008. Let’s review. Morrissey said the military has spent "half a billion dollars" to dismiss gays and lesbians from the military. If we combine the GAO costs from its two reports, we get a total of $288.3 million spent enforcing "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell." And as the author of the most-recent report told us, that should be considered a minimum estimate, not an accurate total cost. The Williams Institute at UCLA and the Palm Center at UCSB both believe the actual costs were higher. Williams put its most recent estimate at $555.2 million. Neither Williams nor the Palm Center had complete access to military records on recruitment and spending. Morrissey’s figures are certainly reasonable. But because of the difference between the GAO figures and the figures from other groups, we rate his claim at Mostly True.	None	Joe Morrissey	None	None	None	2011-02-07T10:30:49	2011-02-02	['None']
pomt-06180	"The study of the Savannah River Estuary . . . clearly demonstrates the project can be constructed and [environmental] impacts will be mitigated."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/14/curtis-foltz/claim-savannah-ports-impact-environment-can-clearl/	Congress cleared the way for Georgia to transform Savannah’s harbor into the port of the future way back in 1999. Then old-fashioned Mother Nature had her say. Planners found that deepening the port to fit modern megaships will destroy some of the delicate wetlands nearby. More than a decade later, they’re still mulling over what to do about it. The Georgia Ports Authority, which is behind the dredging, thinks there’s little doubt planners can make it work. Executive Director Curtis Foltz wrote in an op-ed that appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it’s time to push ahead. "The study of the Savannah River Estuary — the most comprehensive in history — clearly demonstrates the project can be constructed and impacts will be mitigated," Foltz said. This claim puzzled the Truth-O-Meter team. If a study "clearly demonstrates" that port dredgers can address the environmental concerns, what’s the holdup? The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the federal agency in charge of studying improvements to harbors and their effects. The agency wrote the study Foltz mentioned. The port is next door to the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to 10 threatened or endangered species, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Dredging will affect the Savannah River estuary, a type of habitat where fresh water mixes with salty ocean water. A number of species can’t reproduce without estuaries. The corps’ "Tier II Environmental Impact Statement for the Savannah Harbor Expansion" was released in draft form for public comment in November 2010, and details how port planners aim to ease the damage to the environment that dredging will cause. The heads of several federal departments must sign off on the corps’ assessment before the dredging begins, and they haven’t done so yet. We found that while the corps is optimistic that it can mitigate the impacts of the dredging, other arms of the federal government and an independent analysis found weaknesses in the plan. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll focus on two of the most heavily contested issues in this debate: preserving the endangered shortnose sturgeon, and dealing with the loss of the waterway’s dissolved oxygen, which fish and other marine life need to survive. The endangered shortnose sturgeon is a 3-foot-long fish with a bony plate of armor and an upturned nose. Dredging the port will destroy a significant percentage of its habitat, according to the environmental impact study, so the corps proposed to expand it by building a "fishway." This passage would connect shortnose sturgeon to other portions of the river where they can thrive. A dam currently blocks the route. The corps’ draft environmental study concluded that the impacts on the fish "will be mitigated," but the National Marine Fisheries Service raised objections to the corps two months after the draft’s release. As designed, the proposed passage was "not likely to be successful in passing sturgeon to justify its use" to make up for habitat destruction, according to a letter the Fisheries Service sent to the corps. The two agencies worked out changes to the fishway. Last month, the Fisheries Service said the corps’ plan is "not likely to jeopardize" the shortnose sturgeon and other species, so long as the corps closely monitors the effort and meets other conditions. Now, on to dissolved oxygen, which is what fish breathe by filtering water through their gills. Researchers expect the port’s expansion to lower the amount of dissolved oxygen in crucial parts of the harbor, so the corps proposed that they install equipment that will put oxygen back in. The National Marine Fisheries Service objected in a January letter to the corps. They said the equipment might not provide enough oxygen, and called it a "very risky operation with a high degree of uncertainty." But after a few months of discussion, they sent a letter in November saying that they think the corps plan will adequately protect the fish. This letter included plans to closely monitor oxygen levels and make immediate changes if problems arise. The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service also acknowledged that researchers disagree over whether the oxygen system will work. They told PolitiFact Georgia in a recent statement that they’re working on a plan to monitor the equipment when it’s installed to ensure it’s effective. In February, a nonprofit group hired by the federal government to review the corps’ plans raised a different critique. The group said the oxygen injection system might release too much into certain areas of the harbor. This could have "lethal impacts" to fish, especially threatened and endangered species, the group’s report said. None of these comments said the problems are impossible to fix. They do question whether the corps plan will fall short of its goal. We think it’s fair to say that while the corps’ environmental report may have concluded that dredgers can mitigate the environmental problems they would cause, as Foltz stated, critiques by other federal agencies and an independent study muddy the waters. Foltz should have acknowledged their reservations. Since his statement needs more context, it meets PolitiFact’s definition of Half True.

pomt-05267	"The region I represent, both currently and in the future, has more automotive plants than the entire state of California."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/29/marcy-kaptur/marcy-kaptur-says-her-district-makes-more-cars-all/	Like most members of Congress, Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur is a big booster of her congressional district. During a May 17 appearance on C-SPAN, Kaptur described the reconfigured area that she’ll represent if she wins her race against Republican Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher as "the crown jewels of Ohio." To illustrate the area’s industrial prowess, Kaptur discussed how she enjoys pulling her car over beside the railroad tracks in Toledo and watching all the flatbeds go by, full of steel coils, bar steel and other metals bound for auto plants or gas drilling facilities elsewhere in Ohio. One of Kaptur’s boasts about the area’s manufacturing accomplishments got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. "The region I represent, both currently and in the future, has more automotive plants than the entire state of California," Kaptur said. Could the slice of Ohio that Kaptur now represents, as well as the new district that stretches along Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland, really have more auto plants than the nation’s most populous state? Getting the answer was be easier than we thought. It turns out that California no longer has any auto plants. The last car one - a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors in Fremont - closed in 2010. The Los Angeles Times said the plant’s closure marked the "the end of large-scale auto manufacturing in California, which over the years boasted a dozen or more plants building vehicles ranging from Studebakers to Camaro muscle cars." Toyota made Corollas cars and Tacoma pickup trucks at the plant in Fremont, while GM made Pontiac Vibes. GM dropped its portion of the plant in its bankruptcy. Then Toyota scrapped its portion. At the time, the United Auto Workers union criticized Toyota for the decision, saying it was dumping the plant because it was the company’s only unionized facility in the United States. Tesla Motors wants to reopen that factory to manufacture its all-electric Model S sedan, but hasn’t yet done so. The district that Kaptur currently represents has four auto plants, according to her spokesman, Steve Fought: Chrysler’s Toledo Supplier Park and Toledo North plants, GM’s Toledo Transmission plant, and KBI’s bearing plant in Sandusky. The new Ninth District will have three more: Ford’s Brook Park Engine Plant, Ford’s Avon Lake plant, and GM’s Parma Metal Center. The number of auto plants in Kaptur’s current and new congressional districts both exceed the number of auto plants in California - zero. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kaptur’s claim rates True.

pomt-13156	Says Democratic challenger for his N.C. House seat "raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!"	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/28/chris-malone/nc-legislator-accuses-opponent-creating-non-existe/	Chris Malone, a Republican member of the N.C. House of Representatives, took a pretty standard tactic of accusing his Democratic opponent of having raised taxes in a recent mailer. Many races for seats in the North Carolina General Assembly are not very closely contested, as we found in a Mostly True fact-check about gerrymandering. But Malone’s is. John Wynne, a conservative analyst for the website PoliticsNC, rates the district as "leans Republican." Malone faces Democratic challenger Terence Everitt in House District 35, which represents the suburbs in northeastern Wake County. Malone’s mailer is clearly aimed at parents who might still be feeling the pinch of their back-to-school shopping bills. "Terence Everitt raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!" declares the mailer, sent to homes in the area. "That’s right. As a member of the Wake County Transit Advisory Committee, Everitt engineered a $78.5 million tax increase. Not one cent of his tax increase will even go to our schools! We can’t trust Terence Everitt!" Everitt has never held elected office before, so we were intrigued by the claim that he "raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!" This isn’t the only controversial mailer that Malone has sent out. He has also called for the repeal of the controversial "bathroom bill" HB2 – in a mailer paid for by the North Carolina Republican Party, which raised some eyebrows. The tax mailer we’re looking into now was also funded by the NCGOP. Local government 101 There are multiple problems with the mailer’s accusation. The biggest is that the $78.5 million tax increase it references doesn’t actually exist. The mailer is very specific on where it gets its claim, so we’ll break it down. City and county governments’ budget decisions are up to the elected officials. But for large or controversial projects, officials often let voters decide though a municipal bond referendum. It’s a community-wide vote to raise funds, which can be done by raising taxes, borrowing money or both. State law since 2007 has allowed a handful of North Carolina’s largest counties to raise sales taxes by half a cent to fund mass transit programs. The Wake County Board of Commissioners decided it wanted to use the option, so it asked for volunteers to study transit plans. Everitt was one of 72 people who ended up on the Wake Transit Advisory Committee. The county commissioners liked the committee’s plan, so they decided to let the county’s nearly 700,000 registered voters choose at the ballot box whether it’s worth a sales tax increase. But that vote won’t happen until the same day that many of them will also be choosing between Malone and Everitt. So to say Everitt has already raised taxes is simply not true. Malone did not respond to our request for comment. The number Malone cited is right, for what it’s worth. If the bond does pass, it will raise the county’s sales tax rate from 6.75 percent to 7.25 percent. County estimates show that will bring in an estimated $78.5 million in its first year. If it passes, Wake County residents will pay an additional 50 cents on every $100 in goods they purchase. But wait…there’s more We should also note the irony of Malone attacking an opponent for increasing sales taxes on school supplies. Two years ago, state Republicans cut income tax rates and paid for it by broadening the sales tax base and eliminating some exemptions. We looked at some of the details in this Half True claim from Roy Cooper, the Democratic candidate for governor who said Gov. Pat McCrory raised taxes on the middle class "in 67 different ways." One part of the new tax law was eliminating North Carolina’s tax-free, back-to-school-shopping weekend after 2013. From 2002 until that change, families shopping for school supplies such as clothes, laptops and binders could go to stores across the state on one particular weekend and pay no sales taxes. North Carolina and Kentucky are now the only states in the Southeast without a tax-free weekend for back-to-school shopping. Although businesses fought its repeal, the state said doing so could mean $13.6 million extra in tax revenues. Malone wasn’t in office when the legislature created the tax-free weekend. In 2013, he voted for the bill that eliminated it. So if anyone in this race could be said to have raised taxes on clothing and school supplies, it would be Malone – not Everitt. Our ruling Chris Malone, a Republican member of the N.C. House of Representatives, said his Democratic challenger Terence Everitt "raised taxes on clothing, school supplies – even baby diapers!"

pomt-06658	"One international flight a day in a wide-bodied jet ... one flight daily generates $150 million a year and approximately 2,300 jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/sep/12/bob-buckhorn/bob-buckhorn-says-one-new-international-route-tia-/	Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn is defending a program to offer financial sweeteners for airlines that fly nonstop international routes out of Tampa International Airport. The benefits of even one new daily flight would outweigh the costs in incentives, Buckhorn said during an interview with WEDU-TV's Rob Lorei on his Florida This Week program. "One international flight a day in a wide-bodied jet ... one flight daily generates $150 million a year and approximately 2,300 jobs when that money spreads out into the local economy," Buckhorn said in an interview that aired Sept. 2. We heard the numbers and wondered: Could just one new daily international flight pack that economic punch? In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Buckhorn said his figures came from the airport. We found a study presented by an airport consultant in March. But his numbers didn't quite match up. It turns out he cherry-picked one figure and inflated the other. The $150 million a year Buckhorn cited was predicted only for European or Asian flights. The majority of the new routes sought by Tampa are instead to Central and South America. The study said those would have less than half the value to the local economy, under $70 million per new route. On the jobs figure, it appears Buckhorn misspoke. Even flights to Europe or Asia would only add around 1,200 jobs to the local economy, the study showed. Not 2,300. But we also wanted to look at the study itself. Economic impact studies can generate wildly different results depending on how they're conducted, by a factor of 100 percent in one non-airport example, according to an FAA-sponsored review. John Kasarda, an expert in aviation-driven economic development at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the study's basic numbers — $150 million and 1,200 jobs — were "consistent with economic impact studies of international routes by wide-body jets." We also spoke with Christina Cassotis, the consultant who presented the $25,638 study's findings in March. She explained that to estimate the impact of, say, a daily flight to Europe, you've got to pick an aircraft type — in this case, an Airbus 330. "What we selected is a very common aircraft," she said. They picked a price for fuel, and how much the aircraft might burn (and therefore buy in Tampa) — a $14 million impact. They made some other basic assumptions — that about 2 percent of flights would get canceled, that 15 percent of seats might stay empty. They looked into other spending at the airport itself, worth a few million bucks more: What would the airline pay for gate use? How much extra use might a club room get? What else would passengers and crew spend? Then they looked at impact outside the airport. They estimated that more than 75 percent of passengers would be visitors to the area, rather than locals — and spend more than $70 million. (The airport offered a breakdown of visitors vs. locals; Visit St. Petersburg Clearwater had research on how long they might stay; U.S. Department of Commerce studies helped with what they might spend.) Once they calculated that direct and indirect spending — at the airport and in the community — they did a calculation of how that money might move through the economy, known as spinoff or "induced" impact. An economics expert with Economic Development Research Group in Boston used a common model, called IMPLAN, to help calculate a multiplier, which varies by geography and industry. This one took into account about 20 industries touched by visitor spending, from car rental to hotels to shopping. It ended up being reasonably modest, as multipliers go. That added another $64 million to the bottom line. Airline fuel purchases, visitor spending and all that money's reverberation through the economy — those were the three biggest ways an added flight would lift Tampa Bay, the study showed. Our ruling The mayor drew on a consultant's study to support the need to lure international flights to Tampa. But he chose an economic impact of $150 million for his generalization — when just one of the airport's five target areas is in Europe. The rest are in Central and South America, which the study says would generate less than half the economic impact he mentioned. Meanwhile, he misspoke on the jobs number, nearly doubling it. Still, the study does support the idea that a new flight's impact might justify local hustle and incentives, the core of Buckhorn's argument. We rule his statement Half True.

pomt-01838	"Black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in the states with the strictest voter ID laws."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/17/jason-riley/black-voter-turnout-exceed-white-voter-turnout-eve/	Attorney General Eric Holder’s recent suggestion of a "racial animus" fueling Obama’s critics is no more than political posturing, said Wall Street Journal columnist Jason L. Riley. Some GOP politicians and conservative media objected to Holder’s comments on ABC’s This Week on July 13, 2014. Riley, dubbed by Salon magazine as "the right’s favorite new race guru," dismissed Holder’s claims as fear-mongering a day later on Fox News’ The Kelly File. "This is about Democrats concerned about minority turnout in November, and they have nothing to offer these constituents," Riley said. "It’s motivating them by scaring them, telling them that voter ID laws suppress the black vote, even though black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in the states with the strictest voter ID laws." The political and racial motivations and effects behind voter ID laws have been debated for quite some time. We wondered, how did voter ID laws impact voter turnout across the board? The phantom poll booth Riley told us he got the statistic from the U.S. Census Bureau. The federal data agency indicated in a 2013 report that the black voting rate (66.2 percent) indeed surpassed the white voting rate (64.1 percent) by 2.1 percentage points in the 2012 elections. According to experts, the strictest voter ID laws are when voters are required to present a photo ID when casting a ballot, and if they don't, are required to take additional steps before their vote can be counted. If a voter can’t present an ID, he or she is issued a provisional ballot and must submit an ID within a certain amount of time (usually 2 to 6 days). The Census reports that in these states, black voter rates in the 2012 elections were just as high if not higher than white voter rates: Missouri: Black voter turnout higher by more than 6.0 percent* Tennessee: Black voter turnout higher by more than 6.0 percent Georgia: Black voter turnout higher by 0 to 5.9 percent Indiana: Black voter turnout higher by 0 to 5.9 percent Virginia: Black voter turnout higher by 0 to 5.9 percent* Arkansas: Voter turnout not statistically different* Kansas: Voter turnout not statistically different Texas: Voter turnout not statistically different* (* indicates that voter ID laws were not in effect in 2012) So even with the voter ID laws, black voter turnout was higher than white voter turnout nationally and in the states with the strictest voting laws. But experts say that doesn’t necessarily mean that voter ID laws don’t suppress -- or, at the very least, attempt to suppress -- the minority vote. The jury is still out The impact of stricter voter ID laws is difficult to gauge because there are many factors determining voter turnout overall. It may be easy to tally the people who are turned away at the polls, but tracking why someone didn’t show up at the polls is another question, said Alex Keyssar, a political scientist at Harvard University. "It’s safe to say there will be consequences (because of the voter ID laws), but measuring them is extremely difficult," he said. The newness of the legislation makes the impact of the voter ID laws that much more difficult to determine. In fact, many of the laws weren’t even in place in the 2012 elections. (Virginia's law goes into effect in 2014, Arkansas' went into effect in 2013 and Texas' went into effect in 2013.) "One election doesn’t make a pattern," said John Hansen, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. "We have a distance to go before we can measure the impact of these laws." So what accounted for the high turnout of black voters in 2012? Barack Obama, Hansen and Keyssar said. In this year’s midterm elections and in 2016’s presidential race, when Obama’s name won’t appear on the ballot and the laws are in place, the rates may tell a different story. And the increased black voter rates in 2012 could also be interpreted as an unintended consequence or a "backlash effect," according to Erin O’Brien. a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Boston. The stricter voter ID laws may have actually motivated the minorities the laws were trying to suppress. That motivation, unlike its effects, is backed by pretty strong evidence. "There’s an old quote by David Henry Thoreau. He said, ‘Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk,’ there’s some trout in this milk," Hansen said. After Obama’s 2008 victory, the wave of passing new laws on voter access -- including photo ID restrictions as well as proof of citizenship requirements, registration restrictions, and absentee and early voting restrictions -- had a couple of things in common, according to O’Brien’s widely cited 2013 report. The laws were proposed and enacted in states considered to be swing states, where Republicans controlled the government in both chambers, and where minority populations are having more impact on election results. "Historically, the group that has to fight the hardest are communities of color. This legislation has been forwarded at the exact time that we’re becoming more and more demographically diverse," O’Brien said. "These laws were passed in states where minority voter turnout was higher in 2008 and with larger proportions of African-Americans. So they can be seen as ways to clear these (demographic) hurdles." The ruling Riley said "black voter turnout in 2012 exceeded the rate of white voter turnout, even in the states with the strictest voter ID laws," despite the Democrats claiming the voter ID laws suppress the black vote. While there is debate about the reasons why -- and if the phenomenon will last -- Riley's statistic checks out. Census data shows that indeed, for the first time ever, black voter turnout was higher nationally than white voter turnout, and at least just as high in the states with strict voter ID laws. We rate this claim True.	None	Jason Riley	None	None	None	2014-07-17T12:45:39	2014-07-14	['None']
pomt-09246	"In the last 50 years, (the federal government has) only balanced the budget five times."	true	/florida/statements/2010/may/07/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-balanced-budgets-rare/	U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Sarasota, joined an overwhelming majority of Congress on April 27, 2010, in voting to prevent an automatic cost-of-living pay raise for members of Congress. The measure, which passed the House 402-15 and the Senate on a unanimous voice vote, marks the third consecutive year Congress will go without a pay increase. Before the vote, Buchanan recorded a web video discussing 2009 legislation that would have prohibited members of Congress from receiving a raise unless they balance the federal budget. Buchanan's so-called "No Balanced Budget, No Raise Act" never received a committee hearing. Buchanan said he ran for Congress to preach fiscal responsibility. "In the last 50 years, we've only balanced the budget five times," Buchanan said. We wanted to see if Buchanan's recollection of history is correct. The White House Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office both track yearly federal revenues and expenditures. Technically, a budget is considered balanced when federal expenses equal federal revenues -- meaning there is no deficit or surplus. Generally speaking, however, most people consider a budget balanced when revenues meet or exceed expenditures. The federal budget is so huge -- now about $3.7 trillion -- that balancing it with revenues is almost impossible. It hasn't happened in at least the last 110 years, according to the OMB. However, in the past 50 years, from 1960-2010, the federal government took in more money than it spent five times -- in 1969, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Four of the surplus years came together from 1998-2001, President Bill Clinton's last three years in office, and President George W. Bush's first year in office. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the four surpluses totaled more than $559 billion. The fifth surplus -- $3.2 billion -- came in 1969, when Richard Nixon was president. The last surplus before that was in 1960, 51 budget years ago, and outside the window of Buchanan's statement. While a federal surplus is rare in modern history, that's not always been the case. A 1998 study of budget surpluses and deficits conducted for the House Joint Economic Committee found that federal surpluses outnumbered deficits 108 to 100, "with surpluses dominating in a large majority of the years prior to 1930." Urging increased fiscal restraint in Washington, Buchanan lamented in a web video that the federal budget has only been balanced five times in the last 50 years. While the use of the word balance isn't 100 percent right, Buchanan is correct that the federal government has been able to cover its yearly expenses just five times since 1961 -- in 1969 and from 1998-2001.

pomt-07067	"(Birmingham, Ala.) is the cradle of the civil rights movement."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/28/al-roker/whos-right-cities-lay-claim-civil-rights-cradle-ma/	You hear it all the time in Atlanta. Atlanta, many politicians, preachers and others say, is "the cradle of the civil rights movement." Former mayor Bill Campbell said it. So has entertainer Debbie Allen. One-time Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau president Spurgeon Richardson claimed the title for the city. So we were quite surprised when NBC "Today Show" meteorologist Al Roker, who was visiting Birmingham for a charity program, referred to that city as "the cradle of the civil rights movement." The city of Birmingham’s website says many refer to it as the cradle of the movement. We decided to go back in time for some answers. Atlanta was the birthplace of the movement’s most recognizable leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his leading partners. Atlanta was also home to the movement’s leading organizations, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, whose former chairman is longtime U.S. Rep. John Lewis, (D-Atlanta). Birmingham was the stage for some of the most important moments of the movement. The city’s public safety director, Eugene "Bull" Connor, a defiant segregationist, infamously ordered firemen to spray young protesters with water hoses. King, who referred to Birmingham as the most "segregated city" in America, targeted the city for his non-violent campaign because of the stubbornness of its leaders to evolve on civil rights. Some called the Alabama city "Bombingham." It was there, in 1963, that four black girls (ages 11-14) were killed by a bomb in a church on a Sunday morning. Most civil rights historians say the church bombing was the tipping point in public opinion of civil rights for blacks that resulted in federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 that desegregated public facilities, granted blacks the right to vote and prohibited job discrimination. So does that make Birmingham the "cradle" of the movement? NBC thought so after doing some research, said spokeswoman Megan Kopf. "Other cities may be considered that as well, but since we were broadcasting from Birmingham, that is the city we mentioned," she said. Some well-regarded civil rights historians say another Alabama city may have a stronger claim. "I honestly think if we assembled 30 civil rights historians and said if you had to name one place to call the cradle of the movement, I think Montgomery would get 75 percent of the vote and I think Birmingham would finish second," said David Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning civil rights historian who served as an advisor for the acclaimed "Eyes On The Prize" documentary series about the movement. Montgomery was the setting of the historic 381-day boycott to integrate the city’s bus system. It began in late 1955 after NAACP member Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. The Montgomery argument is based on the definition of a cradle ("The earliest stage," according to Webster’s) and the boycott is widely considered the beginning of the modern civil rights movement. Garrow said he’d vote for Montgomery. "Montgomery is the cradle because of the bus boycott," said Taylor Branch, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who has written extensively about King and the movement. Branch said Birmingham played a critical role in the movement. Birmingham was a tough steel town that was considered a bastion of segregation and considered a "gamble" for King. The battles there, Branch said, gave momentum to the 1963 March on Washington. "It is fair to say historically that Birmingham was a tipping point, a breakthrough for the national civil rights movement," he said. What about Atlanta? Atlanta, the historians and others noted, had only a handful of demonstrations and none were as acrimonious, violent or as transformational as Birmingham or Montgomery. "Atlanta finishes third," Garrow said. Steve Kline, spokesman for the King Center, said a valid argument can be made for Atlanta, as well as Birmingham and Montgomery. He noted the efforts of King’s father to get equal pay for the city’s black teachers a few years before the Montgomery bus boycott. Kline also mentioned the SCLC and that its first meeting was held in Atlanta. "You could make a good, strong case for Atlanta in some way," Kline said. Georgette M. Norman, director of the Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery, made a slight distinction in the claim for the title. "We don’t use cradle," she said. "We use birthplace of the modern civil rights movement." Norman said the museum makes that distinction because of the efforts made by others toward racial equality in the decades before the bus boycott. In Montgomery, for example, activists like E. D. Nixon had previously been engaged in civil rights efforts there. Nixon helped organized the bus boycott. Norman believes some refer to Birmingham as the cradle of the movement because of the 1963 church bombing. But if she had to choose which city is the "cradle"? "I’d say it’s Montgomery," Norman said. "That became the first sustainable movement and things moved on from there." Some say they’ve heard a cradle argument for Greensboro, N.C., where college students staged sit-ins in 1960 to protest not being served at "whites only" lunch counters and other locations. "I think it’s great for people to argue and take credit because the debate fosters history," Branch told us. Roker’s visit to Birmingham was a good cause on several levels. He raised money for charity and, as Branch observed, sparked a conversation among us about an important period in American history. NBC said its research showed Birmingham is the cradle. However, the consensus we found is that the "cradle" title more likely belongs to Montgomery. We rate Roker’s statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13363	"Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/sep/30/vote-no-2/amendment-2-would-bring-kid-friendly-pot-candy-flo/	Opponents of Florida’s medical marijuana amendment are warning that cannabis-enhanced edibles will endanger children, hoping that voters will eat up their dire predictions and reject the measure. "Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida," the anti-drug campaign Vote No On 2 said in a flier we received in the mail Sept. 22, 2016. The campaign is run by the Drug Free Florida Committee, an anti-drug group started in 2014 by longtime GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler and his wife, Betty, with financial backing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. We wanted to find out whether the medical marijuana amendment allows "pot candy," and whether it really would be "kid-friendly." Candy plan As a quick refresher, Amendment 2 would let doctors recommend medical marijuana for patients with a host of certain conditions, including cancer, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and more. It’s only a recommendation, because marijuana still is illegal under federal law, so doctors can’t prescribe it and pharmacists can’t distribute it. The patients would take their recommendations to what is referred to as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, which would be regulated by the state to provide the drug. Here’s where we get into Vote No On 2’s assertion about pot candy. The amendment language says the following (emphasis ours): " ‘Medical Marijuana Treatment Center’ (MMTC) means an entity that acquires, cultivates, possesses, processes (including development of related products such as food, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments), transfers, transports, sells, distributes, dispenses, or administers marijuana, products containing marijuana, related supplies, or educational materials to qualifying patients or their caregivers and is registered by the Department." So while the amendment doesn’t specifically mention candy, it does allow edibles. Proponents argue that edible forms of marijuana are better for some patients, in part because the effects can be longer-lasting than other methods of ingestion. That’s also part of the problem, because it can be difficult to gauge how the drug may affect people when eaten instead of smoked. Vote No On 2 cites an uptick of children being hospitalized in many of those states for eating marijuana-laced candy, which they say is tempting to kids if left out. They pointed to several news stories about children in medical marijuana states consuming cookies, chocolate bars, brownies and other sweets and candies. In some of their cases it wasn’t apparent if the candy was medical marijuana or from some other source. (It’s also possible that people could always just buy cannabis in bud form and make their own edibles.) Ben Pollara, director of United for Care, the group behind the amendment, said Vote No On 2 was creating a "total dystopian fantasy about the way the amendment could be implemented." He said a child getting into an adult’s medical marijuana presents the same issues as any medication, and it was up to the adult to prevent accidents from happening. "Put it away," he said. "That’s Parenting 101." Kate Bell, legislative counsel at the Marijuana Policy Project, which supports the amendment, said 19 of the 25 medical marijuana states allow edibles, although they all handle them a bit differently. Amendment 2 offers the state plenty of leeway on how it could regulate the marijuana industry. The Legislature would have to pass a law on the issue and the Department of Health would have to write the regulations. What those rules would specifically say is anyone’s guess, and the health department told us that they couldn’t speculate. A health department spokeswoman pointed out that under current Florida law allowing medical marijuana for some epileptics and terminal patients, the only prohibited form is smoking, which Amendment 2 would allow. That leaves us to look to see how other states handle guidelines about things like packaging and sales practices. Washington, for example, bans products designed to appeal to kids. Connecticut requires tamper-resistant packages just like prescription drugs. California, which is phasing in new regulations, requires labels warning patients to keep products away from children. New Jersey only allows edibles in lozenge form, which were previously only available to child patients to take at school. (There’s an overview of guidelines for each state here.) In Colorado, which started selling medical marijuana in 2001 and recreational marijuana in 2012, there has been an increase in the number of children hospitalized for ingesting marijuana. A spokeswoman for the state’s marijuana enforcement division acknowledged in 2014 that edible forms carry "a significant public safety risk." Colorado this year banned some products shaped like people, fruit or animals. The state also requires opaque, tamper-resistant packaging and a label announcing the content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. The state also is starting to use a universal symbol designating a marijuana product. That doesn’t mean kids don’t end up getting exposed to the drug. Mike Van Dyke, the chief of environmental epidemiology, occupational health and toxicology at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said the state continues to adapt its packaging policies to make edible marijuana less accessible to children. A Colorado report on the amount of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for marijuana exposure shows the number of affected children under 9 — when use is more likely to be accidental — has increased over the last 15 years. But Van Dyke says they still are small numbers. In 2000, prior to medical marijuana being legalized, only 1 child was hospitalized statewide. In 2014-15, there were 37 ER visits and 15 hospitalizations. There’s also been an increase among people older than 9, too, but there are caveats to the data. Hospitals record these as exposures, but they don’t necessarily specify how patients were exposed, or if they were at the hospital because of the exposure or for a related issue. "We’ve definitely seen an increase, but a lot of people are inflating the impact of these cases," Van Dyke said. "Prior to 2010, we didn’t have commercially available, edible marijuana products, so of course there’s going to be more instances with an increase in availability." The Journal of the American Medical Association this year published a study of marijuana exposures in Colorado for kids younger than 10. It found between 2009 and 2015, children’s hospital visits increased from 1.2 to 2.3 per 100,000. The Washington Post noted that means hospitals and poison control centers are much more likely to get calls about diaper cream, toothpaste, laundry detergent and crayons than they are about marijuana. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, "Amendment 2 will bring kid-friendly pot candy to Florida." The proposal would allow edible forms of marijuana, but the amendment does not specifically identify candy. Calling it "kid-friendly" plays on parents’ fears without any proof that’s what will happen. The statement is partially accurate but requires additional context. We rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0a465176-d408-4b16-a6b6-192099324a66	None	Vote No On 2	None	None	None	2016-09-30T06:00:00	2016-09-22	['None']
pomt-14813	Oregon’s Umpqua Community College "where the shooting occurred was a gun-free zone."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/nov/24/greg-steube/oregon-college-shooting-was-gun-free-campus-lawmak/	The sponsor of a bill that would allow concealed weapons on Florida’s college campuses said his legislation would help prevent mass shootings like the attack at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, which he described as a gun-free zone. Whether the school was a gun-free zone or not emerged as a point of contention at a Nov. 19 House Judiciary Committee hearing on HB 4001. Its sponsor, state Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, disagreed with testimony against the bill from Austin Engelbrecht, a lobbyist for Florida State University. Engelbrecht said Oregon law allows students to bring guns on campuses, but it was still the police, not a gun owner, who stopped the Umpqua attack. Steube responded that guns were not allowed at Oregon schools. "Oregon is a gun-free zone. The state of Oregon allows each university the ability to decide for themselves whether it's a gun-free zone or not," Steube said. "The community college where the shooting occurred was a gun-free zone. Don't believe me, look it up on your cell phones." We decided to figure out whether Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., allowed guns on its campus or not. Exception to the rule Christopher Harper-Mercer, a 26-year-old enrolled at Umpqua, killed eight students and an assistant professor and injured nine others before police arrived and wounded him in a shootout on Oct. 1, 2015. Harper-Mercer then killed himself, ending the deadliest mass shooting in Oregon’s modern history. Some gun rights advocates said the shooting could have been prevented if campuses weren’t gun-free zones — that is, the schools restrict students, teachers or anyone else from having a gun on school property. Steube used the shooting as an example of why HB 4001 is necessary, citing an Umpqua policy that bars guns from campus and therefore exposed students to danger. The school’s student code of conduct lists the "possession or use, without written authorization, of firearms," among other weapons and dangerous chemicals or devices, on college property or at college-sponsored events as a punishable offense. There’s a similar policy spelled out on Umpqua’s website. The clause "without written authorization" is important. There is a policy prohibiting guns at Umpqua Community College, as Steube said. But students are allowed to have guns on campus if they have a concealed carry permit — essentially what Steube’s HB 4001 wants to codify in Florida. His bill, which cleared the committee process to be heard in the 2016 legislative session, would apply to all colleges and universities, which would not be able to restrict concealed carry permit holders from carrying guns. While the Oregon University System banned guns in the 1970s, a concealed weapons law from 1989 said only the state’s Legislature can make rules on gun possession. The law was at the center of a challenge by a Western Oregon University student who was suspended in 2009 for bringing a concealed handgun on campus. The student had a permit for the gun. The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled in 2011 that the university system’s ban was beyond its authority and was invalid, so concealed carry permit holders could bring weapons on campus. (Having the gun out in the open was still not allowed.) Oregon is currently one of eight states that allow students to carry concealed handguns on postsecondary campuses — the others are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah, Wisconsin and Texas, which recently passed a bill that takes effect in August 2016. Legally speaking, community colleges can neither arm their own security guards nor remove people with guns from campus. On Nov. 9, Umpqua began paying for an armed sheriff’s deputy to act as armed security, because the school couldn’t directly hire an armed guard. Steube acknowledged the 2011 Oregon court ruling to PolitiFact Florida, but he said schools are now allowed to set their own policies prohibiting weapons. "I stated in committee that state law allows (concealed) carry in Oregon but the school banned guns," Steube told PolitiFact Florida via email. "My statement was an accurate reflection of the law and policy." The State Board of Higher Education in 2012 did create a policy that banned students, employees, contractors, ticketholders to university events and people renting university property from carrying guns on university property, according to The Oregonian newspaper. If someone had a concealed carry permit, they could bring the gun on campus, but he or she could not take it into a building or sports venue. There were exceptions for police, ROTC members, people in off-campus housing, and shooting and hunting clubs. But keep in mind, that policy was for the state’s seven universities, not its 17 community colleges. Their governing boards each set their own rules. Umpqua’s ban on guns doesn’t prevent students with a valid concealed weapons permit from bringing guns on campus. Umpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis told us the school’s gun-free policy didn’t apply to students with a valid permit. "UCC was never designated as a ‘gun-free zone’ by any signage or policy," she said. "Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus." It has been widely reported that students with firearms were on the Umpqua campus on the day Harper-Mercer attacked. One particularly harrowing account included the experience of student John Parker, an Army veteran who was carrying a concealed handgun on Oct. 1. "When I got into the room that was locked down, one of the professors asked if anyone was concealed carry," Parker told Reuters. "I raised my hand and said: ‘Don’t worry, nobody is coming through that door.’ " Parker was in a building away from the shooting. He told MSNBC that a professor convinced him to stay put lest he be targeted by the shooter or mistaken for the suspect by police responding to 911 calls. Our ruling Steube said Oregon’s Umpqua Community College "was a gun-free zone." The school does have a policy generally prohibiting firearms on campus. However, Oregon law allows for students with valid concealed carry permits to bring guns on school grounds with some restrictions. An Umpqua official confirmed that students with concealed carry licenses are allowed to bring them on campus in compliance with state law, just as Steube wants to see in Florida. Steube’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00842	"More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/mar/23/don-beyer/beyer-says-7000-americans-died-climate-change-even/	After a long career as a car dealer, lieutenant governor and ambassador, Democrat Don Beyer was elected to the U.S. of House Representatives last year with a focus on protecting the planet against climate change. Beyer, D-8th, reiterated his goal in a March 4 column for the Falls Church News-Press, calling global warming the "existential crisis of our generation, and of course the preeminent environmental issue." "More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year," he wrote. Beyer posted a similar statement on his congressional website on Feb. 4, saying climate change caused "almost 7,000" U.S. deaths last year. We wondered whether his claim is correct and asked for the source of Beyer’s information. Thomas Scanlon, a spokesman for Beyer, said the congressman’s office had made a mistake about the 7,000 deaths. "That number should be globally, not just in the United States," he emailed. "We made an error in editing this column for FCNP." That said, we wondered if there was even proof that 7,000 worldwide deaths were caused by climate change last year. Scanlon referred us to a two-page report on global warming issued in January by the American Academy of Actuaries. It said "global natural loss events" caused 7,700 fatalities last year. The academy attributed the number to Munich RE, a global insurance company based in Germany that issues an annual report on worldwide losses from natural catastrophes. In a study released in January, the company said 7,700 deaths were caused by global disasters -- including earthquakes, storms, floods, landslides, drought, extreme temperatures and wildfires. But Munich RE doesn’t assess whether whether the natural catastrophes -- resulting in $110 billion in financial losses last year -- were caused by climate change. "We do not have the ability to identify the direct impact of global warming on fatalities caused by natural catastrophes, other than to say any fatality caused by the earthquake peril are not due to global warming," emailed Peter Hoeppe, Munich RE’s head of geo risks research. "Our data indicate an upward trend in regard to losses from weather catastrophes which, over time, have increased in both frequency and severity." Of the 7,700 deaths, Munich RE estimated 850 were caused by earthquakes. The remaining 6,850 deaths, the company wrote, were caused by "weather-related" events. While there’s no precise way to measure the number of deaths caused by global warming, we should note that many experts believe it will be the root of many fatalities in coming decades. The World Health Organization predicts that an additional 250,000 people -- largely in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa -- will die annually between 2030 and 2050 because of conditions caused or exacerbated by climate change. Our ruling Beyer wrote, "More than 7,000 Americans lost their lives to climate change-fueled events last year." The congressman lacks documentation and admits he got his facts wrong. That makes our work easy: We rate Beyer’s statement False.	None	Don Beyer	None	None	None	2015-03-23T11:23:59	2015-03-04	['United_States']
pomt-11871	"Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/01/freedom-partners/koch-backed-group-half-true-claiming-tammy-baldwin/	It seems Charles and David Koch, the conservative billionaire industrialists, want to make U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin the $5 trillion woman. At least, that’s the aim of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the political and policy network that’s tied to the two brothers. On Oct. 26, 2017, a year out from the 2018 election, Freedom Partners attacked Baldwin with two TV ads. Using both a narrator and words on the screen, the two ads make this claim about the Wisconsin Democrat: "Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes." The claim gives no context, leaving it to the viewer to wonder whether her vote was for a one-year $5 trillion tax hike. So, let’s investigate. The group Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, also known simply as Freedom Partners, is a group based outside of Washington, D.C.. It says it will spend $1.6 million on the two TV ads, as well as digital versions. Baldwin is up for re-election to a second term in the November 2018 election. So far, two Republicans -- political newcomer Kevin Nicholson and Leah Vukmir, a state senator -- have launched campaigns to be the GOP nominee. In the 2016 Wisconsin Senate race, an affiliated group, Freedom Partners Action Fund, said it spent $2 million on a TV ad attacking Democrat Russ Feingold over veterans care. Feingold lost to incumbent Republican Ron Johnson, who won a second term. Now to the new ads. Baldwin’s vote The ads include a footnote making it clear that the $5 trillion claim is based on Baldwin’s vote, in April 2011, for a fiscal 2012 federal budget proposed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. At the time, Baldwin was representing the Madison area in the House and was a vice-chair of the caucus. The caucus says it "seeks to give voice to the needs and aspirations of all Americans and to build a more just and humane society." The caucus’ proposed budget was an alternative to federal budgets proposed by President Barack Obama and House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the current House speaker. It was introduced as an amendment to Ryan’s budget and failed in the House, 347-77. The caucus’ budget called for $3.9 trillion in actual tax increases over the next decade, such as raising income tax rates on millionaires and raising rates on the estate tax. However, it could also be argued that other measures in the budget, such as allowing tax cuts adopted under President George W. Bush to expire, also were tax increases. The budget also outlined $1.7 trillion in spending cuts, largely from defense, as well as $1.7 trillion in "public investments" in areas such as education, transportation and infrastructure. An important point here: As we have stated in past fact checks, voting for something as massive as a federal budget and its countless provisions doesn’t mean a lawmaker supports every provision. Lawmakers who voted for the caucus budget might have been motivated, for example, by its defense cuts or new spending, rather than any or all of the tax increases. At the same time, the amount of revenue to be collected in taxes is a major feature of any budget, as it helps set spending parameters. The ads The ads include a footnote that cites a PolitiFact Wisconsin fact check. It rated a different claim -- that Baldwin voted for a budget that included "trillions more" in spending than the Obama budget. That fact check said that, according to experts, the caucus budget would have raised taxes by some $5 trillion more than Obama’s budget. We have since clarified that reference to make it consistent with an earlier fact check. In that earlier item, experts had told us that total tax collections in the caucus budget would be $5 trillion higher than in the Obama budget. Tax collections can rise for any number of reasons -- from tax increases, yes, but also factors such as growth in the economy. Our rating Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce says: "Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes." Baldwin voted for a 2012 federal budget that would have raised taxes by $3.9 trillion over 10 years, but it also would have made $1.7 trillion in spending cuts and spent $1.7 trillion in areas such as infrastructure. Voting for the budget didn’t mean that Baldwin necessarily supported all of the tax increases. There were estimates that total tax collections -- another possible measure of "higher taxes," as stated in the ad -- under budget Baldwin voted for would have been $5 trillion higher than under the budget proposed by the Obama administration. But the ad didn’t make clear that that amount was over a 10-year span, not a sudden increase. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Freedom Partners	None	None	None	2017-11-01T05:00:00	2017-10-26	['Tammy_Baldwin']

pomt-02903	"When is a farm bill not a farm bill? When 90 percent of it is for food stamps."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/06/brad-blakeman/brad-blakeman-says-90-farm-bill-goes-food-stamps/	The expiration of a piece of the 2009 federal stimulus bill means a $5 billion cut this month to the federal food stamp program, called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. That has some lawmakers scrambling to restore the funding, and others fighting to stop it. Count pundit and former George W. Bush aide Brad Blakeman among those who wants to see the cut stand. Appearing on Fox News Channel, Blakeman criticized efforts to restore food stamp funding as part of an agriculture bill. "When is a farm bill not a farm bill? When 90 percent of it is for food stamps," Blakeman said. In this fact-check, we look at whether food stamps, now called SNAP, really amountsto such a large share of spending in the farm bill. Blakeman referred us to data from the U.S. Agriculture Department that shows average yearly participation in SNAP and total federal spending rising every year since 2007. Back then, about 26 million people relied on the program. Today, the number is closer to 47 million. Spending in 2012 reached about $75 billion. Blakeman also sent a link to a Reuters news article that estimated that about two thirds of the farm bill went to nutrition programs. Blakeman told PunditFact his point was that while the farm bill might sound like it deals with agriculture, it largely funds an entitlement program. He’s largely right. Let us explain. A bit about the farm bill The farm bill is second only to the weather in shaping agriculture in the United States. It determines how many billions of dollars will flow to farmers and companies that grow and distribute basic crops such as corn, wheat, sugar and soy beans. It touches subsidies, crop insurance, land conservation, organic agriculture and rural development. But it also serves as the mechanism by which low-income Americans receive nutrition assistance. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, estimated the 10-year cost for the Senate farm bill at $955 billion and the House version at $921 billion. The nutrition component, according to the CBO, is 80 percent in the Senate and 79 percent in the House. That’s close, but a little short of the figure Blakeman used on Fox News. 2013 farm bill budget: CBO score FY2014-23 Selected programs Senate proposal Percent of total House proposal Percent of total Commodities $41B 4% $40B 4% Nutrition $760B 80% $725B 79% Crop Insurance $89B 9% $93B 10% Total $955B $921B The House in particular has had a difficult time achieving consensus on farm policy. Hard-line conservatives have wanted deeper cuts in subsidies to producers and SNAP. Liberals have objected to the many ways that the Republican plan would make SNAP less generous and make it harder to qualify for benefits. The House and Senate are now hammering out a version both bodies can pass. Funding for SNAP remains a significant dividing point. Dottie Rosenbaum, a senior analyst with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, notes that regardless of congressional action, SNAP spending is projected to decline as the economy improves. "The reason spending went up is because the program did what it’s supposed to do," Rosenbaum said. "When people lose their jobs, they need more help." The Congressional Budget Office says that with no change in the law, the number of recipients could be about 35 million by 2022. That is less than the 47 million people today, about half of whom are children, but still more than the total in 2007. A final note: When we told Blakeman that 90 percent was too high, in large measure, he did not object. "In the future I will say the "vast majority" or 80-plus percent," he said. Our ruling Blakeman said that 90 percent of the farm bill went to food stamps. The more accurate figure is 80 percent in the legislation currently under discussion in Congress. The 10 percentage points difference doesn’t change Blakeman’s essential point, but it is enough to bring our rating down a notch. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-04136	"Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false. BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-tweets-social-security-changes-gop/	The fiscal cliff negotiations are now over, but while they were happening, there were lots of accusations and finger-pointing. President Barack Obama and Senate Republicans finally struck a deal early in the morning on New Year’s Day to avoid going over the fiscal cliff, with senators voting 89-8 in favor. But a much-talked about Florida senator with presidential aspirations voted no: Marco Rubio. Amid home stretch negotiations, Rubio took to the online messaging service Twitter to tell people what was happening. On the afternoon of Sunday, Dec. 30, he tweeted: "Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false. BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama." The next day, liberal columnist Paul Krugman said Rubio lied about the negotiations, and that "numerous reports tell us that McConnell did in fact make precisely that demand," referring to the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Krugman concluded that Rubio’s words revealed that a "grand bargain" between the two parties just won’t work: "You can’t make big deals with a totally untrustworthy negotiating partner," he said. We decided to sort out the controversy by investigating Rubio’s claim that the GOP did not insist on changes to Social Security as part of the fiscal cliff, and whether Obama actually supported those changes. Chained CPI The final days of fiscal cliff negotiations hit a roadblock amid a controversy about something called "chained CPI," which would reduce future spending on Social Security for seniors. Most years, seniors get cost-of-living adjustments that slightly increase their monthly Social Security payments. If chained CPI were adopted, the increases would be smaller. What is chained CPI? The CPI stands for "consumer price index," and it would be a new method for calculating cost-of-living increases for Social Security. Chained CPI accounts for how people change their behavior when costs go up: So if the price of pasta goes up, you might buy cheaper rice instead. Supporters of chained CPI say it’s a way to reduce Social Security spending without making major changes to the program. Opponents say it’s essentially a reduction in Social Security payments that hits many seniors who are barely getting by. Although painful for politicians clamoring for the senior vote, switching to chained CPI has drawn support from many economists and experts. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform included the idea in its recommendations. The conservative Heritage Foundation has endorsed chained CPI and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, has shown support for it under certain conditions, if it includes a modest benefit increase. Obama’s view on chained CPI Switching to chained CPI isn’t a new concept. The Washington Post reported that Obama "tentatively embraced" chained CPI during 2011 negotiations with House Republicans on the debt ceiling. But many Democrats -- including Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, and the AARP pushed back. When Obama released his deficit-reduction plan in September 2011 a year before he would face voters, it did not include the change. But post-election, as Obama wanted to avoid going over the fiscal cliff, he again seemed open to switching inflation measures. In mid-December, Obama reportedly agreed to chained CPI, angering some in his own party. Obama spoke about his chained CPI proposal on Meet the Press on Dec. 30, noting that it was not popular with Democrats or the AARP: "But in pursuit of strengthening Social Security for the long-term I'm willing to make those decisions. What I'm not willing to do is to have the entire burden of deficit reduction rest on the shoulders of seniors, making students pay higher student loan rates, ruining our capacity to invest in things like basic research that help our economy grow. Those are the things that I'm not willing to do...." So Obama supported chained CPI as a concession he was willing to make in order to get Republicans to make concessions on things Obama wanted. (We contacted the White House for additional comment on this point and did not get a response.) So was chained CPI part of negotiations? During the final weekend of backroom negotiations on the fiscal cliff, multiple news reports said that Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell included the chained CPI in an offer. The Los Angeles Times wrote that McConnell included it in his proposal on the evening of Saturday, Dec. 29 -- and it appeared to unravel within 24 hours. The reports we read -- in both liberal and conservative media -- said Democrats were bashing the proposal, while some said Republicans were "insisting" or "demanding" that chained CPI be included. At some point Sunday afternoon, though, Republicans dropped their demands for the Social Security change. The timing of those news reports were around the same time as Rubio’s afternoon tweet. Republicans appeared to be in damage-control mode about the suggestion that they would be reducing grannies’ Social Security checks in favor of lower taxes for the wealthy. A reporter asked Sen. John McCain why McConnell made the proposal if Republicans were against it. McCain, R-Ariz., responded bluntly: "Damned if I know." McCain said changes to Social Security would be a political loser for Republicans since the deal at hand was mostly about taxes. "It’s a very bad, losing proposition," McCain said. "What (Democrats) are saying now is, ‘Republicans want to preserve tax breaks for rich people and give up seniors’ Social Security.’ That’s the argument they’re using. Now whether it’s valid or not, it’s a winning argument. It should be off the table. And I think most Republicans believe it should be off the table." Rubio’s explanation Multiple news reports said that McConnell proposed chained CPI but that Republicans revolted and immediately squashed the idea. So why did Rubio tweet that "Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false"? Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email: "Marco’s tweet is 100% true. It was something that Republican leaders had sought, but never insisted on, and it was obviously not part of the final agreement (which Marco voted against because it failed to grow the economy or address spending). I’m honestly surprised that something so obviously true would warrant a fact-check from you guys." Our ruling On Dec. 30, two days before Rubio voted against the fiscal cliff package, he tweeted: "Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false. BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama." Actually, Republicans had asked for the changes earlier in the negotiations, but dropped the demand later when they decided it was a political loser. Rubio’s tweet did not make it clear that GOP leadership did pursue the Social Security change, at least for a time. Rubio also stated "BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama." Obama has shown a willingness to use chained CPI as one ingredient in deficit reduction, though he acknowledges that it isn’t popular with seniors or his own party. Obama has also said it was a concession he was willing to offer as part of a deal where both sides would compromise to reduce the deficit. We rate Rubio’s claim Half True.

pomt-14335	"We have less Americans working now than in the ’70s."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/25/vicky-hartzler/rep-hartzler-ignores-critical-facts-about-workforc/	Following the State of the Union and President Barack Obama’s claims of job creation, one member of Missouri’s congressional delegation said things aren’t so promising. U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Columbia, said, "We have less Americans working now than back in the ‘70s, so we do need to still address that and get our economy going." We reached out to Hartzler’s office to get a better idea of what she meant. Communications Director Kyle Buckles said the congresswoman was referring to the employment-population ratio from 1978 and 1979. We looked into these numbers, as well as some other measures to gauge the portion of the population that is working. Employment-Population Ratio The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines the employment-population ratio as the proportion of civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 16 years and over that is employed. This chart shows the ratio throughout the 1970s. The data show that in only one year, 1979, the employment-population ratio was higher than it was in 2015. In one year, 1978, it was the same as in 2015. In every other year, the ratio was lower. Labor Force Participation Another frequently cited indicator used to compare employment numbers is the labor force participation rate. This is a little different from the employment-population ratio because it compares how many people are in the labor market — whether they have a job or not — to the total number of people who could be working. One tricky issue with these numbers is how the aging population has affected the labor force between the 1970s and 2015. During testimony before a Congressional committee, Elisabeth Jacobs, a senior director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, said the clearest cause for a declining labor force participation rate is the aging population. "The Baby Boom generation, born between 1946 and 1964, is a large cohort of workers whose retirement age coincides with decline in labor force participation that began in 2000. As these workers retired, they left the labor force and in turn pushed down the total labor force participation rate." If we use the two years Hartzler’s staff said she was referencing, 1978 and 1979, we find the labor force participation rates were 63.2 percent and 63.7 percent respectively. Both of those numbers are greater than 2015’s rate of 62.88 percent. However, we again had to wonder about the first eight years of the decade. The rate in 1970 was 60.4 percent and it grew steadily to 62.3 percent in 1977, but it didn’t rise above 2015’s rate in that time. Number of Workers According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population grew from 202 million in 1970 to 308 million in 2010. While the population grew, did the number of Americans working fall to 1970 levels? Bureau of Labor Statistics reports show that by the end of the 1970s, there were nearly 105 million people in the workforce. In 2015, that number had reached more than 155 million. These data show a nearly 50 percent increase in the absolute number of Americans working in 2015 compared to the late 1970s. Our Ruling Hartzler said, "We have less Americans working now than in the ‘70s." The statistics Hartzler’s staff said she cited show the employment-population ratio and labor force participation rate was indeed higher in 1979 than in 2015. However, Hartzler was talking about the entire decade of the ‘70s. When we look at all the years, the claim doesn’t stack up. The first eight years of the decade, 1970 through 1977, have a lower employment-population ratio and a lower labor force participation rate than 2015. Hartzler’s claim does contain an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts and statistics that would give it a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-15203	There has been a 100 percent "increase in student debt under this Democratic White House."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/14/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-student-loan-debt-has-doubled-under-obama/	In a Twitter back-and-forth with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Democrats don’t have a great track record for keeping student loan debt in check in recent years. On Aug. 10, as part of promoting her college affordability plan, Clinton tweeted a graphic that said "$1.2 trillion, the amount 40 million Americans owe in student debt," accompanied by the text, "Cost won't be a barrier to an education. Debt won't hold you back." Bush, running for the Republican nomination, responded with his own similar graphic that said, "100 percent, the increase in student debt under this Democratic White House. Hillary Clinton: mortgaging the future of college grads for four more years." Has the student debt really doubled in the past seven years, and is it fair to tie it to Barack Obama’s presidency? (We also fact-checked Clinton’s response -- a third graphic that said Florida received an "F" in college affordability under Bush. See that article here.) The numbers, for the most part check out. But experts told us that rising student loan debt is a trend that started long before the Obama administration. "The long term trend of colleges becoming unaffordable goes back to the mid-1980s -- when private colleges started jacking up the prices," said Stephen Burd, a senior policy analyst at the New America Foundation and an expert in higher education policy. "In more recent years, it's been the publics that have seen bigger percentage increases in tuition." Total student loan debt has increased about 86 percent since Obama took office -- a bit under the 100 percent increase Bush cited -- according to figures from the Federal Reserve. At the end of 2008, right before Obama was inaugurated, the total student loan debt was $640 billion. By March 2015, student loan debt was $1.19 trillion. This graph from the National Center for Education Statistics shows the total student loan debt from 2003 through 2012, adjusted for inflation: Experts told us that total student debt increases when tuition increases and when more students enroll, and the 2008 recession caused both of these things to happen -- so the recent increase is more a function of the economic downturn, rather than having a Democrat in the White House. The economic downturn pushed states to cut higher education funding, so schools upped tuition to cover costs, said Donald Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University. Since 1980, private college tuition has increased about 200 percent, according to College Board data compiled by Heller. Public school tuition, on the other hand, has increased about 300 percent, with by far the biggest jump happening since 2008. As opposed to Obama, "some critics say governors and state legislators are to blame since they didn't protect higher education funding -- and colleges, since they haven't controlled costs," said Joni Finney, director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania. Even with the increased tuition, more people enrolled in college, as people tend to do when employment prospects appear to dry up, Heller said. Additionally, the recession left households with fewer of their own resources to fund higher education, so they had to take out more loans. There haven’t been any big policy changes so far in the Obama administration that would have affected student loan debt significantly, either positively or negatively, said Beth Akers, a Brookings Institution fellow and an expert on the economics of higher education. "It is far reaching to suggest that the president has had a significant impact on student borrowing during his administration," Akers said. The White House pointed out that the Obama administration has taken other measures to improve college affordability, such as expanding federal scholarships and implementing programs to help borrowers pay back student loans. Akers added that more collective debt is not necessarily a bad thing because higher education generally produces large and positive returns for its graduates. More collective debt means that more people are pursuing higher education -- particularly those from lower income brackets, who need loans the most. Our ruling Bush said there has been a 100 percent "increase in student debt under this Democratic White House." There has been a substantial increase in student loan debt over the course of Obama’s presidency -- but it’s an increase of about 86 percent, not 100 percent. Experts also told us that student loan debt was growing before Obama took office, too, and much of the increase that happened under his watch was a result of the recession and other factors out of the White House’s control.

pomt-08619	"Julie Lassa willingly took a hefty pay raise at a time when people throughout her district and the state were losing their jobs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/21/sean-duffy/sean-duffy-says-julie-lassa-took-pay-raise-other-l/	Democratic State Sen. Julie Lassa has a $3,000 headache on her hands. Lassa, seeking the 7th District congressional seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wausau, is on the defensive about a pay raise for legislators that took effect in January 2009. How lawmakers handled that raise is turning up as a campaign issue in several races this fall. Sean Duffy, the Republican candidate for the northwest Wisconsin seat, calls Lassa a "Madison insider" and uses the pay issue to support his position. An Aug. 25, 2010 Duffy news release noted that some state lawmakers refused their pay raise, given budget constraints, but that Lassa took the annual $2,530 increase -- even as "the state was hemorrhaging more than 100,000 jobs." It went on to quote Duffy campaign manager Matt Seaholm: "Lassa willingly took a hefty pay raise at a time when people throughout her district and the state were losing their jobs." So, is the charge on the money? We asked Duffy campaign spokeswoman Wendy Riemann for evidence to back up the attack on Lassa. She cited a January 13, 2009 editorial in the Stevens Point Journal, printed shortly after the raises took effect. Said Riemann: "All of the legislators got that raise, and many of the legislators said they were going to give it back and she’s on record as saying, ‘I’m keeping that money.’" Let’s look at how legislators are paid: Members of the state Assembly and Senate are paid $49,943. They received a $2,530 (5.06 percent) pay raise, which took effect in January of 2009 and lasts for the next two-year legislative term. Lawmakers also receive $88 for each day they spend in Madison. In the editorial cited by the Duffy campaign, Lassa defended the raise, saying it was only the second increase for legislators in six years, and less than the rate of inflation. Legislators don’t vote on their salaries; pay is set by a panel in the state Department of Employment Relations and then voted on by a joint committee of the Legislature. The full bodies don’t vote on their salaries. Lassa is not a member of the committee. In the latest tally, 31 of 33 state senators are giving back some portion of their raises, using a variety of methods. According to Senate Chief Clerk Robert Marchant, here’s how Lassa is handling her raise: Lassa took the pay raise, starting in January 2009. She received the higher pay for 13 months. In February of 2010, three months before she announced her congressional bid, Lassa notified Marchant she wanted to take lesser pay. By law, legislators can’t simply receive a smaller paycheck; they need to use another mechanism to return money they don’t want. Lassa is using furlough days that extend through June 2011. Lassa’s pay raise was worth a total of $6,325 from January 2009 through June 2011. By the end of the fiscal year, Lassa will have returned $3,062, or a little less than half of her raise. So, where does that leave us? The Duffy campaign is partially right: Lassa took the pay raise -- for about 13 months. But long before they launched the attack and before she announced her congressional campaign, Lassa had already started to give some back. With her approach, she will give 48.41 percent of her raise back, or about half. That’s where we rate Duffy’s statement as well: Half True.

pomt-01148	"Congress is a very special group of people. More than 80 percent of them never left the United States."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/17/sergey-lavrov/russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-says-80-us-/	Are American lawmakers rubes who never travel outside the United States? Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, seems to think so. It isn’t often that comments made by Russia’s foreign minister during an interview with French TV generate enough interest to catch PolitiFact’s eye. But a recent claim by Lavrov -- originally made to the France 24 channel, then repeated in a New York Times dispatch about Russia’s floundering currency -- caught the eye of several PolitiFact readers. In turn, they asked us to fact-check it. The claim came at about the 15-minute mark in the English-language interview Lavrov gave to France 24’s Marc Perelman on Dec. 16, 2014. Perelman asked Lavrov for his reaction to unanimous votes by the U.S. House and Senate to pass the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014. That measure authorizes (but stops short of requiring) military assistance for Ukraine as well as significant new sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, according to Bloomberg. Lavrov dismissed the measure and proceeded to tweak the legislative institutions that passed it. "Congress is a very special group of people," Lavrov said. "More than 80 percent of them never left the United States. They live in their own walls. So I’m not amazed about this Russophobia which is being displayed by the Congress at the moment." Lavrov didn’t look like he was joking in the interview, so we’re taking the claim at face value. Here’s what we found. (An inquiry to the Russian Embassy in Washington was not returned.) Because calling up all 535 members of the House and Senate and asking them about their lifetime travel histories would be prohibitively time-consuming, we figured the fastest way to test Lavrov’s claim would be to look at lawmakers’ records of official travel. We asked Jock Friedly, founder of the legislative data service LegiStorm, to run some numbers for us. Utilizing his database, Friedly found that no fewer than 412 voting House members and senators in the 113th Congress -- the one that just wrapped up its business this week -- have taken privately financed overseas travel during their congressional career, at least going back to 2000. (See LegiStorm’s whole list here.) That means that at least 77 percent of Congress’ 535 members (House and Senate combined) have gone overseas solely by counting one type of congressional travel -- namely, trips financed by outside organizations. The LegiStorm figure doesn’t include official congressional delegations (commonly known as CODELs) that take trips paid for using funds from the federal treasury. We took a quick look through some of the recent CODEL disclosures by the Clerk of the House and found that just in the final six months of 2013, at least 115 House members went on a CODEL. That’s 26 percent of the chamber going overseas just during one quarter of a two-year congressional term. (See the whole list here.) We cross-checked the two lists and found 20 House members who took a CODEL during that six-month period but had never taken a privately financed overseas trip. So that raised the number of confirmed members of Congress who had gone overseas at least once to 432 out of 535 members, or 81 percent. In other words, Lavrov got the percentage who had gone overseas almost exactly backwards. In reality, it’s probably low-balling it to say that 81 percent of lawmakers have made overseas travel. We are confident that the percentage would rise even higher if we had included a longer-term sample of CODELs, if we had counted travel paid by a foreign government (trips that are regulated under the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act), and if we had counted trips sponsored by lawmakers’ campaigns or political action committees. "I think it’s likely to be close to 100 percent who have done official travel of some kind overseas," Friedly told PolitiFact. And of course, none of these numbers touch any foreign travel taken in the lawmakers’ personal lives, either as children or adults. Our ruling Lavrov said, "Congress is a very special group of people. More than 80 percent of them never left the United States." Actually, the data shows that at least 81 percent of members in the recently concluded Congress have taken overseas trips on official business, and the actual percentage is almost certainly higher once all sorts of travel are included, including personal travel completed before being elected to Congress.

pomt-00693	Says he "raised average family income by 50 percent" during his tenure as Arkansas governor.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/04/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-he-raised-average-family-income/	Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is poised to join the fast-growing growing field of Republican presidential hopefuls for 2016. A video touting his potential as a candidate focuses on his economic record and his ability to beat the Clintons. In the video, Huckabee says in a voice-over that "as governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes and welfare, balanced the budget every year for 10 years, and raised average family income by 50 percent." (The video was officially released by a political action committee aligned with Huckabee called the Prosperity for All Fund on May 1, 2015.) That struck us as an impressive increase in incomes, even if it did come over a 10-year period. We wondered: Is it correct? Let’s start by looking at the numbers. When we reached out to Huckabee’s camp, they pointed us to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis tracking per-capita personal income in each state. Huckabee served from July 15, 1996, to Jan. 8, 2007, so the campaign used data for Arkansas between 1995 and 2006. In 1995, the per-capita income figure was $18,555. By 2006, the figure had grown to $29,494. That’s an increase of 59 percent. Case closed? Not quite. It turns out that those figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. If you do adjust the 2006 figure for its value in 1995, per-capita income in the state would have increased to a more modest $22,296. That would produce a 20 percent increase over 10 years, not 59 percent. Granted, a 20 percent increase above inflation, even over 10 years, is a pretty good record -- but it’s not as eye-catching as the 50 percent Huckabee cited in the video. Indeed, when you break it down, 39 percent of the income increase Huckabee referred to came from inflation -- something he neither had control over nor would he want to claim credit for even if he did. Hogan Gidley, senior communications advisor to Huckabee, told PolitiFact, "We stand by the fact: The average family income increased by 50 percent. That’s what’s said in the ad because that’s what happened." There’s another aspect of Huckabee’s claim to look at: Is it reasonable for him to take credit for having "raised average family income by 50 percent"? Note that he didn’t say he "helped raise" incomes; he said "raised." It’s a high bar to prove that his actions are the primary reason for the increase. Taking such a strong degree of credit is questionable since national and international economic conditions beyond the control of any one policymaker can have major impacts on a state’s economy, said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. Generally speaking, Sinclair said, "governors cannot claim much of the credit for income increases on their watch." One factor to look at is whether incomes in Arkansas rose faster than incomes nationally. And the answer is: They didn’t. Over the same period of time, incomes nationally rose by 62 percent without accounting for inflation, a few percentage points higher than the 59 percent under Huckabee in Arkansas. We’ll also note that in the ad, Huckabee touts his record of cutting taxes and balancing the budget, yet advocates of free-market economics have generally been cool toward Huckabee’s record on taxes and spending as governor. Every two years, the libertarian Cato Institute rates each governor on their adherence to low-tax, low-spending principles. Huckabee’s grade from Cato was initially a B, but with every biennial report his grade never improved, moving to C, C, D and finally to F. Cato cited increases on his watch in sales taxes, a 3 percent income-tax surcharge and a 25-cent cigarette tax increase. (Earlier in his term, it noted, Huckabee did implement a $70 million tax cut package and a bill to cut the state’s capital gains tax.) As for balancing the budget, state law requires the governor to submit a balanced budget and for the legislature to pass one. "I am hard-pressed to recall any specific policy initiatives that can clearly be credited with raising incomes," said Hal Bass, a political scientist at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Ark. "He was governor during a time of general national economic expansion, so I think there was a rising tide effect in place." To the extent that Huckabee’s policies may have aided incomes in the state, Bass added, it may have stemmed from his initiatives on health and education. For instance, Huckabee implemented the ARKids health insurance program, which leveraged federal and tobacco-settlement funds to expand health insurance to for low-income children, something that may have "kept poor families from being overwhelmed by medical expenses," Bass said. Our ruling Huckabee said he "raised average family income by 50 percent" during his tenure as Arkansas governor. Once you account for inflation, Huckabee is incorrect. Income in Arkansas increased 20 percent, not 50 percent. That increase trailed nationwide trends. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11115	North Korea's history of international negotiations shows "they'll take the concessions, they'll keep them in their pocket and then they won't deliver."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/07/juan-williams/does-north-koreas-negotiating-history-mean-it-cant/	The stakes could hardly be higher for President Donald Trump’s June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Given Pyongyang’s strides toward developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, the question of whether an arms control deal will take shape looms large over the historic talks. Yet some say North Korea’s track record gives plenty of reason for skepticism when it comes to negotiating. "The problem is that we know historically, going back to Kim Jong Un's grandfather, (that) these people lie, they're deceitful, they'll take the concessions, they'll keep them in their pocket and then they won't deliver," Fox News analyst Juan Williams said June 3 on Fox News Sunday. North Korea has shown nuclear ambitions since Kim Jong Un’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, established the country in 1948. To date, North Korea is believed to possess up to 60 nuclear warheads. The country has conducted six nuclear tests and more than 100 missile tests, including intercontinental missiles. This, despite years of diplomatic engagement and international pressure placed on three generations of leaders — from Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong Il, to the regime’s current leader, Kim Jong Un, whom Trump called "Little Rocket Man." Arms control experts and political scientists we spoke to agreed with Williams’ broader point that skepticism is warranted when dealing with North Korea. But whether Pyongyang has a track record of double-dealing is a bit murkier. Williams, through a Fox News spokesperson, cited examples of what he said were deals, talks or agreements that broke down due to North Korea’s actions or inaction: The Agreed Framework deal in 1994 under the Clinton administration. North Korea promising to "abandon nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs" during talks under the George W. Bush administration. The 2012 Leap Day agreement under the Barack Obama administration. Let’s look at each of these with a view towards whether North Korea behaved duplicitously. Clinton Era: Agreed Framework Former President Bill Clinton negotiated a deal in 1994 with North Korea, dubbed the "Agreed Framework." Under the pact, the country would scrap two plutonium-based nuclear reactors that the United States believed would be used to make fuel for a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Washington would give Pyongyang two alternate reactors less capable of producing bomb-making materials, as well as fuel. The pact would eventually crumble years later, but not before North Korea reaped a reward. "In this agreement, the North Koreans did get very significant concessions from the U.S., South Korea and Japan, including a great deal of economic aid," said Joseph de Thomas, a former U.S. ambassador who worked on North Korea arms control issues as deputy assistant secretary of state for non-proliferation in the Clinton administration. In addition to heavy fuel oil, North Korea received massive investments in the two nuclear power reactors that were to be provided, as well as large scale donations of fertilizer and food. But experts noted that North Korea also made major concessions. Pyongyang rolled back its plutonium-based program and granted access to inspectors — and honored these commitments for eight years. "Without that agreement, North Korea might have amassed enough plutonium for 50 to 100 nuclear bombs by the early 2000s," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. "Instead, they only had enough for less than 10." The agreement unraveled in 2002 after North Korea admitted it was secretly working to produce a bomb — not through the plutonium route, but through a program based on highly enriched uranium. Experts say it’s debatable if North Korea’s uranium-based program was covered under the Agreed Framework (though it was certainly prohibited under supplemental agreements). Regardless of whether North Korea violated the letter of the agreement, experts say the country violated its spirit. Rather than negotiate with North Korea over its compliance issue, President George W. Bush ended the deal. "The Bush administration chose to call the North Koreans cheaters and walk away from the Agreed Framework in a huff rather than working the process to deal with the violation," DeThomas said. "It wanted out of the deal and used North Korean actions as the justification." At the same time, it’s important to note the United States could be faulted for not fully complying with its end of the bargain. For instance, Washington failed to deliver as scheduled the fuel oil it promised North Korea to compensate for the shuttered nuclear reactor. "So they violated the spirit if not the letter of the agreement, and we didn’t do a perfect job of holding up our end either," said Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. According to Kimball, there were multiple reasons for the Agreed Framework’s collapse: delays in key U.S. commitments, Bush’s reluctance to continue the process and his labeling of North Korea as part of "an axis of evil," and North Korea hedging its bets and cheating by pursuing technologies related to uranium enrichment. "In essence, both sides gained benefits without fully delivering on their Agreed Framework commitments," Kimball said. The Agreed Framework fell apart around the end of 2002 when Pyongyang kicked weapons inspectors out of the country and resumed activity at its nuclear facilities. It also announced it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the only country ever to do so. Bush Era: Six-Party Talks North Korea’s withdrawal from the nonproliferation treaty gave rise to international discussion about Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Starting in 2003, the Six-Party Talks brought together North Korea and the United States, as well as South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia. In an apparent breakthrough, North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons and existing programs in September 2005, and pledged to return to the nonproliferation treaty and renew access to international weapons inspectors. In return, other parties to the talks would supply North Korea with energy aid and recognize its right to pursue a peaceful nuclear energy program. The United States and South Korea also agreed to refrain from deploying nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. The talks began to wobble over a disagreement about whether the United States had improperly frozen North Korean assets, and were further derailed when Pyongyang carried out its first nuclear test in October 2006. So had North Korea extracted concessions through those talks? Not so much, say experts. "They didn’t really pocket any concessions in the process," Noland said, "unless you regard stringing us along and buying time as a sort of concession." The Six-Party talks would later resume under Bush. Not everyone agrees North Korea got the better end of the Bush-era negotiations — in fact, some say Pyongyang gave more than it received. "The Bush era again saw some serious concessions made by the North Koreans, such as permitting American inspectors to reside permanently at its nuclear research center, in return, in my opinion, for very insignificant concessions from the U.S.," DeThomas said. Obama Era: Leap Day Agreement Talks continued under the administration of President Barack Obama. On Feb. 29, 2012, the United States and Pyongyang announced a so-called "Leap Day Agreement," under which North Korea would stop enriching uranium and missile testing, and would allow for the return of weapons inspectors. Here’s how senior Brookings Institution fellow Evans J.R. Revere described North Korea’s benefit: "In return for freezing their nuclear and missile programs, they received expressions of U.S. non-hostility and willingness to promote cultural and educational exchanges, a U.S. statement that sanctions were not meant to hurt the North Korean people, and, in a separate but parallel negotiation, 240,000 metric tons of nutritional assistance that the Korean People’s Army is unlikely to find appetizing." According to Revere, Pyongyang downplayed the significance of the Leap Day accord. Why? "Probably because they had concluded they were getting little from the deal," he wrote. Furthermore, because North Korea effectively ended the agreement by announcing a satellite launch a short time later, it didn’t accrue the benefits it was promised, Noland said. "It ended any enthusiasm in Washington for any further negotiations with them under the Obama presidency, but they did not really pocket any concessions," DeThomas said. "They just killed an agreement in its cradle." Our ruling Williams said North Korea's history of international negotiations shows "they'll take the concessions, they'll keep them in their pocket and then they won't deliver." Experts agreed with Williams’ broader point that skepticism is warranted when dealing with North Korea. In terms of North Korea pocketing sanctions, the Agreed Framework offers the strongest evidence. In that case, Pyongyang gained economic aid and other relief from the United States and others before things soured. Yet the other examples Williams cited offer a more mixed picture — both in terms of the balance of benefits and blame for the talks’ collapse. Some experts believe North Korea gave more than it received in some negotiations. We rate this Half True.	None	Juan Williams	None	None	None	2018-06-07T11:57:46	2018-06-03	['None']
pomt-04199	Says a new state report "confirms" that red-light cameras "lead to more accidents, more injuries and greater cost."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/06/michael-doherty/sen-michael-doherty-says-state-report-confirms-red/	More accidents, more injuries, more costs. As state Sen. Michael Doherty sees it, those are the results confirmed by a new state report into New Jersey’s red-light camera program. Pointing to that evidence, the Warren County Republican called for ending the camera use in a Nov. 28 op-ed on NorthJersey.com. The report from the state Department of Transportation, Doherty wrote, "confirms" that red-light cameras "lead to more accidents, more injuries and greater cost." Doherty’s claim is solid as far as the report’s overall findings for the 24 intersections where red-light cameras had been recording violations for at least a full year by the end of 2011. But the senator failed to mention how the report shows a reduction in total crashes and costs at the two locations with two years of data. Also, the report contains repeated warnings to not draw final conclusions about the program, as Doherty appears to have done. Doherty told us he stands by his statements. "There should be little surprise that government bureaucrats don't want us to draw the obvious conclusions that are supported by the data they hoped would remain hidden in an obscure report," the senator said in an e-mail. Under the five-year pilot program, which officially began in December 2009, traffic control monitoring systems produce images of vehicles running red lights, which are reviewed by law enforcement officials to see if a violation occurred. As compared with the year before the cameras were installed, total crashes at those 24 intersections increased from 577 to 582, or about 0.9 percent, and crash severity costs increased by an estimated $1,172,800, the report states. Those costs include vehicle damage and repair, medical care and even funeral expenses, according to the report. But the report also points out how there has been an overall reduction in crashes and costs at the two locations -- both in Newark -- where cameras had been operational for two full years. Comparing the second year of operation to the year before installation, the combined effect at those two locations has been a reduction in total crashes from 47 to 20, or about 57 percent, according to the report. At those locations, total estimated crash severity costs have decreased by $268,900, the report states. When comparing the first and second years of camera use at those intersections, total crashes dropped from 26 to 20, or about 23 percent, and there was a net reduction in crash severity costs of $119,900, the report states. Doherty pointed out how the total number of right-angle and rear-end crashes at those two intersections only dropped from 9 to 8 between the first and second years of camera operation. The senator referred to that reduction as "a statistically insignificant decline." "There is no evidence that the massive safety gains that we were told to expect have appeared or are likely to appear if the red light pilot program is allowed to continue," Doherty added. But the state report repeatedly cautions readers to not draw final conclusions, and notes how many other locations had not been involved in the program long enough to be included in the crash analyses. Of the analysis regarding those 24 locations, the report says, "it is important to remember that safety trends are never established over a single year, and as such additional sustained analysis is needed before concrete conclusions can be drawn." Our ruling In an op-ed, Doherty claimed a new state report "confirms" that red-light cameras "lead to more accidents, more injuries and greater cost." The senator’s claim accurately reflects the overall findings at the 24 locations where cameras had been operational for at least a full year by the end of 2011. But Doherty failed to mention how there’s been a overall reduction in crashes and costs at the two locations with two years of data. Also, Doherty doesn’t heed the report’s repeated warnings to not draw any final conclusions. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02458	Under current policies, "we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/25/richard-durbin/dick-durbin-says-us-debt-track-fall-3-trillion-nex/	When you hear discussion of the federal debt, the trendlines usually go only one way: up. That’s why our ears perked up when we heard the Senate’s second-ranking Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, say on the Feb. 23, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday that the debt is headed downward over the next 10 years. Durbin told host Chris Wallace, "I can just tell you this, Chris. Since President Obama has been in office, we've reached the point we're cutting the annual deficits in half, and we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years." On first glance, the data doesn’t seem to back up the claim that "the overall debt of the United States" is poised to drop by $3 trillion -- or even by a dime -- over the next decade. A quick refresher: The deficit is a fiscal shortfall for one year, while the debt is the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus any surpluses. The most widely trusted source for federal fiscal projections -- the independent Congressional Budget Office -- recently released an annual report, "The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2014 to 2024." In it, CBO estimated the amount of publicly held federal debt for each of the next 10 years. In 2014, the debt is pegged to be $12.7 trillion. By 2024, the debt is set to rise to almost $21.3 trillion. That’s an $8.6 trillion increase, not a $3 trillion decrease. We also checked to see whether Durbin was talking about a decrease in what CBO projected the debt to be 10 years out. In the equivalent "Budget and Economic Outlook" report that was released in 2009, just days before Obama took office, CBO projected that in 2019 -- the final year of that report’s 10-year window -- the debt would be $9.3 trillion. By contrast, in the report released a few weeks ago, CBO projected that the debt level in 2019 would be $16 trillion. So again, the future projection of debt is going up, not down. When we checked with Durbin’s office, spokesman Max Gleischman said the senator was referring to "the amount of deficit reduction Congress has already enacted," adding that "he actually understates it by about a trillion dollars." He pointed us to projections by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which estimated that such measures as the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the 2013 American Taxpayer Relief Act are collectively poised to "shrink deficits by nearly $4 trillion over the 2014-2023 period," as long as the deep, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration remain in place. This figure includes spending cuts, revenue increases, and reductions in the amount of interest on the debt. But look closely at the language: The center’s report consistently refers to the "deficit," not the "debt." As we noted earlier, the deficit is a single year’s shortfall, while the debt is total money owed. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tallied up all the expected reductions in the annual deficit from these laws over the next 10 years, and it found that they combined to equal $4 trillion. But while these reductions in the deficit, if they materialize, would hardly be trivial, they would not be big enough to actually create annual surpluses -- and surpluses are the only thing that can reduce the cumulative debt, rather than adding to the debt at a slower pace. Our ruling Durbin said that under current policies, "we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years." It's obvious now that Durbin meant deficits, not debt. But that doesn't mean it was obvious to everyone watching Fox News Sunday. And Durbin, who has been in Congress for 30 years, certainly should know and be able to articulate the difference. The fact is that people remember the national debt -- there's a whole clock for it -- and it's expected to continue increasing, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Instead of going down $3 trillion, the best estimate is it will rise by $8.6 trillion. That's a difference of ... $11.6 trillion. That's real money to anyone. We rate Durbin's claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-08409	"Scientists have shown us (that) the greater possibilities, the real science movement, has been with adult stem cell research. It has not been with embryonic."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/21/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-scientists-agree-adult-stem-cell/	Stem cell research has emerged as a bright line separating the 2010 candidates for governor in Wisconsin. Democrat Tom Barrett supports both adult and embryonic stem cell research and sought to portray Republican rival Scott Walker as extreme with a TV ad that claimed Walker wants to ban stem cell research. We rated that claim False, since it made no distinction between adult stem cell research, which Walker supports, and embryonic stem cell research, which he opposes. In the wake of the ad, Walker refused to say whether he supports an outright ban on embryonic stem cell research, though he told a pro-life group in the spring he would sign such a bill. In explaining his views at an Oct. 12, 2010 news conference, Walker made this pronouncement about stem cell research: "Scientists have shown us (that) the greater possibilities, the real science movement, has been with adult stem cell research. It has not been with embryonic," Walker said. He then added for emphasis: "That’s not a political statement; that’s a statement of scientific fact out there." We went to the lab -- and several experts on stem cell research -- to see if Walker’s claim on the merits of both sorts of research is true. First, we’ll note two things: 1) There is great hope that stem cell research, which has been used to treat some blood diseases and cancers, may one day treat and cure many diseases. 2) Adult stem cell research is older and generally not controversial, while embryonic is newer and controversial because it involves the destruction of a human embryo. In this item, we are not trying to settle the debate over what is morally right or ethically responsible. We are strictly looking at Walker’s statement. Asked to support Walker’s claim that adult stem cell research is considered by scientists to be superior to embryonic, his campaign cited statements by a federal agency -- the National Institutes of Health -- that differentiate the two: Adult stem cells "are currently the only type of stem cell commonly used to treat human diseases." Doctors have been transferring them in bone marrow transplants for over 40 years. Embryonic stem cells "are thought to offer potential cures and therapies for many devastating diseases, (but) research using them is still in its early stages." Experiments with them didn’t begin until 1998. Walker quotes the National Institutes of Health accurately -- but selectively. The NIH also says adult and embryonic stem cells each have advantages and disadvantages -- and that there is a major difference between them: Embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body, while adult stem cells "are thought to be limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin." Momentum for embryonic stem cell research connected with the National Institutes of Health grew with an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in March 2009. It lifted restrictions on the work that had been imposed by President George W. Bush. Obama’s order said in part: "Advances over the past decade in this promising scientific field have been encouraging, leading to broad agreement in the scientific community that the research should be supported by federal funds." The future of federally funded embryonic stem cell work has been uncertain since a judge in August 2010 blocked Obama’s order; that ruling is being appealed. But experts we consulted said, as Obama’s order did, that there is broad agreement among scientists about the potential of embryonic stem cell research. International Society for Stem Cell Research: Lawrence Goldstein, a member of the society’s board and director of the stem cell program at the University of California, San Diego, told PolitiFact Wisconsin "there is no scientific basis" for Walker’s statement. "While adult stem cells show promise in some therapeutic settings, there are many therapeutic needs that adult stem cells do not appear likely to meet," said Goldstein, who has testified before Congress on National Institutes of Health funding and stem cell research. "In particular, for neurodegenerative diseases such as (Lou Gehrig’s disease) and other related disorders, embryonic stem cells and related stem cell types show great promise both for therapy and for teaching us what is going wrong in these disorders so that we may develop better therapies in the future. "Thus, based on scientific considerations and data, it is far too early to conclude that one stem cell type or another will solve all the medical problems we seek to solve, so research with all types must proceed so that we can find out what is best for each type of disease." National Academies of Science: In September 2008, the academies noted developments in efforts to reprogram adult stem cells to an embryonic stem cell-like state. But "it is far from clear at this point which cell types will prove to be the most useful for regenerative medicine," the academies said, "and it is likely that each will have some utility." Earlier this year, the academies again said it is important to not cut off some areas of stem cell research. Medical College of Wisconsin: Stephen Duncan, director of the college’s stem cell biology program, said no one knows whether embryonic or adult stem cells hold the most promise because research is ongoing. "We just can’t answer whether embryonic or adult stem cells are the best," he said. "The tests haven’t been done." We’ve done enough research, however, to draw a conclusion about Walker’s claim. In supporting his views, Walker said scientists agree the most promising research is focused on adult stem cells, not embryonic stem cells. In supporting that claim, he selectively cites part of a statement by the National Institutes of Health. A broader look at the evidence shows the consensus among scientists is that embryonic stem cells hold great promise in treating diseases, in some ways may be superior to adult stem cells and are deserving of more research. We rate Walker’s claim False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2010-10-21T09:00:00	2010-10-12	['None']

pomt-10471	Barack Obama is "the only candidate who doesn't take a dime from oil company PACs or lobbyists."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/17/barack-obama/obama-rejects-lobbyist-money/	Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton aired television ads about the oil and gas industry just before the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania. Obama's ad asserts, "Obama's the only candidate who doesn't take a dime from oil company PACs or lobbyists. And that's change we can believe in." Obama has stated he has a policy of not accepting campaign contributions from political action committees or lobbyists. There's a bit of fine print on this, however, as we've reported previously . Obama does not take money from registered federal lobbyists, but he does take money from state lobbyists, retired lobbyists and spouses of lobbyists. The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics has a broad definition of lobbyist money that includes contributions from spouses of lobbyists. By its reckoning, Obama has received $115,163 in money from lobbyists based on data released on March 20, 2008. We can't say how much of that comes from contributors connected with oil and gas lobbyists versus other kinds of lobbyists. Many lobbyists represent more than one industry. It's worth noting, however, that Obama's total lags his significantly behind Clinton, who got $865,290, from lobbyists, and John McCain, who got $590,952. Is it possible that Barack Obama took "a dime" from someone connected to oil and gas lobbyists? Yes. But it looks as if Obama took good-faith measures not to accept money from current lobbyists for any industry, including oil and gas. For these reasons, we find his statement Mostly True.

pomt-14408	"More than once, I've actually had a conversation with the protesters on substance."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/13/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-hes-engaged-civilly-protesters-his-c/	In light of protests in Chicago that led to the cancellation of Donald Trump’s rally in the city, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz suggested that Trump should take a cue from Cruz himself. Cruz chided protesters for "behaving abusively" and Trump for telling his supporters to punch protesters in the face on NBC’s Meet the Press. "I think it is important that any political candidate demonstrate respect for the voters. You know, listen, I get protesters at my events. But it's very different," Cruz said March 13. "When I have protesters at my events, I endeavor to engage in them with civility and respect. More than once, I've actually had a conversation with the protesters on substance." HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Is it true that Ted Cruz, famed for his debating prowess, actually engages protesters? When we asked the Cruz campaign for examples, they pointed us to a recent event at the University of Maine and Cruz’s interaction with actress Ellen Page at the Iowa State Fair. In fact, "more than once" is an understatement, Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips argued. "Admittedly, the press rarely writes about it, because it is common and generally a respectful exchange," Phillips said. "It happens all the time." Campaign reporters we spoke with agreed with Cruz’s statement, and we came across several examples of Cruz interacting politely with people with dissenting views or at least addressing their policy concerns. Let’s discuss Cruz made headlines in July 2015 when he debated anti-war activists for 24 minutes at the Stop the Iran Deal Rally in Washington. "We want diplomacy, not war," a Code Pink protester yelled a few seconds into Cruz’s speech. "You know it’s very interesting thing to see those who profess to believe in free speech who are afraid of speech," he said, before inviting the protester and his colleagues to come forward and discuss their opposing views. A month later, Cruz famously sparred with Ellen Page over the intersection of religious freedom and gay rights. Cruz disagreed with Page on most (if not all) points, but kept the exchange going for about six minutes. Even beyond flashy rallies and famous actresses, Cruz does genuinely engage voters, not necessarily protesters, who disagree with him, reporters covering the Cruz campaign told us. For example, Politico reported on Cruz discussing Obamacare with a voter in Hubbard, Iowa, on Jan. 30. The voter pressed Cruz on his vow to repeal the health care law, and told Cruz that his brother-in-law finally gained health insurance under Obamacare but died because tumors were discovered too late. "What are you going to replace (Obamacare) with?" the voter asked. "Well, sir, I’m sorry for your family’s loss, I’m sorry for your wife’s loss," Cruz said and launched into a critique of Obamacare. "My question is, what are you going to replace it what?" the voter continued to ask. Cruz responded that he would allow insurance companies to sell plans across state lines and expand health savings accounts. A day later, an angry farmer in Iowa grilled Cruz on his position against the ethanol mandate (as many cameras and microphones lurked). Here’s a snippet of their exchange: Voter: "Why are trying to put salt on our injuries and wanting to take away our subsidies for biofuels?" Cruz: "Well sir, I’m not." Voter: "Yes, you are, you made that statement. Don’t tell me you’re not. You’re gonna keep it for the big oil people in Texas." Cruz: "Sir, I’m happy to have a conversation with you but not to yell." Voter: "I’ll quit yelling." Cruz: "Okay, I’m happy to have a conversation, but I’ll treat you respectfully." Voter: "I don’t understand it (Cruz’s ethanol position)." Cruz: "Okay, I’m happy to answer." Cruz then explained his policy views to the voter for six minutes and answered additional questions. One-sided discussions When it comes to actual protesters, Cruz’s engagement is sometimes a bit one-sided and is geared toward riling up his supporters, said Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune. "(Cruz) doesn’t create a real dialogue. It’s more for show than anything," he said. "He doesn’t exactly talk with the protesters, but he does provide some kind of rebuttal. He is different from a lot of candidates in that he at least addresses what they’re trying to bring up." Take, for example, how he handled protesters at the University of Maine on March 4. Cruz didn’t debate them, but did use their appearance to double down on his immigration policy. "You wrote a sign that says, ‘There’s no human being that’s illegal.’ Now that’s true. Every human being is God’s creation, a precious gift from God. But if you really believe that no human being can break the law, you will discover the falsity of that if you resist the police officer right now." When protesters interrupted him later, Cruz quipped, "They hear there’s a Mexican border and they start chanting ‘Bernie’? ‘Build bridges, not walls’ — you know that is a very interesting statement. But I’m curious, what do you say to all those people who lose their jobs, what do you say to all those people whose wages are going down, what do you say to single moms who can’t afford to provide for their families? Sir, sir, I appreciate you exercising your First Amendment right, but the First Amendment does not give you the right to silence others." Cruz reacted similarly, reaffirming his opposition to eminent domain when protesters chanted "hands off our public lands" at a February rally in Las Vegas. "Thank you very much, sir, for expressing your views. One of the great things about the First Amendment is that it even allows Bernie Sanders supporters to come to our events," Cruz joked. "And let me say sir, you have a First Amendment right to express your views, but at the same time, 85 percent of the state of Nevada is owned by the federal government. That will end when I become president of the United States." Heckling hecklers Of course, Cruz’s reaction isn’t to talk issues every time he’s interrupted. Often, he brushes it off with jokes. When a heckler yelled, "Ted Cruz looks so weird" at a Jan. 31 Cruz rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Cruz responded with wisecracks: "Apparently, the bars let out early tonight" and "Is that Donald Trump yelling in the back?" A few weeks earlier, a man interrupted Cruz’s Jan. 12 Second Amendment rally in Hudson, N.H. "Why is everyone so excited about guns? They kill people," the heckler said. "Sir, you are welcome to be a part of the crowd, but you are not a part of this group. I understand that you’re very confused," Cruz responded, chuckling, as the man was escorted off stage. As Cruz began to transition into a stump speech about freedom, a second protester got up on stage, prompting Cruz to take a harsher tone: "Oh, we’ve got another young man who’s very confused. Son, thank you — hey, hey, this is not your stage. … Boy, it’s almost like the Bernie Sanders people are scared. The Bernistas are out in force!" A month later, two men — who appear to be the same guys at the gun rally and identified as a "guerilla comedy" duo by the Huffington Post — tried to perform an exorcism on Cruz in Raymond, N.H., on Feb. 8. "Ted Cruz, look in the mirror and let the evil spirit leave, leave your power-hungry, demonic soul," one called out. "They’re very nice young men, a very confused fellow. Apparently, they’re Bernie Sanders campaign," Cruz laughed. "Look at yourself in the mirror," the heckler yelled back. "You know, the very odd things, usually lefties don’t believe in God," he said as the two were escorted out of the event. Cruz cracked a Bernie Sanders joke when protesters interrupted his rally in Houston, Texas. "I understand you seem confused about the First Amendment," he said, addressing the protesters. "You have a right to speak, but you don’t have the right to disrupt others. I’m curious, does that coordinated effort suggest the lefties are getting scared?" Our ruling Cruz said, "More than once, I've actually had a conversation with the protesters on substance." There are numerous examples of Cruz engaging with people with dissenting views. He’s had policy discussions with opposing voters and activists. When it comes to protesters, it’s debatable whether Cruz and the protesters are actually participating in conversations. Nonetheless, Cruz does usually address their issues. And he repeatedly affirms their First Amendment rights to protest. We rate his claim True.

pomt-07895	Says he predicts the weather better than Punxsutawney Phil.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/04/general-beauregard-beau-lee/metro-atlanta-groundhog-boasts-more-accuracy-punxs/	Politics, step aside. The Truth-O-Meter must address a matter of Southern pride. The honor and reputation of our local groundhog General Beauregard Lee. For three decades, the South’s most esteemed weather prognosticator has lived in the stout and lumpy shadow of Punxsutawney Phil. Phil makes the rounds yearly on the morning talk shows. He’s made appearances with Oprah Winfrey and President Ronald Reagan. His agent even scored him a gig with Bill Murray in the 1993 movie "Groundhog Day." On Wednesday, PolitiFact Georgia scribes rolled our eyes as the public fawned over Phil once again during Wednesday’s annual Groundhog Day celebration. Phil never saw his shadow, news accounts said. Spring will come early. But should you really trust Phil? Beau’s website says our metro Atlanta celebrity is accurate 94 percent of the time. Phil’s record is a measly 85 percent, it said. That stat has been picked up by various news outlets. Does Beau really deserve second place to that Yankee glory hog? PolitiFact Georgia decided to settle this matter once and for all. For the scoop on Beau’s record, we talked to Art Rilling, CEO and founder of Lilburn’s Yellow River Game Ranch, an attraction featuring people-friendly wildlife northeast of Atlanta. Beau lives there in a plantation-style manse named "Weathering Heights." For the past 10 years, his staff has calculated the General’s accuracy by noting the number of days local temperatures hit the freezing mark during the six weeks after Feb. 2. Beau, like Phil, predicted an early spring for 2011. Sadly, Phil’s staff has not tracked their groundhog’s predictions so diligently. Their official stance is that their marmot is "incapable of error, so his accuracy rate is 100 percent," said Mike Johnston, vice president of the Inner Circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. Wednesday was Punxsutawney’s 125th groundhog celebration. German settlers brought the tradition, which is based on ancient myths that say hedgehogs, which resemble groundhogs, have the power to predict the weather. Phil’s predictions are not site-specific. If he says that spring will come early, it will, Johnston said. Somewhere. When Phil’s really wrong, Johnston added, it’s the fault of poor Groundhogeese-to-English translation. "People complain and tell us we’re just making it up as we go along," Johnston said, "but after 125 years of doing it, we don’t need to." Before we go further, the staff of PolitiFact Georgia feels obliged to mention that meteorologists have officially determined that groundhogs cannot predict the weather. Really. A tongue-in-cheek analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climatic Data Center concluded groundhogs show "no predictive skill." (Why do this? To help get kids interested in the science of weather.) Or, more bluntly, "you can’t take any stock in a groundhog predicting the weather," said Tom Ross, a meteorologist who helped put together the NCDC’s report. It showed that between 1988 and 2010, Phil gave accurate national weather predictions 10 times out of 23 for a rate of 43 percent. True, but that won’t stop us. Our groundhog’s honor is at stake. Since the keepers of Beau and Phil do not keep comparable statistics, we performed an independent analysis using the NCDC study and National Weather Service data for 2001 through 2010. We defined "early spring" as a February with above-average temperatures. We then compared each groundhog’s prediction with temperatures nationally and in his respective hometown. The NWS does not keep average February temperatures for the hamlet of Punxsutawney, Pa., so a kindly meteorologist gave us figures for Putneyville, Pa., a town at a similar elevation about 15 miles away. We found that the General predicted whether spring will start early nationally with 60 percent accuracy. Phil’s rate was 30 percent. Beau predicted Atlanta weather with 50 percent accuracy. Phil got Punxsutawney’s right 40 percent of the time. By our analysis, Beau’s staff overestimated his success, but he’s still 10 to 30 percentage points ahead of Phil. Georgia’s underhog is the champion, paws down. General, emerge from the shadows. Stand tall on your stubby legs. The Truth-O-Meter salutes you with a Mostly True.

pomt-07845	"The most significant driver of out-migration [from Rhode Island] is the estate tax."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/13/ocean-state-policy-research-institute/ocean-state-policy-research-institute-says-rhode-i/	With Rhode Island facing a projected $295-million deficit in the next fiscal year, the last thing we need is to have rich taxpayers fleeing the state. But the Ocean State Policy Research Institute contends that's exactly what is happening, thanks to Rhode Island's estate tax. OSPRI, which analyzes policy issues "based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, and traditional American values," released a report on Jan. 20 asserting that much of the state's wealth is leaving -- mostly for Florida, which no longer has a state estate tax. "The most significant driver of out-migration is the estate tax, especially considering that the number one destination state for former Rhode Island residents is Florida, a state with no estate tax (or individual income tax)," the report asserted. The lack of an estate tax is what sends people to Florida? Not the lower overall tax burden, including no income tax? And why not the warmer weather? Nonetheless, OSPRI contends in its 20-page report that people are fleeing in droves and Rhode Island's estate tax is a big part of that. We decided to take a look. First, a bit of background. Rhode Island's estate tax, sometimes called a "death tax," applies to estates worth over $859,350, a limit indexed to inflation. (There is a proposal in the General Assembly to raise that limit to $1 million.) The actual tax rate is based on a complicated formula -- isn't it always? -- with a rate that increases as the size of the estate increases. For example, a $1-million estate is taxed at 3.32 percent; a $10-million estate is taxed at 4.98 percent. The impact, OSPRI contends, has been huge. While the state collected $341.3 million from the tax from 1995 to 2007, OSPRI says the state lost $540 million in other state and local taxes because people left Rhode Island. The report was paid for by Alan Hassenfeld, a board member and former CEO of toymaker Hasbro, who says he knows high-income people who have left the state, in part because of the estate tax. The first question is, are more people leaving the state than coming in? The simple answer is yes. The OSPRI study cites a Census Bureau report showing that from April 1, 2000, to July 1, 2009, Rhode Island's population increased by 4,894. But that was because in-state births far outweighed in-state deaths. When you look at net migration in and out of the state, we lost 44,649 residents. The study says it’s the rich who are leaving, but the report makes you wonder. The adjusted gross income of the average taxpayer leaving the Ocean State from 1996 to 2007 was virtually identical to the income of the taxpayer coming into the state ($45,455 versus $45,742). In 7 out of the 12 years, the income of taxpayers leaving was actually lower than the income for taxpayers coming in. So if Rhode Island is losing revenue, it's because more taxpayers are departing, not because the emigrants are, on average, wealthier. The study also says the "migration of income" to Florida -- the top destination for Rhode Islanders leaving the state -- was especially pronounced "in the years after the elimination of Florida's estate tax." "Between 1995 and 2003, the average income out-migration from Rhode Island to Florida was $84,570,000 annually; whereas in 2004 and beyond the average income out-migration jumped by 77 percent to $149,702,000 annually." So beginning in 2004, according to the study, the Rhode Island estate tax sent taxable income fleeing to Florida. But the Florida estate tax was still in effect in 2004. In addition, the number of taxpayers migrating to Florida increased in the years before that tax was eliminated -- not what you would expect if the estate tax was supposed to be keeping them away. Not only that, during the first year the tax disappeared, the number of people moving from Rhode Island to Florida dropped by 13.6 percent. The decline continued in 2006 and 2007, the last two years examined by the institute. Once again, not what one might expect if the lack of an estate tax was driving movement to Florida. And the average income of people moving to Florida from Rhode Island plummeted by 29 percent after the Florida estate tax was eliminated. It rebounded in 2006 but by 2007, it was 36 percent lower than when the estate tax was in effect. J. Scott Moody, the author of the report and a tax policy economist, offered an explanation. Moody said the rich were moving to Florida in record numbers while the estate tax was still in place in anticipation of its disappearance in 2005. "Moving is not an instantaneous process," he said. "You have to prove you changed domicile and move all your relationships to Florida. That's usually a yearlong process." And once the tax was gone, he said, movement to the state began the steady decline because the rich knew Florida's estate tax was scheduled to reappear in 2010. (It didn't happen.) Thus, his analysis lumped 2004 into the no-Florida-estate-tax category even though the tax was still in effect. We asked Moody if any published study documented this type of anticipatory behavior when it comes to the estate tax. He said he didn't know of any but predicted that it would be proven in the coming years. We have other reasons for skepticism. Moody's study makes an attempt to gauge the different factors that send Rhode Islanders to other parts of the country. It ranks the estate tax at the top; population density is second, and lower income taxes is virtually tied for third place with -- and this struck as particularly odd -- the amount of union membership. It doesn't prove that people are migrating to a state for a specific reason, Moody said, "but people vote with their feet." OSPRI's director of policy and organizing, William J. Felkner, who has called for eliminating the estate tax, was even more direct: "There's no doubt that the estate tax is the most influential." The OSPRI study cites just one scholarly report, coauthored by Moody himself: "The County-to-County Migration of Taxpayers and Their Incomes, 1995 to 2006" by The Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas School of Business. The paper mentions estate taxes only twice, citing other studies. One of those studies says estate taxes can "generate out-migration of wealth." In contrast, the other found that such taxes "appear to exercise no significant influence over state migration patterns." Outside experts we consulted had doubts of their own. One expert was Kail Padquitt, staff economist for The Tax Foundation, a think tank that studies federal and state tax policies, who said he hasn’t seen any proof that the prospect of paying estate taxes drives people to move. "You can see people are leaving a state, but (determining) why they are leaving is hard," Padquitt said. "Florida has sunshine, low taxes and warmth. Why wouldn’t people move there?" In 2006, the National Tax Journal published "State ‘Death’ Taxes and Elderly Migration -- The Chicken or the Egg?" The authors, Karen Smith Conway of the University of New Hampshire and Jonathan C. Rork of Vassar College, found no evidence that the elderly are responding to changes in estate taxes. "We overwhelmingly find no effect of estate taxes once you look over time," Conway told us in an e-mail. Moody said he was unaware of the study. In summary: * IRS data cited by OSPRI shows that Florida was increasingly attractive to Rhode Island taxpayers in the years when it had an estate tax. The flow slacked off significantly when the tax was eliminated. That runs contrary to the trend OSPRI claims to have proven. * OSPRI tries to support its argument by including a year when the tax was still in place. We do not find Moody's "anticipatory moving" explanation persuasive. * OSPRI does not mention other scholarly research reporting that the estate tax has little or no impact on the flow of people from one state to another. Are some of the people moving from Rhode Island because of the estate tax? Probably. Is it "the most significant driver" as OSPRI claims? They could not prove their case. We rule their claim False.

pomt-10364	McCain "hasn't held executive responsibility."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/01/wesley-clark/mccain-ran-a-navy-unit-of-1000-people/	Retired Gen. Wesley Clark threw a rhetorical grenade into the campaign this week with the suggestion that Sen. John McCain's military experience does not necessarily qualify him to be president. On CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Clark praised McCain for being "a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces" and acknowledged the Arizona senator had extensive experience as a member of the Armed Services Committee. "But," Clark said, "he hasn't held executive responsibility." McCain's campaign quickly fired back, mobilizing its "Truth Squad," retired officials who worked with McCain in the Navy or were imprisoned with him in North Vietnam. During a hastily arranged conference call with reporters, Truth Squad members said that they were "shocked" by Clark's criticism and that McCain is well qualified to be commander in chief. Yet Clark, a Democrat who has endorsed Obama, had zeroed in on a weakness in McCain's resume. He served 22 years in the Navy, four in the U.S. House of Representatives and 22 in the Senate, but McCain, 71, has not been a mayor, a governor or a chief executive. The closest he came to such a job was serving as commanding officer of a large pilot training group after he returned from Vietnam. But Clark dismissed that as an inconsequential non-combat assignment. "He hasn't been there and ordered the bombs to fall," Clark said. 'Skipper' McCain's career can be divided into two parts — his Navy service from 1958 to 1980, and his political career from 1982 to today. His political work has been entirely in the legislative branch of government, so — even though he oversees a Senate staff of about 60 — he is a legislator, not an executive. McCain's naval career is legend: He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1958, became a fighter pilot and was shot down over North Vietman, where he was a POW for 5 years. But it was after he returned to the United States, during a less familiar chapter in his life, when McCain served at the air group in the role he now cites as his executive experience. His 13-month command of the Replacement Air Group 174 in Jacksonville shows how he manages and provides clues about what he might be like as president. In 1975, McCain became executive officer of the group, which trained pilots and crew members for aircraft carrier service. The RAG, as it was known, had 1,000 people and 75 planes, which made it the Navy's largest aviation squadron. Eyebrows were raised when he became commanding officer a few months later. Some in the Navy suspected favoritism because he was the son and grandson of famous Navy officers. But according to the author of a McCain biography and three people who served under McCain in the training group, he earned high marks for invigorating a unit that had been struggling with a fleet of broken planes. "He was very inspirational," said Bob Stumpf, a student pilot at the RAG who later became the leader of the Navy's Blue Angel team. "He was just always personally involved in the goings-on of the squadron. He didn't hide in his office." The energetic McCain, known in the unit as "Skipper," frequently stopped by the maintenance shops and pilots' "ready rooms" so he could stay in touch with the people he commanded. A demanding boss Robert Timberg, author of John McCain: An American Odyssey , said the air group was "an enormously large operation" and that McCain was well regarded for his work. Carl Smith, who served as a flight instructor with the group and is now a Washington attorney and lobbyist, said McCain was a savvy manager who got rid of ineffective employees, hired talented people, set goals and kept his workers motivated. "He gave the old crowd a chance to perform. But when they didn't, he fired them," said Smith, who is on the campaign's Truth Squad. McCain inherited a squadron that had many crippled planes because the good ones had been sent on carrier missions. He set a goal of getting them all repaired and, to the surprise of many in the Navy, achieved the goal in just over a year. "He basically turned that squadron around," said Stumpf. Ross Fischer, an instructor pilot in the RAG, said McCain was a demanding boss but gave his staff plenty of authority once he saw they could do the job. More than 30 years after working with him in the RAG, Fischer, Smith and Stumpf are supporting McCain's presidential campaign in part because of what they saw in Jacksonville. Said Fischer of McCain, "He's a born leader." An executive job Clark's larger point is correct: McCain has accomplished a lot in his storied military and political career, but he has relatively little executive experience. But still, Clark, who ran for president in 2004, was incorrect to say that McCain "hasn't held executive responsibility." His tenure at the RAG shows that McCain not only held an executive post in which he managed a staff of 1,000 and oversaw a fleet of 75 planes, but he earned positive reviews for his performance. When McCain departed, the unit was given its first-ever Meritorious Unit Citation. So we find Clark's claim to be False.	None	Wesley Clark	None	None	None	2008-07-01T00:00:00	2008-06-29	['None']
pomt-06710	On disaster aid offsets	full flop	/virginia/statements/2011/sep/02/eric-cantor/cantor-flops-position-disaster-aid-offsets/	When Tropical Storm Gaston slammed into central Virginia in August 2004, U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor went all out to get federal disaster aid for his constituents. The Aug. 30 deluge dumped a foot of rain on the Richmond area in 10 hours, causing floods, landslides and eight deaths. Cantor, R-7th, fired a letter to then-Homeland Secretary Tom Ridge, seeking "immediate action" from Washington. "Time is of the essence and it is important to start working on this matter so my constituents can receive help in this time of need," Cantor wrote. He issued a news release stating, "The magnitude of the damage suffered by the Richmond area is beyond what the Commonwealth can handle and that is why I have asked the president to make federal funds available for the citizens affected by Gaston." Cantor’s efforts helped the region obtain about $20 million in federal disaster aid. Cantor did not share the concern of some Republicans that the relief -- if not offset by cuts to other federal programs -- could deepen the national debt. That October, Cantor was among 127 Republicans who voted against an amendment to an emergency supplemental bill for disaster aid that would have offset any increases in the relief with budget cuts. The amendment -- offered by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas -- was handily defeated. Now, let’s flash forward to 2011 and a new cauldron of disasters. On May 22, a tornado devastated Joplin, Mo., leaving 142 dead. Cantor, now House majority leader, the next day voiced confidence the government would provide ample relief. But he said any supplemental emergency money would have to be offset by cuts to other federal programs. Cantor, during a May 29 interview on "Face the Nation," provided this explanation: "When a family is struck with tragedy, like the family of Joplin ... let's say if they had $10,000 set aside to do something else with, to buy a new car ... and then they were struck with a sick member of the family or something, and needed to take that money to apply it to that, that's what they would do, because families don't have unlimited money. "Neither does the federal government," Cantor said. Cantor made similar comments to Fox News on Aug. 29. That was six days after Cantor’s constituents in Louisa County found themselves at the epicenter of a 5.8-magnitude earthquake. It was two days after Hurricane Irene pelted the East Coast, including Cantor’s district. "Yes, there’s a federal role," Cantor said of disaster relief. "Yes, we’re going to find the money. We’re just going to make sure that there are savings elsewhere to continue to do so." We asked Cantor’s office why the congressman voted against disaster aid offsets in 2004 and supports them today. "In 2004, the national debt was under $8 trillion and was $8.67 trillion when (Democrat) Nancy Pelosi became Speaker," Brad Dayspring, Cantor’s spokesman, said in an email. "Today the debt stands at $14.625 (trillion), meaning that while Democrats controlled the purse strings, the national debt increased by an astounding $6 trillion. That is a sign that we are dealing with a debt crisis and are living in different times. Looking back, the previous Republican majority probably made mistakes by not working to at least try to offset new spending." Dayspring noted that Cantor has often said the GOP lost control of the House in the 2006 elections because the Republican majority "lost its way, particularly on spending issues." He said Republicans regained control of the chamber in last year’s elections by "pledging to be responsible stewards of federal dollars." "People and their families affected by these disasters will certainly get what they need from their federal government," Dayspring wrote. "Is the suggestion that Congress should completely ignore the $14 trillion debt and make no effort to pay for things?" he wrote. "That seems quite extreme." Although Cantor has his reasons, there is no doubt he has changed positions on offsets to federal disaster aid. We rate it a Full Flop.

pomt-00281	"Because of Bruce Rauner, Illinois went 736 days without a budget, delaying funding for schools while local governments were forced to raise property taxes."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/sep/30/jb-pritzker/pritzkers-flimsy-claim-rauner-delayed-school-fundi/	There’s no question Illinois’ record two-year budget impasse took quite a toll. State government between 2015 and 2017 ran up a backlog of more than $15 billion in IOUs to vendors as Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who run the legislature squabbled over how to run the state. That jeopardized social services ranging from domestic violence shelters to mental health care. Higher education also took a hit, as public universities and community colleges laid off thousands of employees and state tuition assistance for low-income students was thrown into limbo. Yet a recent ad by J.B. Pritzker, the Democratic challenger to Gov. Bruce Rauner, assigns unilateral blame for the crisis to the now re-election seeking Republican. It also highlights a different education-themed casualty of the budget standoff. "Want to see what failure looks like?" a narrator asks in the 15-second spot. "Because of Bruce Rauner, Illinois went 736 days without a budget, delaying funding for schools while local governments were forced to raise property taxes. Four years of failure is enough." Throughout all the chaos and uncertainty of those days, Rauner and Democrats in the General Assembly managed to carve out a budgetary oasis for school funding. Multi-billion dollar appropriations for K-12 education became law even while lawmakers and the governor could agree on little else. So what exactly is Pritzker getting at? We decided to check. Supplemental grants vs general aid Pritzker campaign spokesman Jason Rubin pointed to delays that developed during the budget standoff in reimbursements to schools for so-called categorical programs such as special education and transportation. "Bruce Rauner led Illinois to a 736-day budget crisis, jeopardizing school funding in its entirety and making the state late on critical categorical payments to schools," Rubin wrote in an email. "Local governments across the state raised property taxes during this time while Rauner’s administration failed in one of its most fundamental obligations, to fund schools on time." It’s true that hundreds of millions of categorical grant dollars, which supplement general aid from the state, were paid to schools later than usual. Data from the Illinois State Board of Education show categorical payments lagged up to nearly seven months in 2017 as the bill backlog ballooned, compared with three months or less in the years leading up to the impasse. But neither Pritzker’s ad nor the article it cites mention categoricals, suggesting instead that state funding was delayed more broadly. That’s simply not the case. General state aid, which has comprised more than 70 percent of state funding for schools in recent years, continued to be paid on time throughout the budget impasse. By contrast, just 4 percent of Illinois districts relied on categorical grants for more than 10 percent of their funding in the year before the impasse began, state records show. Tax hikes not the first line of defense Pritzker’s attempt to draw a connection between the budget impasse and property tax hikes is also questionable. One key reason is the upside-down nature of school funding in Illinois. Few states contribute a smaller share of overall school dollars to local districts, rendering them highly dependent on local property tax revenues to make ends meet. So it has become almost routine for many local school boards to annually raise their property tax levies to the amount allowed by law. Districts sometimes also hold referendums to ask voters for even more authority to raise property taxes. During the budget impasse, districts that went that route were more successful in getting the okay from voters than they had been for several years prior, according to results catalogued by the Illinois Association of School Administrators. That said, the volume of ballot questions asking voters to raise school taxes was still far smaller during the budget impasse than it had been in previous decades, records show. Ben Schwarm, deputy director of the Illinois Association of School Boards, said it was more common for districts to resort to tools other than property tax hikes to cope during the budget standoff with any cash flow problems caused by delays in categorial payments. "It was much more prevalent for them to cut their budgets and lay off staff," Schwarm said. Local reports from the time show cash-strapped districts resorted to taking out higher lines of credit, selling bonds, cutting spending and drawing on reserves to cover costs as they waited while the state comptroller triaged payments to struggling social service agencies, state vendors and schools. Finger-pointing Finally, there’s the question of blame. There was partisan finger-pointing aplenty during the budget standoff, and Rauner clearly played a significant role. But he didn’t act alone. That’s why we rated a similar claim from Pritzker Mostly False in June. The impasse dragged on because the governor and Democrats in the General Assembly held very different views on a variety of key issues ranging from the management of state finances to a so-called turnaround agenda Rauner said would lead to a more robust economy but critics saw as a thinly veiled attempt at union busting. And while local school districts did face funding uncertainty in the absence of a full state budget, they were largely spared from the broader carnage of the impasse. The possibility that schools wouldn’t open their doors carried substantial political risk for Democrats and Republicans alike, so both sides acted to avoid it. Our ruling Pritzker’s ad says that "because of Bruce Rauner, Illinois went 736 days without a budget, delaying funding for schools while local governments were forced to raise property taxes." The budget impasse did cause state reimbursements for special education, transportation and several other programs to lag. Yet the Democrat’s ad implies a far broader impact on school funding, ignoring that general state aid to fund day-to-day school operations was provided for even while a broad array of spending for other state programs was not. As for property tax hikes, it’s likely that many school districts raised their levies as the broader budget impasse was ongoing. But that is routine in Illinois, a consequence of state policies that foist the lion’s share of responsibility for overall school funding on to local property tax payers. What’s more, the ad blames Rauner alone for the budget impasse that caused the delay. But Rauner and Democratic lawmakers butted heads for two years over spending and policy priorities, meaning he hardly acted alone. There are small elements of truth sprinkled through Pritzker’s ad, but he takes significant liberties in seeking to attach sole blame to Rauner for the budget impasse and then link that to school funding delays and property tax hikes.

pomt-09169	"Handel endorsed gay adoption" in 2003 when she was running for chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/07/nathan-deal/deal-claims-handel-supported-gay-adoption/	Nathan Deal is portraying gubernatorial candidate Karen Handel as out of step with Georgia Republicans because she allegedly supported gay adoption seven years ago. In a statement published in the Rome Tribune, Deal lashed out at Handel for what he says were her positions in her race seven years ago for chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission. Deal’s campaign is quoted as saying: "Actually, 2003 isn't so ‘old,’ and the truth is that Handel endorsed gay adoption when she campaigned for Fulton County Commission chair in 2003 while courting votes and fund-raising." But did she? First, a little primer on Fulton County politics vs. Georgia politics. The gay community is a politically active and powerful force within Fulton County. Much of the community is centered in Midtown Atlanta. Making nice with that community can help you get elected in city and county politics, and both Democrats and Republicans court the gay vote. But in statewide politics the landscape tilts very conservative. What plays well in Midtown often bombs in Marietta and Moultrie. Endorsing gay adoption could demolish a Republican or Democratic bid for any statewide office in Georgia. Handel has steadfastly denied Deal’s allegation and is on the record as an opponent of gay adoption in more recent campaigns. In her successful run for secretary of state in 2006 and in her current gubernatorial bid, she has opposed allowing gay people to adopt children. Indeed, in 2006, she was criticized for that stance in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial that otherwise backed her candidacy. "Although the secretary of state's office has zero influence on legislative policies, Handel’s Web site features her opinions on abortion, domestic partnerships and gay adoptions, all of which she opposes," said the Oct. 16, 2006, editorial. Deal’s allegation is that Handel backed gay adoption when she was running for office at the local level only to flip-flop when she got into the state arena. Deal has also accused Handel of once being a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP gay rights organization. Stay tuned. We will address that allegation in a future PolitiFact Georgia report. For this round, we concentrated solely on Deal’s assertion that Handel had once backed gay adoption. Deal’s campaign strategists base their allegation on a single statement by Marc Yeager, former president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, in the now-defunct Southern Voice, a newspaper that catered to the gay community. In an Aug. 15, 2003, article, Yeager is quoted saying: "We will be continuing our support for Karen Handel. She demonstrated in her last run that she was supportive of domestic partner benefits, and she's supported same-sex adoptions on the basis of the best interest of the child." Enough said. Or so says the Deal camp. "This was announced in a newspaper, and she didn’t ask for a correction because it was accurate," said Brian Robinson, Deal’s communication director. "Karen Handel can’t have it both ways." Handel’s camp said the gubernatorial hopeful never backed gay adoption. "Nathan Deal should put down the gay tabloid and try to find a real source for his false attacks," said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Handel campaign. We tried to contact Yeager numerous times, but he did not return our calls. Yeager’s comment was the only evidence we could find that Handel ever supported that position. Handel’s campaign and a half-dozen people familiar with her positions on gay rights issues in the 2003 race said she never supported gay adoption. State Rep. Jill Chambers (R-Atlanta) said she and Handel visited the Log Cabin booth at Atlanta’s 2002 Gay Pride Festival, as did other local and state politicians. "But neither one of us backed gay adoptions, certainly not publicly. It was not high on the agenda," Chambers said. "We shook hands. We handed out some brochures." Jamie Ensley, the current president of the state Log Cabin Republicans, said Handel spoke to their chapter "many times" during her run for the Fulton County Commission and later for chairwoman. "But gay adoption was never an issue," Ensley said. There is no evidence, other than a passing statement by Yeager in an extinct newspaper, that Handel ever voiced support for gay adoptions. And in subsequent runs for office, she has repeatedly declared she opposes it. There is some smoke here -- a widely distributed publication stated that Handel supported gay adoption, and she never asked for a correction. But the bulk of evidence appears to back Handel’s denial. We rate Deal’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12892	Twenty-seven percent of Californians, almost 11 million, "were born in a foreign land."	true	/california/statements/2017/jan/24/jerry-brown/true-27-percent-californians-were-born-foreign-lan/	In his State of the State Address, Gov. Jerry Brown vowed to defend the protections California affords all immigrants in the state, documented or not, against the Trump administration. "We will defend everybody – every man, woman and child – who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state," Brown said in his speech delivered at the state Capitol in Sacramento on January 24, 2017. Brown added that immigrants are an integral part of California, helping "create the wealth and dynamism of this state from the very beginning." He went on to say "27 percent" of Californians or "almost 11 million were born in a foreign land." We decided to fact-check Brown on those numbers. Our research A spokesman for Brown pointed to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau to back up the statement. The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2015 American Community Survey does, in fact, list California’s "foreign born" population at 27 percent. The bureau defines foreign-born as anyone who is not a U.S. citizen at birth, including those who become U.S. citizens through naturalization. California’s overall population was approximately 39.2 million as of July 1, 2016, according to census figures. Twenty-seven percent of that total would be about 10.6 million people. Brown is on track when he described the figure as "almost 11 million." Hans Johnson, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, told us the 2015 American Community Survey is the best source on the state's foreign born population. In a 2013 study using older data, the policy institute itself reported that 27 percent of California’s population was foreign born, about twice the U.S. percentage. California’s percentage appears to have remained steady in more recent years, according to the 2015 census study. California's foreign-born Forty seven percent of California’s immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens, while about 26 percent had some other legal status, according the policy institute’s report. The study estimates 27 percent were undocumented. So, where do California’s foreign born come from? More than half, or 53 percent, were born in Latin America, while 37 percent was born in Asia, according to the PPIC study. Mexico at 4.3 million, the Philippines at 812,000 and China at 760,000 are the leading countries of origin. The nation’s foreign-born population reached 42.2 million, or 13.2 percent, in 2014, according to the Pew Research Center. That total has more than quadrupled since 1965, though its pace of growth has begun to slow in recent years. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown claimed in his State of the State Address that 27 percent of Californians, almost 11 million, "were born in a foreign land." A 2015 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau verifies that statistic. Additionally, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, which studies the state’s immigration and demographic patterns, confirmed the census report is the best authority on California’s foreign born population. We rate Brown's claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-05699	Says "traffic fatalities have fallen dramatically, even as population has risen. You are more likely to stay alive biking, walking and driving around Portland than you were before" he took over the Portland Bureau of Transportation.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/09/sam-adams/are-portlands-streets-safter-walkers-bikers-and-dr/	After a recent Oregonian article questioned the Portland Bureau of Transportation’s spending priorities, Mayor Sam Adams, who has overseen the department since 2005, wrote a commentary in The Oregonian in his defense. He maintained that while some of Portland’s roads might be pock marked, overall, the streets were safer. "In 2005, as a new transportation commissioner, I decided it was more important to keep drivers alive than totally comfortable on side streets. Together with the Portland Bureau of Transportation, we prioritized road safety over smoothness, improving some of the most dangerous streets and intersections," he wrote. "This strategy is paying off much better than we imagined." The next line really caught our attention: "Traffic fatalities have fallen dramatically, even as population has risen. You are more likely to stay alive biking, walking and driving around Portland than you were before." We wondered if he was right, so we got to checking. Portland’s population has grown over the years. The U.S. Census shows an estimated 537,000 people living in the city back in 2006. The 2010 figure is more than 580,000. That’s more than an 8 percent increase. The real question was whether road safety had really improved during Adams’ time as head of the Portland Bureau of Transportation. Our first call was to the city's transportation department for figures on traffic fatalities and accidents. The first part was the easiest to come by. Spokesman Dan Anderson sent us a graph that laid out the total number of traffic fatalities over the past decade. This includes bike, pedestrian, motorcycle and car fatalities. The numbers bounced around a bit; 47 deaths in 2003 was the high point, while 20 in 2008 was the low. Generally, though, the trend line points downward. During the time Adams has been in charge the figures have fluctuated. In 2007 there were 36 deaths, the next year 20, the year after 33. Again, the trend line ultimately points down, but it’s hardly an uninterrupted decline. We asked the mayor’s office about these figures and received a two-page written statement from spokeswoman Amy Ruiz. She noted that "the six years from 2005 through 2010 were notable for having five of the six lowest numbers of traffic fatalities recorded in a year since 1925." We checked, and they’re correct. But that trend started at least a decade before Adams took control of the bueau: The 16 years since 1995 had 12 of the lowest numbers of traffic fatalities recorded in the same period. The overall decline during Adams’ time in charge was driven almost exclusively by a decrease in motorist fatalities. If you look at the categorized figures, motorist deaths have fallen uniformly since 2005 from 19 that year to 7 in 2010. If you look at other categories, however, such as pedestrian, bicycle and motorcycle deaths, taken together the trend in those fatalities is upward. You might be safer driving, but you’re certainly not safer walking. That’s why we’d asked for the number of traffic crashes -- not just those that resulted in deaths. Those figures didn’t offer much in the way of support for Adams’ statement either. In 2005, there were some 9,660 accidents. That number rose in 2006 to 9,885 and then fell during the next three years. But, in 2010, it popped up again, hitting 10,334. Overall, the trend line there seems to indicate hardly any change at all during Adams’ tenure. We decided we needed a broader perspective on all of this, so we gave the state’s Department of Transportation a call. Spokeswoman Sally Ridenour knew just where to find the stats we were looking for. Since 2005, the state seems to have seen the same general trend that Portland has. The number of traffic accidents jumped slightly in 2006, fell the next three years and then jumped again in 2010, with a total of 44,094 accidents. If you back up and take a larger, longer term look at accidents, the trend is downward for both Portland and Oregon. Unlike Portland’s up and down numbers, the number of deaths statewide -- and this, we should note, is not the same as the number of accidents resulting in a death -- has been on a completely uninterrupted decline since 2005. Never satisfied, we wanted to get an even broader picture. So, we pulled up a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation. That report showed that nationally the number of traffic-related deaths has declined since 2005 as well. Because we can’t get enough of Excel’s spreadsheets, we took this line of thought a little bit further. We calculated the number of deaths per thousand since 2005 in Portland and in the U.S. at large. While it’s true that, as a whole, Portland is safer than the average, it’s also true that the number of deaths per 1,000 people have dropped by about 26 percent both in Portland and nationally. That is to say that Portland is getting safer at about the same rate as the nation. While we were looking through all this data, we found a 2011 article from The Oregonian, which outlines how the Pacific Northwest was leading the nation in this decline. "Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana and Alaska -- the transportation department’s "Pacific Northwest region" -- saw the nation’s largest decrease. Deaths plummeted 12 percent to 1,215, federal officials said in a report (PDF)." In fact, Oregon’s figure for 2010 is the lowest since 1944, according to the report. Naturally, we were a little curious about why this might be happening. We talked to Troy Costales, who heads ODOT’s safety division. He says it comes down to five factors: better engineering on roads and in cars, law enforcement, emergency response and public education campaigns. "In Oregon we've been on a steady decline ever since 1999," Costales said. "We've been out in front." Ruiz said the fact that national and state trends were down didn’t necessarily undermine Adams’ assertions that his focus on safety had resulted in fewer fatalities. "He does not say focusing on safety in Portland resulted in unique traffic safety improvements." That might be the case, but Adams directly links his spending decisions to safety trends. If those trends are happening elsewhere, it’s hard to say just how much of the decline Adams can take credit for. In any case, Adam’s wrote that, despite population growth, fatalities are down "dramatically." "You are more likely to stay alive biking, walking and driving around Portland than you were before" he took over, he wrote. He’s partly right, the number of driver fatalities is trending down down. Pedestrian fatalities, however, during his time as head of PBOT are trending up, as are motorcycle deaths. What’s more, Portland’s figures aren’t exactly unique. Adams statement ignores those details and the larger state and national context. We give this statement a Half True.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2012-03-09T14:43:11	2012-02-28	['Portland,_Oregon']

pomt-11226	"I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/07/donald-trump/donald-trumps-misleading-claim-kanye-wests-praise-/	President Donald Trump, in the midst of a controversial bromance with Kanye West, told a crowd at the National Rifle Association convention that the rapper’s praise had doubled his support among African-Americans in a week. Social media pleasantries between the two men began when West professed his love for Trump in an April 25 tweet in which he referred to the 45th president as his "brother." "We are both dragon energy," West wrote. "He is my brother." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com West later tweeted a photo of himself wearing a Make America Great Again hat bearing Trump’s signature. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com While addressing the NRA convention on May 4, Trump’s remarks veered toward his support among black Americans. "Kanye West must have some power because you probably saw, I doubled my African-American poll numbers," Trump told the audience in Dallas. "We went from 11 to 22 in one week. Thank you, Kanye, thank you." We decided to take a closer look at the numbers. It turns out Trump garbled the results of a real survey that showed a much more nuanced picture. Sample too small Trump appears to have been referencing a Reuters weekly poll that showed his approval rating among black men going from 11 percent for the week ending April 22 to 22 percent for the week ending April 29. So even if you take the Reuters poll at face value, Trump misstated the results. The poll showed Trump’s support doubled among African-American men only, not African-Americans in general. (The poll showed that his approval rating among black Americans overall went from 8.9 percent to 16.5 percent over the same period.) But there’s reason to be wary of concluding, based on this poll, that Trump is enjoying a favorable shift in public opinion among black men. First, the sample size is small. Generally speaking, the smaller a poll’s sample size, the more prone it is to error. And the two weekly polls in question looked only at small slices: The surveys were based, respectively, on feedback from 118 and 171 respondents. According to Reuters’ own polling editor, the sample sizes for this particular poll "were too small to reliably suggest any shift in public opinion." Chris Kahn, Reuters U.S. political polling editor, said the "credibility interval" (which is similar to the more familiar margin of error) was +/- 9 percentage points. So while Trump claimed his approval rating among black men for the week ending April 22 was 11 percent, realistically it could have anywhere from 2 percent to 20 percent. His approval rating the following week for this group was anywhere from 13 percent to 31 percent. In other words, according to Kahn, the polling "leaves open the possibility that his approval also could have dropped in this time frame." Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said news consumers should heed the Reuters polling editor’s cautionary notes. "Most polls do not have a large sample of African Americans, and so we have to be very careful in interpreting the results of any single survey. The margin of error is high," Bowman said. "I would also not rely on a single survey to suggest that something new was occurring." We were unable to find other polls that measured Trump's African-American support on a weekly basis. Online survey Another issue with the poll’s reliability concerns how it was conducted. Rather than calling randomly generated phone numbers, this poll allowed online respondents to opt-in to the survey. In polling terminology, this survey used "a non-probability online sample." As CNN’s director of polling Jennifer Agiesta explained, "those who participated signed up to take the poll rather than being randomly selected," meaning "there could be bias in the sample." Charles Wheelan, a professor at Dartmouth who has written extensively about statistics and public policy, cautioned that online polls are highly vulnerable to "selection bias," whereby the sample of respondents does not accurately reflect a population writ large. "It’s very difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate cross-section using online tools because they are so biased by who is likely to be online and respond to a survey," Wheelan said. Our ruling Trump said, "I doubled my African-American poll numbers. We went from 11 to 22 in one week." Even if you take the Reuters poll at face value, Trump misstated the results. The poll showed Trump’s support doubled among African-American men only, not African-Americans of both sexes. In terms of the poll’s accuracy, Reuters’ own polling chief said the sample size was too small to reliably indicate Trump is enjoying a favorable shift in public opinion among black men. The poll’s reliability is also questionable given online respondents opted-in to the survey, which is less reliable than using a randomly-generated sample. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-14036	"During the (housing) crisis, Catherine Cortez Masto gave a sweetheart contract worth millions to a D.C. law firm that then donated thousands to her political campaigns."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/may/27/freedom-partners-action-fund/ad-attacking-former-ag-gets-details-right-misses-b/	A television ad criticizes Nevada Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto for using her position as the state’s attorney general to benefit her "special-interest allies." Freedom Partners Action Fund, which is backed by the Koch Brothers, is spending $1 million on ads attacking Cortez Masto over a deal she made with Washington, D.C., law firm Cohen Milstein to represent the state in 2009. "Lost homes, lost jobs, lost hope — the housing crisis hit Nevada hardest. But during the crisis, Catherine Cortez Masto gave a sweetheart contract worth millions to a D.C. law firm, that then donated thousands to her political campaigns," the ad says. The ad itself is mostly accurate in describing an arrangement with an out-of-state law firm taking in millions of dollars it won in fighting court cases on behalf of Nevada, while the state’s attorney general received around $2,600 in campaign donations from several of the firm’s lawyers. But there are a few layers of context that need to be unpacked. Contingency fees Cortez Masto has focused her 2016 Senate campaign on her response to the foreclosure crisis. She touts her involvement with large settlements totalling around $1.9 billion for Nevada homeowners suffering after the 2008 economic recession. She wasn’t working alone. While she was attorney general, she arranged an agreement with a powerful Washington, D.C., law firm, Cohen Milstein, in 2009 to assist on deceptive lending practice litigation. The ad takes issue with the contract’s structure — Cohen Milstein would be paid with a contingent fee, only awarded if a settlement they helped litigate was reached. Many states, including Nevada, take advantage of these contracts because they don’t require up-front costs and allow overworked or understaffed state attorneys to bring in ‘hired guns" to take on well-financed private corporate lawyers. Nevada law prohibits employing any outside attorney unless the Attorney General’s office is "disqualified" to represent state interests, but Cortez Masto has argued that the state’s relatively small Attorney General’s office and massive statewide budget cuts necessitated use of outside counsel to help with high-profile litigation against, say, large financial institutions. But use of contingent-fee contracts have recently come under fire, with critics saying the arrangements pervert the priorities for state attorneys general by focusing on cases with a potentially larger payoff than those that serve the public. "This has gotten out of hand," former Massachusetts attorney general Scott Harshbarger told the New York Times in 2014. "And it seriously threatens the perception of integrity and professionalism of the office, as it raises the question of whether attorneys are taking up these cases because they are important public matters, or they are being driven more by potential for private financial gain." Masto did indeed take campaign contributions from six lawyers at Cohen Milstein during her re-election campaign in 2010, nearly a year after the Cohen Milstein contract was approved. The six donated a total of $2,650 to the Democrat, with all coming after the general election. Those donations represented a drop in the bucket for Masto, who raised close to $460,000 through that election cycle. Her opponent, Republican lawyer Travis Barrick, only reported raising $15,000 and lost in a landslide. Do those donations really make Coretz Masto’s arrangement with Cohen Milstein a "sweetheart deal?" Who benefits? The Cohen Milstein contract was certainly beneficial for both the firm and state coffers. But the deal itself was more modest than similar arrangements in other states. The firm helped arrange a separate settlement with Bank of America that netted the state an extra $38 million. Cohen Milstein got $5.6 million in fees. Lawyers from Cohen Milstein didn’t return calls to PolitiFact, but records from the state Controller’s Office show six payments to the law firm totalling around $12.7 million between 2009 and 2014. The Cortez Masto campaign said the firm was hired through a competitive bidding process. The contract itself was approved with no controversy or discussion by the state’s Board of Examiners, which includes Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons. The contract was also designed without a cap on the amount of litigated fees that could be collected, which was criticized by lawmakers who successfully strengthened state law and added more oversight over contracts with outside counsel in 2015. Republican Sen. Greg Brower, who sponsored the bill, said during a legislative meeting that Cortez Masto’s office likely violated state law through continual overuse of contingent-fee contracts. "There is a feeling on the part of many observers that the Office of the Attorney General has been essentially abdicating its oversight and discretion over when and how to settle cases to the private law firms it has hired," he said. Cortez Masto did not start the practice of using outside lawyers. Nevada has historically sought outside counsel on big cases, such as the settlement with big tobacco companies in the late 1990s. Before 2015, the Attorney General’s office arranged the contracts with little outside oversight, but the state generally offered less lucrative rates for outside lawyers than other states. Suits and countersuits The legality of the arrangement with Cohen Milstein has been questioned several times. With the assistance of Cohen Milstein, Nevada sued Florida-based Lender Processing Services in 2009 over questionable practices around mortgage loan documents. LPS counter-sued, claiming that the contract between the state and Cohen Milstein violated state law surrounding hiring of outside counsel. The case went far enough that possible sanctions against Cortez Masto’s office were brought up by a district-level judge and oral arguments were held at the state Supreme Court. The two parties settled for $5.5 million before the state Supreme Court issued a ruling. Major homebuilders Pulte Homes Inc. and Lennar Corp. also filed a lawsuit against the state in 2010 after Cohen Milstein was "deputized" to go after the companies, saying the firm couldn’t represent a separate labor union and the state. The case was later settled with the state receiving $475,000 and Pulte not admitting to any wrongdoing. Even with the new rules, Nevada continues to employ outside counsel for certain high-profile legal challenges. Current Attorney General Adam Laxalt hired another well-known law firm based out of Washington, D.C. — Bancroft PLLC — to represent the state in a lawsuit against the state’s new quasi-voucher program. Our ruling A Freedom Partners Action Fund ad claims Cortez Masto "gave a sweetheart contract worth millions to a D.C. law firm that then donated thousands to her political campaigns." The general contours of the ad are accurate. As attorney general, Cortez Masto entered into a contingency-fee contract with Cohen Milstein for outside counsel on lawsuits filed against companies involved in the foreclosure crisis. She then received campaign contributions amounting to $2,650 from at least six lawyers at the firm — technically this is "thousands," but the ad's vague language overplays the scale of those donations compared to her total haul. We take issue with the ad's "sweetheart" description of the deal, as the firm was chosen through a bidding process that was reviewed and approved externally. Lost in the ad is how the extra help was sought amid budget cuts at the Attorney General's office, and Nevada benefited from the lawsuits. Because some additional context is needed, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Freedom Partners Action Fund	None	None	None	2016-05-27T16:20:48	2016-05-02	['Washington,_D.C.']
pomt-06636	Under President Barack Obama’s jobs bill, states would no longer have to lay off teachers, firefighters and police officers.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/16/david-scott/us-rep-scott-says-jobs-bill-will-save-jobs-teacher/	Even before President Barack Obama officially submitted his jobs bill to Congress, U.S. Rep. David Scott took to the airwaves to sing its praises. Obama’s $447 billion bid to push the economy out of the doldrums is just the thing for the middle class and poor, Scott said Sept. 9 in an interview for local National Public Radio affiliate WABE-FM (90.1). It would help the employed, the unemployed and small business to boot. The bill would even spare the nation’s most beloved public servants from joblessness, Scott said. "This is targeted so that no longer will states have to lay off teachers, and it’s specified in its language," Scott said. "Teachers, firefighters, police officers -- people that we need." Government would "no longer" have to lay off teachers, cops and firefighters? This sounded all too touchy-feely for the hardened skeptics of PolitiFact Georgia. Would the legislation create a U.S. Bureau of Rainbows and Unicorns, too? We called Scott’s office for more information. Michael Andel, his chief of staff, referred us to the language of the American Jobs Act of 2011, which was sent to Congress on Monday. Sure enough, Title II, Subtitle B provides $30 billion for what it calls "teacher stabilization." As the bill says, its purpose is "to provide funds to States to prevent teacher layoffs and support the creation of additional jobs in public early childhood, elementary, and secondary education in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 school years." Title II, Subtitle C provides $5 billion in "First Responder Stabilization," which aims to save jobs for police officers and firefighters. This is how the bill would work, if it passes as written: A state would receive money for teachers based on its population, the bill states. It may keep up to 2 percent of the cash for administrative costs and up to 10 percent for state-funded early learning programs. The rest would go to local districts, which would be required to use it for compensation, benefits and support services needed to keep employees or hire new ones. The legislation bars districts from using the funds for other administrative purposes. States may not use the money to boost rainy-day funds or reduce debt, and they have to agree to keep their education spending at earlier levels. Police departments would get their money directly from the U.S. attorney general. Fire departments would get theirs from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These offices may use $10 million for administrative costs. The White House estimates that the bill, as written, would bring Georgians $956.7 million for up to 12,800 teachers, firefighters and police officers. But does that mean that government will "no longer" have to lay off these public servants? On this point, Scott oversold his claim. First of all, the bill funds teachers only for the next two years. Second, it’s not clear to us that the money would be enough to prevent every teacher or officer from being pink-slipped. Consider teachers. The White House estimates its bill could save or create about 390,000 education jobs across the nation over the two years, according PolitiFact Georgia’s calculations. Each of these jobs lasts one year. It’s not clear whether this will save all the education jobs currently at risk. The White House estimates that 280,000 education jobs are at risk for fiscal year 2012. The American Association of School Administrators estimates that 227,000 school district jobs could be cut in the 2011-2012 school year. We were unable to find estimates for education jobs at risk over the two years in which Obama’s bill is slated to create jobs, so whether they all could be saved is up in the air. (Scott said that "states" won’t have to lay off teachers or first responders. These are typically local jobs, but we won’t penalize Scott for this misstep. State funds can help prop up local jobs, and the jobs plan passes money through the states.) Of course, the bill’s chances are far from assured. Even if it does pass, these provisions could be amended out of it. And state governors could decide to reject the cash. In sum, Scott’s claim has strengths and weaknesses. The jobs legislation does set aside $35 billion for teachers, firefighters and police officers. And it does specify that the bulk of the money go to jobs, rather than administrative costs. This means that even though Scott overstated his claim, the bill is "targeted," as he said, to keep these government employees from being laid off. But the burden of proof is on Scott, and while the money could prevent many layoffs, there’s no hard evidence that governments would "no longer" have to let go of employees. His claim has accurate elements, but it’s overstated and could use more context. We therefore rate his claim Half True.	None	David Scott	None	None	None	2011-09-16T06:00:00	2011-09-09	['None']

pomt-04124	On same-sex marriage	full flop	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/09/kasim-reed/atlanta-mayor-shifts-same-sex-marriage/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed’s recent decision to say "yes" to gay marriage took place after a long and sometimes rocky relationship with the city’s supporters of same-sex marriage. Reed previously supported civil unions -- a position that brought him grief during the 2009 mayoral election. One news account said he drew jeers during a forum hosted by gay political groups, and his support in neighborhoods with large gay populations flagged. The pressure intensified in May when President Barack Obama announced he supported same-sex marriage. In December, the City Council cornered Reed into taking a stand by passing a resolution echoing the president’s position. The mayor had to decide whether to sign it. Reed responded with an enthusiastic "I do." "Loving couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, should have the right to marry whomever they want," Reed said in a Dec. 11 news release. He also announced he would join Mayors for the Freedom to Marry. Certainly Reed’s position has shifted. Some pundits have already labeled it a flip-flop. But we here at PolitiFact have learned that elected officials stake out their positions very carefully. Does his current stance count as a true flip? We took a close look at his track record to find out. First, a quick reminder about the Flip-O-Meter. It makes no value judgment. Some might see a flip as a sign of weakness or political opportunism, but it can also be the outcome of an earnest re-evaluation of the facts. Reed spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs says the mayor’s stance is not a flip. She sent us a long list of his efforts to bring equal rights to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgendered people. "Mayor Reed never championed legislation or policies against marriage equality," Jacobs said in an email. Gay rights supporters agree. They’re a powerful group in Atlanta, which has one of the largest LGBT populations in the country. Local politicians actively vie for their vote. Reed consistently told them that his religious views kept him from supporting same-sex marriage, but they did not recall any instance where he said he opposed it. In fact, they give him credit for his 2004 opposition to Senate Resolution 595, which placed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage on the ballot. It was a bold stand at a time when supporting LGBT rights was a much greater political risk than it is today. The resolution passed the state Senate and House with more than two-thirds majorities. The ballot measure passed with the support of more than 75 percent of Georgia voters. "He really was a quiet player in that fight, as were many members," said state. Rep. Karla Drenner of Avondale Estates, a Reed supporter who led the fight against the amendment. And while a vote against the ban was not a vote for same-sex marriage, the amendment’s defeat would have left the door open to it, said Jeff Graham, executive director of the LGBT rights group Georgia Equality. "In the biggest, most public debate in Georgia, he did vote against putting an amendment on the ballot that restricted rights," Graham said. Reed did take other positions that were supportive of gay rights. For instance, as a member of the state House of Representatives, he supported an anti-hate crimes measure that cleared the General Assembly but was ultimately struck down in court. And for all the complaints Reed received for backing civil unions, he favored unprecedented recognition for same-sex commitments in Georgia. Civil unions arguably provide the same benefits as marriage. This LGBT-friendly track record could lead one to think that Reed’s move from civil unions to same-sex marriage was a subtle shift. But in Atlanta politics, it’s pivotal. Reed’s reluctance to support same-sex marriage could have easily lost him the tight 2009 mayoral race, said Laura Douglas-Brown, editor and co-founder of The Georgia Voice, an LGBT newspaper. He won with a mere 700 votes over same-sex marriage supporter Mary Norwood. Members of the city’s sizable LGBT voting bloc said they abandoned Reed because of his stance, and Norwood trounced him in District 6’s gay neighborhoods. "He felt it had hurt him, but he wasn’t going to change his position because of politics," Douglas-Brown said. Reed’s switch was a momentous shift on a personal level as well. His statements indicate he has been grappling with his convictions for years. After Obama’s announcement, he issued a statement that said he was "still wrestling" with his "own personal beliefs on the issue of (gay) marriage." Our ruling: Before supporting same-sex marriage, Reed was a consistent supporter of civil unions despite intense pressure from LGBT voters. During the 2009 race, he dug in his heels, even though it meant losing the support of this crucial voting bloc. PolitiFact defines a Full Flop as "a major reversal of position." Reed’s change fits the bill.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2013-01-09T06:00:00	2012-12-11	['None']

pomt-00108	"We have the most progressive tax system in the country, right here in Vermont."	mostly false	/vermont/statements/2018/oct/29/phil-scott/are-wealthy-vermonters-paying-their-fair-share-sch/	Gov. Phil Scott said in a debate this month that Vermont’s tax system is the most progressive in the nation. Scott made the claim while criticizing a proposal from his Democratic challenger, Christine Hallquist, who wants to use the income tax to pay for education. Vermont schools are primarily supported by a statewide property tax. Hallquist says an income tax would be a fairer way to pay for schools because it would ensure that wealthy residents pay a more equitable proportion of education costs. Scott countered that "the people I’m talking to think they are paying their fair share and more." "We have the most progressive tax system in the country, right here in Vermont," Scott said. "So I’m not sure how many of these rich people we have left in Vermont because they’re moving out." Is Vermont’s tax system really the most progressive in the nation? Tax policy experts agree that Vermont’s tax system is among the most progressive in the country, but no research concludes that it is the most progressive. In fact, some suggest Vermont trails California and Delaware. And some researchers say that California, which has a much higher income tax than Vermont for those in the top bracket, clearly has a more progressive system. Scott's assertion came from a Vermont Department of Taxes presentation, according to Rebecca Kelley, the governor's spokesperson. At the time, the administration was crafting its proposal restructuring the state’s income tax system to adjust for federal tax changes. The department based its report on two sources: A study from the Tax Foundation and a graph by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The Tax Foundation study, which was published in 2014 and looks at income tax structures across the country, concludes that Vermont, California and New Jersey have the most progressive rate structures "by a wide margin." By two progressivity measures, Vermont falls behind the other states. The first measure looks at where the state’s top tax rate kicks in, an indicator of how much the wealthy residents pay, compared with others. Vermont ranked fifth in this category. The top ranked state, California had a 9.3 percent gap between the two rates: its top rate in 2014 was 13.3 percent, and its rate on those making $25,000 was 4 percent. In Vermont, which ranked third, the top rate was 8.95 percent and the lower rate was 3.55 percent. The second source Kelley pointed to was a graph by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), which compares the top 1 percent and bottom 20 percent of taxpayers in all 50 states. The graph compares how much residents in these two brackets pay in all state taxes, including income, property, and excise taxes. The graph, which relied on data from 2012, shows that Vermont had the second most progressive tax system -- after Delaware. The latest data from ITEP, released in a new report earlier this month, shows that Vermont’s system is the second most equitable in the country, behind California. The bottom 20 percent of Vermonters pay 8.7 percent of their income in state taxes while the top 1 percent pay 10.4 percent. Carl Davis, the research director for ITEP, said he doesn’t believe it would be accurate to call Vermont the most progressive state. California has a much higher top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers, he said. "In our research Vermont does not have the most progressive system in the nation, but it is certainly far less regressive than the vast majority of states," Davis said. Our Ruling Vermont has one of the most progressive tax systems in the country, but no research exists showing that it has the most progressive system. The research the governor’s administration cited does not support the claim, but in several cases refutes it. However, research on the relative progressivity of state tax systems is limited and appears to vary greatly based on methodology. We rate this statement as Mostly False.

pomt-13076	Margaret Sanger "wanted a black Christian leader to be like a Judas goat and lead the blacks to genocide. Remember that? And they picked Martin Luther King as their spokesman."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2016/nov/14/pat-robertson/pat-robertson-absurdly-says-sanger-king-conspired-/	Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson recently said that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. partnered in a conspiracy to promote black genocide. "Margaret Sanger was the head," Robertson said. "She wanted a black Christian leader to be like a Judas goat and lead the blacks to genocide. Remember that? And they picked Martin Luther King as their spokesman." Robertson made the statement on the Nov. 8 broadcast of "The 700 Club," his long-running television show that airs from Virginia Beach. It came during his interview of Wellington Boone, a black Christian minister and author from Duluth, Ga., who shares many of Robertson’s socially conservative views. Both men are unrelenting critics of Planned Parenthood, a woman’s health care organization that is the largest single abortion provider in the U.S. Boone, during his interview with Robertson, accused Planned Parenthood of being in cahoots with "the left" in a plan to slow black birthrates. That’s when Robertson weighed in with his comment on Sanger and King. Let’s unpack it. Sanger In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League to distribute contraceptives and promote their use. The organization changed its name to Planned Parenthood in 1942. Robertson and Boone are hardly first to accuse Sanger of espousing black genocide. The charge initially was made by some African-Americans in the early 1930s who distrusted the efforts by Sanger, who was white, to set up a birth control clinic in their Harlem neighborhood, according to Jean Baker, a Goucher College professor and author of the biography "Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion." Baker, in an email, told us Sanger’s motives at the time were misunderstood and that Sanger was "far ahead of her time in opposing segregation" and "saw birth control as a solution to black poverty." Baker added, "... to not offer clinics to blacks would have been a racist action by a woman who promoted contraception for every woman." But Robertson and many other foes of Planned Parenthood say there’s smoking-gun proof that Sanger had racist intent. They point to a Dec. 10, 1939, letter she wrote to a benefactor discussing her plans to begin The Negro Project - an effort to offer birth control and other social services to Southern blacks. "We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members," Sanger wrote. Baker told us it’s a "far stretch" to interpret those words as evidence of a conspiracy to eliminate blacks. She said that Sanger, sensitive to the criticism she had received in Harlem, concluded that if she was to ease suspicions about her goals in the South - during a time of lynchings and segregation - it was essential to teach black ministers and physicians about birth control and convince them to encourage it. It should be noted that Sanger enlisted two prominent black civil rights leaders to serve on the advisory board of The Negro Project: W.E.B. DuBois and Mary Bethune. It’s hard to imagine either would have joined an effort to exterminate blacks. That brings us to another civil rights leader. King Robertson, you’ll remember, also said that King was the black minister who was chosen to be "spokesman" for Sanger’s efforts. Chris Roslin, a spokesman for Robertson, says the claim is based on a 1966 event. Planned Parenthood that year gave King its Margaret Sanger Award in honor of his support of family planning. King could not attend the event, but his wife, Coretta, showed up to accept the award and read his speech. In it, King wrote: "There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts. She, like we, saw the horrifying conditions of ghetto life. Like we, she knew that all of society is poisoned by cancerous slums. Like we, she was a direct actionist – a nonviolent resister." In other words, King did not regard Sanger as a racist. Sanger, who was suffering from congestive heart failure, did not attend the event. She died four months later. It should be noted that Planned Parenthood started providing abortions in 1970, four years after Sanger’s death, according to Katherine Lozada, a spokeswoman for the organization. They were offered by the chapter in Syracuse, N.Y., after the repeal of a state law that criminalized abortion. Planned Parenthood’s role as an abortion provider took off after the U.S. Supreme Court, in its 1973 Roe v Wade decision, ruled that women have a right to abortions. Sanger, in a 1932 article for The Nation, wrote, "Although abortion may be resorted to in order to save the life of the mother, the practice of it merely for the limitation of offspring is dangerous and vicious." Baker told us that "in time, she became upset by the rise in incidence of illegal abortion and pushed the idea of staff physicians administering pregnancy tests and referring pregnant women to hospitals for ‘therapeutic’ abortions. "Sanger's ideas were changing, but she was always sensitive to the idea because she believed that birth control could effectively prevent conception, and abortion would be unnecessary," Baker said. Our ruling Robertson said that Sanger "wanted a black Christian leader to be like a Judas goat and lead the blacks to genocide. Remember that? And they picked Martin Luther King as their spokesman." His statement twists a sentence Sanger wrote in a 1939 letter - discussing the need to seek the support of black ministers in a program to promote birth control in the South - into a murderous conspiracy. His claim that King became the spokesman for the effort is just as preposterous and rests on a 1966 award the civil rights leader received from Planned Parenthood for his support of family planning.

pomt-11971	90 percent of Americans "support universal background checks" for gun purchases.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/03/chris-abele/do-90-americans-support-background-checks-all-gun-/	In the first hours after the Las Vegas mass shooting, many leading elected officials in Wisconsin issued statements about prayer and condolences, but Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele went further. Abele, a Democrat who holds a nonpartisan office, said in a tweet on Oct. 2, 2017: Americans have overwhelmingly supported common sense gun reform. 90% support universal background checks. Elected officials must act. In 2015, we rated as True a claim that polling showed nearly 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support requiring background checks for all gun sales. The statement was made by Wisconsin state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee. So, what about Abele’s claim about all Americans? The latest polls and our checks with four polling experts indicate support is at 90 percent, give or take a few percentage points. Recent polls Here’s a look at national polls done in 2016 or 2017 on this question. Poll Date Question Percent support/favor Quinnipiac University June 2017 Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers? 94% Washington University American Panel Survey July 2016 Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers, no matter where the gun is purchased? 84% CBS News June 2016 Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers? 89% Morning Consult June 2016 Do you support requiring all sellers to run background checks on anyone who buys a gun? 86%* Public Policy Polling Mar. 2016 Do you support or oppose requiring a criminal background check of every person who wants to buy a firearm? 84% CBS News/New York Times Jan.2016 Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers? 88% *This was a poll of registered voters, rather than simply adults So, the latest poll shows support above 90 percent, while three other recent polls show support between 84 percent and 89 percent. Polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, told us that the wording of questions in national surveys can vary and usually do not use the term "universal." But well over 80 percent, and sometimes over 90 percent, of respondents favor background checks for all gun sales, he said. Polling experts Kathy Frankovic, a former consultant for CBS News, Karlyn Bowman at the American Enterprise Institute think tank and Charles Franklin at Marquette University Law School agreed that such results have been consistent. It’s worth noting that some other recent polls didn’t ask specifically about a background check for every gun sale, but they asked similar questions and got similar results: Pew Research Center (March 2017): "Please indicate whether you would strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks." Favor or strongly favor: 84 percent. CNN/ORC (June 2016): "Would you generally favor or oppose a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony?" Favor: 92 percent. We’ll also note that in July 2016, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said: "Ninety percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales." PolitiFact National’s rating was True. Our rating Abele says 90 percent of Americans "support universal background checks" for gun purchases. "Universal" is the term for background checks to be done on every gun sale. We found support for that policy at 94 percent in the latest national poll. Support ranged between 84 percent and 89 percent in the four other most recent polls. Experts say support at or near 90 percent has been consistent for years. For a statement that is accurate and has nothing significant missing, our rating is True.

pomt-00561	"The profit [from automated traffic enforcement cameras] is going to the private corporations, not to the city or state."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jun/14/hillary-davis/aclu-says-profits-traffic-cameras-go-private-compa/	When is a loss not a loss? When it comes to traffic cameras in Providence. That's one lesson we learned when we tried to fact-check a claim about the cameras that flag cars that run red lights in certain intersections. The assertion arose during a hearing on proposed legislation to expand the use of automated cameras to police speeding in school zones. Legislation authorizing the practice was the subject of a May 6, 2015, hearing by the House Judiciary Committee. The sponsor of House bill 6075, Rep. Robert Craven, D-North Kingstown, told the committee, "This is a bill that not only comes with no cost to those municipalities that choose to use it, but it actually creates a profit center." Not so fast, said Hillary Davis, a policy analyst for the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union. These cameras have been a money-losing proposition for Providence. "The profit is going to the private corporations, not to the city or the state," she said. "In fact, the City of Providence was so behind and lost so much money on the red light camera program that last year the General Assembly had to change the law to say that the City of Providence no longer owed the state the several hundred thousand dollars that it had not paid in the several years of the red light camera program." Because she focused on Providence, we wondered if the red light camera system is, in fact, a money-losing proposition with all the profit going to the vendor. First, some background. Providence's cameras, installed in 2006 and 2007, were meant in part to discourage people from running red lights. By that gauge, they appear to have been successful. The number of tickets issued has decreased in monitored intersections from 15,531 in 2008 to 4,149 in 2014, although some of the decline may be due to the fact some of the cameras have been broken. A police officer reviews the video and decides whether to issue a ticket. The person to whom the car is registered gets the ticket in the mail. If the registrant challenges the ticket, the video is shown in court so the judge can make a ruling. On paper, the revenue from the fines were supposed to be shared by the city, the state and Affiliated Computer Services Government Solutions (ACS), which bought, installed and maintained the cameras. But in practice, things haven't worked out that way. When we contacted Davis, she said that most of her testimony on the economics of the cameras was based on an ACLU report, released in June 2008. She said she later tried to follow up with the city, but didn’t get the information she wanted. The 2008 report itself concluded that since installing the cameras, "the city is actually paying out much more than it is taking in." "Providence’s expenses have exceeded revenue received from the tickets by $749,431, much of which has gone to the private company maintaining the cameras. Including [the] equipment replacement costs adds $223,472 to the City’s expenses over the [first] two years, bringing the City’s total net losses to $972,903 – nearly one million dollars!" the report said. But, it turns out, there were a lot of things the ACLU didn't know at the time and didn't find out until PolitiFact started investigating. Since her testimony, Davis and the ACLU have reviewed some of the additional documents. She now calls the saga of Providence’s traffic cameras a "crazy rabbit hole." That's because, as we now know, while the city was nabbing red-light runners, it wasn't exactly following the legal rules of the road. The explanation has more curves than Route 95 in Pawtucket. So fasten your seat belt. Things are going to get "curiouser and curiouser." Under the city's initial 2004 contract with ACS, the traffic camera company, the city was supposed to pay the company $4,550 per month for each approach to an intersection that was monitored by cameras. The plan was to pay the bill with revenue collected from each ticket. In addition, under state law, the first $35 of each $85 ticket was supposed to have gone to the state. That meant that there had to be 91 paid tickets at each approach before the city could earn enough money to pay ACS. (An approach is any street leading to an intersection with a camera. An intersection could have more than one approach.) Most approaches didn't generate enough tickets to pay the vendor’s full bill. Even in 2008, when lots of citations were being issued, we calculated that only 6 of the 25 approaches were catching enough red light runners to give ACS its full contracted payment. Nonetheless, the city couldn't lose money on the deal because, under the terms of the contract, if there weren't enough offenders to pay the bill for each approach, the city could indefinitely defer its payments to ACS. And if, at the end of the contract, the city still owed ACS, that debt would be automatically forgiven. So contrary to what the ACLU said, the vendor wasn’t getting all of the money. What actually happened was that the city wasn't paying ACS anything at all, at least not initially. The city's 2010 report on the camera system, prepared by ACS, says that the private company was paid nothing in 2006 and 2007, the first two years when the cameras were operating. The report didn’t explain why. When ACS renegotiated its contract with the city in 2008, the city acknowledged that, as of June 30, 2008, it owed ACS $2.05 million. But ACS agreed to take $500,000 and forgive $1.55 million. Even with the $500,000 payment, the 2010 city report says, the city made $1 million over the first five years of the program. But that doesn't reflect reality either. In that 2010 report, submitted to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, the city reports that it had paid the state more than $1.6 million between 2006 and 2010. But it hadn't. It kept the money. By 2013, the amount the city owed the state exceeded $2.2 million, or the equivalent of 62,857 red light tickets, according to city records and spokesman Evan England. What happened next was something the Mad Hatter might have appreciated: A deal was cut. Tucked away in Article 9 of the state's 2013 budget bill was a provision saying that, "no city or town shall be required to make payments to the state in implementing any provision of [the automated traffic violation monitoring systems law] . . . until July 1, 2013." The General Assembly passed it, Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed it and -- Poof! -- the debt was gone. Nonetheless, the city was still on the hook from that day forward. But not for long. The following year, the General Assembly passed legislation, sponsored by five Providence Democrats in the Senate and four Providence Democrats in the House eliminating the requirement that the state get a $35 cut for each ticket issued using an automated camera system, effective July 1, 2015. Meanwhile, the city signed another renewal with ACS (now known as Xerox State & Local Solutions). That new deal, in effect since June 26, 2014, calls for upgrading five existing approaches, installing cameras at 15 new approaches and decommissioning 20 others. It also restructures the payment system. In recent years, with Xerox getting its money and ticket volume down, the camera system hasn't been quite so lucrative for Providence. But that situation is expected to turn around July 1 when the state stops taking its cut. In fact, the city says it expects to get $955,000 in revenue from the cameras during the 2016 fiscal year. We'll see. Our ruling Hillary Davis said, "The profit [from automated traffic enforcement cameras] is going to the private corporations, not to the city or state." In the case of Providence's camera system, which was the focus of Davis' comments, the private corporation has certainly gotten paid something, although it ended up forgiving $1.55 million in debt that Providence owed. The state has also made some money, although only a fraction of what it was entitled to. Remember, the state waived more than $2.2 million it was supposed to get from the city. Providence, the third party in this deal, did very well for itself. Davis and the ACLU have plenty of reasons to question the camera system. But it's clear that all the revenue is not going to the traffic camera company. We rate her statement False -- although she was right about the rabbit hole.

pomt-08128	Cities like Seattle have decided to ban food carts.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/09/randy-leonard/portland-city-commissioner-randy-leonard-says-seat/	In an otherwise humdrum council discussion over dumpsters on sidewalks, city Commissioner Randy Leonard dropped this bomb: He plans to crack down on Portland’s popular food carts by making sure they meet building code. "Some cities such as Seattle have just taken the option of banning them; they don’t allow them," he said at a recent City Council meeting. "We’re trying to find a balance where they can be allowed, but in a safe way and in a way that complies with health safety laws, fire code and building code regulations." PolitiFact Oregon has seen food trucks -- Korean tacos, anyone? -- in Seattle. Heck, here’s an article called "Eight Great Street-Food Vendors in Seattle." So we weren’t sure what Leonard meant by the word "banning." We figured this would be easy enough to check, and in the process, explain a topic of interest to Portlanders and street food fans. What we learned is that Leonard was sort of -- but not quite -- right when talking about our sister city to the north. It’s important to keep in mind that food carts and the larger food trucks are different, even though folks tend to use the words interchangeably. In Portland, the city allows food carts on sidewalks so long as the carts are self-contained, of a certain size, don’t compete with existing eateries and don’t cause a sidewalk jam. Vendors need to get a yearly permit from the city and they’re allowed to sell an assortment of foods, including burritos, soup, sandwiches and Thai noodles. Rich Eisenhauer, the city’s sidewalk management expert, says Portland used to issue about 30 to 35 food cart permits a decade ago; the number has dropped to about 18. Where did they go? Well, the sidewalk carts probably expanded into private parking lots -- and these are the eateries that Leonard is targeting. Food trucks, like the food carts, are licensed and inspected by Multnomah County. At last count, the county had permits on file for 609 food carts and trucks. Now, what about Seattle? Washington state law limits what’s sold from sidewalk food carts -- to hot dogs, popcorn, snow cones, coffee, chestnuts, maybe buttered corn cobs -- but there’s no such restrictions on food trucks parked in private lots. However, unlike in Portland, food trucks don’t stay in Seattle lots overnight. That’s because of state health laws that require trucks to return to an approved commercial kitchen "commissary" every night to refrigerate food, wash dishes, and properly dispose of dirty grey water. Leonard interprets that as a de-facto ban. It should be noted that Seattle is trying to be more like Portland. The city has persuaded the county to consider more than just hot dogs when approving mobile food units, of which there are 137 in the city proper. Also, Seattle Councilwoman Sally Clark is readying legislation to allow food trucks to park on streets and sell directly to customers on the sidewalk. "We’re so good at (regulation) that we have hardly any street food scene here," said Gary Johnson, who is with the city’s Department of Planning and Development. Johnson said vendors in Seattle often travel certain routes throughout the week, settling in a different location every day. He doesn’t expect that to change, given the county’s health regulations. In Portland, we like our food trucks in fixed, predictable pods. Oregon state law allows mobile vendors to handle food and clean up in a commissary, or have sinks and other cleanup facilities on-site. And that’s the problem. Food vendors get too comfortable when they don’t have to move. Awnings go up and seats sprout. As the commissioner in charge of the Bureau of Development Services, Leonard didn’t like that trucks were building decks and patios without proper permits. "We have taken a different view, and therein we have created these permanent establishments, which has caused a lot of angst with restaurant owners and code purists," he said.

pomt-07076	A "substantial number" of probationers participating in a pilot project to ease the farm labor shortage are able to "finish the work."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/27/nathan-deal/deal-says-substantial-number-probationers-hired-sh/	Gov. Nathan Deal’s plan to use probationers to ease the state’s farm labor shortage has farmers wondering whether these new workers can take the heat. Literally. Temperatures soar into the 90’s in Georgia’s fields. Harvesters spend hours in the sun stooping, bending and carrying heavy baskets of fruits and vegetables. Hispanic immigrant workers, some here illegally, usually take on this backbreaking labor, but farmers say they’re leaving the state because of the state’s tough new immigration laws. Probationers taking their place have trouble lasting even one day, according to media reports. WABE-FM (90.1) host Denis O’Hayer asked Deal about the probationers during a June 16 interview. "From a practical point of view, does that say to you that this experiment may not work?" O’Hayre asked. "Well, there’s no question it is difficult and hard work. I think you know that when you get into the field," Deal replied. "But our reports are a substantial number of them were actually able to finish the work." Opponents of Georgia’s recent immigration crackdown often complain that most Americans don’t want or can’t handle field work and other jobs performed by legal and illegal immigrants. So, we wondered, have a "substantial number" of Georgia’s probationers really been able to withstand a full day’s work in the fields? Probationers are offenders who serve their sentences outside of prison. Generally, they must be employed to meet the terms of their probation. The DOC supervises about 8,000 probationers in South Georgia, the heart of the state’s agricultural industry. Some 2,000 of them are unemployed, according to the department. Deal’s pilot program started the week of June 13, soon after a survey by the state Department of Agriculture determined that farmers were short 11,080 workers. By then, the vegetable harvest season was already ending and growers complained crops were rotting in the fields. The pilot program invites low-risk, non-violent probationers to work voluntarily in the fields for $7.25 an hour or more. As of June 20, two farms in Sumter and Colquitt counties have hired probationers as part of the pilot, and the probation office in a third county, Echols, is also participating. We asked Deal’s office for proof that a "substantial" number of probationers finished the work. A spokeswoman directed us to the Georgia Department of Corrections, which has joined with the state departments of Labor and Agriculture to run the pilot project. Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan emphasized the pilot program is just getting started. Many qualified probationers have yet to be told about it, and it’s too early to say how well they fill the state’s farm labor needs. Hogan gave few specifics on worker turnover, saying the numbers are still being collected and reviewed. But she says that when the program began June 13, the number of participants each day was in the single digits. As of June 20, "10, 11 or 12" were showing up for work. During the first week, an average of seven probationers worked each day in Sumter County, Hogan said. An average of five or so were repeat workers. We contacted the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association for more information. Both farms participating in the pilot project are part of the group, which opposed the immigration crackdown. Executive Director Charles Hall stressed that it’s too early to pass judgment on the pilot program. Growers may be unable to tell how well it works until after the fall harvest. "This may be a good alternative. It may be a partial solution," Hall said. "It will take us some time to work through." In Sumter County, the program began Monday June 13, when three probationers showed up for work, Hall said. None of them returned the next day. On Tuesday, two arrived and worked all day. One of them returned Wednesday, and nine new recruits joined him. Six of the 10 probationers who showed up worked most of the day. In Colquitt County, the program started June 18, Nine of 11 probationers made it through the work day, Hall said. Five returned the next day. Since then, Agricultural Commissioner Gary Black has said publicly that the program has had mixed results so far. Black told WXIA-TV 11 and Georgia Public Broadcasting that only two farms had signed up and a number of probationers weren’t returning to work. He remained "cautiously optimistic" the program could be refined for the fall harvest. The Associated Press reported similar problems. Probationers came to work without gloves and other protective clothing. They couldn’t keep up with the Hispanic crews and wilted in the heat. Deal spokeswoman Stephanie Mayfield said that the number of probationers who stick it out still count as substantial. "Given that we aren’t trying to fill all our agricultural labor needs with probationers, the turnout has been substantial for a few farms in South Georgia, and we’re working hard in conjunction with the Departments of Agriculture, Corrections and Labor to expand the program," Mayfield wrote us in an email. Let’s sum up. Deal said "substantial" number of probationers "finished the work," but this claim has serious shortcomings. You could argue that since 7 out of 14 probationers returned the next day for more work, the program had a 50 percent success rate. To some, 50 percent might seem "substantial." The work is difficult and newbies often drop out. But the pilot program was designed to place some of South Georgia’s 2,000 unemployed probationers in the state’s 11,000 empty harvesting slots. Participation rates of potentially eligible probationers is so low that it’s premature, and even bit misleading, to say that "substantial" numbers of probationers have finished the work. "Substantial" numbers of probationers have yet to even participate in the program. Deal was misleading. But we’ll be generous and give him some credit for the fact that half of the pilot’s 14 participants returned to the fields for more backbreaking labor. Deal earns a Barely True.

pomt-15070	Says "the cascading effects" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/23/martin-omalley/fact-checking-link-between-climate-change-and-isis/	"Absurd," "embarrassing," and "brazenly silly" were some of the insults hurled at Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley when he suggested in July that climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS. Despite the derision, the former governor of Maryland continues to stand by his talking point. "One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis," O’Malley told Bloomberg TV on July 20. Two months later, O’Malley repeated his argument in an interview with the progressive radio show Democracy Now! on Sept. 10: "Their government could not take care of the basic needs of families in those conditions. Civil war rose up as a result of protest and repression ... then the vacuum to that led to ISIS. So these are the cascading effects that happen in a world that’s very, very connected and in a world where climate change is now creating extreme weather conditions, prolonged droughts." With recent events -- the pope’s visit highlighting climate change and the United States’ decision to accept more Syrian refugees -- converging on the topic, we were curious if O’Malley’s claim really was "absurd." O’Malley’s source A spokesperson for the O’Malley campaign told us that his source was a March 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, which was well received in its field, does not mention ISIS at all, but its authors told us O’Malley’s extrapolation makes sense. The study found evidence that climate change led to an extreme drought in Syria’s breadbasket between 2006 to 2009. Food prices skyrocketed, nutrition-related diseases became widespread, and 1.5 million internal refugees abandoned their farms and flooded into Syrian cities already crowded with 1.5 million Iraqi refugees displaced by the Iraq war, according to the study. This influx of people exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which failed to respond to the situation, according to the study. In 2011, the unrest reached boiling point and erupted into the Syrian uprising. If we follow the sequence of events like O’Malley does, it’s reasonable to say the next fallen domino is the rise of ISIS. "Once the war had begun all sorts of pre-existing actors took advantage of the situation to pursue their goals -- ISIS was one and the collapse of Syria provided fertile ground for their actions," said co-author Richard Seager, a professor of climatology at Columbia University. O’Malley’s campaign also forwarded us many reports and comments from the Department of Defense linking climate change and ISIS. We should also note that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study is not the first rigorous, academic investigation into the links between climate change and conflict (there’s at least one other on the Syrian conflict alone). Drought’s not the sole culprit In the grander scheme of things, experts say, the drought was just one of many sparks that set the Syrian powder keg ablaze. But both the study and O’Malley acknowledge that and get credit for not overstating climate change’s impact. While climate change may have played an indirect role in the Syrian uprising and ISIS’ rise, other causes – Assad’s recruitment of al-Qaeda members, the genocide against Sunni Arabs, etc.– are direct and "crystal clear," according to Ali Khedery, a former special assistant to five American ambassadors in Iraq. Michael Doran, a senior fellow on Middle East security issues at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, pointed out that unrest in region is not confined to areas suffering from drought. He, however, said that O’Malley’s correct that the drought played a role in generating disaffection. "The drought did not cause the Syrian revolution or the fall of Assad," said Kenneth Pollack, a senior fellow on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution. "A very complex mix of factors did that, but the study suggests that climate change was part of that mix even if we can't tell how important it was." The study, which Pollack said is garnering a lot of attention among Middle East experts, notes that there is no single cause for conflict, while O’Malley emphasized the "cascading effects" of the drought, rather than the drought itself. "It's fair to say the uprising was going to happen at some point. But the drought did happen when it happened and based on the timing of it, the agricultural collapse and the migration were direct results," said study lead author Colin Kelley, a climatologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. "The drought creating this chaotic situation also created better opportunity for ISIS to thrive. If you say that in the way (O’Malley) said, it's fair to argue." Our ruling O’Malley argued that "the cascading effects" of climate change contributed to the rise of ISIS The O’Malley campaign referred us to a credible March 2015 study that supports his point. According to the study, a drought in Syria in the 2000s displaced millions of refugees and added to discontent that eventually erupted into war. While the study does not mention ISIS by name, the authors say O’Malley is simply taking their argument one step further. Experts agreed that the drought, spurred by climate change, was one of many factors that led to the Syrian conflict. O’Malley’s phrasing suggests he understands this and is careful not overstate it.

pomt-06050	"Five members of [the Common Cause Georgia] board accepted maximum campaign contributions."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/12/kasim-reed/mayor-reed-fires-back-watchdog-group/	Under the bright lights inside the Atlanta City Council chamber, a fascinating bit of political theater took place on the first business day of the new year. Mayor Kasim Reed accused a government watchdog group of besmirching his and the city’s reputation and went on a verbal attack against the organization, Common Cause Georgia, during the Jan. 3, 2012, City Council meeting. "Common Cause has so much stain on it that it stinks," Reed said. The mayor said at one point: "Five members of [the Common Cause Georgia] board accepted maximum campaign contributions. The level of hypocrisy is stunning." Reed added, "I’ve got a file of exhibits where I can back up every word." That’s an offer PolitiFact Georgia couldn’t refuse. Common Cause Georgia has criticized Atlanta’s process of awarding businesses the lucrative contracts to open restaurants and shops at the city-run Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The organization has complained the process lacked transparency for the public. Common Cause Georgia wants the city to enact a "pay-to-play" provision that would limit the amount of money people who want to do business with the city can contribute to candidates for public office or elected officials. The group has suggested a limit of $250, but its director told us the limit could be higher, like $500. The following evening, the mayor and Common Cause Georgia Executive Director William Perry had a one-on-one debate about the matter during WXIA-TV’s 7 p.m. broadcast. Reed made similar claims. "He didn’t say that anything I said wasn’t true," Reed said. The Atlanta airport, often touted as the world’s busiest, has been a landing strip for allegations and investigations into corruption there since the 1970s, when then-Mayor Maynard Jackson began an affirmative action contract program for women and minority-owned businesses throughout city government. Several city officials who served under former Mayor Bill Campbell in the 1990s and contractors were sent to prison for bribery convictions involving the airport. Common Cause Georgia pressed Reed to support its proposal on pay-to-play during the 2009 mayor’s race. The group has raised concerns about the recent airport concessions procurement process, approved by the council on Jan. 3, noting that some vendors donated money to Reed and some council members. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the issue on Christmas Day, reporting that some vendors in line to win contracts and their relatives gave about $50,000 to Reed’s campaign. The mayor and his staff counter that the contributions are legal, ethical and have been fully disclosed. Reed’s spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs said the five board members the mayor was referring to at the Jan. 3 council meeting were Sam Bacote, Chuck Clay, Bob Irvin, Lee Morris and David Poythress. Clay and Irvin both served in the Georgia Legislature and ran for Congress. Morris served on the Atlanta City Council from 1993 to 2001 and lost a race for Fulton County chairman in 2006. Bacote lost his campaign in 2002 for a spot in the Georgia Senate. Poythress unsuccessfully campaigned for governor as a Democrat in 2010. "It’s a classic, dirty politics trick," Perry told us about the mayor’s statement. "[Reed is] trying to distract from the issue [of pay-to-play]." Perry said Common Cause Georgia board members are prohibited from running for or serving in elected office; thus, they did not raise money for their campaigns while on the board. Most of the board members who ran for office joined the board the year after their campaigns.One board member, Irvin, joined the board in 2007, five years after his last run for political office. Bacote joined the board in 2005, three years after losing his race for the Senate, according to Perry. Jacobs said some of the men may have had an epiphany about accepting maximum contributions once they joined the board, but it is still fair to point out that they did. PolitiFact Georgia looked at as many campaign disclosure forms we could find for each of those board members. We initially thought Reed was talking about the maximum campaign contributions allowed by state or federal law. Those totals are $1,000 and upward. However, the mayor was referring to $250, which Common Cause Georgia has suggested should be the maximum contribution for people who want to do business with the city. We looked at both amounts. All five board members who previously ran for office received plenty of contributions in excess of $250. Did they receive maximum contributions under state or federal law? Each man did, but the number of donors was far smaller. In the case of Irvin, PolitiFact Georgia found just one maximum donation among his disclosure reports for six years, a $2,000 contribution in 1998 from the National Republican Congressional Committee. Perry, Common Cause Georgia’s executive director, says Reed’s argument against their board is disingenuous because the mayor’s criticism doesn’t highlight the organization’s point about contributions from donors who want to do business with the city. Jacobs, the mayor’s spokeswoman, disagreed. She argued that donors should not be excluded because of their business ties with the city. "You are ruling out a large share of people who care about the community," she said. "Are you saying all of these [donors] have an ulterior motive?" Our conclusion Reed is correct to claim that five Common Cause Georgia board members have received campaign contributions that are the maximum limit suggested by the organization. But the group was talking about something slightly different: a financial limit for contributions from interests doing business with the city. In the case of Irvin, we couldn’t find any maximum donations from contributors doing business with the state or the federal government. We also think it is worth noting that two of the five board members ran for office several years before joining the board. The mayor’s claim leaves out some of those key details. Under our rating system, his statement rates as Half True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2012-01-12T06:00:00	2012-01-03	['None']

pomt-03194	South Carolina has "the fastest-growing economy in the Southeast."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/30/nikki-haley/nikki-haley-says-south-carolina-has-had-fastest-gr/	During an event to launch her bid for a second term, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley touted her state’s economic renaissance. Haley is facing a tough re-election fight despite being a Republican in a solidly Republican state, so convincing voters that the state’s economy is improving a key part of her re-election argument. "We have the fastest-growing economy in the Southeast and we’re not slowing down," Haley said at the Aug. 26, 2013, event, according to the Washington Post. "If you think what we did in the first two and a half years was great, wait until you see what we do next." We wondered whether Haley is correct that South Carolina has "the fastest-growing economy in the Southeast." Looking at the region’s economic growth The hard part about checking Haley’s claim isn’t determining how fast her state and others grew -- it’s determining what counts as "the Southeast." The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the part of the U.S. Commerce Department that tabulates state-level economic statistics, counts 12 states in its southeastern region. They are listed in the following chart, along with the inflation-adjusted growth in state gross domestic product between 2010, the last full year before Haley took office, and 2012, the last full year during her tenure so far. We chose this statistic because several economists said it was the best one to use in evaluating her claim. State Inflation-adjusted state GDP, percentage increase, 2012 over 2010 Alabama + 2.2 percent Arkansas + 2.0 percent Florida + 3.4 percent Georgia + 4.2 percent Kentucky + 3.4 percent Louisiana - 1.2 percent Mississippi + 1.2 percent North Carolina + 3.2 percent South Carolina + 5.0 percent Tennessee + 5.8 percent Virginia + 2.2 percent West Virginia + 5.2 percent So by this measure, South Carolina is close to the top, but not No. 1 -- it trails both Tennessee and West Virginia. But determining what counts as a southeastern state is more art than science. Historically and culturally, Tennessee and West Virginia could just as easily be categorized as Appalachian. In fact, other federal agencies, including the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency, do not count West Virginia as a southeastern state, and the Library of Congress’ guide to American regions doesn’t include a "southeastern" region at all. Given the fuzziness of the concept of "southeastern," we are prepared to give Haley some leeway in determining a definition. Under one definition we find plausible -- former Confederate states that also have a coastline, which would exclude Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia -- Haley’s claim would be correct. One additional issue: When we check a claim in which the speaker either takes credit or casts blame on an elected official, we try to factor in whether that personal credit or blame is deserved. In this case, Haley wasn’t explicitly saying that she was responsible for South Carolina’s region-topping ranking, but it did come during an event in which she sought a second term, based in part on the state’s economic health. Bill Seyfried, a professor of economics at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., said that some of South Carolina’s growth was due to the national manufacturing rebound in 2011 and 2012. "Being a manufacturing-oriented state when manufacturing is growing helped," Seyfried said. Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness said that, in general, "politicians receive more blame and credit for the economy than is often justifiable, and policy tools at the state level are of a much smaller caliber than those wielded at the national level." That said, Snaith said he thought Haley’s statement was reasonably solid. Compared to other economic claims by politicians, he said, Haley’s is "one of the more straightforward." Our ruling Haley said South Carolina has "the fastest-growing economy in the Southeast." Since she took office, South Carolina had the third-highest growth rate among the 12 states that constitute the broadest definition of "southeastern." But in a geographically tighter group of eight states, South Carolina does rank first. On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-06506	"We just can’t afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/12/alliance-americas-future/alliance-americas-future-says-government-cant-affo/	The battle over State Issue 2 -- the referendum on Senate Bill 5 -- has drawn the the attention and money of groups from outside Ohio as well as within the state. Among them is Alliance for America’s Future, a Virginia-based group that supports Republican candidates and conservative causes. Its principals include Barry Bennett, a former top aide to Rep. Jean Schmidt, a Republican from southwest Ohio, and political consultant Mary Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney’s daughter. The group is funding a mail campaign that urges voters to support Issue 2. Voting "yes" for the issue Nov. 8 is a vote to uphold SB 5, which overhauls collective bargaining rules for public employees. A "no" vote is a vote to repeal. The front of the campaign's oversize postcard displays a crumpled dollar bill under the heading "Ohio taxpayers have taken a financial beating." On the back in large type, a headline makes this claim: "We just can't afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits too." For emphasis, "pay 100 percent" is underlined and printed in red capital letters to set it off from the rest of the type, which is black. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. Just as the mailer states, SB 5, among its many provisions, requires public employees to pay at least 15 percent of their health-insurance premiums and it prohibits local governments from picking up any portion of an employee's share of pension contributions. More problematic is the headlined statement: "We just can't afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits too." "In this tough economy," the text continues, "it's just not fair to ask taxpayers to pay even more for salaries and benefits for government employees." Voting yes on Issue 2, it says, "means that government employees will make modest contributions to their benefits" by paying "at least 15 percent toward their health insurance coverage" and "just 10 percent toward their own retirement." Fair enough. We’ll stipulate that the comment about contributions from employees accurately states what employees would pay. And we’ll stipulate that state government and Ohio's hundreds of public employers do not have the budgets to pay 100 percent of employee benefits. But that’s not what Issue 2 is about. If Issue 2 is rejected, that does not mean that government will have to pay 100 percent of the employee benefits. Some public employees -- both union and non-union -- have deals in which the employer pays some portion of the employee benefits contribution. But there is no one norm for Ohio’s 525,000 public employees. Cities like Akron, for instance — where union and nonunion workers alike do not pay for health insurance — could save millions in personnel costs. The city’s tab for health care in 2010 was $23.5 million. If the new law had been in effect, Akron workers would have paid more than $3.5 million of the cost. For the 1,941 workers with health care, that would amount to about $1,800 each. Employees in Avon, on the other hand, already pay 20 percent of their health care costs. So they wouldn’t pay a dime extra for coverage under the law. In a report on benefits titled "The Grand Bargain is Dead," the Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a conservative think tank, said, "State government workers today pay roughly 17 percent of the premium costs for the health care coverage" -- or more than is required under SB 5. There are about 115,000 state government workers . Public workers in Ohio pay an average of 9.5 percent of their health care coverage for a single plan and 10.7 percent for family coverage, according to a State Employment Relations Board report on the cost of health insurance in Ohio’s public sector. In pension funding, state government pays only what is required and does not pay any portion of the employee share. About 6.6 percent of public workers have individual or union contracts that call for the employer to pick up all or part of the employee share, according to a report from the state’s five public pension systems in the Dayton Daily News. So what about the claim -- that "we just can’t afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits." Accompanying language in the flier includes several statements that are mostly accurate. Issue 2 does ask government employees to "share in the sacrifices we’ve all had to make." It does mean "that government employees will make modest contributions to their benefits." The statement, done in large headline type at the top of the flier, is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details needed to put the statement in context. Many governments could not afford to pickup the total bill for health and pension benefits. But few do. Most public employees contribute something toward their health and pension benefits. And even if voters reject Issue 2 and SB 5 is repealed, that doesn’t mean government will have to pickup 100 percent of the costs.

pomt-03172	According to a recent poll, "there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' (health insurance) plans than young Democrats."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/05/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-more-republicans-democrats-have-/	During a speech to support President Barack Obama’s health care law, former President Bill Clinton offered a juicy bit of polling data about one of the law’s provisions -- one that allows young Americans to remain on their parents’ health insurance policies up to the age of 26. He said more young Republicans are on their parents’ plans than young Democrats. Clinton, speaking at his presidential center in Little Rock, Ark., on Sept. 4, 2013, said the option to stay on a parent’s policy up to age 26 is a key element of Obama’s law, because it helps keep younger Americans covered. Some young people, presuming they won’t ever get sick, might otherwise be tempted to skip purchasing insurance coverage altogether. Clinton went on to cite data from recent polling by the Commonwealth Fund showing that "large numbers of young people aged 26 and younger have already enrolled in their parents' plans. And interestingly enough -- if I were you guys, I'd promote this, (saying) these Republicans are the personal responsibility party -- there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' plans than young Democrats." The irony that young supporters of the GOP -- the party that has repeatedly tried to repeal or defund Obama’s law -- are actually using this part of the law more than young Democrats are led to chuckles in the audience. We wondered: Is Clinton’s tidbit correct? We turned to the Commonwealth Fund study in question. The fund is a 95-year-old group that aims to "promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency, particularly for society's most vulnerable, including low-income people, the uninsured, minority Americans, young children, and elderly adults." The fund is nonpartisan but generally seen as supportive of Obama’s law. The fund conducted two polls of young Americans -- one taken in November 2011, the other taken in February and March 2013. Unlike traditional telephone polls, this survey uses Internet respondents drawn from a sample that, by design, closely mirrors the demographic patterns of the population at large. In 2013, the pollsters invited 3,530 adults aged 19 to 29 to complete the 2013 online questionnaire. More than half responded, producing a margin of sampling error of slightly more than 3 percentage points. Here’s a summary of what the pollsters found in 2013 when they asked whether a survey participant age 19 to 25 had, in the past 12 months, opted to stay on or enroll in their parents’ health plan: Party Yes, signed on to parents’ plan No, didn’t sign on to parents’ plan Democrats 45 55 Republicans 63 36 Independents 62 38 So, Clinton was right -- 63 percent of young Republicans, compared to only 45 percent of young Democrats had signed on to their parents’ plan, something they couldn’t have done without passage of Obama’s law. Sara R. Collins, vice president of Affordable Health Insurance for the Commonwealth Fund, provided us with some additional details about the survey. The survey included 1,001 respondents between 19 and 25 who were asked whether they consider themselves Republican, Democrat or Independent. Twenty-eight percent of respondents, or 285 people, considered themselves Democrats, while 26 percent, or 259 people, self-identified as Republicans. Because the question Clinton cited only concerned a portion of the people polled, the answers come with a higher margin of error than the overall poll. Collins said the Commonwealth Fund did not determine a sampling error for this specific question but found the results "statistically significant." Put another way, the results are reliable. "President Clinton’s statement is accurate," Collins said. "The difference between young adults who identify as Republicans and those who identify as Democrats enrolled on their parents' policies is statistically significant in the survey. A greater share of young adults who identify themselves as Republicans are estimated to have enrolled on their parents' plans than did young adults who identified themselves as Democrats." For what it’s worth, the partisan variation was more pronounced in 2013 than it was in 2011. That year, respondents of all three partisan affiliations had much closer rates of signing up for a parent’s plan -- 50 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Independents. Our ruling Clinton said "there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' (health insurance) plans than young Democrats." Polling data from the Commonwealth Fund supports the claim.

pomt-15370	"Less than 1 percent of all the education dollars that we spend are spent on private (school) voucher programs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/02/ted-kanavas/ted-kanavas-says-spending-private-school-vouchers-/	Amid the debate over whether to spend state money to expand the private school voucher program, a former state senator is arguing there is not all that much spent on the program. Republican Ted Kanavas made the comments during a face off with Democrat Chuck Chvala, another former state senator, in the June 12, 2015 episode of the WisPolitics online show, The Insider. "Chuck, this is going to be a great document at the end of the day," Kanavas said of the budget, which is stalled in the Legislature. "They're destroying public education," Chvala said of Republicans. "You know, this is a fun segment, but you know, I can't tell you how much it hurts and how sad it is to see them destroy K-12 education." "Wrong, wrong, and wrong," Kanavas said. One of his rebuttal points: "Less than 1 percent of all the education dollars that we spend are spent on private voucher programs." For all the debate about the voucher program, could funding for it really make up such a small portion of spending? Background Education is the largest line in the state's budget with $5.2 billion allocated in 2014-’15. Wisconsin schools have three basic sources of revenue -- state aid, property taxes and federal funding. The proportion each source of aid makes up varies between school districts. A report from the Wisconsin Association of Schools Boards shows state aid and property taxes each providing about 40 to 45 percent of overall education funding in the state. Federal funding typically makes up 6 to 7 percent. Other sources of funding like ticket sales from sporting events and building rentals comprise the last small portion. The state’s school voucher program allows parents to take the government funds that would be used to educate their child to private school of their choice, including religious schools. We've rated claims about spending on the program before. Opposing claims about per-pupil spending at public and voucher schools made by Gov. Scott Walker and state Rep. Sondy Pope in 2013 were both rated Half True because of the methods used for the comparisons. So how much is really spent on voucher schools? The numbers When we reached out to Kanavas to provide support for his claim, he didn’t respond. But a report from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan scorekeeper, breaks down money allocated in the state budget in recent years. Here's a look at how much the state spent on voucher programs: Fiscal year Choice school funding (in millions) 2011-12 $145.8 2012-13 $157.8 2013-14 $171.9 2014-15 $213 Kanavas was fairly general in his statement saying, "education dollars that we spend." But he spoke in the context of the Wisconsin budget, so let’s start there. By that measure, voucher spending makes up 3 to 4 percent in the last four fiscal years, not close to the "less than one percent" asserted by Kanavas. What if we add in the local money that goes to schools through property taxes? After all, in recent years, the state has restricted property tax increases, so the two areas are connected. Fiscal year Percentage spent on voucher programs 2011-12 1.5% 2012-13 1.6% 2013-14 1.8% 2014-15 2.1% The percentage went down, but not enough to fall below 1 percent. Even if one were to take the most charitable approach to analyzing Kanavas’ claim -- by including money for the University of Wisconsin System, which could be lumped in as "education dollars that we spend" -- spending on voucher schools stays above 1 percent. But the essence of his argument holds up -- the state still targets the vast, vast majority of its education spending to public schools. Our rating Kanavas said, "less than 1 percent of all the education dollars that we spend are spent on private voucher programs." While spending on voucher programs comprises a small fraction of the state education budget, it stays above the 1 percent mark. We rate the claim Half True. Editor’s note: After this item was posted, School Choice Wisconsin President Jim Bender called our attention to two Legislative Fiscal Bureau memos. One sent to Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, estimates $600 to $800 million would go toward the school voucher program over the next 10 years. Another memo, sent to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, says that during the next decade, public schools would receive more than $94 billion of state and local funds. In this scenario, less than 1 percent would be spent on school voucher programs. But in his statement, Kanavas spoke in the present tense, and made no mention of spending over a future decade. What’s more, none of those budgets have been approved and other factors could increase or reduce the figure. Our rating remains Half True.

Second, if you performed a reverse Google image search of the picture Rogers included, you would find that this image, and gimmick, has been used before. The Twitter user @calebproera used the same image in a post Oct. 22. It popped up on a different Facebook timeline with the same message on Oct. 8.

pomt-08883	"We have my opponent Sam Olens to thank for [the Arizona immigration ruling] since he was on the team that got Clinton elected."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/02/preston-smith/olens-deserves-some-blame-immigration-ruling-oppon/	Republican Georgia attorney general candidate Preston Smith said he knows who should share some blame for last week's decision by a federal judge to block key portions of Arizona's new immigration law: Sam Olens, the former chairman of Cobb County's Board of Commissioners. So how did a politician from Georgia play a role in a highly controversial legal case in Arizona that has become a centerpiece in the battle over illegal immigration? Here is Smith's logic: Olens helped get Bill Clinton elected president in 1992. Clinton, a Democrat, nominated Susan Bolton, the Arizona judge who made the ruling on July 28. These are Smith's words from a July 28 news release: "It should be no surprise that Judge Bolton is a Bill Clinton appointee; so in part, we have my opponent Sam Olens to thank for nonsense like this since he was on the team that got Clinton elected." That's ridiculous, says the Olens campaign. "To mention Sam Olens' name in relation to Judge Bolton's ruling is comical at best," said Sheri Kell, a spokeswoman for Olens. Olens and Smith are locked in the Aug. 10 runoff for the Republican Party's nomination for attorney general. For weeks, Smith has tried to convince Republican voters that Olens is no true conservative. During one debate, Smith said Olens was part of the Clinton campaign. His evidence? A 1992 Marietta Daily Journal article that reported Olens was a member of a group called the Cobb Chapter of the Clinton for President Committee and treasurer of the Cobb Democratic Party. Kell said Olens was erroneously listed as a member of the committee. Marietta Daily Journal editorial page editor Joe Kirby, who wrote the article in 1992, told PolitiFact Georgia that Olens never protested the article's accuracy. A 1997 Atlanta Journal-Constitution article noted Olens was treasurer of Cobb's Democratic Party nearly seven years before that. Thomas Thrash, who was Cobb's Democratic Party chairman in 1992, asked Olens to be the party's treasurer, Kirby said. Thrash is now a federal judge in Atlanta. Olens said he considered himself a political independent around that time and sometimes voted for Democrats. Olens says he "matured" and he found himself aligned with Republican Party's principles. Olens ran as a Republican for the Cobb County Commission in 1998 and later as chairman, Cobb election officials said. There's no record of him ever running as a Democrat. Bolton's decision Wednesday delayed provisions requiring immigrants to carry their papers and banned illegal immigrants from soliciting employment in public places. Whatever Olens did to assist the Clinton effort, it didn't seem to help much in Cobb. George H.W. Bush trounced Clinton by a 20-point margin in Cobb, Georgia Secretary of State records show. Clinton did carry Georgia, narrowly defeating Bush by a margin of less than 1 percent. Clinton nominated Bolton as a U.S. district judge in Arizona in July 2000, his last full year in office, after being re-elected in 1996. Multiple media sources report Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona recommended to Clinton that he nominate Bolton. Kyl released a statement disagreeing with the court ruling. Adam Clemons, a campaign spokesman for Smith, defended his candidate's claim in an e-mail to PolitiFact Georgia. "It is a verifiable fact that Sam Olens worked to get Bill Clinton elected, which led to the appointment of activist judges, such as Judge Bolton and others, that strike down constitutionally sound, politically popular legislation like the Arizona law, based on their personal views," Clemons wrote. Clinton won the presidency in 1992, but it doesn't look like any efforts in Cobb County helped. Clinton lost the county by a wide margin, so we think it's a major stretch to say "we have Sam Olens to thank" for Clinton getting elected. Keep in mind that presidential terms are four years, so Clinton had to be re-elected in 1996 in order to nominate Bolton in 2000. Clinton lost the state of Georgia in 1996 by 1.2 percentage points. PolitiFact Georgia finds Smith's statement verges on the ridiculous. We don't see how he connected the dots to conclude Olens had a role, in part, in Bolton's appointment.

pomt-01512	A Scott Rothstein victim says that he was "swindled" by Charlie Crist.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/sep/22/rick-scott/ad-promote-rick-scott-rothstein-investor-says-he-w/	A TV ad released by the Republican Party of Florida has created major buzz in Florida’s political world. The ad featured an unidentified man who said he was swindled by Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein -- and, by extension, by former Gov. Charlie Crist, who is now a Democrat and seeking to unseat Florida Gov. Rick Scott. "Scott Rothstein swindled a lot of people, me included," the unidentified narrator said. "He bankrupted many families. Nobody was closer to Rothstein than Charlie Crist. Rothstein was always around Charlie, throwing parties and giving Charlie money. Rothstein bragged that he gave Charlie Crist money so he could pick judges. Of course Charlie took the money. I got swindled by both Rothstein and Charlie. If Charlie Crist will sell judgeships, everything is for sale." The ad -- which has run at least 4,000 times at a cost of about $2 million -- includes photos of Rothstein and Crist embracing each other and blowing out the candles on Crist’s 52nd birthday cake. (Technical note: The ad was released by the state Republican Party, but it is on Scott’s behalf. Scott’s campaign has been defending it and he initially referred questions about the ad to his campaign. So that's why we're putting Scott on the Truth-O-Meter.) PolitiFact Florida has previously fact-checked two claims related to Rothstein, who began a 50-year prison sentence in 2010 for convictions related to a $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme that involved the sale of fabricated legal settlements. But Scott’s charge that Crist "swindled" an investor is new -- and represents a serious charge. Crist unveiled his own counter-attack that calls the ad a lie and recounts Scott’s $1.7 billion Medicare fraud related to his days as CEO of a health care company. We decided to put it to the Truth-O-Meter. We’ve relied heavily on the work of Miami Herald political writer Marc Caputo and federal courts reporter Jay Weaver. On Sept. 16, Caputo and Weaver broke the story that the investor was Dean Kretschmar of Fort Lauderdale. The investor’s lawsuit didn’t mention Crist Kretschmar was part of an investor group known as Razorback that invested with Rothstein. On or around June 2009, Kretschmar invested $8 million, according to the lawsuit Kretschmar and other investors filed in November 2009. The lawsuit named several defendants, including Rothstein and TD Bank, the banker for Rothstein’s law firm. Crist’s name isn’t mentioned in the lawsuit. The group sought $190 million and settled for $170 million with TD Bank, the Herald reported. The newspaper reported that Kretschmar recouped most of his investment. Unmentioned in the ad is that Kretschmar’s lawyer is William R. Scherer, a Scott donor. Earlier this year, Scott’s office hired Scherer’s law firm to sue Digital Domain, a digital effects company that had animated the scenes in Titanic and the Transformers movies. Under Crist, the company received $20 million from the state but in 2012 shut down its Florida operation and declared bankruptcy without creating the hundreds of jobs it had promised the state. (Scherer told the Herald the point of the ad was that Crist took Rothstein’s money — about $81,000 for Crist’s unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in 2010 — at the same time that Kretschmar was being ripped off. But none of that is explained in the ad.) Kretschmar has given about $19,000 to state and federal GOP candidates and committees, including -- ironically -- $500 to Crist when he ran for governor as a Republican in 2006. Scott’s response The pro-Scott ad’s backup cites several articles about Rothstein’s court testimony earlier this year in a case involving a former employee of his law firm. Rothstein testified that he bought Crist’s judicial picks, but did not mention Kretschmar. During a campaign stop in Miami, Scott told the Herald’s Caputo that his ad wasn’t intended to say that Crist was an active participant in the fraud; rather, it was intended to be more metaphorical, equating Crist’s political flip-flops with Rothstein’s swindles. From the Herald: "This individual was a victim of both Scott Rothstein and Charlie Crist. Both of them promised things, and they didn’t come through," Scott said. "Charlie said he was a Ronald Reagan Republican. He was against tax increases. He was against raising your tuition. And he did both," Scott said, repeating variations of this argument when reporters sought clarification. "Charlie was a Republican and then an independent then a Democrat." Scott campaign manager Melissa Sellers cited a list of political positions that Crist has flip-flopped, such as gay marriage. PolitiFact has confirmed a number of such flip-flops. But none of these flip-flops are remotely connected to Rothstein’s criminal acts. And Merriam-Webster's online dictionary defines "swindle" as "to obtain money or property by fraud or deceit," a definition that doesn’t extend to policy flip-flops. (The Florida GOP isn’t giving up on the "swindle" argument -- a new web ad released on Sept. 22 says "Crist swindled Florida. Swindled his own supporters. Swindled voters with promises made and promises broken." That ad focuses on Crist’s flip-flops and doesn’t mention Rothstein.) Sellers also argued that "no one ever said Crist was not part of the Rothstein investigation." The campaign points to a January 2012 article in the Miami Herald about charges pending for others involved in Rothstein’s scheme. (So far, there have been more than 20 separate convictions.) The article included information from Rothstein’s 10-day deposition in a civil case, in which an attorney asked Rothstein if he "conned" or "‘fooled" a list of big-name national politicians, including GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain. Rothstein testified that he "fooled" them all. Rothstein was then asked by an attorney whether he "fooled" Crist or former U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla. The Herald wrote that "Rothstein was not allowed to answer the questions about the two Florida politicians because of objections raised by the lead federal prosecutor in the criminal case, Lawrence LaVecchio, who cited 'investigatory privilege.' Legal experts said LaVecchio objected because his team is still investigating political donations that Rothstein and other members of his firm made to their campaigns." Rothstein testified this year in a separate criminal case involving a former employee that Crist made judicial appointments in return for Rothstein’s donations. But the Herald reported in September that federal investigators examined Rothstein-related donations to Crist in 2010 and have found no evidence of wrongdoing and are not actively investigating the charge. A Republican Party of Florida television ad from August asserted that Rothstein "gave hundreds of thousands of campaign cash to control Crist’s appointments of key state judges." Rothstein and his firm donated to Crist and RPOF -- in addition to a long list of politicians and candidates from both parties. Crist appointed Rothstein to serve on a commission that recommended appeals judges, but he was only one of nine votes. To say that Rothstein controlled the appointments is an overstatement, which led us to rate that claim Half True. Our ruling A TV ad by Scott quotes a Rothstein victim who says that he was "swindled" by Crist, but that’s a gross distortion. Kretschmar was swindled by Rothstein, but the ad provides no evidence that he was "swindled" by Crist as well. Scott and his campaign argue that the comparison between the "swindles" by Rothstein and Crist is metaphorical, with Crist having "swindled" voters by changing his positions on political issues like same-sex marriage. However, the way the accusation was framed in the ad leaves viewers with the impression that Crist was part of Rothstein’s criminal Ponzi scheme -- he was not. The ad’s equation of the two is ridiculous, so we rate the claim Pants on Fire!	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-09-22T11:01:09	2014-08-27	['Scott_W._Rothstein', 'Charlie_Crist']

pomt-13531	Lee Zeldin "missed 2/3rds of Veterans Affairs Hearings"	false	/new-york/statements/2016/aug/30/anna-throne-holst/zeldin-attended-some-hearings-dccc-says-he-missed/	U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a freshman Republican from Long Island, sits on the Veterans Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives. But he’s barely seen, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In an article from Newsday, a DCCC spokesman accused Zeldin of missing two-thirds of the Veterans Affairs Committee's hearings. His Democratic opponent for the 1st Congressional District seat, Anna Throne-Holst, tweeted a jab at Zeldin based on the DCCC charge. "No Show Zeldin continues to miss work, missed 2/3rds of Veterans Affairs Hearings," her tweet read. She linked to the article in the tweet. Zeldin’s office says he attended nearly three-quarters of the meetings held by the committee and subcommittees to which he belongs. So, who’s right: Zeldin or Throne-Holst and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee? We checked transcripts and webcasts to find out. Checking attendance The initial reply from Zeldin’s office cited his attendance at both hearings and markup sessions. During hearings, lawmakers listen to witnesses testify. In markup sessions, lawmakers meet to amend a bill. So the back and forth between Throne-Holst and Zeldin when the story first broke refferred to two different sets of numbers. We based our analysis on Zeldin’s attendance at Veterans Affairs hearings, since that’s the charge that Throne-Holst and the DCCC made. The committee has held 56 hearings since Zeldin took office and joined the committee in 2015. Zeldin’s office said he attended 36 of the 56 hearings. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said he attended 20. To verify attendance at hearings, you can check the official transcript or watch the webcast of the hearing. A hearing’s transcript includes an attendance record. But it takes time for transcripts to be available. When the DCCC made its claim in early August, the most recent official transcript was from a hearing on June 10, 2015. So only four of the 16 disputed hearings have transcripts available. Zeldin is marked as present in two of the official transcripts for meetings that the DCCC charged him with missing. In another transcript, Zeldin was not listed as present when his office said he was there. How many hearings did Zeldin attend? Verifying Zeldin’s attendance at the other hearings meant watching the webcasts. So that’s what we did. In the webcasts for 13 of the hearings. Zeldin is either heard voting or seen in plain view in five of the hearings the DCCC charged him with missing. We did not find Zeldin in eight of the hearings his office said he attended. That does not mean he wasn’t there. Zeldin’s seat is on the outside of the dais, which is sometimes cut off from the camera’s view. We found proof from transcripts and webcasts that Zeldin attended at least 28 of the 56 hearings. Our ruling The DCCC and Throne-Holst claim Zeldin missed two-thirds of the Veterans Affairs hearings. We found through webcasts and transcripts that their claim doesn’t add up. Zeldin attended at least seven hearings the DCCC claimed he missed. Zeldin attended at least half of the hearings. He did not miss two-thirds of the hearings. We rate this claim from Throne-Holst and the DCCC as False.	None	Anna Throne-Holst	None	None	None	2016-08-30T22:00:00	2016-08-09	['None']
pomt-06098	Says a new national poll shows "the majority of the American people believe we should have a gold standard" for U.S. currency.	false	/texas/statements/2012/jan/04/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-majority-americans-favors-gold-stand/	After his third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses Jan. 3, 2012, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, told supporters that his campaign has been propelled by the issues he champions, including slashing government spending, abolishing the Federal Reserve System and withdrawing from Afghanistan. Paul also said that "today there was a national poll that came out and they were talking about how many people supported the gold standard. How long has it been since they've taken a national poll on the gold standard? And guess what? The majority of the American people believe we should have a gold standard and not a paper standard" for U.S. currency. Really? First, let’s discuss what the gold standard is. Here’s a June 23, 2011, summary from the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan office that provides information to Congress: Today, "the U.S. monetary system is based on paper money backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. The currency is neither valued in, backed by, nor officially convertible into gold or silver. Through much of its history, however, the United States was on a metallic standard of one sort or another." The pure gold standard ended in 1933, CRS said, "when the federal government halted convertibility of notes into gold and nationalized the private gold stock." Remnants persisted until the early 1970s, but then disappeared. Advocates have continued to push for reinstatement of the gold standard, in part to constrain inflation and shore up the dollar’s value. Ralph J. Benko, a senior adviser for economics with the group American Principles in Action, which favors a return to the gold standard, wrote in a blog post earlier this year that "the value of the dollar has eroded by some 95 percent from the day my father was born until today. For the most part it has been a slow process of erosion rather than a dramatic event. That said, history records that the gold dollar held its value – over centuries — and under the gold dollar, history records that … the economy grew, on balance, more steadily and robustly than it has since the last remnants of the gold standard were repudiated." This view is hardly universal among economists. Critics say that switching back to the gold standard would be impractical and unwise and potentially limit a government's ability to deal with recessions and depressions through monetary policy. We'll leave the policy debate to others. What we're fact-checking is whether there’s as much public support for the idea as Paul claimed. When we asked Paul’s campaign to point us to the survey showing national interest in restoring the gold standard, spokesman Jesse Benton pointed us to a column by gold standard supporter Benko and Andresen Blom, executive director of American Principles in Action, that appeared in the Jan. 3, 2012, edition of the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. The column mentions three surveys conducted on behalf of their organization by the Polling Co. Inc., a Washington, D.C., firm. The polls surveyed likely Republican primary voters and caucus-goers in states whose voters act first in choosing delegates for the presidential race -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. "Fifty percent of New Hampshire voters favor the gold standard, with more than half of those favoring it ‘very strongly,’" Benko and Blom wrote. Similar polls in Iowa and South Carolina found support for the gold standard at 57 and 51 percent. We asked American Principles in Action for the full data on New Hampshire, which they provided. The poll of 500 likely Republican primary voters had a margin of sampling error of 4.4 percent. It asked, among other questions, "Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of returning the U.S. monetary system to the gold standard?" The poll found that 29 percent had a "very favorable" opinion and 21 percent had a "somewhat favorable" opinion, for a total of 50 percent. Majorities in the Iowa and South Carolina polls also supported the idea. So Paul is correct on the number -- but way off on the description. This was not a "national poll" that shows that a "majority of the American people believe we should have a gold standard." Instead, it was three polls in three states, with respondents from only one party -- and even among this narrow sample, it only asked those who are active enough politically to be considered likely to participate in the upcoming primary. The survey was also commissioned by a group that supports the gold standard. And what about national polls? There was one, but it doesn’t perfectly support Paul’s thesis. Rasmussen Reports took a national poll of 1,000 likely voters Oct. 18 and 19, 2011, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Rasmussen found that 44 percent of likely voters had a favorable impression of returning the U.S. monetary system to the gold standard, or, broken down, 15 percent very favorable and 29 percent somewhat favorable. That’s closer to the majority mark, but it’s worth noting a few qualifiers. Among pollsters, Rasmussen, which describes itself as nonpartisan, has a reputation of producing polls that skew Republican. In addition, this poll was of likely voters, which uses a smaller pool of respondents than the default method, which is to poll all registered voters. Most significantly, 44 percent isn’t a majority, though Rasmussen did find that 57 percent of likely voters agreed with the gold standard after they were asked this follow-up question: "Many say that adopting the gold standard would dramatically reduce the power of central bankers and political leaders to steer the economy. If you knew that returning to the gold standard really would reduce the power of central bankers and political leaders to steer the economy, would you favor or oppose returning to the gold standard?" However, framing the question like that is hardly a neutral wording of the question. Jeff Bell, the policy director of American Principles in Action, told us that the Rasmussen poll does not show there’s a national majority in favor of the gold standard. Bell told PolitiFact that those in favor amount to "a plurality of the voters as a whole, unless you ask modifying questions, which aren’t completely kosher in national polling." When we told Benton, Paul’s spokesman, that the polls to which he referred us were of likely Republican primary voters in particular states -- not a national poll -- he said of Paul’s caucus-night comment, "Relax, dude, it was a rally speech to supporters, not a major policy speech or a debate." Our ruling Paul says "the majority of the American people believe we should have a gold standard and not a paper standard." But the polls his campaign cited to back up that claim surveyed likely Republican primary voters in three states -- not voters nationwide. The one national poll that addressed this question found 44 percent in favor of a gold standard, and that isn’t a majority. On balance, we rate Paul’s statement False.

pomt-07826	"Over the last two years since President Obama has taken office, the federal government has added 200,000 new federal jobs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/15/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-200000-new-federal-jobs-have-spr/	In a Feb. 15, 2011, press conference, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said that "over the last two years since President Barack Obama has taken office, the federal government has added 200,000 new federal jobs. And if some of those jobs are lost in this, so be it. We're broke. It's time for us to get serious about how we're spending the nation's money." A few readers asked us whether Boehner was right about the number of new federal jobs, so we checked into it. We turned, as we always do, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official statistician for the United States labor force. BLS calculates two categories that illuminate Boehner’s comment. The first is the overall rise in federal employees between January 2009 and January 2011. The net increase was 58,000. The second is the number of federal employees without counting U.S. Postal Service workers. Over that same two-year period, the increase was 140,800. Both of those numbers are lower than the 200,000 figure Boehner cited. We also checked with John M. Palguta, vice president for policy with the Partnership for Public Service, a non-profit that promotes government service, and he confirmed our general conclusion using numbers from a different database. He dug into the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s on-line federal workforce data source, "FedScope." He found that in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, respectively, the federal government filled a net 59,995 and 47,062 new permanent, full-time, non-seasonal, non-postal jobs. Combined, that means that federal employment rose by 107,057 jobs -- well short of 200,000. We checked with Boehner’s office to see what his statement was based on. Aides said they had used figures from December 2008 to January 2011, which produced an increase of 153,000 federal, non-postal jobs. Then they factored in, on a discounted basis, the temporary jobs required to carry out the 2010 Census. According to the Census Bureau, such temporary employment peaked at 585,729 in early May 2010. "We think 200,000 is probably generous to the White House," said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. In previous fact checks, we have rejected the idea of adding temporary Census workers to federal job totals. While the statements we rated previously aren’t structured in exactly the same way as Boehner’s, we think the general principle remains valid -- that when you’re counting the rise or fall in the number of federal workers over a long period of time, it’s cherry picking to count the creation of temporary jobs but not their elimination. All told, we find that Boehner’s 200,000 number is way off. We rate it False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2011-02-15T18:23:10	2011-02-15	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-15085	"There's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/18/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-legality-birthright-citizenship-not/	With illegal immigration zooming to the top of the Republican presidential primary agenda, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is taking aim at the concept of "birthright citizenship" -- the notion that someone born on United States soil automatically qualifies for U.S. citizenship. During the second GOP debate held at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., one of the CNN moderators, Jake Tapper, asked Paul, "Where do you stand on the issue of birthright citizenship?" Paul referenced the 1898 Supreme Court case United States vs. Wong Kim Ark. "The case that was decided around 1900 was -- people had a green card, were here legally, and they said that their children were citizens," Paul said. "There's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens. So it hasn't really been completely adjudicated." We wondered whether Paul is right that "there's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens." The Wong Kim Ark case Wong Kim Ark, a laborer, was born in 1873 in San Francisco. His parents were of Chinese descent but lived legally in the United States. Around age 17, he left for a temporary visit to China, and returned to the United States without incident. Then, around age 21, he left again for a visit to China, but at the end of that trip, he was denied re-entry to the United States because the collector of customs argued that he was not a U.S. citizen. (This was no small distinction -- it was the era of anti-immigrant strictures known as the Chinese Exclusion Acts.) The Supreme Court framed the case this way in its majority decision: The question presented by the record is whether a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States by virtue of the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." The majority ruled that Wong -- and others born on United States soil, with a few clear exceptions -- did indeed qualify for citizenship under the 14th Amendment, which reads in part, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States." The majority wrote: The Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes. The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States. So what does this mean for Paul’s claim? He is right that the facts of Wong Kim Ark didn’t concern illegal immigrants who had a child while on U.S. soil. Rather, Wong’s parents were in the United States legally when he was born. "Sen. Paul is correct," said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University law professor. "Wong Kim Ark was a child of parents who resided legally in the United States. The Supreme Court has not ruled explicitly on a citizenship case involving children born in the United States to undocumented parents." How much do the facts of the Wong Kim Ark case matter for the future of birthright citizenship? In the debate, Paul essentially argued that because the 1898 Supreme Court case didn’t directly address birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, that issue remains to be fully adjudicated. That argument is much more controversial. One scholar who supports Paul’s view is John C. Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University. Without getting too far into the weeds, Eastman and others who share his view see the 14th Amendment phrase "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States as pivotal. In a recent article, Eastman decried "widespread ignorance about the meaning of the word ‘jurisdiction.’ " Eastman wrote that undocumented immigrants, like foreign tourists, "are subject to our laws by their presence within our borders, but they are not subject to the more complete jurisdiction envisioned by the 14th Amendment as a precondition for automatic citizenship." For this reason, Eastman argues, the ruling in Wong Kim Ark "does not mandate citizenship for children born to those who are unlawfully present in the United States, and it does not even mandate citizenship for those who are visiting the United States temporarily but lawfully." However, a majority of legal scholars said Paul’s focus on the facts of this particular 1898 case leaves out context. They argue that the majority’s ruling offered a ringing endorsement of birthright citizenship -- a stance that runs contrary to the idea that the justices intended to hand down a carefully restrained and limited decision. "In Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court relied on common law, going back to cases decided in England before the American Revolution, to hold that any person born on U.S. soil and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is a U.S. citizen," Yale-Loehr said. "I am confident that if a case arose involving a child born in the United States to undocumented parents, the Supreme Court would rule the same way." Scholars who share this view add that the Supreme Court has had ample opportunity to overturn its precedent in the succeeding decades but has never done so. Finally, these scholars say, more than a century of longstanding practical precedent should also count for something. This is not simply a standoff between left-leaning and right-leaning scholars. John Yoo, a conservative University of California-Berkeley law professor, has taken a high-profile stance against the position Paul articulated. "The Court read the 14th Amendment to recognize the existing American practice of granting citizenship based on birthplace," Yoo wrote. "It saw no support for a new exclusion of the children of aliens, (writing) ‘The Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens.’ " Eleanor May, a spokeswoman for Paul, stood by the senator’s claim. "There is a difference between 'adjudicated' and 'longstanding legal consensus,' " she said. "Has the case been completely adjudicated? No. " Our ruling Paul said "there's never been a direct Supreme Court case on people who were here illegally, whether or not their kids are citizens." Paul is right that the landmark Supreme Court case on this issue didn’t address the specific example of a child born to undocumented immigrants. But he ignores the sweeping language in support of birthright citizenship in the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the fact that the ruling continues to stand more than a century later, and the longstanding practice of granting citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants. His statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2015-09-18T14:12:05	2015-09-16	['None']

pomt-11041	"There isn't a system" for reuniting families separated under Trump’s zero tolerance border policy.	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/29/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-right-there-was-no-plan-reuniting-fa/	Following the initial uproar over President Donald Trump’s zero tolerance border policy, the focus shifted from the administration’s separation of families, to questions about what it was doing to put families back together. Media reports highlighting immigrants’ often fruitless attempts to reunite with relatives depicted a federal government ill-prepared to put thousands of parents back in touch with their children. "There isn’t a system," Rachel Maddow said June 21. "There isn’t a database … connecting the parent from whom the kid was separated, and the kid from whom the parent is separated." We wanted to see if this was true. As it turns out, immigration experts, multiple government officials, a Republican-appointed federal judge and countless reports of immigrants struggling to find loved ones all point to the absence of a federal government system for reuniting families separated under Trump’s border policy. Trump’s zero tolerance policy First, let’s recap the Trump border policy that set things in motion. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a "zero-tolerance" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution. A good number of these people have been adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. As a result, under Trump’s policy, more than 2,000 kids have been placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter pending release to a legal guardian. Facing intense political pressure, Trump issued an executive order on June 20 that instructed immigration authorities to keep families together during their legal proceedings, within existing legal and resource constraints. It was not clear how or if the order would affect children already separated from their families. We reached out to the White House and Department of Homeland Security to ask about what system was in place, if any. We heard no response. Crucial disconnects Immigration experts we spoke to highlighted crucial disconnects among federal agencies tasked with carrying out Trump’s family separation policy. Any workable system for family reunification, experts said, requires coordination between three offices: Customs and Border Protection, which apprehended and separated families, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which received children, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which detained parents. "While we don’t know what conversations were occurring internally," said Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, "there is just not evidence of planning and coordination to address how parents would know where their children were, how they could communicate, and how reunifications would occur." Louis Desipio, a political science professor at UC Irvine who specializes in immigration, said it’s likely that senior civil servants anticipated the problem, but lacked authority to pump the brakes on Trump’s aggressive policy shift to put an administrative structure in place. "I don't believe there was a system in place when zero tolerance was implemented," Desipio told PolitiFact June 27. "I haven't seen any evidence that they have improved the system in the past week or so." Trump administration officials acknowledged that reunifying families was being done on the fly, months after the zero tolerance policy was announced. As Steven Wagner, a Trump appointee at Health and Human Services told the Washington Post June 19, "This policy is relatively new, and we’re still working through the experience of reunifying parents with their kids after adjudication." David FitzGerald, who co-directs the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, put it this way: "The ‘zero tolerance’ policy was implemented with zero planning for putting families back together again." Federal judge: Government tracks property better than migrant kids Amid an international outcry over Trump’s border policy, a lawsuit against the administration brought by a separated family percolated through a federal court in San Diego. During a hearing, Judge Dana Sabraw of the Southern District of California repeatedly pressed the government’s lawyer on whether there was any system in place for keeping separated parents and children in contact. According to Politico, the judge "sounded skeptical about the government’s stance," citing an apparent lack of communication among key agencies on how to reunite families. On June 26, Sabraw, a George W. Bush appointee, issued a blistering ruling against Trump’s family separation policy. Sabraw found "there was no reunification plan in place," and ordered a preliminary injunction requiring the federal government to reunite children younger than 5 with their parents within two weeks, and return older children to their parents within 30 days. "The government has no system in place to keep track of, provide effective communication with, and promptly produce alien children," Sabraw wrote. "The unfortunate reality is that under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property." HHS Secretary testimony at odds with first-person accounts Hours before the federal court order, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar appeared before the Senate Finance Committee. The hearing was ostensibly about prescription drug pricing, but quickly veered toward Trump’s border policy, with Azar playing down concerns about the administration’s handling of separated families. "There is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located," Azar told the committee. "I've sat on the (Office of Refugee Resettlement) portal with just basic keystrokes, within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent." Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the Trump administration was giving deceptively "rosy answers" and told Azar, "Suffice it to say, portals are not part of the daily existence for these people." Azar countered that the Office of Refugee Resettlement has an 800 number to connect family members. A Health and Human Services spokesman told us that unaccompanied children are also assigned case managers to help located families. Yet reporting from the Washington Post, New York Times, New Yorker and other firsthand accounts showed the shortcomings of the existing infrastructure. Attorneys described cases where clients were never told about the 800 number, calls rang with no answer, and instances where officials on the other end "refused to offer details of where children had been taken." Adults in detention claimed wait times of a half-hour, and no ability to provide a call-back number. Parents who were already deported discovered the 800 number often doesn’t work abroad, or is prohibitively expensive. When children were located, the federal government would not provide transportation, even if the child has been relocated to a shelter or foster home on the other side of the country. In the absence of a federal system, an ad hoc network of attorneys and aid workers is scrambling to reunite families. Maddow, in her June 21 broadcast, cited a New York Times article that quoted Anthony Enriquez, the director of the unaccompanied minors program for Catholic Charities. (Maddow did not respond to our request for comment.) "There is no system whatsoever to track these family separations, no efforts systematically to reunite these families," Enriquez said. "There is no supervisor, there is no database saying, ‘child here, parent there,’ so they can come back together." During the Senate hearing, Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow said the more than 60 migrant children in Michigan foster homes have been unable to connect with their parents. "As of my last contact with the agencies, they did not know, they were not given any information up to this point about where the parents are," the senator said. "And there was not communication going on in terms of what's happening for these children." The Trump administration has ushered in a partial fix, of sorts. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it would temporarily stop detaining adults who arrive with children, citing workload burdens, and two key agencies said on June 23 they would increase coordination. But the joint policy announcement makes clear the federal government’s beefed-up approach to family reunification applies only for the purpose of deportation. "There is still no commitment to reunification for all families," said Greenberg, of the Migration Policy Institute. Our ruling Maddow said, "There isn't a system" for reuniting families separated under Trump’s zero tolerance border policy. Crucial disconnects exist among key agencies tasked with implementing Trump’s family separation policy. Administration officials have acknowledged the lack of preparation. A Republican-appointed federal judge who ordered the government to reunite families found there was no reunification plan in place. Media reports have documented the government’s limited existing infrastructure, as a grassroots network of immigration attorneys and aid workers struggle to reunite families.

pomt-01562	"(Obama's) entire national security team, including his secretary of state, said we want to arm and train and equip (Syrian rebel forces), and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/11/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-barack-obama-went-against-nationa/	President Barack Obama spoke from the White House on Sept. 10 to announce his overall strategy for dealing with the growing regional threat presented by the terrorist group the Islamic State. Part of that includes asking Congress to authorize funds to arm Syrian rebels. After, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had a terse exchange with former White House Press Secretary-turned-CNN contributor Jay Carney. McCain has supported arming Syrian opposition forces for years. "I'm astounded that Mr. Carney should say that the Free Syrian Army is now stronger," McCain said, referring to moderate rebel fighters revolting against Syrian President Bashar al Assad. "In fact, they have been badly damaged." Carney responded, "That's not what I said, senator. What I said is that we know a great deal more about the makeup of the opposition." The back-and-forth continued. Carney eventually said, "I think we have to agree to disagree on this." But McCain wasn’t done. "No, no, facts are stubborn things, Mr. Carney, and that is, his entire national security team, including his secretary of state, said we want to arm and train and equip these people, and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down," McCain said. "Facts" are stubborn, but they also get misconstrued. Is that the case here, or is McCain accurately retelling history? Mass protests broke out in Syria in March 2011 against Assad, a powerful dictator, as the Arab spring continued to spark unrest in the region. Over the next two years, the situation in the country would escalate dramatically, with Assad turning his army on his own people and Syrians in turn taking up arms against the regime. McCain and some of his congressional colleagues called for Obama to arm opposition groups, but the administration rejected those options. McCain’s office noted that in February 2013, outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs, testified at a Senate Armed Services Committee that they supported a proposal to arm some rebels. "Did you support the recommendation … that we provide weapons to the resistance in Syria?" McCain asked. "Did you support that?" "We did," Panetta replied. "You did support that," McCain said. "We did," Dempsey added. Until that point, those divisions between Panetta and Dempsey and the White House were not public. And they likely only emerged because Panetta was on the way out after serving four years in the administration. We learned more about this debate from another former member of the national security team, Hillary Clinton, thanks to her memoir Hard Choices, which recounted her time as secretary of state. In the book, Clinton said she was reluctant to support efforts to arm Syrian opposition forces. She was reminded of the Afghan fighters who, armed with American guns to take on the Soviet Union, went on to form al-Qaida. But in late-summer of 2012, she came to support a proposal put together by CIA director David Petraeus to provide some arms assistance and training to vetted groups so the United States would have an ally on the ground. "The best I could say for it was that it was the least bad option among many even worse alternatives," she wrote. Obama, however, wasn’t convinced. "He worried that arming the rebels was not likely to be enough to drive Assad from power and that with all the weapons already flowing into the country from Arab nations, our contributions would hardly be decisive," she said. In summary, the plan to arm rebels had the support of the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the CIA director and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That’s a pretty convincing argument for McCain. But Clinton goes on to note that, "Despite high-level support from the National Security Council, some at the White House were skeptical. After all, the president had been elected in large part because of his opposition to the war in Iraq and his promise to bring troops home." McCain said the "entire National Security Team" supported arming the rebels, but Clinton notes there was division within some quarters of the White House. Whether McCain exaggerated his point comes down to how you define the national security team. McCain’s spokesman said, "The Senate-confirmed heads of the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and uniformed military are generally considered a president's national security team." But the White House told PolitiFact that on "his national security team are also numerous members of the (National Security Council) staff, like the deputy national security advisors, for example." The National Security Council also by law includes the vice president, and meetings are regularly attended by the Secretary of the Treasury and the national security adviser, as well. Who is right? Both, said Dan Mahaffee, director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. Mahaffee said the members of the group McCain is referring to are generally called the "principals" who make up the core of the national security team. But other advisers, including those mentioned by the White House, are often powerful cogs in those meetings as well. President George W. Bush, for example, delegated a lot of national security authority to Vice President Dick Cheney, Mahaffee said, while President Richard Nixon made National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger his point man for those discussions. "There are two columns you put these people in," Mahaffee said. "The ones empowered by law to give advice, and the larger, more informal staff that is equally if not more weighty in this administration." We don’t know what side many of those players fell on during the debate. The White House told us, "We don’t discuss the details of our internal deliberations." Our ruling McCain said Obama’s "entire national security team, including his secretary of state, said we want to arm and train and equip (Syrian rebel forces), and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down." Obama did go against the advice of four key players on his administration’s National Security Team, including Clinton (secretary of state), Petraeus (CIA director), Panetta (defense secretary), and Dempsey (chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff). We also know from Clinton’s book that there was "high-level support from the National Security Council." There’s an element of uncertainty that Obama went against his "entire" team. We don’t know the positions of many of his advisers during those deliberations, including Vice President Joe Biden and his national security adviser. Their opinions are strong voices on Obama’s team. We rate McCain’s statement Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2014-09-11T18:13:59	2014-09-10	['Syria', 'Barack_Obama']

This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump on Oct. 4, 2015, why he told a New Hampshire crowd he would send refugees back to Syria should he win the presidency. Trump had previously said he would accept some Syrian refugees for humanitarian reasons. "The migration was strange to me because it seems like so many men," Trump answered. "There aren't that many women, there aren't that many children. It looked like mostly men and they looked like strong men. These looked like physically strong people. And I'm saying, ‘Where are all the women? Where are all the children?’ " Stephanopoulos told Trump that half the refugees are children, which led the billionaire to shift gears and question why the United States was planning to take in so many refugees. Trump’s description of Syrian refugees as not being many children and women didn’t sound quite right to us, so we decided to check out it out. It appears Trump was confusing his talking point over a couple of different issues. Registered refugees vs. sea arrivals In the interview, Trump started talking about how he heard America was accepting 3,000 refugees, then 10,000, and "now I hear we want to take in 200,000." Trump said, "We don't know where they're coming from, we don't know who they are. They could be ISIS. It could be the great Trojan Horse. I mean this could be one of the great Trojan Horses ever since the original." His campaign did not get back to us to clarify his remarks, but to us and experts we consulted, his answer sounds like he had a different refugee population in mind altogether. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps spread over several nations, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to numbers we accessed on Oct. 4, the total comes to more than 4 million. Of those 4 million, 50.3 percent are female, and 51.1 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger. In all, only 23.5 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the U.N. were men older than 18. So that settles that argument, right? Not really. Geoffrey Mock, Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, says Trump’s anecdote may have been referring to Europe’s mass influx of refugees and migrants, not the U.N.-registered refugees in camps that Stephanopoulos was asking about. "This is a complicated issue, and Trump is right to my mind on a few points, but he’s messing up situations, confusing them terribly so his overall point is way off base," Mock said. Trump likely meant so-called "sea arrivals," refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The U.N. counts almost 534,000 people who have crossed into Europe this year, with almost 3,000 dying during the journey. To Trump’s point, 69 percent of sea arrivals are men, and these are the people dominating headlines about the humanitarian crisis in Europe. Of those 534,000, about 55 percent of them are from Syria. The rest are from across Asia and Africa, from places like Eritrea, Afghanistan and Sudan. These people are not the same as Syrians in registered refugee camps. But as Trump warned, some do claim to be from Syria and are not, and many are indeed undocumented, experts told PolitiFact. But the problem with Trump’s statement is that none of the majority-male refugees and migrants in Europe are coming to the United States. Refugee resettlement We can’t confirm where Trump got his 200,000-refugee number, but it may refer to Secretary of State John Kerry’s announcement in September that the U.S. would accept 85,000 worldwide refugees in 2016, up from 70,000. In 2017, that number would expand to 100,000, for a total of 185,000 refugees over two years. To add another wrinkle to Trump’s already confusing claims, those won’t all be Syrian refugees, but rather refugees from all over the world. Kerry did say some of the expansion was to accommodate Syrians, but there was no indication how many. The U.N. has said 10 percent, or about 400,000, of the Syrian refugees in camps need to be resettled. President Barack Obama announced that in fiscal year 2016 (through Sept. 30), the United States would accept at least 10,000 refugees from Syria. Those 10,000 aren’t necessarily the type of people who would be ISIS operatives as Trump fears, according to Mock. "The priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and teens on their own, and women and children at risk," Mock said. The people selected undergo screening by state agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. The process can take years. That doesn’t make for an efficient method of terrorizing the United States, Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow Daveed Gartenstein-Ross said. While it’s a legitimate concern that there are ways of beating the screening process, he said, there would be more efficient ways for ISIS cells to reach America than what Trump is fearing. "Instead of sitting around hoping you win the refugee lottery and then wait years, then pass the screening to get to America, it would be much easier for a terrorist group to send a person through Europe or put them onto an airplane to the United States," Gartenstein-Ross said. "If they could otherwise pass the refugee screening process, they could certainly get on an airplane." Moreover, the scenario Trump paints doesn’t hold up to scrutiny once you take into account that it misrepresents the parties involved. "When Trump raises concerns about photos of young men among the refugees who have made it to Europe, this has absolutely nothing to do with the Obama-announced resettlement program that will draw upon the population identified by the U.N. as being the most vulnerable among the 4 million Syrians in their refugee camps, all of whom are identified and registered," Mock said. Our ruling Trump said "there aren't that many women, there aren't that many children" among Syrian refugees. It appears Trump is conflating two different sets of refugees: Those 534,000 reaching Europe by sea, who are mostly men, and the 4 million Syrians in U.N. refugee camps, most of whom are women and children. Only about 10,000 refugees in the camps are slated for resettlement in the United States over the next year. Those making the perilous trip to Europe are not. The priority refugees from this group would be torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, unaccompanied children and teens, and women and children at risk. Those factors, coupled with background screenings, suggest they would likely not be ISIS operatives waiting to terrorize the United States. Trump's assessment of the refugee situation is badly mangled. We rate his statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-10-04T18:57:05	2015-10-04	['Syria']

pomt-07726	"There are nearly 500,000 registered sex offenders across the country and at any one time about 100,000 are unaccounted for."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/03/peter-palumbo/palumbo-says-there-are-500000-registered-sex-offen/	For several years, state Rep. Peter G. Palumbo has worked to revise the way Rhode Island registers and monitors convicted sex offenders. This year he introduced legislation to consolidate the state’s sex offender registry under the supervision of the state police and revamp it to comply with federal guidelines. A General Assembly news release announcing the new bill cites the reason such legislation is needed, attributing the statement to Palumbo: "Across the nation, there are nearly 500,000 registered sex offenders and at any one time about 100,000 of them are unaccounted for. As long as there is one sex offender out there that we cannot account for, there is the potential for great harm, the potential for another victim." We wondered if that many sex offenders were really missing, so we asked Palumbo where he got those figures. He cited one source: The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, a nonprofit based in Alexandria, Va. According to its annual report, the center was created by Congress in 1984, following the highly publicized disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City. The center created a national missing children’s hot line and serves as a clearinghouse for information on missing and exploited children. It also collects data twice a year from every state on registered sex offenders. Carolyn Atwell-Davis, the center’s director of legislative affairs, says the group arrives at its figures by calling law enforcement officials in each state and requesting the totals. It uses the information to periodically publish a national map showing the number of registered sex offenders in each state. Using similar data, and what it calls conservative estimates, the center tallies offenders who are unaccounted for. Atwell-Davis said the number of registered sex offenders, based on the most recent survey, in December, is actually 728,435 -- 46 percent more than the number Palumbo cited. Atwell-Davis said the last time the total number of sex offenders nationally was close to 500,000 was about 2002. The group’s estimate of the number of unaccounted for is 100,000 -- a number that hasn’t changed in years. NCMEC receives nearly $50 million annually in government grants and charitable contributions to fight child pornography, track sex offenders, maintain a missing children’s hot line and train police and prosecutors. Its data on sex offenders are cited routinely by politicians and the Justice Department. Because Palumbo’s underlying point is that a substantial number of registered sex offenders is missing, we decided to examine that premise. First, we checked Rhode Island, where the sex offender registry lists 569 offenders. Of that total, 119 are so-called Level 3 offenders, who have been convicted of sexual assaults, child molestation or kidnapping a minor. Ten of those were identified as being deported, moved out of state, incarcerated out of state or whereabouts unknown. Another 225 are so-called Level 2 offenders, those who had committed less serious felony sex offenses. A total of 12 were identified as whereabouts unknown. So, 22 of the 569 registered offenders in Rhode Island are unaccounted for -- about 4 percent. We checked with some neighbors. One problem is that many use different criteria in entering offenders on their registries. Connecticut, for instance, does not have tiers of offenders. All are lumped together, for a total of 5,279. Rather than having various categories of missing, public information officer Lt. Paul Vance says the state uses a category of "not in compliance." That includes everyone from those who haven’t supplied their addresses to those who have fled. The total is 372 or about 7 percent. New York State identifies 31,972 offenders in three tiers. But only 490 are identified as location unknown. That is 1.5 percent of the total. Massachusetts has a total of 8,166 registered sex offenders. Those who haven’t properly registered or who are otherwise unaccounted for are termed violators. As of Wednesday, there were 227 violators - or less than 3 percent. We aren’t the only ones wondering about NCMEC’s numbers. Jill Levenson, chairwoman of the Department of Human Services at Lynn University, in Boca Raton, Fla., has been studying sexual offender registries, with other researchers from the University of Massachusetts, the University of California and the New Jersey Department of Corrections. She disagrees with the number of 100,000 "missing" offenders reported by NCMEC. Levenson said the highest number her group could determine was 17,688. "When they (NCMEC) say missing, part of the question is what does that mean?" said Levenson. She said her group found many of the "missing" were homeless, in transit or simply the result of data entry errors. A study of the Florida registry found nearly a third of the people listed had died, moved or been deported. Levenson said she feels it’s important to make the proper data available so that resources may be allocated most efficiently to deal with social problems such as sexual offenses. She argues the current emphasis on "publicly identifying and tracking known offenders may do a disservice to the public, since over 90 percent of sexually abused children are victimized by someone well known to them with no previous sex crime record, not a stranger found on a registry." We asked Atwell-Davis about Levenson’s conclusions. As for the missing offenders, Atwell-Davis said, "We’ve always said that was an estimate and that it was conservative." She said several studies suggest the true number is higher. For example, she said she believes California is missing 20 percent of its offenders. The official figures from California, as of March 1, are 71,803 registered offenders, with 17,544 in violation of the registration law. That is 24 percent. Atwell-Davis said she believes the discrepancy is due to the fact that Levenson gets her figures from public registries while NCMEC gets data directly from law enforcement agencies in each state and territory. "We don’t want to create fear where it is unnecessary," said Atwell-Davis. "We believe it is important for communities to have good information." So where are we? * The 500,000 figure Palumbo cites for the total number of sex offenders in the United States was, by NCMEC’s count, off by more than 228,000. The last time it was 500,000 was nine years ago. * If NCMEC’s numbers are accurate, the ratio of unaccounted for sex offenders nationwide is 1 of 7, not the 1 of 5 Palumbo’s statement suggests. * NCMEC’s numbers are in dispute. A team of academics says they’re substantially overstated. Data from Rhode Island and nearby states supports that view. Clearly, when even one registered sex offender is missing, that’s a serious problem -- a problem Palumbo is trying to fix. But public officials owe it to their constituents to get the facts right when they’re trying to address such issues. Palumbo’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- the PolitiFact definition for Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01891	"Justin Amash is rated Michigan’s No. 1 conservative" by National Right to Life.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/07/justin-amash/justin-amash-says-pro-life-group-rates-him-top-m/	The common narrative in the ongoing battle for control of the Republican Party usually involves a grassroots conservative challenging the GOP incumbent in a primary. We’ve seen it already this cycle in Virginia and Mississippi. But the storyline comes with a twist in western Michigan, where Rep. Justin Amash, a tea party favorite, is the one facing a tough test from establishment-backed candidate Brian Ellis. With a significant lead in the race, Amash is on the offensive with a new ad that looks to bolster his conservative credentials while attacking the record of his opponent. "Justin Amash is rated Michigan’s No. 1 conservative," the narrator says, while the names of several groups pop across the screen: National Right to Life, Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. FreedomWorks and Club for Growth have consistently backed Amash. But where does Amash stand with the anti-abortion National Right to Life? Will Adams, a spokesman for Amash, pointed us to the National Right to Life Committee’s legislative scorecard for the 113th Congress (i.e. since 2012). The group tracks votes important to their cause and rates lawmakers on how they vote. The pro-life committee says Amash is 4 for 4, so 100 percent. But, as we learned, that’s only part of the story. First, if this is the measure by which "Michigan’s No. 1 conservative" is determined, then Amash is in an eight-way tie with all of Michigan’s Republican congressman. Each of them also received 100 percent on their National Right to Life scorecard. Second, if we go back to the scorecard from the previous Congress, Amash actually had one of the lowest ratings in the Republican caucus. On 10 votes, Amash received a negative score on three votes supported by the National Right to Life Committee — two for voting present, one for voting against the legislation. Only six Republicans scored lower. Amash, who says he is 100 percent pro-life, explained many of those votes on his Facebook page, where the two-term congressman almost always describes his position on legislation. Two of the votes, which went toward legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, Amash was against because it didn’t strip funding from all abortion providers. He voted present. "Legislation that names a specific private organization to defund (rather than all organizations that engage in a particular activity) is improper and arguably unconstitutional," Amash wrote. "Moreover, the legislation is easily thwarted because the organization may simply change its name." On the third item, an amendment to ban sex-selective abortion, Amash voted "no." He said the bill "criminalizes the motive for getting an abortion. In other words, it keeps all abortions legal except those obtained for the ‘wrong’ reasons." These explanations did not appear to appease the National Right to Life Committee, which favored all three measures. In 2012, Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the group, told the evangelical newspaper The Christian Post, "With such a record, he is unlikely to rally pro-life support to his new flag — a flag that seems designed mostly to cover his backside back home." The national group has so far not endorsed a candidate in the race (they have made endorsements in 20 primaries nationwide). But the state affiliate, Right to Life of Michigan, has: They backed Ellis over Amash. The state group also withdrew support from Amash in 2012. Lastly, we reached out to a spokesman for National Right to Life. They said they have no distinction of "No. 1 conservative." "National Right to Life has not rated anyone, including Rep. Amash, as a ‘No. 1 conservative,’" Derrick Jones said. "Nor does National Right to Life rate members of congress in terms of ‘conservative’ or ‘liberal.’" Adams, Amash’s spokesman, said it was "fair to lump a good pro-life rating in with our description" as top conservative because "self-identified conservatives poll overwhelmingly pro-life." That may be true, though by National Right to Life’s scorecard, it is not uncommon for a handful of Democrats to score higher than Republicans. In the last Congress, some Democrats even scored equal to or higher than Amash. Our ruling Amash’s ad claimed he was "rated Michigan’s No. 1 conservative" by several groups, including National Right to Life. While he has voted with the group this Congress, they ranked his record near the bottom of the GOP caucus from 2011 to 2012. Though he explained the times when he went against the group, it ultimately did not change their rating and clearly angered the organization. Amash’s ad implies approval from a group that has criticized his voting record, and whose state affiliate is backing his opponent. We rate Amash's statement False.

pomt-06772	Says allowing the payroll tax holiday to expire would end up "costing another estimated 900,000 jobs in 2012."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/aug/19/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-says-letting-payroll-tax-holiday-expi/	With all the intense interest on Congress during the debt ceiling debate and with all the nervous tics from people watching the near-death process, there’s little surprise that Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley’s decision to vote against the final deal drew reaction from his constituents. The debt agreement passed 74-26, of course, but Merkley was one of only six Democrats voting against a deal that prevented the United States from defaulting on its financial obligations for the first time in history. In explaining his vote, Merkley offered some general observations about the impact on people, especially the middle class. "I voted against the deal because, in short, I felt that it would make it harder for middle class Oregonians to get ahead now and in the future," he said in an Aug. 3 letter to a constituent in Hillsboro. "I have a single, simple measure to evaluate this proposal: is it going to create greater opportunities for prosperity and success for working Americans? Unfortunately, I have concluded that it will not, and so I cannot support it," Merkley said. Pretty general stuff. But he also offered a specific complaint - that the deal could slow down federal spending at the same time other government efforts to stimulate the economy are also ending, including the payroll tax holiday. Merkley says that’s a recipe for worsening the job picture at the very time when jobs are most needed. He backs his claim with numbers, which always gets our juices flowing here at PolitiFact Oregon. Allowing the payroll tax holiday to expire Dec. 31 is a terrible choice, he says in the letter, "costing another estimated 900,000 jobs in 2012." That tax cut lowers Social Security payroll taxes paid by employees to 4.2 percent of earnings from 6.2 percent. The economic argument Merkley makes is well known: that the extra $1,000 on average a family will have because of the payroll tax holiday will be spent. That means more money in circulation, which means more products produced and sold, which means more demand and more jobs. But is his claim correct about jobs connected to the payroll tax holiday? For support, Merkley cites an Aug. 1, 2011, analysis by economist John S. Irons at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. "Extending that tax cut for another year would provide roughly $118 billion in stimulus through increases in employees’ take-home pay, which would boost economic activity by an even greater $128 billion, Irons writes. "Allowing this policy to expire would lower GDP by 0.8 percent in 2012, and would lead to roughly 972,000 fewer jobs." While other economists have come to similar conclusions, absolute truth is impossible to obtain. Many factors affect economic performance -- including such wild-cards as weather and market psychology. Howard Gleckman, the editor of a tax blog for the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, has this to say about extending the payroll tax holiday: "Obama wants to extend this year’s payroll tax holiday. That may help keep consumer demand afloat. But since we don’t know what households have been doing with the extra cash they got this year, it is hard to predict what will happen if the holiday is extended." The payroll tax is scheduled to go back up Jan. 1, unless Congress renews it. If it is extended, the payroll tax holiday would mean $400 for the year for workers who make $20,000; $800 for workers who make $40,000; and $2,000 for workers who make $100,000. Social Security taxes only apply to income up to $106,800, so the measure particularly benefits workers below that threshold who, most economists say, are more likely to spend it. Merkley’s analysis conforms with traditional economic thinking and he is supported by actual calculations from economists. But questions of cause and effect in the economy always must be qualified as simply best educated guesses. Merkley adds the proper fudge in his letter, saying the job loss totals are estimates. In a world where absolutes are rare, Merkley’s statement passes the sniff test. We rate his claim: Mostly True.	None	Jeff Merkley	None	None	None	2011-08-19T16:37:55	2011-08-03	['None']
pomt-03171	Says Obama "exempted Congress and their staff from the full effect of the (health care) law."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2013/sep/05/jim-jordan/jim-jordan-claims-obama-health-care-decision-exemp/	The U.S. Office of Personnel Management issued a rule on Aug. 7 that said members of Congress and their staffers "will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums" when they buy insurance through exchanges set up under the soon-to-be implemented Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. That greatly upset some foes of the law. Among them was Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Champaign County in west-central Ohio, who wants the law repealed. He issued an Aug. 8 news release titled "Jordan Responds to President Obama’s Latest Healthcare Exemptions," which protested "special treatment of Congressional staff under Obamacare" as it urged delaying the law’s implementation. "First the President delayed the employer mandate for a year, and now he has exempted Congress and their staff from the full effect of the law," Jordan’s statement said. Given that a highly publicized provision of the law requires members of Congress and their staffers to buy insurance through the exchanges, we wanted to examine Jordan’s claim that the new rule would exempt those people "from the full effect of the law." By way of background, Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley devised the requirement as a political maneuver when the Senate Finance Committee drafted its version of the health care bill. He thought Democrats who controlled the committee would nix his idea so they wouldn’t have to participate in health insurance exchanges. Instead, they agreed and his provision became part of the law. The relevant part of the law states that: "Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, after the effective date of this subtitle, the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and Congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are - (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an Amendment made by this Act). " Because it goes on to define congressional staff as "all full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress," people who work for Congress but not an individual Congress member - like employees of congressional committees - won’t be required to buy their insurance on the exchanges. That provision makes Congress members and staffers in their personal offices the only employees of a large employer who will have to buy insurance through the exchanges, which were designed to make coverage available to people who must purchase insurance on their own, small businesses, and people who currently lack insurance. As Washington & Lee University health care law expert Timothy Jost noted, most Americans won’t buy insurance on the exchanges because they’ll continue to get insurance through their employer, or through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. And many of those who do get insurance through the exchanges will qualify for federal subsidies to help reduce their costs. The law itself does not specify how Congress should move employees into the exchanges from their current Federal Employees Health Benefits program insurance or whether they should be allowed to retain the employer co-pay they get toward their coverage. That co-pay is a significant amount of money. The Office of Personnel Management says the federal government typically pays between 72 and 75 percent of its employees’ health insurance premiums. Before OPM issued its proposed rule this month, there was speculation that large numbers of congressional staffers would quit their jobs if the co-pays were discontinued and they had to pay their entire health insurance premiums out of pocket. The newly issued rule states the government’s co-pay toward health plans bought on the exchange won’t be greater than the government’s contribution provided for other federally insured workers. It also says congressional employees on the exchanges won’t be eligible for premium tax credits for insurance bought on the exchanges, like other exchange participants who would be buying insurance on their own. The rule also permits each Congress member to determine which workers are employed by the "official office," rather than the committees on which the Congress member serves, and thus would have to buy insurance from the exchanges. A fact sheet that OPM issued on the decision says that because the legal requirement that Congress members and staffers buy insurance from the exchanges is prefaced with the clause "notwithstanding any other provision of law," the policy it is implementing "is not subject to the rule in the Affordable Care Act that prohibits an employer from providing a qualified health plan through an exchange as a benefit under its cafeteria plan." Jordan interpreted the law differently from OPM. He believes the letter of the law requires people to "pay for their exchange plan on their own," and that Grassley’s amendment requires staffers to "fully participate in the exchange by picking a plan, paying for it on their own, and perhaps qualifying for subsidies," said his press secretary, Meghan Snyder. "The rule change will now allow Members and staff to receive a contribution from their employer toward the exchange plan, unlike other Americans participating in the exchange," Snyder told us in an email. "Further, members and staff will not qualify for the same subsidies as other Americans. Therefore, Members and staff are treated differently than the Americans who fully participate in the exchange." Snyder said that the "rule change reduced the cost of the plan for Members and staff by up to 75 percent and changed how the subsidies are applied as well. Those special exemptions, which apply only to Members of Congress and their staff, allows them relief from the full effects of the law." She noted that articles written by Reuters and Bloomberg made the same supposition about the law as Jordan. An April article from Bloomberg called the tax breaks that employers get for providing health insurance to their workers "hugely inefficient" and expressed the view that halting employer copays for congressional employees "may make Congress inclined to save public and private money by restricting the subsidy for employer-provided coverage." The August Reuters article said the health care law "contained no language that allowed federal contributions" toward congressional employees’ health care costs and said the OPM decision "means that Congress will escape the most onerous impact of the law as it was written." Other lawmakers - including Grassley - did not believe Grassley’s amendment would stop the federal government from paying part of congressional workers’ health insurance premiums. When we asked Grassley’s office whether his legislative language was intended to force Congress members and staffers to pay all their insurance costs out-of-pocket, dramatically cutting their compensation in the process, it directed us to Senate report language on the Finance Committee bill that specified employer contributions could be used to pay for health exchange insurance purchases by Congress members and employees. A 2010 Congressional Research Service report on the issue also found the law "may provide authority for the federal government to make a contribution to the health insurance premiums of Members of Congress and congressional staff." Washington & Lee University law professor Jost says the Congressional Research Service report shows "the intent of Congress as to how coverage would be paid for was clear all along." "Congressional coverage would be paid for in the same way coverage for other federal employees is funded — through the federal Office of Personnel Management," Jost wrote on the Health Affairs blog. "The ACA requires the federal government to ‘make available’ exchange coverage to Congress, and Senator Grassley stated at the time he offered his amendment that its intent was ‘to require that Members of Congress and congressional staff get their employer-based health insurance through the same exchanges as … constituents.’ It was only a matter of time until OPM clarified this." When we went through the 906-page law, we could not find anything that would ban employer copays for insurance bought through the exchanges or that would "require people to pay for their exchange plans on their own," as Jordan’s office said it did. Snyder did not respond to our request to point out those provisions in the law. Given that Jordan has one of the lowest staff turnover rates in the U.S. House of Representatives and presumably tries to be a fair employer, we also asked Snyder whether Jordan thought it would be fair to gut the compensation package that his staff receives by stopping the federal government from paying part of their insurance premiums. It seemed to us that halting a type of compensation offered by many major employers would single out Congress members and staffers for a raw deal that nobody else in the country would have suffered under the law. Snyder dismissed our question as "largely hypothetic," since Jordan wants to repeal the law. "Whether it be government handing out a "raw deal" or a "special deal," it is still a law that treats members and their staff differently than the average American," she said. So where does Jordan’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter. There is a kernel of truth in it. We don’t dispute Jordan’s assertion that Congressional employees will get different treatment under the Affordable Care Act than some others who get their insurance from the exchanges. That’s due, in part, to Grassley’s provision makes Congressional offices the nation’s only large employer that will be required to buy insurance through exchanges designed to cover individuals without insurance and small employers. But while the Congressional employees will get an employer contribution toward their insurance, others in the exchanges will also be getting federal subsidies for their insurance. And Jordan's claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression and actually distorts some facts. Although Jordan says the Affordable Care Act ‘s wording would require the federal government to discontinue the copay for Congress members and employees when they buy insurance through the exchange, the language of the law does not address that question. Authoritative sources like the Congressional Research Service and a Senate report on the health care bill long ago said the Affordable Care Act could allow continuing the employer copay for Congress members and their staffers. So while Congress and their staffs will be treated differently than some others getting health care coverage through the insurance exchanges, Jordan’s claim goes too far when he describes the Office of Personnel Management’s ruling on co-pays as one that "exempted Congress and their staff from the full effect of the law." Nothing in the law says that congressional employees should be required to pay the full freight for their health insurance. On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordan’s claim rates as Mostly False.

pomt-00230	After Hurricane Hermine struck Tallahassee, "utility companies lined up trucks to restore power. But as mayor, Andrew Gillum refused help from workers."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/oct/10/republican-party-florida/republican-ad-misleads-attack-andrew-gillum-about-/	When Hurricane Hermine hit Florida in 2016, it knocked out power for several days in Tallahassee, igniting a political storm of tension between the capital city and state government. A new storm is brewing in the 2018 race for governor, with Democratic Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum under attack about allegations his administration didn’t cooperate with utility companies. "After the Hurricane, we had no electricity for over a week," said a woman named Kathryn in a TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida. "Utility companies lined up trucks to restore power. But as mayor, Andrew Gillum refused help from workers. The trucks just sat, while people suffered." "Incompetence, or extreme politics, I don't know," she says. "But leaders are supposed to help people in tough times. And Andrew Gillum, he didn't help us. He failed us." A second TV ad by the party said, "Gillum turned away workers who could have restored our power." Gillum’s Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, has also criticized Gillum’s leadership during the hurricane. This ad distorts the city’s response to the massive power outage. The city accepted help from several utilities, although it turned down an offer of help from Florida Power and Light, the Florida utility giant. City response following Hurricane Hermine After Hurricane Hermine hit Sept. 1, 2016, more than 75,000 customers of the city's municipal electric system and 20,000 customers of the nearby cooperative electric company, Talquin Electric, lost power. Power was restored to 90 percent of homes within five days. After the storm hit, Gov. Rick Scott held meetings with government officials, and utility executives including Eric Silagy, Florida Power and Light CEO. Silagy said he had 575 personnel ready to help. But Rob McGarrah, the city’s general manager of utilities, was confident the city had engaged enough assistance from eight other utilities, the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald reported after the storm. He did not immediately jump on the offer by FPL and told Scott that coordination with the visiting crews was important to "make sure what we're doing is safe." City spokeswoman Alison Faris told PolitiFact that at the time FPL’s offer was extended, the city had already accepted all the assistance it could safely utilize. Barry Moline was the head of the Florida Municipal Electrical Association at the time. He said it was McGarrah’s responsibility to identify the needs while Moline was in charge of coordinating with other utilities. "Any claim that suggests the mayor had anything to do with rejecting crews is a flat-out lie," Moline, who now serves as executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Association, told the Sun Sentinel. "It's wrong. It's false. It didn't happen. The mayor wasn't involved with selecting or choosing crews to bring into Tallahassee." A few weeks after the storm, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote that Moline and others said "Mayor Gillum had until 10 p.m. to accept the workers parked 90 minutes away in Lake City or they'd move up the coast." But Moline told PolitiFact that it was up to McGarrah, not Gillum, about whether to accept help from various utilities. When responding to a disaster, the mayor and city commissioners look to McGarrah as the expert, Moline said. Moline said at the time FPL was offering "resources" but "they refused to divulge what FPL resources meant" in terms of the type of workers. Moline said it's important to know what type of workers a utility is offering to provide because workers have different skills. FPL media relations didn’t respond to requests for comment. The images of utility trucks in the ad were from FPL staging areas in Valdosta, Ga., and Flagler, on Florida’s east coast. The names of the company on the trucks were blurred in the ad "because it was a political ad and the name of the utility company was not relevant, the fact that they were staged and ready and not allowed to help is," said Meredith Beatrice, spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Florida. On Sept. 4, Gulf Power sent 150 workers to Leon County. Days after the storm, city officials said they accepted all the help they could. McGarrah explained he had to embed his own people in outside crews for safety reasons and that the city had reached a "saturation point" with mutual-aid crews. "It starts to get to the point where more bodies don't necessarily equate to ... more productivity," he said. "You can only get so many line trucks, bucket trucks and people in an area." Several news articles following the storm, as well as a report by Leon County, show that the city did accept help from many other utilities. Leon County’s report said that the city of Tallahassee Utilities and Talquin Electric both have mutual-aid agreements to obtain equipment and labor from other utilities following disasters. A total of 198 line crews and staff from nine utilities assisted with restoration efforts. Crews arrived in Leon County by midday on Friday, Sept. 2, and assisted until Sept. 11, the county report said. The mayor’s role City residents complained on social media about the pace of restoration after word spread that the city turned down help from Florida Power and Light. Three days after the storm hit, Gillum defended the city’s response on Facebook. "Let me be clear. We are happy to accept any help from any person or organization that is going to accelerate the speed at which we can safely restore power to our residents. ... We have accepted help from eight different utility companies from three different states offering assistance with power restoration." Gillum warned "too much help at one time may make us feel better, but it can actually slow down progress." Gillum, however, acknowledged the city could do better at updating planning protocols. Moline told the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald that while Gillum was at the meetings about storm response, Tallahassee isn’t a "strong mayor" form of government and Gillum "had zero input into the decisions to get more resources or fewer resources." Beatrice, the Republican Party spokeswoman, pushed back on that assessment. "He was at those meetings where decisions were made, and he had ‘zero input,’ which is unacceptable leadership," she said. "The blame still falls on him for not speaking up. Doing nothing and shifting blame to subordinates is awful leadership." Alan Harris, chief administrator for the Seminole County Office of Emergency Management, told PolitiFact that it sounded like the city followed the mutual-aid agreement in place. "The elected officials do not get involved with the agreements accept to approve them at a board meeting," he told PolitiFact. Typically, he said, tactical decisions are left in the hands of a department manager, not a mayor or elected official. Chuck Lanza, a former Broward County emergency management director, said the role of the mayor can depend on the mayor and the situation -- not necessarily the form of government. "Yes, Tallahassee Mayor Gillum is not a ‘strong mayor,’ as the city has implemented the City Manager model for day-to-day governance," Lanza said. "Having said that, I would not be surprised to see any mayor become the face and voice of the city during a threat and in the subsequent response and recovery. The dynamics are not always documented but the mayor’s power may increase due to the nature of the event. In the old days, the mayor of Miami Beach would have a very visible role in a hurricane response and was successful in making decisions in conflict with the county who had the legal authority to make the decisions." Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said after a hurricane struck Tallahassee, "utility companies lined up trucks to restore power. But as mayor, Andrew Gillum refused help from workers." The city of Tallahassee turned down an offer from Florida Power and Light to help restore power to residents after Hurricane Hermine in 2016. In Tallahassee, the mayor isn’t the chief executive of the city like he or she would be in New York, Boston or Tampa. So in the case of storm response, decisions didn’t ultimately fall to Gillum. They were made by the city’s general manager of utilities. Despite what the ad claims, the city accepted help from multiple outside utility companies to help restore power in Tallahassee. The claim from the Republican Party of Florida has only an element of truth but distorts the facts to give viewers the wrong impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-05124	Says Gov. Chris Christie’s proposed budget is "the biggest spending budget in the history of the state of New Jersey. It is the largest in the nation at this point in time."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/25/vincent-prieto/vincent-prieto-claims-chris-christies-proposed-bud/	Gov. Chris Christie touts himself as a chief executive who tightened Trenton’s purse strings, squeezing out excess spending while paring down state government. But a Democratic state legislator claims the Republican governor’s proposed budget makes history for two costly reasons. "This is the biggest spending budget in the history of the state of New Jersey. It is the largest in the nation at this point in time, that just was written by the governors of the nation," Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson) said during an interview on My9 News' "New Jersey Now" that aired June 17. Those are two big claims, both of which are short on facts. The budget proposal that Christie outlined in February for the upcoming fiscal year called for nearly $32.15 billion in state spending. The Senate and Assembly are scheduled to vote on a Democratic budget proposal on Monday. Though Christie’s proposal is one of the largest budget plans in New Jersey’s history, former Gov. Jon Corzine proposed more costly budgets. Corzine’s fiscal 2008 budget proposed $33.3 billion in spending for the year, the most in state history. Final state spending that year ended slightly higher, at $33.61 billion, according to state Treasury Department reports. Corzine proposed a $32.97 billion spending plan for fiscal 2009, but the state ultimately spent less than that, with the final tab at $30.8 billion, excluding federal stimulus aid. But comparing apples to apples -- budget proposals to budget proposals -- the governor introduced the third largest spending plan in state history. Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, said Prieto was referring to a larger measurement of spending that includes federal money, as well as spending from funds like the Transportation Trust Fund. By that measure, Christie’s proposal includes more spending than previous budget plans. The assemblyman’s "point is accurate," said Hester. But Prieto does not make that distinction during the interview, which focused on whether the state can afford a tax cut considering lower-than-expected state revenues. Andy Pratt, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said Prieto is including expenditures that are listed as off-budget and said the budget has never been referred to in this way. "Only if you are looking for a way to make some kind of political point would you do it another way," he said. Prieto also said Christie’s proposal is the largest in the nation. That’s not true. Hester said Prieto meant to refer to the percentage increase in state spending, not the broader measurement of spending, between Christie’s proposed budget and the current budget. The National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers released a report in June that tracks spending from states’ general funds only. The report found Christie’s budget proposal for fiscal 2013 increases spending by 7.2 percent over fiscal 2012. The percentage increase in New Jersey’s spending is larger than any other state, according to data in the report. California is proposing the next largest increase at 7 percent. So by that measure, Christie is proposing the largest spending increase in the nation, but Prieto is wrong to characterize the governor’s budget as "the largest in the nation." The budgets for California, New York, Texas and Massachusetts all propose to spend more in the upcoming fiscal year than New Jersey, according to data in the report. Our ruling In a discussion about whether New Jersey can afford a tax cut considering lower-than-expected state revenues, Prieto said Christie’s proposed budget is "the biggest spending budget in the history of the state of New Jersey. It is the largest in the nation at this point in time." The governor’s fiscal 2013 budget calls for $32.15 billion in state spending. That’s the third largest -- not the largest -- budget proposal in state history. A spokesman for Prieto said the assemblyman was referring to a broader measurement of spending, which includes federal funds. But Prieto did not make that distinction. Also, New Jersey’s budget is not the largest in the nation. We rate this claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14491	Says "Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come" to the United States.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/26/glenn-grothman/us-rep-glenn-grothman-criticizes-barack-obama-over/	With questions about border security and refugees from Syria still dominating the debate in the Republican presidential contest, we decided to look back in our files and tackle a claim made in late 2015 by U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin On Nov. 20, 2015, soon after the House passed a bill that would increase security checks on refugees from Iraq and Syria, Grothman appeared on conservative talker Jay Weber’s show on WISN (1130-AM). In the appearance, he asserted President Barack Obama has basically an open-door policy when it comes to immigrants. "Whether it’s dealing with the Middle East or south of the border, Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come here and we’ll see what happens," said Grothman, R-Campbellsport. Since Grothman made his statement in the context of the Syrian refugee bill, we’ll evaluate the claim with that in mind. Obama plans to accept about 10,000 people from Syria in 2016. Refugee process Obama has said Syrian refugees coming into United States must follow the same vetting process as all other refugees. But Republicans argue that is not enough and more stringent background checks are necessary, given concerns about terrorists posing as refugees and slipping into the country. Let’s take a closer look at the vetting process for those seeking refuge in the United States. Those seeking refuge must find a United Nations Refugee Agency and identify themselves as a refugee. The U.N. collects data on the applicant, such as their date and place of birth. Applicants are interviewed to confirm need for resettlement. Refugees from active war zones, including Syria, already must undergo additional checks, such as iris scans that are checked against terrorist databases. The White House says less than 1 percent of the global refugee population is considered strong candidates to be admitted to the United States and make it past this first check. Then, applicants are received by a federally funded Resettlement Support Center overseas. An applicant file is created with identifying documents and security checks conducted. Candidates are screened by at least four U.S. security agencies -- National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department. The agencies check for security risks, such as ties to known bad actors, and criminal history. The process continues with a Homeland Security interview; those from Syria get an "enhanced review," which means their documents are scrutinized more closely. Fingerprints are taken and screened against federal databases. A medical screening occurs. Cultural orientation classes are taken. Travel is booked. Finally, the refugees arrives in the United States. U.S. officials will eliminate any candidate who intelligence does not think will make a good candidate to enter the United States. "Any doubt, they’re out," said Melanie Nezer, vice president of policy and advocacy for the refugee assistance group HIAS. Grothman’s backup Grothman’s team sent a series of links to news articles and quotes from federal officials as evidence of Obama’s stance on refugees. "The idea that somehow they pose a more significant threat than all the tourists who pour into the United States every single day just doesn’t jive with reality," Obama said in his remarks after a meeting with the Canadian prime minister Nov. 19, 2015. Grothman also included a quote from FBI Director James Comey’s congressional testimony in October 2015. "If we don’t know much about somebody, there won’t be anything in our data," Comey said. "I can’t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there’s no risk associated with this." But Comey didn’t say the system is failing, or that no vetting occurs. Only that it is impossible to identify every potential problem. "James Comey doesn’t have the power of absolute foresight," said Antonio Ginatta, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. "No level of vetting would get you to 100 percent." Our rating Grothman said, "Barack Obama is apparently not for vetting people and saying just anybody can come" to the United States. But refugees are the most vetted people who enter the country -- and Syrian refugees already face additional measures. What’s more, Grothman’s evidence didn’t back up his claim. We rate the claim False.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2016-02-26T05:00:00	2015-11-20	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-09727	"Usually it's about $900 a month to get health coverage. (Florida's program has) reduced that, on average, to about $150 a month."	false	/florida/statements/2009/oct/23/charlie-crist/crist-makes-misleading-claim-about-florida-health-/	In a recent Fox News interview, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist boasted about Cover Florida Health Care, an effort to provide low-cost health care coverage to the nearly 4 million uninsured in the state. "There are no government mandates to it, no tax dollars utilized for it," Crist said on Oct. 21, 2009. "Just good, aggressive negotiating by our administration with health insurance companies. ... And, really, the problem with health care is that it's expensive. And so what we've attempted to do is reduce the cost by reducing the expense and the premium of health insurance, and we've had success doing so. Usually it's about $900 a month to get health coverage. We've reduced that, on average, to about $150 a month." Given all the debate over the high cost of health care, we wondered if the Florida plan could be as inexpensive as Crist claims. We found he was distorting the savings by mixing apples and oranges. The program, which was started in 2008, allows individuals who have been without coverage for at least six months to pick from plans offered by six insurance companies. Each provider was chosen by the state through a competitive bidding process, and each offers at least two options — one with catastrophic and hospital coverage, and another plan that can provide less coverage. The program's Web site says that individual plans can be purchased for as little as $23 or as much as $800 a month, depending on age, gender and level of coverage. Patients pick and choose between various options offered through the six insurers. So, for example, a woman who is between 19 and 29 years of age can pay $130 a month for a plan that includes no deductible, $10 copays for doctor visits, but no hospital inpatient coverage. Since Cover Florida Health Care was enacted, critics have said the program hasn't done enough to cover the uninsured. To date, about 4,500 people have enrolled — about 0.1 percent of the state's uninsured population. The low-cost options so often touted by state officials don't offer patients much of a safety net, said Florida state Sen. Nan Rich. "People are beginning to see that it doesn't cover anything," said Rich, a Democrat from Broward County. "It may be inexpensive, but it's inexpensive for a reason. It's a very low level of coverage." When we asked Crist's office about his claim — that health care costs are on average $900 a month compared to $150 under Florida's plan — we were told that the $900 figure cited by the governor came from the Kaiser Family Foundation and that it refers to the amount of money a family pays, on average, per month. Crist's office also noted that the figure is outdated (for instance, in 2006, the average monthly cost per family was about $950) and pointed us to a new Kaiser report released Sept. 15, 2009, that estimates families now pay about $1,114 a month. So Crist is off by about $200 for family coverage. As for the average cost under the Cover Florida program, Crist's office pointed us to a document that lists the different providers and their rates for individuals. The average for the higher-end coverage, which would include hospitalization and catastrophic insurance, is about $227, while the average for the less-expensive "preventive" plan was $89. So Crist's $150 number is the approximate average of the two. But wait. The first number Crist cited is the Kaiser estimate for a family . The second number is for an individual . We went back to the Kaiser report and found that the average cost for an individual plan is actually around $400 a month, which would mean the gap was not as dramatic as Crist claimed. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey acknowledged the apples and oranges comparison but said the underlying point is still valid that the Florida average is lower. But we find Crist is using sleight-of-hand, comparing numbers that aren't comparable. He's used a higher family number with a lower number for individuals. We rate his claim False.

pomt-09262	"Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/02/bill-maher/bill-maher-and-george-will-spar-over-oil-and-brazi/	A potential ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico led to a spirited debate on U.S. energy policy on ABC News' This Week. Liberal commentator Bill Maher lamented the fact that both major political parties, including President Barack Obama, have supported offshore oil drilling in recent years instead of being more aggressive about renewable energy. "Where is the other side on this? I could certainly criticize oil companies and I could criticize America in general for not attacking this problem in the '70s. Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years; we certainly could have," Maher said. Maher said Obama seems to be backpedaling on offshore drilling since the spill, adding "I hope there's a flip-flop I can believe in there." Conservative columnist George Will challenged Maher about Brazil. "Could you just explain to me in what sense has Brazil got off oil?" "I believe they did," Maher said. "I believe in the 70's they had a program to use sugarcane ethanol, and I believe that is what fuels their country." "I think they still burn a lot of oil and have a lot of offshore (drilling)," Will said. "Can we have judges factcheck this on Brazil?" Maher said a few moments later. "I don't think I dreamed that on Brazil." With an invitation like that, how could we resist? So we dug into the research on Brazil and energy. Brazil does produce a lot of sugarcane ethanol, as Maher said. "Brazil is one of the largest producers of ethanol in the world and is the largest exporter of the fuel," according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an independent agency within the U.S. Department of Energy that collects and analyzes energy information. Additionally, more than half of all cars in Brazil are flexible-fuel capable, which means they can run on 100 percent ethanol or an ethanol-gasoline mixture. By contrast, the best numbers we found for the United States is that there are approximately 8 million flexible-fuel vehicles, which would translate to roughly 3 percent of all vehicles. (We would caution that even that number might be deceptive, as the U.S. Department of Energy warns that "many FFV owners don't know their vehicle is one.") But even though Brazil aggressively uses biofuels, and invests quite a bit in hydroelectric power, it still produces and consumes a lot of oil. In 2008, Brazil ranked No. 7 on the list of the world's countries that consume the most oil, using about 2.5 million barrels per day. In first place was the United States at 19.5 million barrels per day, followed by China, Japan, India, Russia, and Germany, according to the Energy Information Administration. Brazil also produces a lot of oil through drilling near its coasts. In recent years, Brazil's state-controlled energy company Petrobras announced a major new find of oil in some of the deepest waters where exploration is conducted, some 7,000 feet below in the Atlantic Ocean. The find is expected to make Brazil even more important in the oil export business. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that Brazil will become a net exporter of oil this year, even before the new fields are tapped. Getting back to our factcheck, Maher was likely remembering Brazil's aggresive efforts to promote ethanol, and certainly Brazil has outpaced the United States in getting flexible fuel vehicles on the road. But Maher said, "Brazil got off oil in the last 30 years." Actually, Brazil still consumes a great deal of oil. It's also embarking on more offshore drilling in some of the deepest waters for exploration. Brazil is hardly "off oil." So we rate Maher's statement False.

pomt-10939	"President Trump proposed the increase to $700 billion to our military budget, which included the 355-ship Navy, which included a military pay increase, a modest one, which included, a yet even more modest housing allowance, but yet (Sen. Tim Kaine) even voted against giving more money to our men and women who are in the military service and against our housing allowance."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/corey-stewart/stewart-mark-repeated-attacks-kaines-support-milit/	During a recent debate, Republican Corey Stewart criticized incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine for his frequent opposition to President Donald Trump. As evidence, Stewart said Kaine voted against Trump’s proposal for a bolstered military budget. "He has the nerve to say that he supports our military," Stewart said. "President Trump proposed the increase to $700 billion to our military budget, which included the 355-ship navy, which included a military pay increase, a modest one, which included, an yet even more modest housing allowance, but yet he even voted against giving more money to our men and women who are in the military service and against our housing allowance." Stewart repeated similar versions of the same claim five more times during the debate. "Earlier this year President Trump and the Republicans have proposed legislation for a 355-ship Navy, they proposed legislation that would've included another $7.1 billion of veterans care, they proposed legislation that would have increased the salaries for our military personnel, and increased the housing allowance," Stewart said later. "He voted against all of it." Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, said Stewart has been repeating the accusation for months. "I support the military with my own flesh and blood," Kaine, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded. "My boy is an infantry commander in the Marine Corps." Kaine added that "the record will show" Stewart’s claims to be made-up. We decided to check the record for ourselves. A short-term government spending bill When contacted for comment, Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch said Kaine voted against a short-term government spending bill on Jan. 19, 2018. "This spending bill included all of the items Corey mentioned," Fritsch wrote in an email. Kaine did vote against that bill, a continuing resolution that would have kept the government funded through Feb. 16, 2018. Ultimately, the measure fell 10 votes short of passing and resulted in a government shutdown through Jan. 22. Before voting, Kaine issued a joint statement with fellow Virginia Sen. Mark Warner detailing his opposition to a bill that would mean "punt(ing) budget discussions until mid-February." "Congress should remain in session with no recess until we work out a long-term bipartisan budget deal that addresses all issues," Kaine and Warner said. In a second statement after the vote, Kaine and Warner explained that Virginians wanted "a bill that funds our military, education and health care programs, extends the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and protects Dreamers." The omnibus spending bill Despite opposing the short-term resolution, Kaine was one of 65 Senators who voted in favor of the omnibus spending bill — a bill packaging many smaller appropriations bills into one — that Congress approved on March 23 to fund the remainder of the fiscal year through Sept. 30. Although Fritsch pointed us to the Jan. 19 vote, Stewart told local news outlets after the debate that he was referring to the March 23 omnibus spending bill in his attack on Kaine. That bill, a 2,232-page document formally titled the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, authorized $1.3 billion in spending. Trump signed it into effect the same day Congress approved it, despite a last-minute veto threat on Twitter. In response to Trump’s Twitter post, Kaine blasted the president for displaying "the Art of the Deal-Wrecker." After Trump signed the bill, Kaine applauded the legislation as a "long list of wins for Virginia." "It will help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, spur economic growth, combat the opioid epidemic, support shipbuilding and ship repair, boost defense funding, allow us to continue to protect the Chesapeake Bay, deliver affordable child care, increase accessibility to cyber scholarships, expand access to higher education, and more," Kaine said in a statement. Among its many provisions, the omnibus spending bill allocated $700 billion for military spending, boosted military hardware, added funding for veterans care, authorized an expansion of the Navy’s fleet, raised pay for military personnel by 2.4 percent and increased funding for military housing. Ironically, Sams, the Kaine campaign’s communications director, noted that Stewart himself said he would have preferred to see the bill vetoed. "I wish the president had vetoed it," Stewart said March 26, 2018, during a radio interview on the John Fredericks Show. "I don't know what his calculation was … they gave him a bad bill, one in which he didn’t feel that he had any choice but to sign it." Stewart called the bill "an absolute nightmare and a disaster" due to its high spending totals, lack of funding for the border wall, and provisions covering Obamacare, sanctuary cities, gun control and "a sweetheart project that (Senate Minority Leader Chuck) Schumer has going up in his district." Beyond the bills Sams said Kaine has advocated for proposals to improve the military since Trump took office, including the Navy’s plans to boost its ship count from 280 to 355 over the next few decades. Kaine was an original co-sponsor for a 2017 act declaring that "it shall be the policy of the United States to have available, as soon as practicable, at least 355 battle force ships." In May, for example, Kaine said he hoped Congress would "maintain forward motion towards a 355-ship Navy." A month prior, Kaine said the Navy’s potential expansion to 355 ships could benefit workers. "We talk about what 355 means for the budget, and there are a whole series of issues there, but there is a real work force need," Kaine said at a meeting of the Senate Armed Services sea power panel. "Folks who are going to be building these ships are in pre-K right now." Kaine’s campaign also pointed to several instances where Kaine showed support for the military, including when he defended increased military spending, applauded the Navy’s purchase of aircraft carriers and sponsored an amendment providing $12.3 billion for Virginia shipbuilding. Our ruling Stewart said, "President Trump proposed the increase to $700 billion to our military budget, which included the 355-ship Navy, which included a military pay increase, a modest one, which included, a yet even more modest housing allowance, but yet (Kaine) even voted against giving more money to our men and women who are in the military service and against our housing allowance." Kaine did vote no on a short-term government spending bill, which included several of the military-related provisions Stewart cited, in order to signal his disapproval for another short-term budget resolution. However, Kaine eventually voted in favor of those same provisions when he said yes to the omnibus spending bill on March 23, and he has taken other actions and made other statements in support of those provisions.

Obama "made the very argument he is now criticizing back in November 2006."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/29/hillary-clinton/cherry-picking-obamas-quotes/	In a dust-up on Hillary Clinton's vote for the Kyl-Lieberman amendment, the Clinton campaign responded to charges that she had given President Bush a "blank check" by charging the Illinois senator had flip-flopped on Iran. In a memo to reporters titled "Obama vs. Obama," the Clinton campaign cited a 2006 speech by the senator that said "maintaining a military force in Iraq is necessary to constrain Iran's ambitions," which is no different than the amendment that Clinton supported. The quotes are accurate, but the Clinton campaign has taken them out of context. Obama's 4,000-word speech spends about two paragraphs on Iran and Syrian; its main purpose was to argue for withdrawing from Iraq. After discussing the need to reduce troops and increase diplomacy, Obama outlines a number of possible scenarios, including sending more troops to Afghanistan. After that, he says the reduced forces in Iraq would still have a role to play in sending a message to Iran and Syria. But it's an exagerration to say that he has dramatically switched positions. The Clinton campaign is right when it asserts that there is little difference between Clinton and Obama on Iran policy. Both advocate aggressive diplomacy and economic sanctions, and both say a military strategy cannot be ruled out. But selectively quoting Obama from the November speech is a weak point for this argument, so we rate this claim Half-True.

pomt-08105	"I have always been focused on reining in the deficit."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/13/herb-kohl/us-sen-herb-kohl-says-hes-always-been-focused-redu/	Four-term U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., isn’t often in the news, but a couple developments on a Friday afternoon in December put him there -- and may provide an early glimpse at the what to expect in the 2012 election. Kohl, 75, has not hinted he will retire. But Republicans, after knocking off U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold in December, already have an eye on his seat. So on Dec. 3, 2010, when President Barack Obama’s debt commission agreed on recommendations for long-term budget fixes and employment figures did not improve as much as expected, dueling news releases landed in reporters’ mailboxes. Release one: The political arm of Senate Republicans blamed Kohl and Democrats for backing a "bloated stimulus" that failed to create jobs to bring the unemployment rate down. Release two: Kohl issued a statement praising the debt commission’s work as a step toward getting America’s fiscal house in order. "I have always been focused on reining in the deficit, and this is a good place to start for next year’s budget debate," Kohl said in the release. "Always," of course, is a pretty high standard, especially over a 22-year career. And during that time the multi-millionaire Kohl has been more known for his personal frugality than as a devoted deficit hawk. So we dug into that statement. It would be impossible, of course, to examine every vote in that period. But we can look at key votes and examine how Kohl’s fiscal record compares to others in the Senate. Kohl’s spokeswoman, Lynn Becker, said Kohl has approached the federal budget with a businessman’s eye for the bottom line. She cited numerous votes. Her list includes Kohl voting in 2003 against expanding Medicare to give drug benefits to 40 million seniors and disabled people at a cost of $400 billion over 10 years. Additionally, Kohl backed two balanced budget acts during the Bill Clinton years -- measures linked to bringing the federal budget into rare surplus; supported a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts in 2003, citing concerns about deficits. He went along with $500 billion in cost curbs on Medicare that were part of health care reform, and has voted against major military spending such as the F-22 aircraft, the C-17 cargo plane and B-2 bomber, Becker said. And he voted to eliminate the superconducting super collider and space station projects. She notes Kohl was twice named to the deficit-reduction honor roll by the bipartisan Concord Coalition, a nonprofit group advocating for debt control. A detailed defense, to be sure. PolitiFact Wisconsin confirmed those votes and honors. But what about the other side of the ledger? Among the big-ticket items Kohl voted for: The first George W. Bush tax cuts, in 2001, at a time of surpluses. The $800 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a.k.a. the stimulus package, in 2009. Kohl said it was a necessity to save the economy from meltdown. Federal health care reforms in 2010. Official, if uncertain, estimates show they could reduce health care costs long term, but Republican critics say they could backfire. The controversial Troubled Asset Relief Program, at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008. Kohl also went along with supplemental appropriations to support the Iraq war, saying that cutting off funding would have endangered troops. He backed elimination of tax cuts for millionaires as an alternative way to pay for war costs. Additionally, Kohl has opposed a ban on earmarks -- a small part of the budget but controversial because individual members of Congress use them to direct spending to their districts. So the picture is not nearly as clear as the votes provided by Kohl’s office. When it comes to budget-related rankings by the media and interest groups, some portray Kohl as fairly liberal on spending, while others put him in a different light. The National Journal, a Washington D.C. publication, pulls out selected fiscal votes to judge senators on economic policy. It rated Kohl as the 19th to 34th most liberal in the 100-member Senate from 2007-2009. On a broader range of votes, the widely quoted rankings counted Feingold -- but not Kohl -- as a centrist. The National Taxpayers Union Foundationa analyzes each lawmaker’s agenda based on bill sponsorship (not just those that had votes) and tallies its net cost -- or savings. Over his career, Kohl has averaged a ranking of 25th-stingiest in the Senate. The NTU advocates for lower taxes and smaller government. We’ll sample a few other interest groups that take a broader view than simply budget issues: Kohl has agreed with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce about half the time -- in the middle of the Senate pack but more often than most Democrats. He has agreed with the AFL-CIO’s labor agenda more than 80% of the time -- very low by Democratic Party standards but in the center in the Senate overall. He has agreed with the agenda of Citizens Against Government Waste more often than just a handful of Democrats. And in the late 1990s to 2005, he was in accord more often than not with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government spending watchdog that no longer produces the rankings. Overall, Kohl generally comes out as a somewhat moderate Democrat. He certainly doesn’t have a reputation as a party-bucking maverick like Feingold, though he can point to some exceptions, such as supporting the balanced-budget amendment and line-item veto authority for the president. Is he a Johnny-come-lately to the deficit issue or a closet deficit hawk? He’s something in between, based on the ideologically mixed reviews he gets from interest groups and or examination of his voting record. Let’s return to the original statement: "I have always been focused on reining in the deficit." In making it, Kohl -- who owns the Milwaukee Bucks -- went to the basket hard. The statement certainly suggests Kohl has been at the forefront of the issue, though there is little evidence of that -- even on the deficit-minded votes his office cites. And he has voted for numerous big-ticket items, whatever the rationale for the individual votes. Kohl’s fiscal rating of votes in recent years puts him in the most-liberal third of the Senate. That alone may not make him a big spender -- being a Republican conservative hasn’t necessarily meant deficit reduction in recent years -- but it’s a general clue that his agenda has often been focused more on spending than on cost controls. Thus, the slam dunk attempt falls short. We rate Kohl’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Herb Kohl	None	None	None	2010-12-13T09:00:00	2010-12-03	['None']
pomt-08290	"The president of the United States will be taking a trip over to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/04/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-claims-obamas-trip-india-will/	It sure sounds outrageous. On his upcoming presidential trip to India, President Barack Obama is bringing an entourage of 3,000, staying in swanky hotels, guarded by an armada of Navy ships -- costing American taxpayers the staggering sum of $200 million a day. To say this figure -- $200 million a day -- has made the rounds in the blogosphere would be a huge understatement. It has been repeated by nearly every conservative pundit in the land: Hannity, Limbaugh, Beck, Drudge. Always with a healthy dose of indignation. It also got picked up by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., who told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Nov. 3, 2010, it was just the latest example of government excess and spending from the Obama administration. "The president of the United States will be taking a trip over to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day," Bachmann said. "He's taking 2,000 people with him. He will be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are five-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. This is the kind of over-the-top spending. It's a very small example, Anderson. "And I think this is an example of the massive overspending that we have seen, not only just in the last two years, really in the last four. That's what we saw at the ballot box last evening." Again, $200 million a day sounds outrageous. But is it true? The White House says, emphatically, that it's not. "Due to security concerns, we are unable to outline details associated with security procedures and costs, but it’s safe to say these numbers are wildly inflated," said White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. Cooper asked Bachmann how she came up with the number. "These are the numbers that have been coming out in the press," Bachmann said. Actually it's a figure that came from just one source, a news agency in India, relying on an anonymous source. It was then repeated thousands more times in the blogosphere and over conservative airwaves. The claim that the U.S. would be spending "a whopping $200 million per day" on Obama's visit to Mumbai, India, originated in a report from the news agency Press Trust of India. It was an estimate attributed anonymously to "a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit." Maharashtra is a state located in western India. Here's what the story said: "The huge amount of around $200 million would be spent on security, stay and other aspects of the Presidential visit," a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit said. About 3,000 people including Secret Service agents, U.S. government officials and journalists would accompany the President. Several officials from the White House and U.S. security agencies are already here for the past one week with helicopters, a ship and high-end security instruments. Said Bedingfield: "The numbers reported in this article have no basis in reality." Now it's true that overseas travel by presidents can be expensive, said Kelley Gannon, who worked on the press advance team for George H. W. Bush and was director of press advance for George W. Bush. "You have to re-create a mini White House." But pegging an exact cost has long been an elusive task for news reporters. In an Oct. 7, 2009, story for McClatchy Newspapers, reporter Steven Thomma took a stab: The costs of the trips -- borne by taxpayers -- are difficult to measure, but they're expensive. When (the president) uses the familiar blue-and-white reconfigured 747 as Air Force One, it costs $100,219 an hour to operate, according to the Air Force. And that's just HIS plane. There also are cargo planes, used to fly in armored limousines, helicopters, staff and other equipment, as well as the Secret Service. A single Air Force C-17 cargo jet, for example, costs $6,960 an hour, according to the Congressional Research Service. A total of 77 other aircraft were used on one multi-country trip to Asia by former President Bill Clinton in 2000, according to the Air Force Times, including 14 C-17 Globemasters, 12 C-5 Galaxys, three C-141 Starlifters and two C-130 Hercules. ABC News at the time estimated the cost of that entire trip at $50 million. An Air Force Times story on March 27, 2000, said Clinton's trip to India and Pakistan "may be the most expensive such mission ever carried out by the Air Force." The reporters said the operation required hundreds of aircraft missions. They tagged the cost of the 5-day trip at $50 million as well. That comes to $10 million per day. Previous trips by the Clinton administration were less expensive, according to a September 1999 U.S. Government Accountability Office analysis of the costs for Clinton's 1998 trips to Africa, Chile and China. "Presidential travel to foreign destinations requires planning, coordination, and logistical and personnel support," the report stated. "The estimated incremental costs of President Clinton’s trips to Africa, Chile, and China were at least $42.8 million, $10.5 million, and $18.8 million, respectively. The largest of these costs consisted of operating expenses of the president’s aircraft and other military passenger and cargo aircraft; travel expenses, including lodging for the travelers; and telecommunications, vehicle, and other equipment rentals and procurement in the countries visited." We couldn't find any significant evidence that Obama's 3-day trip to India was going to be unusual in scope. According to Press Trust of India and the Times of India, two US Air Force Jumbos and four helicopters landed ahead of the president's visit; and Obama will be protected by a fleet of 34 warships, including an aircraft carrier. In addition, the Times story states: Obama is expected to fly by a helicopter -- Marine One -- from the city airport to the Indian Navy's helibase INS Shikra at Colaba in south Mumbai. From there, he will drive down in a Lincoln Continental -- the Presidential limousine -- to the nearby the Taj Hotel. Two jets, armed with advanced communication and security systems, and a fleet of over 40 cars will be part of Obama's convoy. Around 800 rooms have been booked for the President and his entourage in Taj Hotel and Hyatt. The President will have a security ring of American elite Secret Service, which are tasked to guard the President, along with National Security Guards (NSG) and personnel from central paramilitary forces and local police in Mumbai and Delhi. Similar arrangements will be in place in Delhi, with the Air Force One to be kept in all readiness throughout Obama's stay here from Sunday afternoon to Tuesday morning. That probably sounds like a lot, but it's pretty standard fare for presidential travel, several people familiar with such travel told us. James Gerstenzang, a former reporter who covered numerous foreign trips by presidents for the Los Angeles Times, laughed at the $200 million a day figure, which he guessed was probably "inflated by a factor of 10." And the claim about the entourage of 3,000 also seems grossly inflated, he said. He noted that any members of the press traveling with the president pay their own way, so that's not a cost borne by taxpayers. "It really bothers me when numbers like that get thrown around by both sides for political reasons, without it being backed up," Gerstenzang said. Veteran reporter David Jackson, who has traveled on a number of foreign trips by presidents, wrote for the USA Today, "No, President Obama's trip is not going to cost $200 million a day." "That figure -- first thrown out by a single Indian media outlet and now viral on conservative talk radio -- is wildly, wildly off the mark." And basing the claim on an estimate from an anonymous state government official in India is dubious at best. "I think you have to ask, 'How would they know how much any of this costs?'" said Gannon, the advance press director under George W. Bush "We don't share that with officials from foreign governments. I'd question where they got that number from. That does sound very inflated." As fact-checkers, we wish we had hard numbers from public documents to settle the issue of the cost of Obama's trip to India. But they don't exist. White House officials say details about foreign travel -- including the cost -- are not released for security reasons. So we don't know the cost to taxpayers of Obama's trip. But we think Bachmann and others have a responsibility to back up statistics they cite. And in this case, the backing appears to be one news story, relying on an anonymous state government official in India. People familiar with presidential travel say that estimate is way off, and they question how a government official in India would know anyway. And a report by the independent GAO backs that up: A trip to India by Clinton, regarded at the time as perhaps the most expensive in history, was estimated to cost $50 million, or $10 million per day. That alone should cause someone to question the $200 million a day figure. In short, we don't see any evidence to back up this statistic. And we rate Bachmann's claim False.

pomt-14095	Half of illegal immigrants "come on legal visas and then overstay."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/16/ken-cuccinelli/ken-cuccinelli-says-half-illegal-immigrants-have-o/	Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli says Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s plans for a border wall with Mexico has its limits in stemming the flow of unauthorized immigrants into the U.S. "Half the people who come into this country illegally don’t cross the border illegally," Cuccinelli, also a Republican, said recently during an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. "They come on legal visas and then overstay, and then we can’t find them." We examined Cuccinelli’s claim. Similar versions of this statement have been uttered by other Trump opponents, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who recently suspended his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. Cuccinelli was a key strategist for Cruz. Cuccinelli sent us several studies to back his point. He noted that in a 2004 report, the Government Accountability Office said three separate estimates culled from various surveys by the Department of Homeland Security found visa overstayers made up 27 percent, 31 percent and 57 percent of undocumented immigrants in three small surveys of immigrants. Two of those surveys asked immigrants caught in sting operations how they entered the country. The third survey asked green card holders whether they overstayed their visas or crossed into the U.S. illegally. "The percentages above do not represent the illegal population but, as indicated above, do provide some evidence that in all likelihood, a substantial proportion of illegal immigrants are overstays," the GAO said. Cuccinelli also pointed to a widely cited report by the Pew Research Center in 2006. It estimated "nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials." While the source data gave an estimate that said somewhere between 33 percent and 50 percent of undocumented immigrants were visa overstayers, the report went middle-of-the-road and called it 45 percent. Pew relied on a 1997 study by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS report concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the U.S. legally. The problem is that neither the INS nor its successor, the Department of Homeland Security, have provided updated statistics on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstayed visas since that aging study. Cuccinelli also cited a 2014 study by Robert Warren, a former INS demographer who worked on that federal agency’s 1997 report. Building on figures from the earlier INS report, Warren estimated that in 2012, visa overstayers comprised 58 percent of the people who became undocumented immigrants that year. Why do analysts estimate the number of visa overstays rather than relying on hard government figures? The reason is that while the U.S. does a good job getting information about foreign visitors when they enter the country, it does not collect reliable data from them when they depart, according to a report issued in January by The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank that examines immigration trends. Michelle Mittelstadt, the institute’s director of communications, said that in the absence of firm data from the government, analysts typically say that between one-third to one-half of unauthorized immigrants are people who have overstayed the time they were legally allowed to be in the U.S. "When we use those estimates, we are clear to note that this is based on some pretty historical work," Mittelstadt told us. "The reality is that there are no better estimates out there right now." Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that while estimates of undocumented immigrants have been stable since 2007, the number of people entering illegally across the southwestern U.S. border has "collapsed." That means that the proportion of those overstaying their visas likely is on the rise, he said. "The patterns of illegal immigration have changed since this question was last investigated," Nowrasteh wrote in an email. "Cuccinelli is likely closer to the truth today than he would have been in previous years." Our ruling Cuccinelli said half of illegal immigrants "come on legal visas and then overstay." This widely cited statistic stems from an estimate based on research going back to the 1990s. The federal government hasn’t provided updated statistics on overstayed visas, and subsequent research has focused on adapting the old data to new trends. Estimates in those reports have ranged from 27 percent to 58 percent of illegal immigrants overstaying their visas. So Cuccinelli is using what research shows to be a plausible figure. But he would be more accurate to refer to it as an estimate rather than a fact. We rate his statement Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d71a56ee-1b9e-47b2-b95a-bd509fe4c214	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2016-05-16T00:00:00	2016-05-02	['None']
pomt-10182	Obama says McCain went to Bermuda and "pledged to protect tax breaks for American corporations that hide their profits offshore."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/24/barack-obama/yes-mccain-said-he-would-oppose-some-changes/	An attack ad from Barack Obama looks at a trip John McCain made to Bermuda last year. "Bermuda. It’s more than just a vacation destination for John McCain," the ad says over jaunty, Caribbean-style steel drum music. "McCain went to Bermuda, and while he was there pledged to protect tax breaks for American corporations that hide their profits offshore. And grateful insurance company executives and their lobbyists who benefit from the tax scheme gave McCain $50,000." Bermuda, a British territory with significant autonomy, is home to many international companies seeking to avoid taxes. In 2006, there were 14,267 international companies registered in Bermuda, many of them American-owned, according to the U.S. State Department. A 2004 GAO report also listed Bermuda as a tax haven. McCain visited Bermuda in August 2007, when he was still competing for the Republican nomination. The only account we could find about the trip appeared in a Bermuda newspaper called the Royal Gazette . The Obama ad shows a copy of the newspaper while it makes its claim that McCain pledged to protect overseas tax breaks for American companies. You can read the entire Royal Gazette report online; here's the part where McCain talks about tax laws: "The Arizona senator, who spent three days on the island this week meeting business and political leaders, said he understood the concerns of the insurance and reinsurance sectors about draft legislation proposing a clampdown on U.S. business operations in so-called tax havens. He told the Royal Gazette: 'The industry, the reinsurance that's had such phenomenal success has been good for both nations. I would oppose any measures that would upset that.'" The McCain campaign responded to the Obama ad by pointing out that the Obama campaign rents office space from Accenture, which is based in Bermuda. The Chicago Sun-Times reported in 2007 that the Obama campaign was leasing the 11th floor of an office tower for its headquarters from Accenture. The company is based in Bermuda. Insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda are a high-profile issue, with U.S.-based insurance companies seeking to reverse a treaty with Bermuda that they say puts them at a disadvantage compared with their Bermuda-based competitors. The Obama campaign phrases McCain's comments in a negative light, but gets the substance largely correct. McCain said he would oppose attempts to change current law in regards to Bermuda, though he singled out the insurance and reinsurance industries for protection rather than all types of industries.

pomt-06504	Says Rick Perry co-chaired Al Gore’s campaign for president.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/12/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-rick-perry-co-chaired-al-gor/	Given a chance to question any other presidential candidate, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann opened her question for Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Oct. 11, 2011, Bloomberg/Washington Post debate by saying: "In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan introduced an economic miracle. And while all of us were wishing and yearning for a third term for Ronald Reagan, Gov. Perry, you were campaigning and co-chairing Al Gore's election campaign for president of the United States." Setting aside what Bachmann ultimately asked, we realized we’d previously explored the Perry-Gore connection. For more than a decade, news accounts and Perry critics said that as a Democratic legislator, Perry played a leadership role in then-U.S. Sen. Gore’s unsuccessful 1988 presidential bid. Yet when we revisited this topic in September, we found no evidence--not a pinch--that Perry had a ruling role. It’s the stuff of political legend--and it was all but unchallenged by Perry until after he launched his bid for president. However, interviews with political players in Texas and Tennessee and news articles from 1988 convinced us that, although Perry endorsed Gore, he was not his Texas chairman. Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Perry’s presidential campaign, told us by email: "We have no record or recollection of any leadership position" for Perry in Gore’s 1988 campaign. Asked why Perry did not say as much when a 1998 opponent repeatedly lofted such claims, Sullivan replied: "We did not (have) access to information about the Gore ’88 campaign organization and therefore 10 years later could not definitively say one way or the other." Perry says he voted for Republican George H.W. Bush in November 1988, Sullivan said. In an August 2011 blog post, Texas political journalist R.G. Ratcliffe, who also reports for the Austin American-Statesman, declared that Perry did not chair the Gore campaign in Texas. That prompted us to take a closer look at the Perry-Gore connection. Austin consultant George Shipley, who advised Gore’s 1988 campaign, told us in an interview that Perry "made, to my knowledge, one, possibly two press tours, but he was not what I would call that active in the campaign." Sherman lawyer Bob Slagle, who supported Gore while chairing the state’s Democratic Party, told us in an interview that Perry "may have been chairman for some area around Haskell County," Perry’s home county, but he was no more than that. Similarly, two staff members in Gore’s 1988 effort said Perry was not its Texas chief. Tennessee lawyer Tom Jurkovich, Gore’s Texas director, told us by email that "we may have named (Perry) to a ‘steering committee’ or as one of several campaign ‘co-chairs,’ typically honorific titles with no real role ... (Perry) wasn't highly involved in the campaign, however, and had zero operational responsibility." Mike Kopp of Nashville, who did press outreach for Gore, was more emphatic, saying in an interview: "We didn’t have a chairman in Texas; we didn’t have co-chairs," either. "We weren’t that organized; we didn’t have that strong a ground game." Perry, who switched to the Republican Party in 1989 before winning his first statewide office in 1990, has since said he realized around that time that Gore was not his man. Still, he did not— could not—deny he’d come aboard with 27 fellow Texas House Democrats who endorsed Gore at a Jan. 5, 1988, Texas Capitol press conference. Perry and the other legislators saw Gore as the best conservative Democrat in a field that included Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Missouri U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. A Jan. 7, 1988, news article in the Abilene Reporter-News quotes Dusty Garison, Perry’s district aide, saying: "Rick thinks it’s important that conservative Texans who have traditionally voted in the Democratic Party not vote in the Republican Party simply because they want to vote for a conservative presidential candidate." Gore, Garison said, appears to be a candidate who can bring the party back to "mainstream America." But Gore’s candidacy faded after he fared poorly in Southern primaries. He wound up third in the March 1988 Texas primary, trailing Dukakis and Jackson. Garison told us in an interview he didn’t remember Perry having an official position in Gore’s campaign. Perry's "chairmanship" appears to have originated as a campaign attack that stuck after it was seemingly confirmed by Perry himself. Sprinkle in Nexis fever—the tendency of journalists to echo news clips they find using the Nexis database—and the legend abides. A review of news articles archived by the Legislative Reference Library shows that Democrat John Sharp made the charge about Perry’s leadership role in the Gore campaign when Sharp faced Perry in the 1998 race for lieutenant governor. In March 1998, Perry’s camp pressed Sharp to say whom he’d support in that year’s governor’s race between Gov. George W. Bush and Democrat Garry Mauro. Sullivan was quoted in a March 15, 1998, Dallas Morning News article as saying that while Perry would back Bush, Sharp had "supported Mike Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992, (Democratic Gov.) Ann Richards in 1994 and was preparing to run against Gov. Bush in 1997. In 1998, will John Sharp continue his long opposition to the Bush family in Texas or change his position for political gain?" "Texans deserve a straight and honest answer," Sullivan said. The newspaper reported Sharp’s campaign then claiming that Perry served as a state vice chairman for Gore’s 1988 presidential campaign in the state. In an April 1998 debate with Perry, Sharp charged Perry with being Gore’s "co-campaign manager," the Fort Worth Star-Telegram then reported. In a Sept. 15, 1998, Dallas Morning News article, Sharp is quoted making the "co-chairman" claim again. Perry acknowledged that, the story says, but said there was a "push to get a conservative Southerner" elected president. "Going through that was part of what started me through the process of changing parties in 1989," he told the newspaper. "I came to my senses." It was Perry’s September 1998 acknowledgment that fed our conclusion in a January 2010 fact check that there was some truth to Republican gubernatorial candidate Debra Medina’s claim that Perry had been Gore’s "campaign manager." We again leaned on the 1998 article in rating Mostly True a similar claim by Rep. Ron Paul. When we revisited this topic, Sharp acknowledged he was making a charge he could not prove. Sharp, who lost a second bid for lieutenant governor in 2002, later helped devise a business tax overhaul at Perry’s behest. He’s now chancellor of the Texas A&M University System. By text message, Sharp agreed Perry wasn’t chairman of Gore’s 1988 Texas campaign. Reminded that he said things otherwise on the hustings, Sharp said: "Never could prove it." We couldn’t prove it either. We failed to find campaign-related documents potentially listing titles, if any, given to the Texas legislators who came out for Gore. Interviews suggest campaign leadership titles may have been casually shared. Hugo Berlanga, a former legislator who was then speaker pro tempore of the Texas House, said in an interview that the members committing to Gore, who was then a U.S. senator, were going to be his Texas co-chairs. "The bottom line, whether he was a coordinator or co chair, (Perry) was involved," Berlanga said. Bobby Aikin, also among legislators then for Gore, said in an interview: "I think each one of us claimed to be a co-chair or coordinator or some-such like that." So, say so long to the "Chairman Perry" legend? Sure, barring contradictory evidence. All in all, Perry indeed endorsed Gore for president, but he did not hold a campaign leadership post.

pomt-03859	Says, "I-205, six miles of which runs through my district, already carries more traffic than I-5."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/12/jackie-dingfelder/does-interstate-205-carry-more-traffic-interstate-/	Critics of a $3.4 billion plan to replace the current Interstate 5 bridge connecting Portland and Vancouver say that tolling the bridge will send drivers elsewhere -- spreading the rush hour gridlock around instead of solving it. Backers are relying on money from tolling to help pay for a new bridge. That was the concern that Sen. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Portland, was channeling during a floor speech in opposition to House Bill 2800, which authorized the state to sell $450 million worth of bonds for the project, known as the Columbia River Crossing. The controversial bill has cleared both chambers and Gov. John Kitzhaber’s signature is expected Tuesday. In her speech, Dingfelder said she worried that toll-wary travelers would seek out refuge on Interstate 205, using the Glenn Jackson Bridge to cross the Columbia. "I-205, six miles of which runs through my district, already carries more traffic than I-5," Dingfelder said, so piling on more will hurt her neighborhood. We snapped to attention at her assertion that I-205 carries more traffic. Has I-205, completed in 1983 as a bypass corridor for I-5 traffic, surpassed its older sibling with regards to traffic over the bridges? We went to the Oregon Department of Transportation for the answer. The agency tracks how many vehicles pass at certain points along all of its freeways. Those records show that in 2011, 123,900 "average daily trips" were recorded on I-5 at the Interstate Bridge. On I-205, 138,700 trips were recorded at the Glenn Jackson Bridge. The trips include both northbound and southbound. So I-205 has 11 percent more traffic at the bridge. And we suppose that makes sense, since the Glenn Jackson Bridge is nearly twice as wide as the Interstate Bridge. Ruling: We don’t know how many motorists would head over to I-205 to avoid a toll, but we do know that Dingfelder’s right. More cars already travel across the I-205 bridge than the I-5 bridge. We rate this statement True.	None	Jackie Dingfelder	None	None	None	2013-03-12T03:00:00	2013-03-04	['None']
pomt-02991	"Live cats have holes drilled into their skulls," posts put into their heads and coils put into their eyes, and some have had their ears cut off or are intentionally deafened or starved at UW-Madison labs that do research to improve hearing in humans.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/18/people-ethical-treatment-animals/cats-have-holes-drilled-their-heads-undergo-other-/	Using a robo-call and a video, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals condemned experiments on cats that are done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in an effort to improve hearing in humans. Yes, felines, as in your pet Fluffy. It turns out the UW has used domestic cats in such experiments for more than 30 years. PETA’s automated call, which doubles as the soundtrack for the video, was recorded by comedian and PETA activist Bill Maher. According to the animal rights group, the call went to more than 100,000 phone numbers on and near the UW-Madison campus on Oct. 8, 2013. That was several days before Maher did comedy shows in Madison and Milwaukee. On the call and in the video, which shows graphic images of cats being used in experiments at the UW, Maher says: "On this very campus, dozens of live cats have holes drilled into their skulls, steel posts screwed to their heads and metal coils implanted in their eyes. Some cats have had their ears cut off. Others are intentionally deafened. Most of us find it hard to miss a single meal, but these cats are starved for up to six days straight for experimental sessions lasting for hours." Stark allegations. UW-Madison responded the same day with a statement saying "there is no factual basis" for them. And yet, "Many of the individual facts are true," veterinary school professor Eric Sandgren, director of the Research Animal Resources Center at UW-Madison, told us two days later. "But the implication" that the experiments amount to cruelty "is not," he said. Let’s do some research of our own on the various parts of PETA’s claim. Why cats This item is not about whether researchers should use cats to try to improve hearing in humans; PETA opposes all use of animals in experiments. But here’s some of UW’s rationale for doing so: The design and improvement of hearing aids, as well as cochlear implants, which are surgically implanted devices that can help people with severe hearing loss, rely on the work of the UW cat research, Sandgren wrote on the UW website. The work is "well-respected across the world and widely cited in the literature, with nearly 5,000 citations over the years. Thus, any medical advances in this area will use (the) work as a starting point." The cat research is aimed at trying to understand how the brain works. It requires recording and studying a real functioning brain, which can't be ethically done in humans, according to UW. Cats are used because they have nervous system and auditory systems very similar to those in humans. The experiments help researchers understand how the brain integrates information from the two ears, UW says. This circuitry plays a major role in humans' ability to detect signals in the presence of background noise, which is the major symptom of elderly people with hearing loss. That in turn helps improve the design of hearing aids and cochlear implants. PETA’s Jeremy Beckham, who manages the group’s investigations of labs, told us that despite more than three decades of experiments on cats, UW "has absolutely nothing to show for it" and that experiments on humans are more ethical and have more potential to help improve hearing. PETA’s targeting of the cat experiments made news in February 2013. A staff member of the group and actor James Cromwell (Oscar nomination for "Babe") were arrested after bursting into a University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents meeting in Madison and shouting that the research is torture, not science. Seven months later, in September 2013, the federal Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, a part of the National Institutes of Health, filed a report after investigating allegations by PETA that the UW-Madison cat experiments violated policy on the humane care of lab animals. The office found no such violations, although it said UW needed to improve procedures for controlling infections. For this fact-check, we received information from PETA, including an internal protocol form completed by UW researchers outlining their cat experiments, which the group obtained through an open records request. We also obtained information from UW through an interview with professor Sandgren and an article he wrote; and responses the university made to the federal investigation. We’ll break the claim by PETA into its various parts, using some of the script Maher read from. "Dozens of live cats have holes drilled into their skulls, steel posts screwed to their heads and metal coils implanted in their eyes" PETA noted that in the protocol form, filed in 2008, UW said it had been using a total of about 30 cats per year. However, Sandgren said the form lists 30 as only the maximum of cats that might be used in experiments. As for the drill, post and coils procedure, it has been performed on 18 cats over the past 10 years. He said he believes 18 is the total number since the experiments began. In the procedure, according to UW, cats are "deeply anesthetized" for surgery, then a hole is drilled in the head in order to implant an electrode in the brain. A head-holding stainless steel post is implanted on the skull with 10 to 15 small titanium screws. Extremely thin Teflon-coated coils are implanted around the eyeball. The head posts are "nearly identical to part of the ‘halo apparatus’ used in humans to keep the head from moving after a spine injury," Sandgren said in the article he wrote. The surgery is done to "stabilize the head during experiments and monitor eye movements to measure the cats’ ability to localize sounds." Because the coils are not placed in the eye or cornea, "they are not likely painful to the animals. The procedure and technique has been utilized for many years in different species in labs around the world." So, PETA overstates the number of cats that have undergone the procedure but describes the procedure accurately. "Some cats have had their ears cut off. Others are intentionally deafened." Unlike the current experiments, in which cats can remain in the UW lab for a period of years, until roughly 2005 some experiments were done in which cats were euthanized before the experiments ended, Sandgren said. In those cases, the outer ears were removed so that more precise recordings could be done. PETA's Beckham told us contended that some of those cats lived for a few days after the procedure before being euthanized. As for intentional deafening, around 2008 or 2009, UW did a pilot study in which two cats were intentionally deafened with an antibiotic in order to explore whether bilateral cochlear implants provide more effective sound localization, and therefore better hearing, than single implants. The study did not produce significant results so it was not repeated, Sandgren said. Again, PETA is partially accurate on this part of its claim. In the past, parts of ears were cut off of cats who were then euthanized. But the deafening procedure is no longer done. "These cats are starved for up to six days straight for experimental sessions lasting for hours." PETA cited a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in October 2012 by a former UW veterinarian who was involved in the cat experiments. He said that one reason cats were getting infections is their overall health suffered because of "sporadic calorie deprivation." Beckham, citing the UW’s protocol document, claimed some cats were completely deprived of food for up to six days. Sandgren told us cats would likely be unable to perform tasks for experiments and could die if they were completely denied food for up to six days. He said the cats are in fact given less food than they want, in an attempt to get them to perform tasks for their experiments -- which can last for several hours -- for which they are rewarded with food. He said the cats are regularly weighed and examined to ensure they are in good health. The federal investigation found that the seven cats being used in experiments at the time were in "excellent clinical condition." So, this part of PETA’s claim is overstated. Cats are given limited amounts of food during experiments, not starved for up to six days. Our rating PETA said: "Live cats have holes drilled into their skulls," posts put into their heads and coils put into their eyes, and some have had their ears cut off or are intentionally deafened or starved at UW-Madison labs that do research to improve hearing in humans. Overall, some of the various parts of the statement were partially accurate, others were not. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-03369	"Upwards of 90 percent" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/12/rachel-campos-duffy/more-90-women-change-their-minds-about-having-abor/	The same day the state Senate approved a bill requiring women to get an ultrasound before getting an abortion, Rachel Campos-Duffy appeared at a Wisconsin Right to Life gathering in Appleton. The controversial bill drew striking comments from some senators. One Republican said abortions "became the thing to do" in the 1960s and a Democrat said the bill was government trying to "find its way into a woman’s vagina." Meanwhile, Campos-Duffy -- a conservative pundit, occasional host of "The View" TV show and wife of U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Hayward -- made her own eye-catching statement about ultrasounds and abortion. In connection with the June 12, 2013, Right to Life event, she did a video interview with the Appleton Post-Crescent newspaper, saying: "So, it really doesn’t make sense to me when people who purport to be advocates for women suddenly say, ‘Oh, we don’t need those pesky ultrasounds, you don’t need all of that information,’" Campos-Duffy said. "It seems very dubious, their motivation, because we always want the patient to have as much information as possible. "Now, it's true that once a father or a mother who are seeking an abortion see an ultrasound, it's true that upwards of 90 percent of them decide not to have an abortion. Our opposition may not like those results, but those are what people decide after they have all the facts in front of them." Do more than 90 percent of women seeking an abortion decide not to get one after seeing their ultrasound? The law Gov. Scott Walker signed the bill July 5, 2013. Besides ultrasounds, the law requires doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges. A judge has temporarily blocked the requirement on doctors, but the ultrasound provision remains in effect. Before a woman can get an abortion, an ultrasound must be performed. There are exceptions for a medical emergency or in cases in which the pregnancy is the result of incest or sexual assault, if those crimes have been reported to police. The person performing the ultrasound must describe what is being shown and provide the woman an opportunity to see the ultrasound images. But the woman can't be required to view the images. Eleven other, mostly southern states have adopted laws that require an ultrasound before abortion although the laws are in effect in only nine of the states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group focusing on reproductive health issues. The states are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia. However, North Carolina’s law is temporarily unenforceable pending a court decision and Oklahoma is permanently blocked by court order. Campos-Duffy’s evidence As for Campos-Duffy’s claim that "upwards of 90 percent" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have one after seeing an ultrasound, she told us her source was the Knights of Columbus. She cited a page on the Catholic group's website that describes how the group helps bring ultrasound machines to "pro-life pregnancy help centers." "Reports indicate that up to 90 percent of women considering an abortion choose to have their baby after seeing an ultrasound image," the website said. "They hear their baby’s heartbeat, they see their baby’s head and fingers. They know it is a child, not a ‘choice.'" But that's merely a statement similar to Campos-Duffy's, not evidence that her statement is correct. Joe Cullen, of the Knights of Columbus’ national office in New Haven, Conn., told us his group based its 90 percent statement on statements by two other organizations -- Focus on the Family and ICU Mobile. Like the Knights of Columbus, both groups help supply ultrasound machines for anti-abortion pregnancy centers. Interestingly, the Knights removed the 90 percent statement from its website after we heard from Cullen. Let’s see what the other two organizations have to say. Focus on the Family Focus on the Family is a multi-faceted organization in Colorado Springs, Colo., founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. It provides grants to pregnancy centers for ultrasound machines. Focus on the Family claims that since its ultrasound program began in 2004, "the estimated number of babies saved" is more than 201,000. But the group told us it doesn’t claim that any particular percentage of women seeking an abortion change their minds after seeing their ultrasound. ICU Mobile ICU Mobile, based in Akron, Ohio, makes a claim similar to Campos-Duffy’s, saying on its website that "86.9 percent of women considering an abortion who see their baby aboard an ICU Mobile choose life." The website says the statistic is for 2010 and breaks down this way: The mobile units provided ultrasound images to 1,389 women; 613 were "abortion minded or abortion vulnerable"; and 533 of them, or 86.9 percent, "made a decision for life." That statistic, though unverified, helps Campos-Duffy’s claim a little, but it applies to a relatively small number of women and there are some other caveats. The women are categorized by ICU Mobile as being undecided but leaning toward having an abortion. And the group does not indicate how it determines whether a woman, after receiving an ultrasound, ultimately gave birth or had an abortion. Indeed, ICU Mobile’s claim is much lower for women who had decided to have an abortion before they saw an ultrasound. Just over half of those women change their mind after the ultrasound, the group claims. Other sources Other sources do not support Campos-Duffy’s contention -- at least not for the 90 percent claim she made. University of California, San Francisco: Researchers interviewed 20 women who received an ultrasound "as part of their abortion care" and published a study in November 2012. The women’s responses "offer support for anti-abortion claims that ultrasound viewing can dissuade women from abortion, as well as support for abortion rights claims that viewing an ultrasound can cause emotional difficulty for a woman planning to abort." But in a separate article, one of the researchers, Tracy Weitz, director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the university, said "no peer-reviewed empirical data has supported this proposition that viewing an ultrasound image discourages women from abortion." University of British Columbia: In a study published in 2009, researchers gave questionnaires to 350 women who came to two abortion clinics, asking if they wanted to view an ultrasound. Nearly 73 percent got the ultrasound and 86 percent of them described it as a positive experience. But none changed their minds about having an abortion. University of Texas at Austin: Researchers there and from the University of Alabama at Birmingham gave surveys to 318 women who sought abortions at clinics in six Texas cities in 2012; 72 percent looked at their ultrasound. Before their consultation and ultrasound, 92 percent of those women said they were sure of their decision, or that abortion was a better choice for them. Afterward, the percentage was unchanged. We’ll also note that the conservative Family Research Council in Washington, D.C. cites on its website various statements indicating that women are more likely to opt not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound; one pregnancy center director in Baton Rouge, La., is quoted as saying that "98 percent of women who have ultrasounds choose to carry to term." But the council makes no claim and provides no evidence indicating that on a national level upwards of 90 percent of women seeking an abortion change their minds after seeing an ultrasound. Our rating Campos-Duffy said "upwards of 90 percent" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. Research indicates that some women seeking an abortion change their mind after having an ultrasound. But, while one anti-abortion organization claims a figure of nearly 90 percent for its ultrasound program among a certain group of women, there is no solid evidence to back Campos-Duffy’s sweeping claim. We rate her statement False.	None	Rachel Campos-Duffy	None	None	None	2013-07-12T10:29:18	2013-06-12	['None']

pomt-12813	The United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit is "the most overturned court in the country."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/10/sean-hannity/no-9th-circuit-isnt-most-overturned-court-country-/	Fox News host Sean Hannity says it’s no surprise that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against President Donald Trump and his executive order on immigration. "We have both been predicting for days now the 9th Circuit — the most liberal court of appeals, the most overturned court in the country — it would act this way," Hannity said on his show Feb. 9, speaking with a guest. Several states have sued the Trump administration over its executive order that temporarily blocks immigration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending. So lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States and Alaska and Hawaii. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge’s decision. (The court didn’t rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.) It’s possible the administration will try to appeal their case again, this time to the Supreme Court. Right after the judges handed down their decision, Trump tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" As Hannity noted, the 9th Circuit has a reputation for being liberal. But we wondered if he was correct when he said the Supreme Court overturns more cases from the 9th Circuit than any other appeals court in the country — the implication being that the 9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court. In our research, we found that the 9th Circuit has a higher-than-average reversal rate, but not the highest. Additionally, experts told us that counting reversals doesn’t necessarily say much about the quality or substance of the 9th Circuit’s work. The numbers To evaluate this claim, we turned to SCOTUSBlog’s Supreme Court statistics archive, specifically their Circuit Scorecards, which track how often the Supreme Court justices agree or disagree with the lower court decisions. The Supreme Court hears cases from the 50 state courts and 13 federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts. The cases that the Supreme Court chooses to take on are often disputed among the lower courts, complex, and problematic, so there’s a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will decide that the lower court’s decision was wrong. In fact, the Supreme Court reversed about 70 percent of cases it took between 2010-15. Among cases it reviewed from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it reversed about 79 percent. The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate is higher than average, but it’s not the absolute highest among the circuit courts. That distinction goes to the 6th Circuit, which serves Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee, with an 87 percent average between 2010-15. The 9th Circuit is in third place. 6th Circuit - 87 percent; 11th Circuit - 85 percent; 9th Circuit - 79 percent; 3rd Circuit - 78 percent; 2nd Circuit and Federal Circuit - 68 percent; 8th Circuit - 67 percent; 5th Circuit - 66 percent; 7th Circuit - 48 percent; DC Circuit - 45 percent; 1st Circuit and 4th Circuit - 43 percent; 10th Circuit - 42 percent. We also found that the 9th Circuit never had the highest reversal rate in any individual term between 2004-15. (That’s the farthest back we could go.) A spokesperson for Hannity pointed us to a 2014 article in National Review titled, "Ninth Circuit Leading the Pack for ‘Most Reversed.’ " But the evidence presented in the article does not support the headline. So Hannity’s claim that the 9th Circuit is the "most overturned court in the country" is incorrect. The Supreme Court only hears a handful of cases from each circuit each year, so the rate of reversal is highly variable, said Jonah Gelbach, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a statistician. In 2014, for instance, the 2nd Circuit had a reversal rate of 100 percent, which sounds pretty bad until you find out that the Supreme Court only heard one case from the 2nd Circuit that entire season. The 9th Circuit is by far the largest circuit. In the 12 months leading up to March, 31, 2015, just under 12,000 cases were filed in the 9th Circuit — more than 4,000 more than the next-largest circuit, the 5th Circuit. Despite that gigantic docket, the Supreme Court heard just 11 cases from the 9th Circuit in 2015, reversing eight. This means the Supreme Court generally reverses far less than 1 percent of all the cases the 9th Circuit (and other circuits) decide. "Given the small numbers of cases involved, it can be difficult to draw any serious conclusions from such statistics about the quality of the courts involved," Gelbach said. "Having said that, the 9th Circuit does seem to consistently have a high reversal rate over time." It’s possible that the sheer size of the 9th Circuit, as well as some of its procedures, cause it to produce more "outlier decisions," which are cases the Supreme Court always reverses, than other circuits — leading to a higher reversal rate, said University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt. Roosevelt said there might have been a time in the past when the 9th Circuit was considerably more liberal than the Supreme Court, stemming from the fact that Democratic President Jimmy Carter didn’t get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice, though he did appoint several judges to the 9th Circuit. Today, the 9th Circuit might still have the highest number of Democratic appointees of any appeals court, but there’s been enough turnover in the past few decades that it’s not as much of an outlier, Roosevelt said. Our ruling Hannity said the 9th Circuit is "the most overturned court in the country." While the 9th Circuit has a higher than average reversal rate among cases it sends to the Supreme Court, it has not had the highest rate since at least 2004 (the oldest data point we could find). Even if it did, experts told us that the massive size of the 9th Circuit compared to the handful of cases it sends to the Supreme Court every year make reversal rates an imperfect measure of the quality of the 9th Circuit’s decisions. More broadly, experts say this statistic is a poor way of comparing courts. We rate Hannity’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/71a91833-9701-4d94-8ae4-023f5a3fe5d6	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2017-02-10T17:29:21	2017-02-09	['None']
pomt-11820	Says a Washington Post reporter who broke news on Judge Roy Moore story has a criminal history of "faking."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/14/blog-posting/no-washington-post-roy-moore-reporter-doesnt-have-/	A website seeking to discredit sexual assault allegations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore is digging up the alleged criminal record of a Washington Post reporter who helped break the story. "WaPo reporter who broke news on Judge Roy Moore story has a criminal history of ‘faking,’ " read the headline on 100percentfedup.com. The headline on the story might make you think the reporter, Stephanie McCrummen, has a past of "faking" her news stories. But the details in the post aren’t related to journalism: They highlight McCrummen’s "public criminal records in multiple states stretching across four time zones," including writing a "fake check." "When a reporter has a criminal history that essentially proves she gave false information to pay a debt or for services, shouldn’t her character come into question when it comes to making a 40-year-old sexual allegation against one of the most-hated, Steve Bannon-backed conservatives running for office in America, that may help to enhance her career?" the blogpost reads. The story was shared over 24,000 times and cited a 2011 Red State blog post that similarly sought to discredit McCrummen following a report that was critical of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Again, none of the charges speak to McCrummen’s journalistic integrity. The only criminal violation and "faking" related to a bounced check written 25 years ago when McCrummen was in college, while the rest of her "history" encompassed traffic infractions. McCrummen was an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1992 when she wrote a $6.93 check that bounced. "That was a bounced check was for groceries while Stephanie was in college, which she paid back," said Kristine Coratti, vice president of communications at the Washington Post, in response to our email inquiry to McCrummen. McCrummen pleaded guilty to the criminal misdemeanor charge, appeared before a magistrate and paid it off, alongside a $50 fee, according to James Stanford, the Orange County Superior Court clerk. Traffic violations The blogpost then pivots to McCrummen’s traffic offenses, the first of which was for speeding in Scottsdale, Ariz. "In 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona’s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges," the post reads. "After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction." Traffic offenses can be criminal if the driver is found driving without a license or the excessive speed was not prudent for the conditions. But the court authorities doubt this was the case. "If it was criminal it would probably still be in the records because those are retained longer than civil traffic case, but we just can’t know for sure," said Jennifer Ilten, executive secretary at the Scottsdale city court. Heather Murphy, communications director at the Arizona Supreme Court, said the court where the fine was paid wasn’t a "criminal court," but rather, municipal. Murphy confirmed that McCrummen owed -- and paid -- $321.30, according to court records. "The fine is fairly typical of a civil traffic violation for speeding or another moving violation, but I cannot state that as fact," Murphy said. "This is not driving without a license or DUI – those fines begin in excess of $1,000. "Even knowing the fare amount, a big chunk of that could have been the collection fees," Ilten said. "It was probably a lesser charge." Murphy also explained that FARE enforcement is much less sinister than the post made it sound. It usually occurs when a person doesn’t receive a citation because it went to an old address. A new citation is mailed to the new address when discovered. In this case, the ticket was entered for collection on Oct. 4, 2010, and paid in full on Oct. 23, 2010. The other two traffic tickets both occurred in Virginia and had been wiped from the courts. In Fairfax County, the post reported McCrummen failed to obey a highway sign -- an infraction, not a criminal offense. The same goes for Prince William County; the post said McCrummen drove at 46 miles an hour in a 25 mile per hour speed zone. That’s also not a criminal offense. Coratti declined to comment on McCrummen’s traffic infractions. Our ruling A 100percentfedup.com blog post said McCrummen "has a criminal history of ‘faking.’ " The faking, here, isn’t really faking at all -- and certainly not in a way that would question the veracity of this report. The reporter in question wrote a bounced check while in college in 1992 for $6.93. The reporter paid back the money and a $50 fee. Case closed. We rate this statement False.

pomt-07526	Under a House Republican appropriations bill, "6 million seniors are deprived of meals."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/06/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-gop-bill-would-deprive-six-milli/	CORRECTION: In the initial version of the story, we speculated that the number of people who could be deprived of meals due to the proposed cuts could range from 2 million to 4 million. However, an alert reader pointed out that we neglected to factor in the obvious reality that people eat every day, so the number of people affected would be much smaller. We have revised this item to reflect that. However, this error doesn’t affect our ruling of Half True, since we still believe that Pelosi’s estimate of 6 million meals was calculated reasonably, and that her error came from misspeaking as she described the statistic at the public event. On April 4, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made an appearance with a group called the Hunger Fast Coalition in which she took aim at her Republican rivals’ budget priorities. "In one of the bills before us, 6 million seniors are deprived of meals – homebound seniors are deprived of meals," Pelosi said. "People ask us to find our common ground, the middle ground. Is middle ground 3 million seniors not receiving meals? I don’t think so. We’ve got to take this conversation from a debate about numbers and dollar figures and finding middle ground there, to the higher ground of national values. I don’t think the American people want any one of those 6 million people to lose their meals." The comment attracted a fair amount of attention in the blogosphere, so we thought it was worth a check. We’ll focus on whether 6 million seniors would in fact be denied meals if Republican budget plans are enacted. When we contacted Pelosi’s office, they walked us through their calculations. But first, they acknowledged an error in Pelosi’s remark: She should have said "6 million meals for seniors," not meals for "6 million seniors." So right from the beginning, we’ll have to downgrade her original comment’s accuracy. Setting that aside, how good is the rest of Pelosi’s math? First, Pelosi’s office elaborated that the Republican bill she was referring to was H.R. 1, a fiscal year 2011 spending bill that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a 44-56 vote on March 9, 2011. The bill specifies that aging services programs within the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration on Aging will get about $1.4 million. That’s roughly 5 percent below the funding for those programs during fiscal year 2010. This 5 percent cut is relevant to Pelosi’s comment because it refers to the budget category that includes federal nutrition programs for seniors. According to HHS, these programs are designed to "reduce hunger and food insecurity; promote socialization of older individuals; and promote the health and well-being of older individuals and delay adverse health conditions through access to nutrition and other disease prevention and health promotion services." Generally speaking, this funding goes either toward "Home-Delivered Nutrition Services," which helps deliver meals to homebound seniors, and "Congregate Nutrition Services," which provides meals at senior centers and other centralized locations. In fiscal year 2010, total funding for these nutrition programs was just under $819.5 million. Cutting 5 percent from this amount would mean a reduction of nearly $41 million. Pelosi’s office said when they made the calculations, they actually used a more conservative estimate -- a 3.6 percent reduction -- so by their math, the cut would actually be $30 million. And how deep is the impact of either a 3.6 percent cut or a 5 percent cut? We found data for fiscal year 2009 showing that the program funded roughly 149.2 million home-delivered meals and 92.5 million centralized meals. Together, that adds up to about 242 million meals. A 5 percent cut from that amount would be 12.1 million meals. A 3.6 percent cut would affect 8.7 million meals. But once again, Pelosi’s calculations were conservative. Her office used 193 million meals as its baseline, rather than 242 million. Using this smaller starting point, a 5 percent cut would mean a reduction of 9.7 million meals, while a 3.6 percent cut would mean a reduction of 6.9 million meals. The 6.9 million figure, her office said, is the source of the statistic Pelosi cited in her appearance with the Hunger Fast Coalition. As far as we can tell, Pelosi’s math seems sound -- at every turn, she erred on the cautious side, up to and including the final step, in which she rounded 6.9 million down to 6 million, rather than up to 7 million, which would have been entirely justified. So 6 million meals is a conservative estimate; the true number could well be higher, and her methodology provides her with a large cushion for error. In other words, Pelosi’s problem wasn’t her math; it was how she reported her math at the event. So ultimately, Pelosi is wrong, but we think she deserves credit for taking a cautious approach in cobbling together her numbers. On balance, we rate he claim Half True.

pomt-04120	"In the four years before I became governor, we increased state debt $5.2 billion. We've paid it down $2 billion."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/09/rick-scott/rick-scott-hits-charlie-crist-state-debt/	Gov. Rick Scott is decking Charlie Crist on Florida’s debt. Speculation abounds that Crist, who recently became a Democrat but was a Republican when he served as governor, will challenge Scott’s 2014 re-election bid. "In the four years before I became governor, we increased state debt $5.2 billion. We've paid it down $2 billion," Scott said in response to a question about possibly running against Crist during a December interview with CBS-4 Miami. "That’s going to cost you money down the road, so we’re doing the right thing." Scott’s talking point on the debt is part of a broader strategy to contrast the dour economy Florida experienced during the Crist years with the state’s turnaround since 2011. PolitiFact Florida wanted to check Scott’s arithmetic and evaluate the point he’s trying to make about each leader’s influence on the debt. It’s going to be fun -- don’t reach for your Facebook tab! Debt downlow We hear a lot about the perils of the $16.4 trillion national debt, accumulated over years of the federal government borrowing money to pay for the cost of running the country. State debt is a very different animal. Unlike the federal government, Florida is bound by law to balance its budget every year. However, the state is allowed to borrow money to pay for capital improvement projects, such as university buildings, roads and environmental preservation. There are a few different ways to talk about state debt. There’s the overall total for outstanding debt, which was $26.2 billion as of June 30, 2012. But within that are two categories. The largest chunk ($21.6 billion in 2012) is called "net-tax supported debt," which is accrued when the state issues bonds to raise money for spending projects. The smaller part ($4.6 billion in 2012) is "self-supporting debt," which is accrued by bonds that come with a revenue source, such as toll roads and dorm construction. This is our second check on Scott and the state debt. In 2011, we rated his claim that Florida’s debt was $23 million as True, even though he was referring to net tax-supported debt and not total debt. Experts told us then it was okay for him to use that figure. This time, Scott appears to be referring to the total outstanding debt. Whose debt is it anyway? Just as there are different ways to count the debt, there are different ways to assign responsibility for it. We can figure out how much debt Florida accumulated during the Crist years by looking through the archives of the Division of Bond Finance, which publishes an annual report on the debt picture. Scott's press office directed us to the division's most recent Debt Affordability Report. Using that, we created a chart to show the total outstanding debt (in billions of dollars) over recent fiscal years. FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 FY 2011 FY 2012 $23 $24.1 $24.3 $26.4 $28.2 $27.7 $26.2 Scott’s math works if you compare the fiscal year ending in 2006 with the one ending in 2010 (+$5.2 billion), and then 2010 with the 2012 fiscal year (-$2 billion). But some experts told us the better way to compare debt between governors is by examining the budgets over which the governor actually had control to veto spending. Crist was elected in 2006 and took office in January 2007. That means the first budget he signed -- which included projects in need of bond financing -- covered the 2008 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2008. The last budget Crist signed was for the 2011 fiscal year, which ended six months into Scott’s tenure. So, to some experts, it’s more accurate to assess the growth of the debt under Crist from FY 2008 to FY 2011. This method produces an increase of $3.4 billion in debt, which is still large but not as big as the $5.2 billion that Scott claimed. Scott gets the same treatment. He took office in January 2011, so the first budget he signed covered the budget year running July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. Under this measure, Scott reduced the debt only $1.5 billion. All of that said, no one denies the total debt fell sharply with Scott, who is famously debt-averse. It’s short of his $2 billion talking point now, but it probably won’t be when we get an analysis of debt from the 2012-13 budget, said Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of tax research. "He’s only had one year that’s been reflected, but certainly I think we’ll find that last year was a relatively low bonding year as well," Wenner said. We should note there’s still another way to analyze debt: debt actually issued by a governor. We won’t go through all the numbers here, because they’re yet again different from the numbers Scott used. But they do reflect the same trend of debt rising under Crist and dropping under Scott. What was happening? Even during the worst of Florida’s recession, Florida borrowed money for capital projects, all the while maintaining its credit ratings with various agencies. "We’ve been very well managed financially even during the downturn," said Ben Watkins, executive director of the state’s Division of Bond Finance. "We’re very conservative." The sharp decline in debt is due to the state’s discontinued borrowing for acquiring conservation land and the decline of the state’s largest borrowing program, called Public Education Capital Outlay, or PECO, for public school, college and university construction projects. The decades-old program is paid for by a tax on electric, gas and telecommunications services, a source that has shriveled over recent years as Floridians conserve energy and ditch landline phones. In 2012, there was no PECO borrowing because of a serious drop-off in collections from the tax. Higher ed advocates said the PECO shortfall signaled a "crisis in infrastructure funding" that would limit the state’s ability to educate college students. At the University of South Florida, for example, a new learning center has gone unfinished as it awaits more PECO money. In his first year, Scott vetoed $474 million in bonds, including dozens of improvement and construction projects at state colleges and universities. Scott lowered debt issuance to $416 million, its lowest level since 1990 and significantly less than the $2 billion yearly average for the previous decade. Conversely, the rapid increase in debt after 2002 was driven mostly by the 2002 class-size amendment added to the Constitution by Florida voters that year. It required the Legislature to reduce class sizes by adding more classrooms. It cost the state $2.5 billion to build more class space, which included $1.9 billion in lottery revenue bonds, said David Jacobson, a spokesman for Moody’s Investors Service. That program is essentially over, he said, which contributes to the debt falling. As education commissioner, Crist said he supported the goal of reducing class size but was concerned with costs. Eric Draper, executive director of Audubon of Florida, said he hopes Scott allows the state to issue more debt for land conservation this year because it makes long-term sense. "As you’re building houses, they need parks, clean water," he said. "Somebody’s got to pay to preserve the land where the water comes from." So far, the Scott administration has tried to get rid of state land, with the Department of Environmental Protection at one time proposing to sell off $50 million worth of land. "Under Gov. Crist, we didn’t see a proposal like that," Draper said. "(He) was a big supporter of the state’s land acquisition programs. Gov. Scott has been markedly less encouraging." Experts in a Bloomberg story called Florida’s drastic debt reduction a "pretty rare achievement" that sets Florida apart from the five most populous states. Our ruling We give Scott some credit for his broader point about the debt’s steady rise under Crist and sharp decline under his tenure. But the numbers he uses are not accurate if you consider the budget years over which Crist could have exerted any control. Moreover, some bonds Florida issued were to pay for programs in the works before Crist took over, or the Legislature shares at least some of the blame for putting it in the budget. Finally, there was a spike in the debt after 2002 that was driven by a constitutional amendment to limit class sizes. Voters approved that measure, and the state government was required to put it into action. Overall, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03959	Says, "Statistics indicate that one in eight children, and one in 18 adults in Oregon suffers from mental illness."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/16/peter-courtney/do-one-eight-oregon-children-and-one-18-adults-suf/	Oregon Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, doesn’t tend to throw his personal weight behind many public bills. That’s why the Oregon Capitol stood at attention when Courtney called for more money -- new money, dedicated money -- to pay for a game-changing boost in mental health services for children and adults. In an accompanying press release, his office noted that: "Statistics indicate that one in eight children, and one in 18 adults in Oregon suffers from mental illness. The Oregon Health Authority also reports that the state is currently serving less than half the adults and slightly more than one-third of the young people who need treatment." PolitiFact Oregon was skeptical. Those stats seem high. The Senate president’s office directed us to the Oregon Health Authority. People there sent us to the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, and specifically, to its State Data Infrastructure Coordinating Center. These people take census figures annually and apply a standard formula developed in the late 1990s to determine how many people have a "serious mental illness" or "serious emotional disturbances." We thought the number of diagnosed cases might drive the statistic, but that’s not the way it works. Instead, the research institute applies a percentage to the civilian adult population -- in this case, 5.4 percent -- to derive the estimated number of people 18 years and older with a "serious mental illness." The low side of the estimate is 3.7 percent and the upper side is 7.1 percent. In Oregon, 5.4 percent translates into more than 162,000 people out of 3 million adults. That translates into one in 18.5 adults. Let’s move on to the claim that one in eight children suffers from mental illness. Children are treated differently. The institute takes census numbers and applies a poverty formula, so a state that’s considered "high poverty" is calculated to have more children with a serious mental illness -- or in technical terms, "serious emotional disturbances" -- than states considered "low poverty." Oregon is a mid-poverty state. The percentages do not vary dramatically among the types of states, 9 percent to 11 percent of children for a low poverty state and 11 percent to 13 percent for a high poverty state. In Oregon, an estimated 10 percent to 12 percent of children ages 9 to 17 have a serious emotional disturbance. Ten percent of Oregon children is one in 10. Twelve percent is one in 8.3. The average -- 11 percent -- is one in 9.1 children. Again, this is just for children ages 9 to 17, so the calculation doesn’t capture the entire range of children. Remember that Courtney’s claim is one in eight. Now what do we mean by a serious emotional disturbance? Or rather, what do the experts mean? We spoke with Dr. Ronald Manderscheid, executive director of the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors. He’s the person who developed the federal algorithm used to estimate the number of adults and children with mental illness or emotional disability. In other words, he’s a solid expert. There is an assessment scale used routinely by mental health professionals. The spectrum spans from 1 to 10 to 91 to 100, and assesses how well a person functions. A child in the top bracket would be "superior" in every facet of life, and have a healthy sense of confidence and take problems in stride. The scale also applies to adults. Anyone in the 51 to 60 bracket, or lower, is considered to have a serious emotional disturbance or mental illness. Adults in this bracket would exhibit "moderate symptoms," such as occasional panic attacks, or "moderate difficulty" in social, work or school settings. Children in this group would have "sporadic difficulties or symptoms" in several but not all social areas. Symptoms would appear in times of distress. People in the 41 to 50 range would show "serious symptoms," including frequent shoplifting or severe obsessive rituals, or "serious impairment" in social, work, or school settings. This person might have no friends or be unable to keep a job. Children in the 41 to 50 bracket would show serious impairment in one area or moderate problems with functioning in most social areas. Children may have frequent anxiety attacks or have an unhealthy preoccupation with suicide. The "one in eight" statistic cited by Courtney applies to children who top out at 60. How many children do we have in Oregon, in that age group? An estimated 437,053 in 2011. Just to give you an idea, that means about 48,000 kids in the age bracket who fall within the accepted definition. Again, that’s an average of one in 9.1 kids. We also talked with Bill Bouska, children’s mental health system manager, and Jon C. Collins, manager of health programs analysis and measurement, both at the Oregon Health Authority. We asked why go with the higher percentage? "There’s not a lot of difference between 11 and 12 percent. These numbers are meant to be very general numbers, and to guide states," Collins said. "They’re not meant to be precise figures, so picking something on the high side is a little bit safer than picking a number on the low side, since they are estimates." Let’s go to our ruling. Courtney’s office relied on national statistics to claim that one in 8 children and one in 18 adults suffer from mental illness in Oregon. We found those statistics and talked to the person responsible for calculating the federal formula used to derive those statistics. We understand this is all about estimates, but if we’re going to boil it down to percentages, let’s see what they are. A 5.4 percent rate translates into one in 18.5 adults who suffer from a mental illness that makes functioning moderately difficult. Manderscheid, our national expert, says the percentage used now is 5.8 percent, which is one in 17.2 adults, so Courtney’s statement still rings true. (The number of adults who suffer from a mental health disorder in a given year is much higher -- one in four -- but they take medication or receive treatment so condition doesn’t affect their ability to function.) With children, we find that the one-in-eight statement is slightly more alarming than the average would indicate. The average in Oregon is one in 9.1 with a high of one in 8.3. It’s also important to understand that the statistic applies to a narrower subset of children, and that the statistic covers children who show sporadic difficulties in several but not all social areas.. Still, all in all, it’s hard to argue with a nationally accepted standard, so we find these details to be additional information missing from an otherwise accurate statement. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Peter Courtney	None	None	None	2013-02-16T03:00:00	2013-02-06	['Oregon']

Antonio Sabato Jr., an actor who spoke the first night of the Republican National Convention, told ABC News after his speech that Obama is "absolutely" a Muslim. "I don't believe the guy is a Christian," Sabato said. "He has never talked about Jesus Christ once." "We had a Muslim president for seven and half years," Sabato added. PolitiFact has done extensive fact-checking on Obama's faith and has debunked false claims in chain e-mails that he attended a radical Islamic school, that his political rise mirrored a biblical tale about the Antichrist, and that he took the oath for U.S. Senate on a Koran. All three earned our lowest rating, Pants on Fire. This claim will, too. Our fact-checking shows clear evidence that Obama is a Christian. According to Obama’s memoirs and independent biographies, Obama was not raised in any particular faith. He became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. "It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith," Obama said in a 2006 speech. "It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth." The pastor of Trinity then was Jeremiah Wright, the minister from whom Obama distanced himself in the 2008 presidential campaign, after video of some of Wright's more controversial sermons were aired on television and the Internet. The break between the two men was over Wright's comments about American foreign policy and race relations, not tenets of Christian doctrine. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life. "Along his Senate campaign trail (in 2004), Obama would never fail to carry his Christian Bible. He would place it right beside him, in the small compartment in the passenger side door of the SUV, so he could refer to it often," reported journalist David Mendell in his 2007 biography Obama: From Promise to Power. After the falling out with Wright, Obama said he intended to find a new church once the campaign was over. In office, though, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat. So why do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? A benign explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion want to associate him with something they perceive to be negative. None of it, however, makes the claim correct. Our ruling Sabato said Obama is "absolutely" a Muslim. That’s wrong.

pomt-03121	"Tampa got more (federal housing) money because they scored higher on the blight scoring system, so they've got a much bigger problem than we do."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/sep/18/bill-foster/st-petersburg-mayor-says-tampa-gets-more-federal-h/	The question for the candidates was simple: What can St. Petersburg’s mayor do to improve severely depressed housing values in Midtown? Mayor Bill Foster and challenger Rick Kriseman both talked about chasing grants to improve the struggling area, which stretches from Second Avenue N to 30th Avenue S and Fourth Street to 34th Street. Kriseman credited Tampa for successfully raking in federal dollars for "affordable housing initiatives." He did not elaborate. Foster said Tampa gets more federal money because "they probably need the money more." "Tampa got more money because they scored higher on the blight scoring system, so they've got a much bigger problem than we do," Foster said. Intrigued by Foster’s claim, PolitiFact Florida decided to investigate how the cities compare in terms of a "blight scoring system" and if Tampa indeed is worse off when compared to St. Petersburg. Is it really more problems, more money? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, awards billions of dollars in grants to cities, counties and states each year. Some of the awards are known as "entitlement grants," based on formulas. Others are competitive, based on who has the best plan. Allies of Kriseman sounded the alarm on Foster’s response in the forum. To them, Kriseman obviously was talking about a $30 million federal grant the Tampa Housing Authority won last year for Encore Tampa, an urban redevelopment project aiming to transform the Central Park/Ybor neighborhood formerly home to a public housing complex. It wasn’t that Tampa received the Choice Neighborhoods grant over St. Petersburg because it simply has a bigger need for the money. St. Petersburg did not apply for it, even after Foster directed the city’s former contracts and grants officer, Wayne Finley, to explore a similar transformative proposal for the neighborhood around Citrus Grove Apartments at 731 15th St. S. "It was very clear to me, two years in a row, that he promised to apply," said St. Petersburg City Council chairman Karl Nurse, who pushed for the Choice Neighborhoods initiative. It’s accurate to say the city decided not to pursue that grant, a fact confirmed by city and federal officials. But that’s not what Foster said he was talking about when he brought up the scoring system based on "blight." In a brief chat, Foster clarified he was talking about a dollar disparity when considering an array of housing and urban improvement grants, not just Choice Neighborhoods. "I tasked my housing department to advise me on how Tampa is getting grant monies that we are coming for," he said. "Their response was, it’s based upon a scoring system, and Tampa qualified because they had more issues." There are still issues with what Foster said Problem is, a "blight scoring system" does not really exist. A HUD spokesman was perplexed by Foster’s comment, saying there’s no easy comparative analysis for "blight" between Tampa and St. Petersburg, or other cities for that matter. But for certain grants, cities get the money based on formulas that take into account an area’s population, poverty and, in some cases, foreclosure picture. Foster had city officials answer our follow-ups. Joshua Johnson, director of the housing department, directed us to fiscal year 2012-13 allocations for Community Development Block Grants, or CDBG. Tampa received $2.8 million and St. Petersburg got $1.6 million. The formula for CDBGs is based on a mix of measures, including population, housing overcrowding, and the extent of residents living in poverty. Tampa exceeds St. Petersburg in all three of those measures, according to HUD data. Normally, Johnson said, if a city has more people, it also has more people who earn lower incomes. According to 2012 Census estimates, Tampa had 347,645 residents, and St. Petersburg had 246,541. Tampa also had a greater share of residents below the poverty level, at 19.2 percent compared to 15.3 percent in St. Petersburg. Foster was trying to articulate that HUD looks at the age and condition of a city's housing stock when considering how to award certain money, and "clearly if you're going to look at those two factors, blight is part of that," said Clarence Scott, city leisure and community services administrator. For instance, the city of St. Petersburg conducted a blight study of the city’s Southside area in pushing to declare it a Community Redevelopment Area. The purpose of that study was just to prove the city is deserving; not to compare it to other places. Similarly, Tampa conducted a blight study in 2006 of the Central Park/Ybor neighborhood that qualified as a CRA and later received the Choice Neighborhoods grant. In 2008, Congress authorized HUD under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act to start the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which provides grants that help states and local governments rehab, re-sell or demolish foreclosed or abandoned homes. More money was dedicated to the program in the 2009 stimulus package and the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking reforms. Tampa and St. Petersburg each received money for the first and third phases of the program, and Tampa got more -- $18.3 million compared to St. Petersburg’s $13.2 million. The Tampa Housing Authority received a second, competitive grant of $38 million that the city shared to build low-income housing. St. Petersburg tried to win a second-round grant but was not chosen. This program distributes money based on the number of home foreclosures, the number of homes financed by a subprime mortgage loan, and the number of homes in default. "Perhaps Foster is simply noting, albeit awkwardly, that you can’t fault him for failing to bring in HUD dollars that are based on formulae for which blight and poverty characteristics are key variables," said Elizabeth Strom, a University of South Florida urban planning professor. "But I am not aware of any ‘blight scoring system’ that would be used across programs." Our ruling Shrugging off the implication that he is sitting back and letting Tampa collect federal affordable housing grants, Foster said Tampa gets more money because they scored higher on the "blight scoring system." In the end, Foster is right that Tampa generally gets more money in entitlement grants (not even considering competitive grants). But that’s as much a matter of population and poverty as anything else. A "blight scoring system" does not exist by that name. Foster’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05300	Betty Sutton "gutted Medicare by $500 billion" with her vote for the president's health care bill.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/21/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-betty-sutton-gutted-medicare-500-/	Truth is the first casualty of war, it has often been said, and truth -- or factual accuracy -- often goes down first in the talking points of political campaigns. And talking points never die. They just keep spinning. PolitiFact Ohio recently noted that Rep. Betty Sutton was using a claim that PolitiFact National named as its "Lie of the Year" when she said Rep. Jim Renacci "voted repeatedly to end Medicare." Sutton, a Democrat, and Renacci, a Republican, are both incumbents facing each other in November in the new 16th Congressional District. Renacci voted for measures that would significantly change Medicare as we know it, but would not end it. PolitiFact, like our friends at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker, rated the claim used by Sutton as False. In our research, however, we found that Renacci's campaign website using another popular talking point about health care. Sutton, the website said, "gutted Medicare by $500 billion" when she voted for the health care reform that is formally known as the Affordable Care Act and informally called Obamacare. PolitiFact has examined the claim that health care reform cuts Medicare by $500 billion on a number of occasions, including once when Renacci said it at a town hall meeting early in 2011. We rated that one Mostly False. We asked Renacci's campaign how he backs up the statement and the amped-up use of "gutted." About "cuts," they responded that "it has been widely reported that these changes to Medicare are real, and the use of the term 'cut' has been used in analyses done by numerous media outlets including CNN, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Daily News." Health care reform does, by definition, make changes. But the use of "cuts" in every instance was journalistic shorthand describing a complicated piece of legislation. It is important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, as Renacci and the law’s foes make it sound. Instead, it reduces the projected growth in Medicare spending, by about $500 billion over a 10-year period. That's about 7 percent of what Medicare was projected to cost over that decade. The total projected cost of Medicare over that decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is $7.1 trillion, even with the reduced growth in spending. Medicare spending will still increase. That's a big difference. Renacci's campaign said the word "gutted" was used "because it accurately reflects what the real-life and real-dollar impact of what this law will do to seniors." Webster’s New World College Dictionary’s applicable definitions for ‘gut’ are to destroy the interior of, as by fire, or to remove the intestines from or eviscerate. In support of the word "gutted," the campaign cited a report that 20 million people, including seniors, could lose their current coverage under the new law. But that report, released in March by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that provides economic and budgetary analysis to Congress, dealt with people who get health insurance through work. It didn’t even apply to Medicare. Changes planned to the Medicare Advantage, which the Renacci camp also cited, would phase out payments for extra benefits not available under traditional Medicare. That’s not gutting Medicare. Since 2010, PolitiFact has examined repeated claims by politicians and interest groups that the health care reform bill would cut Medicare by $500 billion. Each time the claim was found to be Mostly False or False, depending on the specific wording. In this case Renacci’s website claims Sutton’s support of health care reform was a vote that "gutted Medicare by $500 billion." There is an element of truth in this claim from Renacci: the health reform law is forecast to cause less spending on Medicare than what was previously forecast. But that spending reduction is a result of slowing growth so that less is spent in the long run, not cutting out traditional Medicare benefits. Those are critical facts missing from Renacci’s claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, this claim rates Mostly False.	None	Jim Renacci	None	None	None	2012-05-21T06:00:00	2012-05-11	['None']

pomt-07775	The president’s proposed budget "will help reduce the deficit by $400 billion over the next decade to the lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was president."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-budget-will-bring-deficit-lo/	In his remarks at the opening session of a small business forum in Cleveland on Feb. 22, 2011, President Barack Obama made the following claim about the budget proposal he released eight days earlier. Saying that government should live "within its means," Obama told the audience, "And that's why I've designed a budget that freezes spending for five years and will help reduce the deficit by $400 billion over the next decade to the lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was president." The part that caught our eye was that Obama’s proposed budget "will help reduce the deficit by $400 billion over the next decade to the lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was president." This is different than what he said in a speech to unveil his budget plan in Baltimore on Feb. 14, 2011. In that event, Obama said that his budget "would cut the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, bringing this kind of spending -- domestic discretionary spending -- to its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president." He said something similar in his State of the Union address. Discretionary spending refers to funds appropriated by Congress annually, rather than determined by a formula, and we discovered that there are a variety of definitions of "domestic discretionary spending." In our fact-check, published on Feb. 16, 2011, we looked at all the possible definitions and concluded that Obama was justified in saying that by 2015, domestic discretionary spending would be at the lowest levels as a percentage of GDP since the early 1960s at least. However, we downgraded Obama to Half True because those numbers used at least one accounting technique that some economists consider a gimmick. In Cleveland, though, the president said something different -- that the overall federal deficit would be lower by the end of the next decade than it’s been under any president since Eisenhower. Could that be true? Before we go further, we’ll make one general caveat: The president’s numbers refer to his preferred policies -- which are merely the opening gambit in what is sure to be a drawn-out fight over the federal budget. In addition, the numbers are based on economic projections as far as 10 years in the future that may or may not come to pass. Using the summary tables from Obama’s budget proposal, we found that the deficit for fiscal year 2011 is expected to be $1.645 trillion, while in 2021 -- the end of the decade-long span the president referenced in Cleveland -- the projected deficit is $774 billion. So the president actually underestimated the size of the decline in the deficit -- it’s actually set to fall by $871 billion over the 10-year period rather than by $400 billion. As for the Eisenhower comparison, there are at least two obvious ways to look at this -- by the size of the deficit in dollars and by the size of the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. The latter calculation takes into account the size of the economy, which has grown dramatically over time, enabling fairer comparisons across long periods of time, such as the 50 years since Eisenhower left office. To make these comparisons, we looked at the historical tables included with the president’s budget. Using dollar amounts, Obama projects a deficit of $774 billion for 2021. From 1961 to 2011, the dollar amount of the deficit (not adjusted for inflation) was lower than that in every single year except for 2009, 2010 and 2011. So using this measure, the president’s comparison is way off. Using deficits as a percentage of GDP. Obama's budget projects that the deficit in 2021 will represent 3.1 percent of GDP. From 1961 to 2011, the percentage was lower than 3.1 percent in 32 out of the 51 years. So by this measure, too, Obama’s comparison is way off. In fact, in five years -- one under President Richard Nixon and four under President Bill Clinton -- the federal government ran a surplus. So those years alone would have made the president’s claim incorrect. When we showed this comment to economists on the left and right, they agreed that the president was so far off that it was hard to believe he meant the comment as he said it. And indeed, the White House confirmed to us that the president had intended to make the same comparison he had made in Baltimore. In fact, about an hour and a half after we initially contacted the White House, Obama changed his statement when he made his closing comments in Cleveland. ‘We’ve also got to get our fiscal house in order," he said, "and that’s why I’ve put forth a budget that includes a five-year spending freeze that will help reduce the deficit by $400 billion and will get annual domestic spending down to the lowest levels since Dwight Eisenhower." So where does this leave us? The president meant to say something different and then rephrased the statement several hours later. Still, most people in the room or watching on television who didn’t see his closing remarks would think that Obama was referring to the deficit, which would be incorrect. To set the record straight, we give his initial statement in Cleveland a rating of False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-02-22T17:37:37	2011-02-22	['Dwight_D._Eisenhower']
pomt-10086	Michelle Obama ordered $400 worth of lobster and caviar at a New York hotel.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/02/chain-email/official-looking-receipt-is-a-fake/	(Published Oct. 28, 2008) A new e-mail claims to depict a $400 room service receipt signed by Michelle Obama. Guess what? It's phony. The e-mail is a graphic ( view it here ) that has an accurate quote from Obama next to her photo: "The truth is, in order get things like universal health care and a revamped education system, then someone is going to have to give up a piece of the pie so that someone else can have more." Obama made the remarks on the campaign trail in North Carolina on April 8, 2008. The e-mail then says, "Oh really? Who is the someone that gives up a piece of the pie? Keep the change!" It then shows a receipt with the caption, "Receipt signed by Michelle Obama at Waldorf Astoria on October 15, 2008 at 4:00 p.m., $447.39 for an afternoon snack." The receipt then lists things like whole steamed lobsters and "Iranian Osetra caviar." The receipt is a phony mock-up, and doesn't even look like the receipts the hotel actually uses, said a spokeswoman for the Waldorf Astoria hotel. Obama was not staying at the hotel, and the story is "completely made up," the spokeswoman said. Usually, the hotel doesn't comment at all on its guests, but was willing to deny the report in this case because it is false and "it's escalated so much," the spokeswoman said. The basis for the e-mail appears to be a story that appeared Oct. 17, 2008, in the New York Post gossip column Page Six. The newspaper has since posted a correction: "The source who told us last week about Michelle Obama getting lobster and caviar delivered to her room at the Waldorf-Astoria must have been under the influence of a mind-altering drug. She was not even staying at the Waldorf. We regret the mistake, and our former source is going to regret it, too." We're not sure who created the e-mail, but it credits itself to PUMA PAC, a political action committee formed in the wake of Hillary Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the Democratic Primary. PUMA says its acronym stands for "People United Means Action," but among Democrats its common meaning is usually thought to be "Party unity, my a--." PUMA posted the graphic to its Web site a few days after the New York Post story appeared, but has since retracted it. PUMA PACs's executive director, Darragh Murphy, posted a message to the group's Web site that states, "I sincerely regret repeating and amplifying what turns out to be a shameful attempt to embarrass and undermine Michelle Obama. I will take better care in checking sources in the future." So the hotel where the event was supposed to have occurred repudiates the e-mail, the newspaper that originally reported it repudiates the e-mail, and the political group that promoted it repudiates the e-mail. Lest we be in the grips of a well-oiled conspiracy, we went back and checked on Michelle Obama's activities on the day in question. The date and time on the receipt are Oct. 15, 2008, at 16:04, or 4:04 p.m. That day, Obama was in Fort Wayne, Ind., speaking at a rally, and was onstage speaking at about 1:30 p.m. Even a charter flight from Fort Wayne to New York would take about two hours, and we don't think she could have rushed from the Fort Wayne event, flown to New York, checked into the Waldorf and ordered room service in that brief window of time. So the e-mail flying around the Internet that says Michelle Obama ordered $400 of lobster and Iranian caviar is just wrong, and because it's a mock-up based on a retracted news item, we rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-03100	"The president’s own advisers have said there’s a war on coal."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/23/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-links-obama-war-coal/	The unveiling of proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants stirred up protests that the administration is waging "a war on coal." Under these rules, newly built coal-fired facilities could not release more than 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. The most advanced plant today releases over 1,600 pounds. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R- Ky., faces re-election next year. Just before the announcement, his campaign posted an ad on the Web called "Stand for coal." The ad uses excerpts from what sounds like a public speech by McConnell. Here’s how it begins: I don’t have to tell you there’s a war on coal here in America, and it’s really come home here in Kentucky. The president’s own advisers have said there’s a war on coal. And I want to remind people that whether they live in a coal county or not, a war on coal is a war on Kentucky, all of Kentucky. Because our great competitive advantage has been low utility rates. This administration, whether it’s Obamacare or the war on coal, needs to be stopped. And I tell you, I will be the leader of the forces that take on the war on coal. The second sentence stands out. It would be politically inflammatory if the president’s team was talking about waging a war on coal. More than 50 Democratic lawmakers come from coal-producing states, and they eye this issue warily. We decided to look at the substance behind McConnell’s claim that "the president’s own advisers have said there’s a war on coal." We emailed McConnell’s campaign, and they pointed to several news articles from June of this year. The articles reference Daniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist and a member of President Barack Obama’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. They quote Schrag telling the New York Times that, "Politically, the White House is hesitant to say they’re having a war on coal. On the other hand, a war on coal is exactly what’s needed." We’ll work through the three elements of McConnell’s claim one by one. Is Schrag an adviser? By title, Schrag is certainly an adviser. The president’s advisory council has 18 members and includes the former chief of Google, the president of Yale, chemists, biologists, physicists and computer scientists. It meets about seven times a year and the members talk about everything from city planning to mathematics education, from health care to information technology. Earlier this year, the council sent a letter to Obama suggesting half a dozen factors to include in his climate change policy. On that list, it recommended doing more to "decarbonize" the economy. It noted the administration’s "efforts to increase coal’s usability through development of carbon capture and storage," and said the White House should speed that process along. One caveat: Most of the actual policy-making on climate change takes place at the Environmental Protection Agency and at the Department of Energy. We contacted Schrag and he said he was expressing his own views, not those of the administration. "I do not have that knowledge nor that authority," Schrag said. Schrag said he has never met one-on-one with the president. Obama has met with the council as a whole a handful of times. Did more than one adviser say this? McConnell used the plural. "The president’s own advisers have said," was his phrase. The McConnell campaign did not identify any advisers other than Schrag. We could find no others. There is no evidence that we are dealing with more than a single adviser. Did Schrag say "we have a war on coal"? It is clear that Schrag himself would like to see a war on coal. However, he said he regrets using that term. "A ‘war on coal’ is taken as an attack on coal miners, etc., and that was not my intention," he said. "I don't want to fight a war on anyone. Indeed, I am a strong supporter of coal plants with carbon capture and storage." Schrag said his actual words have been twisted. "I never said that there was a war on coal. My statement was that, in my own personal opinion, a war on coal is needed -- not that the administration is waging a war on coal," Schrag said. Schrag does not say he was misquoted as such. Let’s look at his words again: "Politically, the White House is hesitant to say they’re having a war on coal. On the other hand, a war on coal is exactly what’s needed." It is possible to interpret those words as saying, "There is a war on coal but no one wants to say so." But it is also possible to interpret them as, "I think there should be a war on coal but the administration isn’t there yet." A look at the headlines of the articles McConnell’s campaign sent us tends to support the second interpretation. The Washington Post had "Obama science adviser calls for ‘war on coal’." The Washington Times had "Obama science adviser urges ‘war on coal’." The Washington Times item said "One of the White House’s advisers on climate change said that President Obama should use his global warming speech Tuesday to launch a ‘war on coal’." If the administration did have a war on coal, there would be no reason for Schrag to say it was time to launch one. We should note that the original quote from Shrag in the New York Times was removed at some point from the New York Times story. There is no explanation by the New York Times as to why the quote was removed. Conservative bloggers noted the alteration of the story and copied the original context of Schrag’s quote. Daniel P. Schrag, a geochemist who is the head of Harvard University’s Center for the Environment and a member of a presidential science panel that has helped advise the White House on climate change, said he hoped the presidential speech would mark a turning point in the national debate on climate change. "Everybody is waiting for action," he said. "The one thing the president really needs to do now is to begin the process of shutting down the conventional coal plants. Politically, the White House is hesitant to say they’re having a war on coal. On the other hand, a war on coal is exactly what’s needed." The administration’s policy on coal The core of the president’s coal policy is clean coal. In practice, that means creating new methods to capture and store the carbon released when coals burns. The White House said the administration has spent about $6 billion to develop clean coal technology. Staff also pointed to an $8 billion loan guarantee program under the Department of Energy that has just begun. Under the program, private investors can apply to the government to eliminate the risk to lenders who put money behind a clean coal project. Recently, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, told a House committee that, "We believe coal will continue to represent a significant portion of the energy supply in the decades to come." Administration critics say its policies will produce a different result. The Institute for Energy Research favors deregulation and is headed by the former policy chief at Enron. The group posted an article on its website, "EPA emissions rule will destroy U.S. coal industry." The institute argues that the proposed rules "will deny U.S. citizens the right to have new generating facilities built using coal." The biggest problem for coal right now seems to be the market. While coal remains the primary fuel for producing electricity, it is losing ground against much cheaper natural gas. Utilities are shedding coal fired generators and adding ones powered by natural gas. According to reports on planned capacity changes submitted to the government’s Energy Information Administration, by 2016, there will be a net loss of 149 coal-fired generators and a net gain of 120 that use natural gas. Our ruling McConnell said, "The president’s own advisers have said there’s a war on coal." A man who sits on a presidential advisory council did speak of a war on coal. It is accurate to call him an adviser. It is inaccurate to refer to more than one adviser but much more significant, it also falls wide of the mark to interpret his words as meaning that there is a war on coal. The adviser expressed support for that sort of policy, but press accounts at the time and the adviser’s own words today affirm that he did not say there is presently a war on coal. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2013-09-23T14:00:02	2013-09-18	['None']

pomt-08516	"Tom Ganley supports a 23 percent national sales tax that would raise taxes on the middle class while giving a huge tax break to millionaires like himself."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/06/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-charges-tom-ganley-supports-/	Taxation and spending are two topics of political debate in which specifics can be in short supply. A notable exception is the "Fair Tax Act," introduced most recently by Republican congressman John Linder of Georgia. The legislation specifically calls for abolishing most federal taxes - including personal and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes - and replacing them with a national sales tax on private consumption, home interest payments and government spending. It would have a rate of 23 percent. Backers say the plan would be progressive on consumption and increase savings and investment. Opponents say it would be regressive and increase taxes on middle-income earners. (Detailed examinations of the proposal can be found in FactCheck.org’s "Unspinning the fair tax," published May 31, 2007, and PolitiFact.com’s "Adding up the fair tax," published Jan. 23, 2008.) Promoted by such groups as Texas-based Americans for Fair Taxation the Ohio FairTax Association, the proposal has been embraced by many in the Tea Party movement, whose "Contract from America" supports a "single-rate tax system." The Ohio Democratic Party says the plan is supported by Tom Ganley, the Republican challenging Rep. Betty Sutton in the 13th Congressional District. The claim is posted as a fact on a website paid for by the Democratic party that Sutton-authorized: "Tom Ganley supports a 23 percent national sales tax that would raise taxes on the middle class while giving a huge tax break to millionaires like himself." Just one problem: Ganley's campaign says he does not support the FairTax. That got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity going. Does he or doesn't he? The answer rests on the fine line between "support" and "supportive." Sutton's campaign cites a survey of candidates that was posted in May by Ohioans for the FairTax. It has Ganley's position checked in the category of "favorable/supports." Steven Curtis, the group's state director, said the listing was based on discussion with Ganley's campaign staff. "They told me he was supportive," Curtis said. "They told me he was favorably inclined toward the FairTax." That echoes a member’s posting on the Fair Tax Nation website last November, after Ganley spoke to a breakfast meeting during the Senate run he left for the congressional race: "His PR man said Tom is very supportive of the Fair Tax." Sutton also points to a statement by Ganley on his own website: "We need to consider basing our tax structure on alternate tax methodologies such as the Fair Tax and others which can be utilized to help people invest and save." Ganley spokeswoman Meghan Snyder said that the call for consideration does not constitute support. "The current system is broken and ideas such as the Fair Tax and Flat Tax are on the table for consideration, but Mr. Ganley has not endorsed either plan," she said in an emailed statement. "Though there are many proposed solutions, lowering taxes to grow the private sector will ultimately help bring our country back to prosperity." Ganley has called for "fair taxes," but we could not find his "supportive" position on the Fair Tax plan, or his stated openness to it, translating into a direct endorsement. So there’s a shred of truth to the claim. He has called for the Fair Tax to be considered, but: But to carry that point further to say he has thrown his support behind it is an overstatement. Not explaining that it is one possibility he said should be looked at fails to raise critical facts that could give readers a different impression. And classifying it as a tax that would "raise taxes on the middle class while giving a huge tax break to millionaires like himself" adds in a dose of political hyperbole. We rate this claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02086	A company hired to do Common Core testing in Florida will "attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2014/may/20/charles-van-zant/common-core-testing-homosexual-possibly-can/	Heads up moms and dads -- a Florida lawmaker has unearthed one more conspiracy behind Common Core. A company that has been hired by Florida to give students tests will be recruiting every one of those students to become gay. Think Progress, a liberal blog, dug up a video of state Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, speaking about the topic at the "Operation Education" conference -- a gathering of conservative religious groups who met about the theme of "How education reforms are attacking America’s Foundation." The Orlando conference was in March, but Think Progress posted a video clip of Zant on May 19, and the video then spread to other blogs. We listened to the full speech. Here is the portion that drew attention: "Our new secretary of education in Florida recently appointed AIR to receive the $220 million contract for end-of-course exam testing and to prepare those tests. Please -- go on their website. Click the link to what they are doing with youth, and you will see what their agenda really is. They are promoting as hard as they can any youth that is interested in the LGBT agenda and even name it 2-S, which they define as having two spirits. The Bible says a lot about being double-minded. "These people that will now receive $220 million from the state of Florida, unless this is stopped, will promote double mindedness in state education, and attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can. I'm sorry to report that to you. ... I really hate to bring you that news, but you need to know." Van Zant encouraged listeners to research AIR, so we took him up on his suggestion and decided to check if AIR plans to "attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can." We contacted Van Zant’s office and asked him to provide evidence to support his claim and did not get a response. We should note that our previous fact-checking shows people can’t be recruited to a particular sexual orientation. In 2011, GOP presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty said scientists are "in dispute" about whether being gay is a choice, and we rated that claim False. (Editor’s note: We added this point after our initial publication to address reader concerns.) Here, we’ll explore Van Zant’s specific claim that a testing company was making the attempt. Common Core tests and AIR In March, the state Department of Education announced that it would give a $220 million, 6-year contract to American Institutes for Research to develop and administer new accountability tests to replace Florida’s old testing system, the FCAT. The Washington-based nonprofit will develop tests aligned to the Florida Standards, the new education benchmarks based on the controversial Common Core State Standards. The new tests are expected to be ready for the 2014-15 school year. AIR has contracts to develop tests for about 10 states including Florida. When the state chose AIR, Common Core foes took aim at the testing company. The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition accused AIR of promoting a lesbian gay bisexual transgender "lifestyle", better known as LGBT, calling the choice of AIR "completely unacceptable": "Besides implementing the same deceptive plan discussed at the governor's summit in August, the state has chosen a company that has a significant history of promoting identification of the GLBT lifestyle for children as young as seven years old," Florida Eagle Forum lobbyist Randy Osborne said in a Florida Stop Common Core Coalition letter to supporters. (Similar claims have been made by Common Core opponents in Utah and Tennessee.) We rated the coalition’s claim Half True in March. As we explained in that fact-check, one part of AIR’s business is creating materials for schools on LGBT Youth issues, in which it studies the youngsters’ experiences and offers recommendations for how to help the students. AIR only provides those materials to entities that request them -- currently that includes federal government contracts. AIR has no such contracts with the state Department of Education or any Florida districts to provide LGBT materials. (AIR is in discussions with a couple of districts in other states.) "No entity in Florida has asked us to do LGBT work," AIR spokesman Larry McQuillan said. AIR describes its practice in this way: "AIR’s Health and Social Development program develops knowledge and understanding about LGBT youth that takes account of their experiences and needs. AIR also enhances opportunities for the healthy development, well-being, and safety of LGBT children, youth, and their families by providing workforce training and technical assistance to service providers across systems addressing behavioral health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and homelessness." AIR also does similar work in the areas of bullying and substance abuse in addition to its efforts in education, health and workforce matters. "We are not an advocacy group," McQuillan told PolitiFact in March. "AIR is a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization. We do educational assessment, research, health policy research and communication, and international development. We have supported many states by providing high-quality assessments of their specific state standards." A few standards include sexual orientation We interviewed McQuillan about Van Zant’s comments and asked about what sort of material will be included on the tests. "It’s the state that decides what questions they want to ask," he said. "Florida is truly in control." Joe Follick, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, said the tests administered by AIR will only include English language arts and math. "Florida has always been and will continue to be committed to assessments that solely measure a student's knowledge of subject areas and critical thinking spelled out in the Florida Standards," Follick said in an email in response to our questions. Our ruling A firm hired to do Common Core testing in Florida will "attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can," Van Zant said. The firm hired to do testing, AIR, separately provides information to entities that request it to help them assist LGBT students. Currently, the federal government accesses AIR’s information but the organization doesn’t have such a contract with the state of Florida or any Florida districts. We found no evidence that when AIR administers tests in Florida that the testing process will involve recruiting students to become gay. Van Zant takes a somewhat limited connection between the testing company and gay and lesbian issues and then blows it up into a wild claim that lacks evidence. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-02961	Says "there are actually more people in poverty now than there were when we started" the War on Poverty.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/24/jason-conger/are-there-more-people-living-poverty-now-there-wer/	When Bend Rep. Jason Conger announced that he will seek the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in hopes of squaring off against Sen. Jeff Merkley, he outlined his stance on several issues, including poverty. It’s a timely topic, especially given that a potential crisis could be brewing with regard to food stamp funding. A recession-era boost to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expires Nov. 1, meaning all recipients will see their benefits drop. Plus, lawmakers are considering additional cuts to the program, which has seen considerable growth in recent years. That’s all just context, though, for what we’re really interested in. During his announcement, Conger maintained that the long-running War on Poverty (which involves programs such as SNAP) has failed to make much difference. In fact, he said, things are worse than before. "We’ve been fighting a war on poverty for 50 years and we failed," he said. "There are actually more people in poverty now than there were when we started. We’re spending a trillion dollars on safety net programs. … Does anyone think for any reason that just throwing more money into that same system is going to change the result? Of course not." Now, folks have probably dedicated careers to trying to determine whether the War on Poverty has succeeded in any meaningful way. Certainly, it’s too complicated a question for a single PolitiFact. But one thing PolitiFact Oregon could check was whether there are "actually more people in poverty now than there were when we started." The whole concept of the War on Poverty dates to 1964 when President Lyndon B. Johnson introduced legislation that, among other things, created Medicare and Medicaid, and gave permanence to the food stamp program. The U.S. Census Bureau has been keeping an eye on poverty for decades, stretching back even before Johnson’s reforms. So figures were easy to come by. In the bureau's most recent report on poverty, a helpful graph shows both the number of folks in poverty and the poverty rate (which takes into account the growing population). The two graphs tell different stories, depending on how you read them. In terms of whole numbers, Conger is right. About 36 million folks were living in poverty in 1964, and about 46.5 million folks live in poverty today -- obviously an increase. However, if you consider the other graph, you’ll find the poverty rate was 19 percent in 1964 and is about 15 percent now. Truth be told, the rate has been fairly stagnant ever since a drop in the 1960s. We spoke with Conger about his decision to go with the raw figures over the rate. It came down to accuracy, he said. The more he looked into comparing rates over time, he said, the less he was certain he’d be comparing "apples to apples." "I didn’t want to distort it or anything," Conger said. "I used the raw number because I know that’s true." He also pointed out that he could have done something sensational. He could have, for instance, said the number of people living in poverty grew by more than 20 percent since the War on Poverty began, but he said he knew that would be alarmist. "I deliberately didn't do that because I was just trying to make a point." Now, we’ve done our share of looks at poverty during our time with PolitiFact Oregon, and we know this is a complicated issue. So we turned to an expert, Beth Mattingly, a researcher with the Stanford Center for the Study of Poverty and Inequality. The big difficulty with measuring poverty, she said, is that while programs aimed at fighting poverty have increased, the government’s method for measuring poverty, which is heavily focused on an individual's cash resources, has not. That means the rate does not take into account several types of assistance, specifically the types Conger was calling ineffective. Non-cash transfers such as food stamps, energy assistance and nutrition programs for women and children don’t get counted. Neither does the earned income tax credit, one of the bigger tools used for fighting poverty. "The official poverty number hasn't declined dramatically," Mattingly said, "but it means something different today than it did before the War on Poverty." Folks who research poverty, including employees of the U.S. Census Bureau, have tried different ways of looking at the poverty rate. One that Mattingly suggested we take a look at is called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which does pull together the various types of assistance. The measure also takes into account necessary costs to a family or individual, for instance health care or transportation. The idea is that it would offer a more comprehensive measure. Unfortunately, that measure has been around only a few years and doesn’t give us a direct comparison between now and 1964. So back to our ruling. Conger is correct that more people are in poverty now than in 1964 in terms of raw numbers. But if you look at the rate, which takes population growth into account, we’ve experienced an overall drop. The rate itself, of course, is not perfect, but that seems to be the fairest measure over time, even if it doesn’t take into account many of the programs that came a result of the War on Poverty. Conger’s statement is accurate but needs that clarification. We rate this claim Mostly True. Tell us what you think by leaving a comment on OregonLive.com.

pomt-05573	Tim Kaine "reduced higher education funding by 25 percent when he was governor, driving up tuition..."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/apr/04/scott-lingamfelter/republicans-say-tim-kaine-cut-higher-education-25-/	Editors note: This story was amended on July 19, 2012 to include the inflation-adjusted increases in tutition for in-state students Virginia's four-year colleges and community colleges during Tim Kaine's term as governor. This does not affect our orignial ruling. Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine has been crisscrossing the state talking about the need to cultivate a talented workforce to boost the economy. Republicans have pounced on the narrative, charging that Kaine undercut his goal when he was governor from January 2006 to January 2010. The Republican Party of Virginia sent out a prepared statement by Del. Scott Lingamfelter, R-Prince William on Feb. 22, saying if Kaine was serious about developing a talent-based economy "he wouldn’t have reduced higher education funding by 25 percent when he was governor, driving up tuition costs and making college less affordable for Virginia families and students." Did Kaine cut the higher education budget by 25 percent leading to higher tuition costs? We asked Lingamfelter and officials at the state Republican Party to back up the statement. In reading the explanations, keep in mind that Virginia’s fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. The 2006 budget, for example, covered a fiscal year that ended June 30, 2006. Lingamfelter cited data from a 2010 report by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. It shows the amount of general funds spent for each in-state, full-time student at a four-year college fell from $8,709 in budget years 2006 and 2007 to $6,500 in 2010 and 2011. That’s a 25.4 percent drop. At community colleges, average state funding per student fell from $4,602 in fiscal 2006 and 2007 to $2,946 in 2010 and 2011, a 36 percent decrease. The SCHEV data focuses on general fund money the state gives colleges and universities to help pay for daily operations, such as faculty salaries and equipment. The general fund is mainly supported by taxes on income, corporations and sales. Higher education institutions cover their share of the costs through tuition. When state spending goes down, tuitions typically rise to deal with the shortfall, according to a 2009 SCHEV report. Sure enough, tuition did go up during Kaine’s term. The average costs for in-state tuition and instructional fees at four-year institutions -- not including room and board -- rose from $3,812 in the 2005-2006 school year to $5,003 in 2009-2010. That’s a 31.2 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, it's about a 19 percent rise. The average cost for tuition and instructional fees at Virginia’s community colleges rose from $2,182 in the 2005-06 school year to $2,716 in 2009-10. That’s a 24.5 percent increase. Adjsuted for inflation, it's about a 13 percent rise. Virginia’s experience was not unique; tuition and fees for in-state students at four-year public universities rose across the nation during Kaine’s term. The U.S. Department of Education said the national average increased by 23 percent during that span, the College Board says they rose by 29 percent. Officials at the Republican Party of Virginia offered an additional justification to Lingamfelter’s claim that Kaine cut one-fourth of higher education funding. They compared outlays in Kaine’s mid-term 2008 budget to the farewell spending proposal he left behind for fiscal 2011 and 2012. To check the GOP’s math, we turned to the Department of Planning and Budget for records of general fund dollars the state paid towards college operations, financial aid and research spending. Kaine entered the governor’s mansion half way through fiscal 2006, inheriting a $1.45 billion budget for higher education costs. That rose to $1.76 billion in 2008. Kaine’s final budget proposal called for funding to hit a low point of $1.37 billion in fiscal 2012. So if you compare the proposed 2012 valley to the 2008 peak, Kaine endorsed a 22.1 percent cut to higher education spending -- close to the Republicans’ number. But if you compare Kaine’s proposed 2012 funding to the level six years earlier when he came into office, the reduction is only 5.7 percent. Is it fair to blame Kaine for the cuts to the colleges? All of the spending levels Kaine recommended for colleges and universities -- within a few dollars -- were in state budgets that were approved with overwhelming bipartisan support in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates. Lingamfelter supported all the final budget bills. Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the Kaine, said the former governor had to cut nearly every part of the state budget to cope with the deep recession. She disputed that reductions to higher education hit 25 percent, saying the GOP cherry picked data. Hoffine said that Kaine backfilled most of his cuts in the 2010 and 2011 budgets with stimulus money from the federal government. The stimulus ran out in 2012, however, leaving higher education in a hole. Hoffine also noted that Kaine in 2008 pushed through a $1.4 billion bond program for building projects at colleges and universities. Dan Hix, SCHEV’s finance policy director, said lumping together the general fund spending and the bond money is "sort of an apples to oranges" comparison. Colleges "do need construction, but you can’t take that money and hire faculty, buy equipment," he said. Our ruling Lingamfelter said Kaine cut higher education by 25 percent, leading to higher tuition costs for in-state students. The delegate and the state GOP offered two sets of statistics to back the claim about the cuts. Lingamfelter accurately referred to a SCHEV report showing per-student spending at four-year colleges dropped 25.4 percent from the 2006 to the 2011 state budget. Republicans say bottom-line spending under Kaine decreased by 22.1 percent. But to get to that number, they ignore increases to higher education made early in Kaine’s term and begin counting in 2008, when spending peaked, the recession set in and state politicians began to cut. We think the purest measurement comes from comparing the 2006 budget Kaine essentially inherited to his farewell proposal that offered a spending plan through 2012. That shows Kaine endorsed budgets that reduced higher education spending by 5.7 percent over six years. Lingamfelter’s statement puts full responsibility for the cuts on Kaine. But these were policy decisions that Lingamfelter and his fellow Republican delegates overwhelmingly supported by voting for state budgets. So Lingamfelter is correct in saying that state spending on colleges went down under Kaine and in-state tuition went up. But the most basic, bottom-line statistics do not produce the dramatic scale of spending cuts that the Republican claims. And his comment omits that Kaine did not unilaterally enact budgets; he needed the General Assembly’s help. We rate Lingamfelter’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-07373	"Bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-bin-laden-had-declared-war-again/	In his speech on May 1, 2011, announcing that a Special Forces team had killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, President Barack Obama took care to praise Pakistan for its assistance. "It's important to note that our counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding," Obama said. "Indeed, bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well, and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people." In a press conference the following day, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed those sentiments, saying, "In Pakistan, we are committed to supporting the people and government as they defend their own democracy from violent extremism. Indeed, as the president said, bin Laden had also declared war on Pakistan. He had ordered the killings of many innocent Pakistani men, women and children." In a CNN interview on May 3, Deputy National Security Adviser Denis McDonough discussed al-Qaida's terrorist acts against the Pakistani military and also referenced how "we saw in 2007, when al-Qaida declared war on Pakistan...'' Is it possible that bin Laden had declared war against the very country where he was living? We went to the news archives for September 2007, when bin Laden released the videotaped message that underpins Obama's and Clinton's claim. The news stories, however, do not talk about a general declaration of war against Pakistan, but rather that bin Laden called for a jihad, or holy war, against Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who was then president of Pakistan, calling him "a tyrant'' and "an apostate.'' Bin Laden disliked Musharraf because the Pakistani leader allied himself with the West -- particularly the United States -- and against al-Qaida. After Pakistani forces stormed a mosque in Islamabad, the Daily Telegraph in London quoted bin Laden saying, "So Pervez, his ministers, his soldiers and those who help him are all accomplices in spilling the blood of the Muslims who have been killed ... He who helps him knowingly and willingly is an infidel like him." According to an account in the Chicago Tribune on Sept. 21, 2007, bin Laden said the military's siege of the mosque "demonstrated Musharraf's insistence on continuing his loyalty, submissiveness and aid to America against the Muslims ... and makes armed rebellion against him and removing him obligatory." According to the Daily Telegraph, al-Qaida released a second statement in 2007 from bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, in which he said the storming of the mosque "revealed the extent of the despicableness, lowliness and treason of Musharraf and his forces, who don't deserve the honour of defending Pakistan ... Pakistan is a Muslim land, the forces of Musharraf are hunting dogs under Bush's crucifix.'' So is declaring war against Musharraf and the Pakistani military that backed him the same as declaring war against the entire nation? Analysts we interviewed had a range of opinions on that point. "That would constitute a declaration of war in my view," said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. "In fact, a more powerful one than our secular conceptions of war since this would carry a theological imprimatur and a religious responsibility." But Sadanand Dhume, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said there is "a very big distinction" between declaring holy war against Musharraf and declaring war against the whole of Pakistan. The statements by President Obama and Secretary Clinton were clearly meant to ease tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan, Dhume said, because Pakistan is still an essential ally in the region, particularly with the ongoing war in neighboring Afghanistan. But, Dhume said, the comments "don't square with the facts on the ground." "Bin Laden has never declared war against Pakistan," Dhume said. "He was opposed to Musharraf." After the 9/11 attacks, Musharraf was regarded as a key U.S. ally in the fight against terrorism, particularly al-Qaida. With the U.S. sending some $20 billion in foreign aid to Pakistan since 2001, Dhume said, Musharraf cooperated with the U.S. "to a certain degree" against elements of al-Qaida in Pakistan. For example, Pakistan's intelligence agency captured the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in Pakistan in 2003, and turned him over to U.S. authorities. Bin Laden always opposed the leaders of Muslim nations that were seen as sympathetic to the U.S., Dhume said. "There was no declaration of war against Pakistan," he said. "Think about it logically. Why would al-Qaida declare war against Pakistan? They declared war against a leader they thought was an American puppet. You have to view it through their ideology. For them, it is about a larger, global holy war." Indeed, many of al-Qaida's supporters are Pakistanis, he noted. A Chicago Tribune story about bin Laden's taped message in 2007 noted that a survey of Pakistanis at that time found that bin Laden had a higher approval rating than Musharraf -- 46 percent to 38 percent. "I understand why Obama said what he said," Dhume said. "If (Obama) described things as they really are, the (American public's) anger toward Pakistan would be even greater." Technically, bin Laden didn't declare war against countries, but rather against governments and regimes, said Laura Mansfield, a counter-terrorism analyst. "But I'm not sure there is any distinction there," she said, or if there is, it is a distinction without much difference, because bin Laden's declaration resulted in terrorist attacks against Pakistani military and civilians alike. "Bin Laden had an agenda to remove all of the secular leaders from Muslim countries and to replace them with leaders who would follow Sharia (Islamic religious) law," Mansfield said. Bin Laden may have been more careful about declarations of jihad against the leaders of Muslim countries rather than the countries themselves, but that did not appear to translate to his statements about the United States. For the U.S., his ire was often more generally aimed at Americans rather than its leaders or government. For example, a Feb. 23, 1998, "fatwa" signed by bin Laden and others in the name of the World Islamic Front and called "Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders", stated that "to kill the Americans and their allies -- civilians and military -- is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it." Again, Obama and Clinton said "bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan." In fact, bin Laden declared a holy war against Pakistan's then-president, Musharraf, because of his cooperation with the United States in its war against al-Qaida. Bin Laden clearly had some support in Pakistan (Exhibit A: that was his final hiding place). In the end, we think there are credible arguments to be made that there is little distinction between declaring a holy war on a country's leader and military versus the country itself.

pomt-06853	"There's no money in Social Security."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/aug/04/barry-hinckley/gop-senate-candidate-hinckley-says-there-no-money-/	How much money does the United States have on hand to pay for Social Security benefits? That was one of the issues that Barry Hinckley, a Republican seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, touched upon during a Channel 6 interview that aired July 24. Noting that people are living longer and there's concern about how the benefits will be financed down the road, host Vincent "Buddy" Cianci, asked Hinckley what his solution would be. The candidate said he would raise the retirement age. He also focused on separate statements by Whitehouse during the debate over the debt ceiling. He said that Whitehouse had reported that the crisis might prevent benefit checks from going out and that the Social Security trust fund has a multi-trillion dollar surplus. "So if there's a surplus, why are checks going to stop going out? Well, actually, there isn't" a surplus, said Hinckley. He asserted that the Johnson administration started spending Social Security money to pay for the Vietnam War and "they never looked back. They kept spending that money so that, unfortunately, there's no money in Social Security." On his website, Hinckley doesn't say there's no money in Social Security. He's says there's no "actual money … just IOU's from the general fund." PolitiFact has dealt with the no-money-in-Social-Security issue before. More than a year ago, Michele Bachmann, now a Republican candidate for president, was given a False on the Truth-O-Meter for insisting that "Social Security, like I told you, is out of money." Why False? In recent history, Social Security has been financed exclusively by payroll taxes. The amount raised in taxes was more than enough to cover the benefits it needed to pay out. The excess went into a trust fund, which has now accumulated roughly $2.5 trillion. Those who say the fund has no money, or that it has nothing more than a bunch of IOUs from the federal government, are referring to the fact that Social Security doesn't have $2.5 trillion in cash sitting in a vault somewhere. The federal government has loaned the money to itself, using the cash to pay for other expenses. But these aren't IOUs, which generate no interest. The loan is in the form of special-issue Treasury bonds that earned $117.5 billion in interest in 2010, according to the latest trust fund report. So saying that Social Security has no money is akin to saying that you're broke if you have $20 million in certificates of deposit but only 20 cents in cash. But things are changing. Thanks to the recession, Social Security paid out more in benefits in the last two years than it raised from the Social Security tax. That hasn't happened since 1983. Last year's shortfall was $49 billion; this year it's expected to be $46 billion. To pay benefits last year and this year, Social Security is supplementing money from the payroll tax with interest from the bonds, according to Mark Hinkle, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration. Unfortunately, with the U.S. population getting older, more people will be getting benefits, and fewer young people will be paying taxes to finance the program. According to the 2011 Annual Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund Reports, interest from the treasury bonds -- combined with the ongoing revenue from the Social Security payroll tax -- will be insufficient to cover the cost of retiree checks in 2022. Unless something is changed, the trust fund will be drained because it is under-funded. Fourteen years later, in 2036, the trust fund itself will be depleted, according to the report. If nothing is done, the only money flowing into Social Security will be the amount raised year-to-year in taxes. That will only cover about 75 percent of what it should through 2085. One issue driving the debate over Social Security is the realization that the federal government -- the folks promising to pay those Treasury bonds, with interest -- isn't exactly awash with cash, as the debate over the debt ceiling highlighted. The national debt is approaching $15 trillion, a total that includes the $2.5 trillion owed to the Social Security trust fund. So maybe a better analogy would be: Saying that Social Security has no money is akin to saying that you're broke if you have 20 cents in your pocket but $20 million in the stock of a heavily leveraged company. You're far from broke. But you're probably lying awake at night wondering if you're ever going to see all $20 million of your investment. When we asked Hinckley about his statement that "Social Security has no money," he said he is correct because Social Security doesn't have cash on hand. The bonds it holds, he said, are assets. "Social Security has assets. It doesn't have money," he said. "Money is something you can immediately pay bills with. Assets are only redeemable if the government can borrow more money to pay them off. I've never said they don't have assets. The problem is, I question the integrity of the assets when you have to borrow money to redeem them." To summarize: Hinckley said, "There's no money in Social Security." In fact, Social Security has a $2.5-trillion trust fund with more money coming in each year. The money is "invested" in a federal government that paid out $117.5 billion in interest in 2010 but shows a risky willingness to rack up debt, raising concerns that it may someday be unable to pay that money back, with interest. But Hinckley, in his Channel 6 comments, said Social Security has no money now. At the time he said it, the checks were still going out. And they still are. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-11025	Says Ronald Reagan said immigrants "brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/03/becoming-american-initiative/did-ronald-reagan-say-immigrants-made-america-grea/	A conservative group in favor of legislation that benefits immigrants has a new ad claiming President Ronald Reagan said immigrants made America great — a jab to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan and his hard-line immigration policies. "Today, the Becoming American Initiative launched its first ad featuring a video of President Ronald Reagan talking about how immigrants have always made America great," the group said July 3. "The message is especially important for conservatives and all Americans to hear on July 4th as President Trump pushes to limit immigration." The ad shows footage of Reagan talking about immigrants who "brought with them courage and the values of family, work and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again." Reagan used the "Let’s Make America Great Again" slogan in his 1980 presidential campaign. Did he say what the ad shows? We found that Reagan in a 1980 campaign speech spoke about immigrants’ journey to America and of their contributions to society. The ad patched together what Reagan said about immigrants with his closing call for everyone to "make America great again." The full speech wasn’t just about immigrants, it narrated Reagan’s grievances with Carter and the economy and Reagan’s own vision for America. We reached out to Becoming American Initiative, a conservative a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, via Twitter but did not hear back. Becoming American Initiative ad The 30-second ad features Reagan’s voice over video of him delivering a speech with the Statue of Liberty in the background. It includes black and white video of a crowd of people walking and of men doing construction work, as well as video in color of a man picking fruit, of a child at the border, and a photograph of people waving American flags at what looks like a naturalization ceremony. Here’s a transcript of Reagan’s words: "Through this Golden Door has come millions of men and women. These families came here to work. Others came to America and often harrowing conditions. They didn’t ask what this country could do for them but what they could do to make this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history. They brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again." A slide at the end of the video said: "Immigrants Have Always Made America Great." What Reagan said The Becoming American Initiative ad is based on a Labor Day, Sept. 1, 1980 campaign speech Reagan delivered at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, N.J. Reagan went on to beat Democrat Jimmy Carter in the November election. With the Statue of Liberty in the background, Reagan paid tribute to immigrants, starting his speech by saying they came to America to work and helped build cities and "incredibly productive farms." Reagan twice said "make America great again": around the middle of the speech, when he spoke about what his administration will do; and toward the end of the speech, when he called on everyone to also "make America great again." The ad from Becoming American Initiative cut and patched together sentences. Below is a partial transcript of Reagan’s speech, in bold are the words the ad highlighted. "Through this Golden Door, under the gaze of that Mother of Exiles, has come millions of men and women, who first stepped foot on American soil right there, on Ellis Island, so close to the Statue of Liberty. These families came here to work. They came to build. Others came to America in different ways, from other lands, under different, and often harrowing conditions, but this place symbolizes what they all managed to build, no matter where they came from or how they came or how much they suffered. They helped to build that magnificent city across the river. They spread across the land building other cities and towns and incredibly productive farms. They came to make America work. They didn’t ask what this country could do for them but what they could do to make this, this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history. They brought with them courage, ambition and the values of family, neighborhood, work, peace and freedom. We all came from different lands but we shared the same values, the same dream. Today a President of the United States would have us believe that dream is over or at least in need of change. Jimmy Carter’s Administration tells us that the descendants of those who sacrificed to start again in this land of freedom may have to abandon the dream that drew their ancestors to a new life in a new land. The Carter record is a litany of despair, of broken promises, of sacred trusts abandoned and forgotten. ... This country needs a new administration, with a renewed dedication to the dream of an America -- an administration that will give that dream new life and make America great again! Restoring and revitalizing that dream will take bold action. ... I want more than anything I've ever wanted, to have an administration that will, through its actions, at home and in the international arena, let millions of people know that Miss Liberty still "lifts her lamp beside the golden door." Through our international broadcasting stations -- the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and the others -- let us send, loud and clear, the message that this generation of Americans intends to keep that lamp shining; that this dream, that this dream the last best hope of man on earth, this nation under God, shall not perish from the earth. We will instead carry on the building of an American economy that once again holds forth real opportunity for all, we shall continue to be a symbol of freedom and guardian of the eternal values that so inspired those who came to this port of entry. Let us pledge to each other, with this Great Lady looking on, that we can, and so help us God, we will make America great again." Several years later, Reagan signed into law the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. The law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards — including people who had been in the United States since 1982 and special agricultural workers. Our ruling A Becoming American Initiative ad claimed Ronald Reagan said immigrants "brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again." The ad is based on a 1980 Labor Day campaign speech in New Jersey, where Reagan lauded immigrants’ contributions, while also listing his grievances with Carter and his own vision for America. Reagan didn’t say immigrants "made America great" verbatim, but he did imply it. The ad cuts out some of Reagan’s words to make the comments appear adjacent.

pomt-06988	For people in the top 1 percent for income, "your effective tax burden is in the low 20s, the lowest it’s been in decades and decades and decades -- lower than somebody who might make substantially less money."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/12/timothy-geithner/geithner-says-top-1-percent-have-tax-rate-low-20s/	Even as they push Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling this summer, President Barack Obama and members of his administration argue that America’s richest citizens should sacrifice some of the tax breaks that substantially lower how much they pay. During a June 24 appearance at Dartmouth College, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said it’s not only a matter of fiscal responsibility, but also of fairness. "We have to correct the biggest problem in our tax system today, which is that it’s just basically unfair," said Geithner, a 1983 Dartmouth graduate. "If you are fortunate enough to be among the … most fortunate 0.5 percent, 1 percent of Americans today, your effective tax burden is in the low 20s, the lowest it’s been in decades and decades and decades — lower than somebody who might make substantially less money." The wealthy have always been able to take advantage of tax breaks, so it's not like millionaires all pay the top tax rate of 35 percent. But is the disparity that large? Let’s break Geithner’s statement down into its parts: * The richest group is paying in the low 20s; * That tax burden is lighter than it has been in decades; * Their effective tax rate is lower than for people who make much less. In his speech, Geithner was referring to income taxes rather than all taxes that individuals pay. Congressional Budget Office data compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan research group, show that the effective individual income tax rate for the wealthiest 1 percent was 19 percent in 2007, the most recent year available. Citing IRS statistics, Geithner’s office put the rate at 23 percent in 2008. By those measurements, Geithner is in the ballpark. Is the burden the lowest in decades? Geithner’s office points to a recent PolitiFact articlethat found Mostly True the president’s claim that wealthy CEOs and hedge fund managers are paying lower federal income tax rates than they have since the 1950s. That finding was based partly on two documents — the 2010 Economic Report of the President, and a 2007 study by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanual Saez — that are cited by Geithner’s office and generally support his assertion. The Urban-Brookings center, again using statistics from the Congressional Budget Office, found the same trend. In a table charting tax rates between 1979 and 2007, the CBO reported that the average effective income tax rate (that is, the percentage paid after deductions and credits) for the richest 1 percent of earners began at 21.8 percent in 1979, rose to as high as 24.2 percent in 1996 and 2000 and had dropped to 19 percent by 2007. (Conservatives note that even though the rates are dropping, upper-income Americans still account for the lion’s share of the nation’s income tax revenue. "So while it is true that tax rates … are significantly lower than they were 30 years ago, the rich are paying a lot more of the overall tax burden," says Cato Institute economist Dan Mitchell. Federal figures show that the top 5 percent of taxpayers accounted for more than half of the income tax dollars paid.) But what about Geithner's final point: that the rate for the top 1 percent is "lower than somebody who might make substantially less money"? In his talk, Geithner cited the example of super-investor Warren Buffett, who famously complained that the United States tax system is so upside-down that he paid a smaller share of his income to Uncle Sam than his secretary. Speaking to wealthy donorsat a 2007 fundraiser for then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, Buffett said, "The 400 of us (here) pay a lower part of our income in taxes than our receptionists do, or our cleaning ladies for that matter." Buffett said that he was taxed at 17.7 percent on the $46 million he had made the previous year, while his secretary faced a 30 percent federal tax bill on her $60,000 earnings. Buffett’s case provides a powerful anecdote about the extremes of a tax system that hands breaks to a small group of wealthy people, particularly those who take much of their income in tax-favored capital gains and dividends. And Treasury statistics support the assertion that the super-duper rich — the 120,000 taxpayers who comprise the wealthiest 9/100ths of 1 percent of the tax-paying population — pay slightly lower income tax rates than people just below them on the income ladder. But Geithner made a much broader assertion. He said the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers — about 1.4 million individuals or households — paid lower rates. And that isn't supported by the facts. We began with a source provided by Geithner’s office: the 2010 Economic Report of the President. On page 154, a chart tracks the history of effective tax rates for people making more than $250,000 a year and the middle 20 percent of taxpayers who make considerably less. While the tax rate for the rich has clearly dropped, the chart shows, it remains visibly higher than the middle group. The CBO figures paint a more specific, and stark, contrast. In 2007 (the most recent year listed), the top 1 percent of earners paid 19 percent of their income in federal individual income taxes, and for people earning less, the rate went steadily down, to a rate of minus 6.8 percent for people in the lowest 20 percent of taxpayers. (Because of the Earned Income Tax Credit, many working class families pay no net taxes and, indeed, collect refunds from the government to help them make ends meet.) The CBO chart covers only the federal individual income tax, which is the one Geithner was discussing. But even if you fold in other federal taxes (corporate, estate, Social Security and Medicare), average rates remain higher for the richest group than for everyone else. The non-partisan Urban-Brookings center folded in the other forms of federal taxes for 2011, and found that the top 1 percent will pay 27.6 percent, and that rates steadily decline for the less-wealthy until they reach zero (a little less, actually) for the lowest one-fifth of earners. While some of the very rich pay a lower rate than less wealthy Americans, said Eric Toder, the center’s co-director, "We do find that the average rates go up by income." Our ruling Geithner was largely correct when he said the top 1 percent pay rates in the low 20s, a tax burden that is historically low. But he's wrong that the wealthiest enjoy effective rates "lower than somebody who might make substantially less money." We rate the statement Half True. UPDATE: This story was updated to clarify our characterization of Geithner's message about the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers. Our initial article said Geithner was wrong that their effective tax rate is lower than that of "most Americans," including ones who earn substantially less. We have changed that to quote Geithner directly in saying that the wealthiest enjoy effective rates "lower than somebody who might make substantially less money."

pomt-04473	Under Barack Obama, the U.S. now has the "lowest workforce since (President Jimmy) Carter."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/08/american-future-fund/ad-says-workforce-smaller-under-barack-obama-any-t/	The American Future Fund, a group that advocates "conservative and free-market" principles, has released an advertisement that -- like other ads and Web videos in this election cycle -- seeks to compare President Barack Obama to his one-term Democratic predecessor, Jimmy Carter. "Remember where we were four years ago: 11 million people out of work, a $10 trillion debt," the narrator says in the ad, which was released Oct. 1. "But four years later, 13 million people out of work, $16 trillion debt, and now the lowest workforce in 31 years." As the narrator mentions the size of the workforce, the visual on the screen shows the line "lowest workforce since Carter" against an image of Carter’s face dissolving into Obama’s. We thought we’d check whether under Barack Obama, the U.S. now has the "lowest workforce since (President Jimmy) Carter." Some contradictions Before looking at the substance of the comparison, let’s point out a few internal problems with the ad. First, 31 years ago was October 1981 -- 10 months after Ronald Reagan took office. Given the reverence Republicans have for Reagan, it’s easy to see why this ad focused on Carter instead. But "31 years" and the Carter reference can’t both be right. One of them has to be incorrect. Second, the ad uses the term "lowest workforce." The term "workforce" refers to an absolute number of people who are either employed or are seeking work. Using this statistic, the group’s claim is way off, because of the nation’s overall population growth during the last three decades as well as the expansion of women in the workforce through the 1990s. In 1980 and 1981, the size of the civilian labor force was a bit over 100 million. Today, even after a drop due to the most recent recession, it’s more than 150 million -- a 50 percent increase. The American Future Fund didn’t respond to us for this story, so we can’t be entirely sure what they meant. We wonder if they were referring to a different statistic -- one that takes into account the size of the nation’s population. That statistic is called the civilian labor force participation rate -- essentially, the labor force divided by the nation’s total population. Comparing labor force participation rates So what happens when you look at the labor force participation rate? By the numbers, the ad isn’t far off. The figure for August 2012 -- the most recent month at the point the ad began airing -- was 63.5 percent. (On Oct. 5, the new figures for September showed it ticked slightly upward to 63.6, but we'll use the numbers that were current when the ad started to run.) The last time the rate was as low as 63.5 percent for more than one consecutive month was in 1979, when Carter was president. However, it’s worth noting a few caveats. First, the rate did dip to 63.5 once during Reagan’s presidency, in September 1981. Second, if you smooth out monthly volatility, labor force participation rates were close to indistinguishable during the final year of Carter and the first year of Reagan, most of which was a recessionary period. The average labor force participation rate in 1981 under Reagan was only one-tenth of 1 percentage point higher than it was in 1980 under Carter. So the focus on Carter has a grain of truth, but even there the ad overplays its hand a bit. That's because economic factors are not the only things that affect the labor force participation rate. The other big one is demographics, particularly the aging of the population. In the 2000 Census, the number of Americans aged 60 to 69 -- that is, those who had recently hit retirement age or would do so within a few years -- was to about 20 million. But thanks to the Baby Boomers, the number surged in the 2010 Census to more than 29 million, almost a 50 percent increase. This matters because the more people aged 60 to 69, the more people who are passing into retirement age -- or, to put it another way, leaving the labor force. Even though more people proportionally are remaining in the workforce after retirement age, the difference isn’t big enough to cancel out the flood of new retirees. Our ruling The ad says the U.S. now has the "lowest workforce since Carter," emphasizing the point by morphing Carter’s face into Obama’s. The ad includes a significant inconsistency about dates, and it uses the word "workforce" incorrectly. During the Carter administration, the size of the civilian labor force was a bit over 100 million. Today, even after the most recent recession, it’s more than 150 million. By a different measure -- the civilian labor force participation rate -- its claim is not far off. In general, the last time the rate was consistently this low was under Carter. However, not all the blame for the low participation rates today has to do with the recession and slow recovery under Obama. A portion of the decline has been driven by long-term demographic trends that have nothing to do with the person or the party in the White House. Because it garbles the facts on a number of fronts, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-03407	"In 1960, most black children were raised in two-parent, monogamous families." Today "we have only 20 percent of black children being raised in two-parent, monogamous families..."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2013/jul/01/ew-jackson/ew-jackson-says-20-percent-black-children-are-bein/	E.W. Jackson, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, says black families have deteriorated over the last 50 years. "In 1960, most black children were raised in two-parent, monogamous families." he said. "By now, by this time, we have only 20 percent of black children being raised in two-parent, monogamous families with a married man and woman raising those children." We wondered whether the stark drop Jackson described during a June 20 speech in Newport News was accurate. He attributed the deterioration of black families to the expansion of welfare programs in the 1960s. Gregory Aldridge, Jackson’s campaign manager, told us the figures came from a chart by the conservative Heritage Foundation. It shows less than 20 percent of black babies in the 1950s were born to single mothers and that rose to 72.3 percent in 2008. Heritage attributed its figures to the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control. These figures, however, don’t quite fit Jackson’s statement. His claim focused on the percentage of black children "raised" in two-parent, married families. Some single mothers at birth might later marry and raise their children in two-parent homes. So we turned to Gretchen Livingston, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center. She said U.S. Census data shows that in 1960 about 65 percent of black children under 18 were living in households with two married parents -- well in accord with Jackson’s claim that "most" of the children were reared in such homes. U.S. Census Bureau tallies for 2012 show that of 11.2 million black children, 3.7 million were living with two married parents. That works out to 34 percent -- higher than the 20 percent Jackson claimed. The reason for the drop, Jackson opined, is that welfare and food stamp expansion in the 1960s "began to tell women you don’t need a man in the home, the government will take care of you. That began to tell men you don’t need to be in the home, the government will take of this woman and take care of these children." Jackson’s opinion is not universally shared. A lot of research has been done on welfare’s effect on the black family and the conclusions are mixed, according to Gregory Acs, director of the nonpartisan Urban Institute’s Income and Benefits Policy Center. Acs doesn’t think welfare is completely unrelated to the drop in the percentage of children living with two parents, but he said a lot of other issues are at play. For example, Acs said economic opportunities for women have risen over the decades and fallen for men. That has contributed to a drop in marriage rates that also explains why more children -- black and white -- are being raised by one-parent families. In 1960, 91 percent of white children of under 18 were living in two married parents in the household, according to a 2010 report by the Pew Research Center. By 2012 that had dropped to 70 percent of white children living with two married parents, according to U.S. Census figures. Our ruling Jackson said in 1960 most black children were raised in two-parent, married households and now only 20 percent of them live in two-parent households. In 1960, about two-thirds of black children were living with two parents so that part of Jackson’s statement is correct. The most recent figures show that 34 percent are living with two married parents. So Jackson’s latest figure is off, but that doesn’t harm his gist that there’s been a significant decline in traditional black families. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	E.W.

pomt-01657	Because of President Barack Obama’s failure to "push job creation," the black unemployment rate in Ferguson, Mo., is three times higher than the white unemployment rate.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/21/lou-dobbs/black-unemployment-three-times-higher-ferguson-bec/	Fox News host Lou Dobbs criticized President Barack Obama for not going firsthand to Ferguson, Mo., to calm tensions after the killing of an unarmed 18-year-old African-American by a white police officer. Obama, Dobbs claimed, bears responsibility for the economic issues that have contributed to the tensions in Ferguson. "Black unemployment is three times that of white unemployment," Dobbs said on Aug. 19’s America’s Newsroom. "The community itself has a 13 percent unemployment rate, more than double that of the national average. The household net worth in that community is $10,000, a third less than the national average." "These are the results of policies on the part of the state government, the local community, and the president of the United States," Dobbs said, arguing that President Obama should assure residents that "there will be honest and forthright dealing" with "no ambiguity about the conclusions." Obama needs to see, Dobbs said, "what happens when you don’t push job creation, you don’t push prosperity for all Americans." Linking Obama’s economic policy to the tensions in Ferguson, a town of 21,000, is a fairly significant charge. So we wanted to check Dobbs’ claim that because of Obama’s failure to "push job creation," the black unemployment rate in Ferguson is three times higher than the white unemployment rate. Ferguson’s unemployment rate The most recent unemployment figures for Ferguson come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which asks an annual sample of 1 in 38 households about their demographics, background and finances. Ferguson’s small enough that the Census only produces figures over a three-year period, the most recent of which track 2010-2012. Over that period, 16 percent of the black labor force in Ferguson was unemployed, compared to 8.5 percent of the white labor force. That’s a ratio of about 1.9; not the three times that Dobbs alleged. Dobbs' figure is more accurate for St. Louis County, which includes Ferguson. In 2012, St. Louis County had a black unemployment rate of 17.8 percent, 3.1 times the white unemployment rate of 5.7 percent. But Ferguson makes up just 2 percent of St. Louis County in terms of population. Dobbs is also closer if you include Ferguson Census figures from 2008-12. In that scenario, the black unemployment is 2.8 times the white unemployment rate. Natalie Holmes, a researcher for the Brookings Institute, told us the best statistics to use are the Ferguson numbers from 2010-12, because they are both more current and "capture less of the recession." Putting the racial employment gap in context Dobbs is right that Ferguson’s unemployment rate of 13 percent, according to the American Community Survey’s 2010-12 estimates, is roughly twice the current national average of 6.2 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By most measures, Ferguson is not a prosperous town. But the gap between black and white unemployment in Ferguson is nowhere near unique. In July, the national black unemployment rate was 11.4 percent. That’s about 2.2 times the 5.3 percent white unemployment rate, according to the BLS -- a bigger gap, proportionally, than in Ferguson, with the caveat that the numbers from Ferguson aren’t as recent. So Ferguson is reasonably representative when it comes to the racial employment gap. More critically for Dobbs, this isn’t a recent phenomenon somehow created or exacerbated by Obama. Since the BLS began keeping unemployment data by race in 1954, the black unemployment rate has consistently been about twice as high as the white unemployment rate. According to the Pew Research Center, which published the above graph in 2013, the discrepancy between black and white unemployment was highest in the late 1980s, and lowest during the Great Recession. The average ratio between black unemployment and white unemployment since the BLS began keeping data is 2.2 -- exactly what it was in July. Put simply, African-Americans have been 2.2 times more likely to be unemployed since 1954 than whites. Researchers haven’t reached a consensus on why this gap persists: explanations include, according to Pew, "differing industrial distribution of black and white workers," a "skills gap," and the "‘last hired, first fired’ hypothesis." Dobbs goes too far in pinning the blame on Obama. Experts have consistently told us and our colleagues at PolitiFact that although government policies can affect employment figures, other economic factors are typically at play; in this case, the Great Recession and subsequent recovery. And according to Elizabeth Kneebone of the Brookings Institute, Ferguson’s economic downturn over the last decade is a potent example of the general increase of suburban poverty in America as more money flows to urban areas. Our ruling Dobbs said that because Obama failed to "push job creation," the black unemployment rate in Ferguson is three times higher than the white unemployment rate. First and foremost, Dobbs’ numbers are off. The most recent and best available statistics say the black unemployment rate is 1.9 times higher than the white unemployment rate in Ferguson (16 percent to 8.5 percent). Second, that has little to do with Obama. Since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping data in 1954, African-Americans have been nationwide are more likely to be unemployed than whites. We rate Dobbs’ claim False.	None	Lou Dobbs	None	None	None	2014-08-21T13:14:48	2014-08-19	['Missouri']

pomt-06935	"Your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/20/alan-hays/hays-claims-tax-dollars-not-being-used-sue-voters-/	In talking about redistricting -- the redrawing of legislative and congressional districts that figures to be a prominent story for the next year or so -- state Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatilla, recently made the point that he did not vote to spend money on a lawsuit that seeks to overturn a redistricting constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2010. That amendment, called Amendment 6, says that elected officials cannot draw congressional districts to favor incumbents, political parties or thwart minority representation. (A separate amendment, Amendment 5, includes the same protections for state legislative districts). In a previous item about whether Hays voted to spend money to fight a lawsuit about one of the amendments, we rated Hays' claim True, noting that the issue did not come up for a vote in the Florida Senate, and that it's the House that has joined a lawsuit trying to strike Amendment 6 down. We also checked a broader claim from Hays that the Legislature has not "filed a lawsuit to fight" the state constitutional amendment. But that doesn't mean we're done with his statement to voters at The Villages during a July 13, 2011 redistricting public hearing. "Some of you people had voted to tax or to spend our taxes against the amendments that were passed by 63 percent of the vote," a man told legislators during the hearing. "I wonder if you, Sen. Hays, since I'm in your district, did you vote?" "Did I vote for what?" Hays asked. "....These taxes being paid for the suit against the amendments?" the man asked. Later in the meeting, Hays responded: "No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit. The disappointing part of this whole thing, folks, is the misinformation that is out there. The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6. The Amendment 6 lawsuit was filed by one Republican congressman and one Democratic congresswoman. The Florida House chose to go, and what's the term? An intervenor? ... in seeking clarification. The Florida House intervened. But your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people who voted the 63 percent. Believe me. I don't know where you got your information but it's incorrect. So no I did not vote to waste that money." So Hays was right to say he didn't vote to spend money "to fight that lawsuit." But was he also right to claim that "your tax dollars are not being used to sue you?" The day after Amendments 5 and 6 passed, two of Florida's minority members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- filed suit seeking to overturn Amendment 6 (which relates to congressional redistricting). They argued that the amendment will negatively affect minority representation. On Jan. 14, 2011, the Florida House filed a motion seeking to join the Brown/Diaz-Balart lawsuit, arguing in a filing that: "It is the Legislature -- not Plaintiffs -- which has the primary responsibility for redistricting. And it is the Legislature -- not Plaintiffs -- whose prerogative will be challenged (and potentially invalidated) under the Amendment," the suit says. The Florida Senate, in which Hays serves, is not a party to the lawsuit. Regardless, tax dollars are being used for the suit, state budget records show. The House has spent slightly more than $700,000 on contract legal fees for three firms associated with redistricting issues. GrayRobinson, received the highest amount: about $614,000 between July 2010 and May 2011. Latham and Watkins had been paid about $28,000 and Miguel De Grandy about $58,000. Not all those fees are connected to the Amendment 6 lawsuit, said House spokeswoman Katie Betta. But some are. Betta gave us a ballpark breakdown: about 50 percent of those bills were related to the Amendment 6 lawsuit, 40 percent were for general legal services related to the redistricting process and the last 10 percent were for the required process for the state to seek permission from the federal Department of Justice to go forward with the amendments. To go a step further, tax dollars are being used to defend Amendment 6 as well. Through June 2011, the defendant, the Florida Secretary of State, has paid $59,724.26 to lawyer Harry Thomas with the Tallahassee firm of Radey Thomas Yon & Clark. The Secretary of State is the defendant because the office is charged with implementing the amendment. (Brown and Diaz-Balart are using legal defense funds -- not tax dollars -- to pay for the lawsuits, said David Simon, spokesman for Brown.) Hays told a group of residents concerned about redistricting, "Your tax dollars are not being used to sue you the people who voted the 63 percent." But tax dollars are being used by the House to try to strike down Amendment 6, as well as by the Secretary of State to defend the amendment in court. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01942	Says President Barack Obama said when "we got bin Laden, terrorism problem solved."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/24/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-says-president-obama-claimed-terrorism/	It feels a little like 2003 lately, with Iraq in crisis and former Vice President Dick Cheney arguing for a muscular intervention to thwart the rise of violent anti-American extremists. Cheney thrust himself into the punditry ring with a Wall Street Journal op-ed that eviscerated President Barack Obama’s foreign policy and spurred follow-up TV interviews. ABC This Week’s Jonathan Karl asked Cheney about Obama on June 22, saying it "almost seems like you’re accusing the president of treason here, saying he’s intentionally bringing America down a notch." Obama’s withdrawal of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan will allow more terrorists to gain a foothold in those countries and threaten U.S. interests, Cheney said. (We previously checked his claim that the number of terrorists has doubled, which we rated True.) "The scope of the problem, in part, is based upon an unwillingness by the president to recognize we have a problem," Cheney said. "They're still living back in the day when they claimed we got (Osama) bin Laden, terrorism problem solved. That wasn’t true then, it’s even less true today." The question for us in this fact-check: Did Obama declare the terrorism problem solved after special forces killed bin Laden in 2011? The answer: not that we can find. FactCheck.org looked into a similar claim from Cheney’s June 19 interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. When Kelly called him out for being wrong on Iraq "time and time again," Cheney said, "Barack Obama has stated repeatedly the terrorist threat is gone, we got bin Laden." After reviewing Obama’s speeches in recent years, FactCheck found no traces of Obama saying the terrorist threat was "gone," which obviously means he did not say it "repeatedly." Our review turned up similar findings. We did not find any instances in which Obama said threats of terrorism are solved, or gone, or just kaput. Spokespeople for the White House and Cheney could not be reached for comment. Obama did not make that claim the night he announced bin Laden’s death, and he has not dismissed the lingering threat from al-Qaida-affiliated groups and other violent jihadists in public comments since 2011. His usual message is bin Laden’s death is a big deal, but the terrorism fight is not over. "The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al-Qaida," Obama said May 1, 2011. "Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort. There’s no doubt that al-Qaida will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must –- and we will — remain vigilant at home and abroad." In the column Cheney co-wrote with daughter Liz, he pinpointed Obama saying "core al-Qaida is on its heels, has been decimated" to illustrate the president’s skewed point of view. The statement, pulled from Obama’s remarks in an Aug. 9, 2013, White House press conference, is accurate but out of context. Obama was responding then to a question from Karl (that guy is everywhere), who asked if Obama still believed "al-Qaida has been decimated" after a previous speech, given terrorist threats across the Middle East and Africa that closed diplomatic outposts. Obama’s response: "What I said in the same National Defense University speech back in May that I referred to earlier is that core al-Qaida is on its heels, has been decimated. But what I also said was that al-Qaida and other extremists have metastasized into regional groups that can pose significant dangers." That May 2013 university speech also does not contain a proclamation that the country’s terrorism problem is solved. Obama heralded the deaths of bin Laden and his lieutenants but followed up immediately with a warning: "Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists." During his 2012 re-election campaign, Obama did not consistently follow up on his point that bin Laden is dead with a reminder that the anti-terror fight remains. But even in those cases he usually said al-Qaida was "on the run" or "on the path to defeat." Reporters noticed when he dropped a reference to al-Qaida being "on the run" in a few of his stump speeches, questioning whether he did it because of the deadly attack on the Benghazi special mission on Sept. 11, 2012. (He later restored the reference about al-Qaida being "on the path to defeat.") Still, Obama never said the problem was solved. Obama has been using the word "solve" a bit lately, but not in the way Cheney claims. In explaining why he will not deploy American troops to confront ISIS, Obama said June 19, "We do not have the ability to simply solve this problem by sending in tens of thousands of troops and committing the kinds of blood and treasure that has already been expended in Iraq. Ultimately, this is something that is going to have to be solved by the Iraqis." We’ll end on an interesting note highlighted by FactCheck. Cheney’s former boss, President George W. Bush, used similar language as Obama to describe his administration’s efforts to beat back al-Qaida, using "on the run" in 2001 and 2003 as well as "decimated." Our ruling So did Obama, as Cheney claimed, say "we got bin Laden, terrorism problem solved"? No. Obama’s foreign policy speeches since bin Laden’s death have qualified the killing as a major achievement in the battle against terrorism, but not the solution to a complex threat. Obama usually notes the problem remains despite the fact that core al-Qaida has decentralized into regional, still dangerous groups. Cheney is either missing or ignoring Obama’s nuanced statements. We rate Cheney’s statement False.	None	Dick Cheney	None	None	None	2014-06-24T14:52:04	2014-06-22	['None']
pomt-06691	A bipartisan payroll tax cut championed by the White House has meant that "the average family has an extra $1,000 in their pocket" this year.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-payroll-tax-cut-has-boosted-aver/	During a Labor Day speech in Detroit, President Barack Obama offered a sampling of policy proposals to get the nation’s economy moving. During the speech, Obama touted one policy achievement he had already enacted -- a one-year, 2 percentage point cut to the payroll tax that Obama was able to include in a December 2010 tax package. The package that passed with bipartisan support also extended the expiring George W. Bush-era tax cuts, among other things. "Last year, we worked together, Republicans and Democrats, to pass a payroll tax cut," Obama told the crowd in Detroit on Sept. 5, 2011. "And because of that, this year the average family has an extra $1,000 in their pocket…." Because tax year 2011 is still under way -- meaning that Americans’ personal financial situations will be subject to countless factors between now and Dec. 31 -- it’s impossible to know for sure how much of a benefit the average American family will see when they finally file tax forms next spring. Still, we wondered whether Obama’s figure is supported by credible estimates. So we took a look. First, some background about the tax, and the tax cut, that Obama is referring to. The payroll tax refers to federal taxes taken directly from the paychecks of employed Americans. It is primarily used to fund Social Security and Medicare. The policy Obama signed into law temporarily reduced the portion of the payroll tax that funds Social Security by 2 percentage points. It is in force for the duration of 2011. You can do a rough assessment of Obama’s claim by using some basic math. We prefer to use median income -- the income level that’s precisely in the middle when all incomes are ranked from smallest to largest -- because, unlike the mean (or average), it’s not subject to influence by a small number of very high earners. However, since Obama said "average," we’ll offer both figures. The median household income in 2009 -- the most recent year available -- was $49,777. Lowering the tax rate by 2 percent reduces the tax burden for the median family by $996, or very close to the $1,000 Obama cited. As for mean household income, it was $67,976, meaning that the 2 percent payroll tax cut would have left $1,360 extra in the pockets of the average family. By this measure, Obama understated the benefit, though as we noted, an average is a less-than-ideal yardstick. But there are at least two reasons why using even the median figures is imperfect. First, not all income is subject to the payroll tax, including interest income, dividends, capital gains, inheritances and Social Security benefits. These income streams are taxed in various ways, but not by the payroll tax, and thus they get no benefit from the payroll tax cut. Second, not all households include people who are working, and who can therefore benefit from a payroll tax cut. The two most obvious categories are people or couples who are unemployed, and individuals or couples who are retired. To gauge the impact of these factors, we turned to estimates by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The center found that the average benefit from the payroll tax cut was $934 -- slightly lower than Obama claimed. (The median benefit from the tax cut may well be lower still, but the center didn’t calculate it.) Meanwhile, not all households will benefit. Just under 78 percent of "tax units" -- which roughly equates with households -- will see a reduction in taxes from the payroll tax cut. So according to the Tax Policy Center, the 78 percent of households who see a benefit will see an average reduction of $934. The remaining 22 percent of households will see no benefit. These are nuances that Obama didn’t capture in his Labor Day speech. Our ruling Obama’s statement is close to correct, but it lacks some clarifications that would have made it fully accurate. First, nearly a quarter of families don’t benefit from the payroll tax cut, although this may be obvious to listeners, since he specifically referred to a "payroll" tax cut. Second, the amount that households saved is at most $934, according to the Tax Policy Center’s calculations -- an amount that would decrease if the center had used a median rather than an average. Obama would have been better off saying that "the average working family has nearly $1,000 extra in their pocket" this year as a result of the payroll tax cut. On balance, we rate Obama’s comment Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-09-06T16:47:33	2011-09-05	['White_House']

pomt-14802	Says President Barack Obama "will not utter the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ and as matter of policy, nobody in the administration will say the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism.’"	true	/virginia/statements/2015/nov/30/ted-cruz/cruz-right-obama-doesnt-link-islam-terrorismerrori/	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says the U.S. can’t defeat an enemy it won’t define. The presidential candidate came to Richmond on Nov. 14 to address a gala dinner held by the Family Foundation, a socially conservative lobbying group. Before the speech, Cruz was asked during a news conference how the U.S. should respond to the terrorist attacks a day earlier in Paris. "Well, the first thing we should do is identify the evil we are fighting," Cruz said. "The fact that President Obama will not identify, he literally will not utter the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ and as matter of policy, nobody in the administration will say the words ‘radical Islamic terrorism.’" We wondered whether the White House really does shun that phrase. We emailed the Cruz campaign twice but did not hear back. The White House press office also did not respond to emailed questions for this article. So we tried a LexisNexis search of media articles and speech transcripts that used the phrases "Barack Obama" and "radical Islamic terrorism." It brought up 1,900 items - more than we had the time to scour. But we did find in the list plenty of references to complaints by present and past GOP presidential contenders - Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Cruz - that Obama doesn’t use the phrase. We also ran the phrase "radical Islamic terrorism" through the search engine on the White House website and couldn’t find an instance of administration officials describing the Islamic State in that way. The closest thing was one instance, during a news briefing in February, when White House press secretary Josh Earnest referred to "Islamic militants" while discussing Islamic State fighters in Iraq. PolitiFact National, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times all reported in February that the president and his administration try to avoid invoking Islam while describing the Islamic State and its followers, preferring to describe the organization’s philosophy in non-religious terms such as "violent extremism." Obama also has called the Islamic State a "terrorist group" with a "twisted ideology." The upshot, according to the articles, is that the White House wants to avoid tying the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims to terrorism. That could play into the hands of terrorists, who portray the U.S. as an enemy of Islam itself. Obama refers to ISIS by another acronym, ISIL. "ISIL is not ‘Islamic,’" he said in a Sept. 10, 2014, statement. "No religion condones the killing of innocents." In a Nov. 16 news conference in Turkey, Obama said the group does not represent Islam and "is not representative in any way of the attitudes of the overwhelming majority of Muslims." But Obama added that Muslims around the world "have to ask very serious questions about how did these extremist ideologies take root, even if it’s only affecting a very small fraction of the population." Two Middle East analysts told us the White House’s cautious phrasing is no coincidence. Rick Brennan, senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. said the administration avoids linking the words "radical Islam" and "terrorism" because it does not want to give the Islamic State religious legitimacy in the Islamic world and swell the organization’s ranks. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, had a similar take. There’s debate among analysts over the administration’s phraseology. Brennan told PolitFact National earlier this year that the White House’s wording has been "too cautious," noting that Islamic State teachings reflect a strain of Islam that has attracted 40,000 or more followers. James Gelvin, a UCLA history professor, disagrees. He told PolitiFact that it’s unnecessary to emphasize a religious aspect of the Islamic State because "their doctrine is exceedingly unpopular among most people who consider themselves Muslims." Our ruling Cruz said that Obama administration won’t use the phrase "radical Islamic terrorism." Although we wouldn’t swear White House officials never have uttered the words in public, we could find no evidence to the contrary. It’s clear that the administration prefers non-religious ways to describe the Islamic State - such as a "terrorist group," "violent extremism" and "twisted ideology."

pomt-06837	Says state Rep. Sandy Pasch "did nothing to stop" people from scamming the Wisconsin Shares child-care subsidy program and voted against funding for fraud investigators.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/05/club-growth/wisconsin-club-growth-says-rep-sandy-pasch-did-not/	The Wisconsin Shares program was intended to provide child care subsidies so needy mothers could seek work. However, the taxpayer-funded program was rife with abuse and fraud as parents and child care providers alike scammed the system. Numerous calls for improvements to the $350 million program came after the Journal Sentinel published a series of stories, "Cashing in on Kids," beginning in January 2009. In early 2009, after the initial stories ran, newly elected Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, was among those from both parties calling for reforms. Among other things, there was a call for a comprehensive audit of Wisconsin Shares, to examine every element of the program from initial intake to the final payments. The legislative fallout from the stories forms the basis of TV and radio ads being run by the conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth against Democrats, including Pasch, who faces state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, in an Aug. 9, 2011, recall election The radio ad against Pasch states: "Wisconsin taxpayers lost millions to people scamming the state welfare system and Representative Sandy Pasch did nothing to stop it. One provider stole enough money to buy an mansion with an indoor pool and basketball court. But Pasch voted against funding for fraud investigations even after it was reported that child care centers were used to transport drugs, launder dirty cash and provide fake employment for criminals." (Similar versions of the ad have aired against Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo, and Sen. Jim Holperin, D-Eagle River. Clark is challenging Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon, while Holperin is being challenged by Republican Kim Simac. The ads are not available online. There also appear to be multiple versions of the ads airing in individual races.) So, did Pasch "do nothing to stop" people from scamming the system and vote against funding for fraud investigations? When we asked Club for Growth spokesman R.J. Johnson for backup, he cited the following as evidence: -- On June 16, 2009, Pasch voted against an amendment to the 2009-2011 budget to provide funding for welfare fraud investigations. -- Pasch voted against the 2011-’13 state budget, which included funding for welfare fraud investigations. The second claim is a bit of a reach. The 2011-’13 state budget contained some $605,500 to a year to investigate fraud in the Wisconsin Shares program. However, that was one tiny part of the overall budget, which Democrats opposed for much larger reasons. Indeed, the 2009-’10 state budget included funding for five new state workers to investigate fraud in Wisconsin Shares; Sen. Darling (and other Republicans) voted against that budget. Before we dig into the first vote, let’s look closer at the program and Pasch’s overall record on it. Wisconsin Shares was started in 1997 as part of the state’s welfare reform initiatives. The program was designed to give low-wage working parents assistance with child care, encouraging them to get and keep jobs, rather than stay on welfare. It serves about 34,000 families. Pasch took office in January of 2009, the same month the newspaper began publishing stories about problems with the program that allowed child care providers and parents to game the system. An early step taken to address problems with Wisconsin Shares came in February 2009 when lawmakers, including Pasch, voted unanimously to conduct a state audit of the program. That audit, released later that year, found that state regulators had misspent an estimated $20 million in 2008 alone. The audit also determined that about 11 percent of the cases studied had eligibility and other problems and said that the program has significant holes that allow the system to be defrauded and abused. Later in 2009, lawmakers were considering the 2009-’11 state budget and several amendments dealt with the issue. One of them is the basis of the item cited in the Club For Growth ad against Pasch. Amendment #80, offered by state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, called for spending $500,000 for additional welfare fraud investigations. The amendment was tabled on a 50-48 vote, with Pasch joining the majority. So Pasch voted to table the amendment. But that amendment would have affected a different program called Food Shares, and not the Wisconsin Shares program that covers the child care payments. Beyond that, Pasch did support other measures to address problems with Wisconsin Shares. Other measures Pasch supported included the creation of Act 2, which included a fraud detection unit that led to the suspension of payments to 130 providers and identified millions in overpayments in 2010. She also supported Act 76, which stops providers with criminal backgrounds or a history of abusing public assistance programs from receiving program payments and being licensed to care for kids and suspends state payments if a provider is under investigation and increases state review of child care providers, employees, and non-client residents of in-home providers. Another bill she supported, Act 77, strengthens the state's ability to go after fraudulent child care center operators, even if their businesses have dissolved. And there’s the 2009-’10 budget -- which Pasch voted in favor of -- that included funding for the five additional state Wisconsin Shares fraud investigators. So let’s put this one to bed. The Club for Growth says Pasch "did nothing to stop" people from scamming the Wisconsin Shares program and voted against funding for fraud investigations. She did vote against a 2009 budget amendment that increased funding for fraud investigations (of a different program) and voted against the 2011-’13 state budget that included fraud investigation funds. So there is an element of truth to the statement made by Club for Growth. But Pasch and supported numerous other measures to address problems with the child care program, including ones that cracked down on fraud. That means the statement "ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." And that’s the yardstick used by the Truth-O-Meter to describe one thing: a statement that is Mostly False.

pomt-14774	"Since 2008, we have cut 5,000 positions" from Virginia public schools.	true	/virginia/statements/2015/dec/08/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-5000-school-jobs-cut-2008/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe is making it clear that helping public schools will be the "top priority" in a two-year budget he’ll propose to the General Assembly this month. "Since 2008, we have cut 5,000 positions" in state public schools, he said Dec. 3 to journalists attending an annual AP Day at the Capital seminar hosted by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. McAuliffe, a Democrat, made a similar claim Nov. 24 during his monthly radio show on WTOP in Washington. We wondered whether the governor is correct. So we turned to the official source for Virginia school statistics: the Superintendent's Annual Report, a database kept by the state Department of Education. Brian Coy, McAuliffe’s director of communications, said the start date for the governor’s claim refers to the state budget year that began July 1, 2007, and ended June 30, 2008. We accept that, because it’s bureaucratic parlance to refer to budgets by the latter year they were in effect. The 2007-08 budget is significant, because it was one of the last spending plans to be carried out before the last recession gripped the state and forced deep cuts in programs. Public education employment was at an all-time high in Virginia that school year, with 191,013 full-time equivalent workers. That fell to 186,202 employees during the 2013-14 school year, the latest figures available. That’s a drop of 4,811 full-time equivalent jobs. Almost one-fourth of those lost jobs belonged to instructors - a group that includes teachers, principals, assistant principals, librarians and guidance counselors. The number of full-time instructors dropped from 103,303 in 2007-08 to 102,140 in 2013-14 - a decline of 1,163. We should note that enrollment increased slightly during that time span. As a result, the average number of students per instructor rose from 11.5 to almost 12.1. About 70 percent of the job cuts went to "administrative, service and support personnel." This group includes school secretaries, nurses, bus drivers, janitors and computer technicians. The support staff shrank from 59,384 full-time equivalent jobs in 2007-08 to 55,912 in 2013-14 - a loss of 3,472. About three-quarters of those jobs were in school transportation and maintenance. We should note that while school jobs still are down from 2007-08, they do appear to be rebounding. As we’ve said, there were 186,202 full-time equivalent jobs in 2013-14, the latest year available. That’s slightly higher than the previous school year, when there were 185,944 positions. And a final note: McAuliffe, at this writing, has declined to reveal details about his education budget, other than to pledge significant new funding. He’s scheduled to present his budget proposals to the General Assembly’s money committees Dec. 17. Our ruling McAuliffe told journalists, "Since 2008, we have cut 5,000 positions" in state public schools. The actual number is 4,811, but we won’t carp with the rounding up. In a similar statement on a radio show, the governor said "about 5,000 jobs." It should be noted that about one-fourth of the positions belonged to instructors and that the vast majority of lost jobs affected support staff. That said, we rate McAuliffe’s statement True.

pomt-02166	"Under Greg Abbott, Texas four-year-olds would be forced to undergo standardized tests."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/may/01/wendy-davis/greg-abbott-plan-doesnt-mandate-standardized-testi/	Texas children take mandated state tests from elementary through high school. Wendy Davis says Greg Abbott seeks to impose tests even earlier. An illustration posted online by Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, starts by stating Texas pupils currently take the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, or STAAR. Davis then says that under Abbott, the Republican candidate for governor, "Texas four-year-olds would be forced to undergo standardized tests as well." A reader emailed us, asking: "What’s the truth to that?" Existing pre-k serves select students Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, and Abbott, the state’s attorney general, have clashed over their competing proposals for pre-kindergarten education at a time that some communities, including San Antonio, have moved to expand pre-K. Not all children attend public pre-kindergarten, but Texas school districts have been required to offer pre-K to certain students since 1985, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research. Factors affecting eligibility include qualifying for a free- or reduced-price lunch, homelessness or the inability to speak or comprehend English. Texas was home to more than 750,000 3- and 4-year-olds in 2010, according to a Texas Education Agency web page. In 2012-13, about 227,000 3- and 4-year-olds were enrolled in public school pre-k, the agency said. Davis supports a broad expansion of full-day pre-K to all youngsters, costing the state about $750 million a year. In contrast, Abbott proposes spending an additional $1,500 per student in school districts that agree to implement a "gold standard" program consisting of a rigorous curriculum and staff requirements plus assessments to measure effectiveness of the pre-K programs. Those assessments are what led to the Davis’ campaign’s charge that Abbott wants to test 4-year-olds. For instance, Davis said April 15, 2014, that "assessments" in Abbott's plan is code for testing, according to a Dallas Morning News account posted online that day. Davis cites Abbott proposal By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out Abbott’s education proposal discusses pre-K students being given standardized tests. From Abbott’s plan: In order to equip the Commissioner of Education with the data necessary to properly evaluate prekindergarten programs, lawmakers should amend the Education Code to require school districts with prekindergarten programs to administer assessments at the beginning and end of the school year. There are at least three methods of assessing students at the prekindergarten level: ● Direct Assessments, norm-referenced standardized tests: A typical question on a direct assessment might ask the child to identify the letter and provide three options. The child receives credit for correctly identifying the letter. Direct assessments are in some views deficient because they do not capture the full spectrum of the students skill set and cannot truly be used to determine quality of the program. ● Observation Checklists and Scales: Assessment under this method requires that teachers informally watch students within the daily routine and observe their mastery. This option does provide a more complete capture of the student’s progress but is contingent on teachers being well-trained in the method. Such assessments are also labor intensive. ● Child’s Work (Portfolio): Assessing children’s work acts as a complement to a teacher’s observed progress. This method does not capture the entire picture of a student’s progress and tends to be labor intensive for teachers. Abbott’s proposal says next: "Most states employ one or both of the first two assessment methods. Texas is one of only four states not to require any assessment." Also, the proposal says that in order to preserve local control and give schools flexibility, the "state should avoid granting any one testing organization a monopoly over prekindergarten evaluations. Instead," Abbott proposes, the state education agency "should publish a list of approved assessments that districts may use. Districts will report the results to the agency." A footnote leads to a 2012 report by the New Jersey-based Educational Testing Service identifying the other states that don’t assess the quality of pre-k classes as Maryland, Tennessee and Wisconsin. The ETS report also says that each of the three assessment methods has tradeoffs while it separately warns against counting on standardized tests to gauge a preschooler. "Older students typically are tested through the use of norm- or criterion-referenced assessments," the report says. "Students are expected to independently read and respond to assessment items by filling in a bubble or circling or checking an answer (known as a selected response), or writing an essay or performing mathematical calculations… "These traditional approaches," the report continues, "are unlikely to produce useful data about what a 4-year-old knows or can do, and, in turn, how effective the pre-K program is in improving children’s development and/or kindergarten readiness." It’s unrealistic to expect such children to read independently and respond to traditional test queries, the report says, in part because you can’t count on them to remember test directions. Also, the report says, such children develop at different rates and, naturally, are adjusting to school coming from distinct home lives. A chart in the report indicates that Alabama, Alaska, Nevada and Virginia rely solely on "direct assessment" of preschool students with 19 states mixing preschooler assessment methods. Campaigns' analyses Petkanas, asked about Abbott’s plan not saying standardized tests would be required of 4-year-olds, said the plan "mandates assessments and ties funding to their outcomes -- and then points to norm referenced standardized tests as the first way to do that." We asked Abbott’s campaign about this. Spokesman Matt Hirsch stressed by email that Abbott’s plan gives districts with state-supported pre-k classes the flexibility to choose an assessment method. Our ruling Davis said Abbott would force 4-year-olds to take standardized tests. Not quite. Abbott wants assessments of the subset of Texas students who are enrolled in public pre-k at the start and end of each school year and he says a way of doing so would entail standardized tests. However, his proposal also lists alternate assessment methods and says districts who volunteer for his pre-k program should be left to pick an assessment approach from various options fashioned by the state. We rate this claim as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-06478	The Milwaukee County sheriff’s department "plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency" and in 2009 reported far fewer crimes to the FBI than the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee police did.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/17/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executve-says-sheriffs-office-pla/	With his 2012 budget, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele proposed to cut more than $14 million and 240 positions from the sheriff’s office -- cuts larger than for any other county department. His rationale? When it comes to crime fighting, Abele essentially said, the sheriff’s office doesn’t do much. "By statute and by practice, the sheriff plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency," Abele said in his budget remarks to the County Board on Sept. 29, 2011. "For example, in 2009 the sheriff reported only 12 crimes to the FBI, compared to 41,000 for the City of Milwaukee and 3,200 for West Allis, and even 242 for the UWM Police Department." Wait. The sheriff’s department, covering the entire county, reported far fewer crimes to the FBI than the campus police at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee? Let’s address the two parts of Abele’s statement one at a time. Sheriff plays "limited role" in law enforcement: Abele’s claim bolsters what is his opinion, but it is important in the context of his entire statement. The first-term county executive is arguing that his budget cuts are justified because the sheriff’s office plays only a limited role in what he calls traditional law enforcement. It’s certainly true that the Milwaukee County sheriff’s office has less responsibility for crime fighting than sheriff’s departments in less urban parts of Wisconsin, given that Milwaukee County is filled with cities and villages that have their own police departments. That means under FBI rules the vast majority of crimes in Milwaukee County are reported by local agencies and not the sheriff’s office, said Tami Jackson, spokesman for the state Office of Justice Assistance, which coordinates FBI reporting. The sheriff’s office also differs from local police departments in that it runs two jails, provides bailiffs for the courthouse and provides other inmate-related services. Indeed, under Abele’s budget, nearly three-fourths of the 1,146 sheriff’s employees would work in what is known as the detention division, while less than 20 percent would perform what are called police services: crime investigation, patrol and providing security for the airport, parks and County Grounds. So, it is clear the sheriff’s office has less responsibility for crime fighting than other police agencies. But by running jails and patrolling freeways, among other duties, it is providing other essential law enforcement services. Sheriff reported few crimes to FBI: In his claim about crimes reported to the FBI, Abele was citing the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting figures for 2009, said his spokesman, Jeff Bentoff. Those major crime statistics are released annually by the FBI and are tracked regularly by news media such as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which maintains a searchable database of UCR data. Through UCR, local law enforcement agencies report to the FBI four types of violent crime (murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) and four types of property crime (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson). So, the statistic Abele is citing covers only a limited portion of offenses that local law enforcement authorities handle and only the most serious ones. We found Abele accurately quoted the total number of UCR crimes reported to the FBI in 2009 by Milwaukee police (more than 41,000); West Allis police (more than 3,200); and UWM police (242-- five violent and 237 property crimes). Abele was off a bit when he said the sheriff’s office reported 12 crimes to the FBI in 2009. The sheriff’s office actually reported seven violent crimes plus 12 property crimes for a total of 19 UCR crimes. Although Abele gave the wrong figure in his budget speech, he quoted the correct figure in other budget documents. (Bentoff said Abele cited 2009 UCR statistics because they were the most recent available when Abele’s budget was assembled. We found 2010 figures and they show a similar disproportion -- the sheriff’s department reported 38 UCR crimes to the FBI in 2010, far fewer than the 271 reported by UWM police.) So, Abele was correct in claiming that the sheriff’s office reported far fewer crimes to the FBI in 2009 than UWM police did. But is that the whole picture in terms of crime fighting? Was the sheriff’s office involved in handling only 19 serious crimes in all of 2009? When we asked Clarke spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin about Abele’s statement, she did not rebut his statistic. Rather, she argued that Abele "cherry picked" a figure that she said doesn’t reflect the many non-UCR offenses handled by the sheriff’s office. McLaughlin provided summaries that show the sheriff’s office made 1,927 arrests in 2009. Relatively few were for serious crimes. A sampling: One arrest was for murder, one was for second-degree sexual assault and 15 were for battery. In contrast, more than 1,000 of the sheriff’s arrests were for operating while intoxicated. In Wisconsin, OWI doesn’t become a crime until the second offense. The sheriff’s office also recorded 290 arrests for disorderly conduct, which can be a municipal offense or a misdemeanor crime. So, while the sheriff’s office does handle some serious crimes, most of its traditional police work involves lesser offenses. Our conclusion Abele said the sheriff’s office "plays only a limited role as a traditional law enforcement agency" and in 2009 reported far fewer crimes to the FBI than UWM police did. Abele’s claim about the FBI reporting was accurate and it reflects the fact that the sheriff’s office handles relatively few major crimes. On the other hand, the sheriff’s office runs jails, patrols freeways and provides other services that other police agencies rely on and that are essential components of traditional law enforcement.

pomt-06557	"We’re. . . keeping and creating jobs in our state. From American Greetings, to Wendy’s, to Diebold, we’ve gone to their doorsteps to keep jobs right here in Ohio."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/03/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-touts-contacts-companies-create-re/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich has taken to the airwaves to tout his record on jobs. The first-year Republican governor is featured in a television commercial that began airing in September in which he talks about his early success with job creation in Ohio and declaring it as proof he is a man of his word. Kasich promised during last year’s gubernatorial race that his pro-business agenda would to bring jobs to Ohio. Kasich defeated incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland last November. But you wouldn’t be able to tell it from this ad. It looks and feels every bit like campaign commercial. It was even shot from the same Y-shape rural road intersection where Kasch filmed one of his ads for the campaign. "We’re . . . keeping and creating jobs in our state," Kasich says in the new commercial, paid for by the Republican Governors Association. "From American Greetings, to Wendy’s, to Diebold, we’ve gone to the their doorsteps to keep jobs right here in Ohio." PolitiFact Ohio recently checked another claim by the governor about jobs, giving him a rating of Mostly False for suggesting that his administration is solely responsible for the net 45,000 new jobs in the state this year. The statistic about the jobs was correct for January through July, but economists we talked to said it was too soon to know if the governor’s policies would boost employment. Job growth in Ohio, they said, had been well underway for more than a year. But this claim is different, so PolitiFact Ohio took another look. Kasich has had some high-profile headlines after striking deals laden with tax incentives to keep American Greetings and Diebold in Northeast Ohio after both companies threatened to move their headquarters out of state. Kasich’s critics do not believe either company was really going to leave and just used the threats to exploit the governor for additional taxpayer-paid sweetheart deals. American Greetings, for example, in addition to naming the Chicago area as a possible new location for its headquarters also said it was considering moving within Northeast Ohio even before the governor got involved. But the part of his claim where he says that he is keeping jobs here seems to be easily proven by those two deals alone. But whether his policies are creating jobs for Ohio is a bit more dicey to test. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols provided a list of "development deals for which we did the heavy lifting." The list claims the current administration has created 557 jobs and retained 10-times that many — 5,529. The American Greetings deal retained 1,750. A deal keeping Central Ohio staple Bob Evans here, rather than moving to Texas, lured 150 additional jobs here, according to Nichols. The list includes nine companies in all. Company Jobs Created Jobs Retained Bob Evans 150 360 American Greetings 0 1,750 Diebold 0 1,500 Mitec 88 0 Janova 116 38 Johnson Controls 50 400 Dannon 100 453 Wendy’s 53 388 Chrysler (Perrysburg plant) 0 640 Total 557 5,529 The numbers backup the statement. Determining how much credit goes to the administration is not always so clear, but the governor can certainly lay claim to having kept some jobs here and attracting some new ones. Kasich did not offer a tally for his job creation and retention record, or take credit for all job growth in the state. Rather, he offered up a general statement about efforts in his administration that have yielded some results. On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates True.

pomt-12188	"Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/jul/27/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-32-percent-texas-public-school-sp/	Dan Patrick framed his case for ordering Texas schools to shift money toward higher teacher salaries by suggesting that less than a third of school spending currently reaches teacher pocketbooks. The Republican lieutenant governor, addressing reporters before the July 2017 start of a special legislative session called by Gov. Greg Abbott, said: "Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers." By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia offered as the basis of Patrick’s claim a state publication presenting statistics such as student enrollment. We did not spot information in the document speaking to what Patrick said. Texas Education Agency figures But when we reached out to the Texas Education Agency, spokeswoman Lauren Callahan responded by pointing out state-posted figures for the 2015-16 school year, the latest year of audited spending totals. That year, according to the agency, state government recorded receipts of $58,796,907,294 related to public schools from state, local, federal and other revenue sources. The same year, according to another agency web page, 347,328 teachers were paid combined base salaries of $18,023,516,741, averaging $51,892. That $18 billion breaks out to 31 percent of the nearly $59 billion in total receipts. Some more money went to teachers, though, in nearly $1 million in stipends such as what’s paid to teachers that oversee extracurricular activities, Callahan told us. The resulting total teacher compensation, $19,005,561,634, divides out to 32 percent of the total education receipts. Additional money goes into other salaries. According to the agency, Texas schools in 2015-16 paid more than $24 billion to 68,699 teacher support staff — broken out by TEA into more than 20 job categories including counselors, school nurses and athletic trainers — plus 237,460 administrative, professional, paraprofessional and auxiliary staff — with spending on all employee salaries accounting for more than 70 percent of school-related receipts. Keep in mind, though, Patrick singled out the share of all spending solely devoted to teacher pay. School district advocates When we asked finance experts who advocate for school districts if the equation based on TEA data holds up, we heard back that the math works, but the total-spending figure folds in spending deserving of an asterisk. In emails, Joe Wisnoski, a former TEA finance administrator who advises and lobbies for school districts, and Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials each suggested it’s unfair to compare the $18 billion spent on teacher salaries to total receipts, which count money that doesn’t play into school employee salaries, each expert wrote. Wisnoski suggested it’s more appropriate to compare spending on teacher salaries to operating expenditures, which means not judging the teacher salaries against any money districts raise in bond proceeds or what’s spent on capital projects such as buildings or to pay off debt. Wisnoski noted that none of those funding streams would be available to could be diverted to salaries anyway. According to the TEA’s posted figures for 2015-16, 2015-16 "all funds" operating expenditures for schools totaled nearly $49.5 billion --of which the spending on teacher salaries accounted for 36.4 percent, Wisnoski said and we confirmed. "There are lots of ways to include or exclude things in the world of school district finances," Wisnoski said, "and what is most appropriate somewhat depends on the person making the point and the specific point being made." Canby called the equation that got us to 32 percent of all spending going to teacher salaries a misleading "apples divided by oranges calculation." He said he would gauge the share of spending on teacher salaries, starting from 2016 actual expenditure totals he said he fetched from the state’s Public Education Information Management System. Those figures suggest that teacher salaries cost $19,131,375,774 with benefits adding $3,429,356,293. The resulting $22,560,732,067 accounted for 47.7 percent of $47,303,105,584 in operating expenditures statewide, Canby noted. Canby also emailed us a web link to a July 2017 commentary by TASBO’s executive director, Tracy Ginsburg, stating that the group had been unable to verify numbers aired by Patrick indicating that of $163,000 spent per classroom, $52,000 is paid to classroom teachers. Ginsburg encouraged readers to consider a June 2017 report by Moak, Casey & Associates, the lobbying and consulting firm whose associates include Wisnoski. That report says that in 2015-16, Texas school employee salaries and benefits absorbed 79 percent of $46.4 billion spent on "basic educational costs." The share of that spending on teacher salaries alone doesn’t appear in the report, which states that "instruction" accounted for 61 percent of basic costs, taking into account some 333,000 teachers plus 63,700 education aides. The "instruction" entry in the report says: "Also included here are the salaries and benefits costs of 4,500 librarians as well as the books and other materials that can be found in Texas school libraries. The cost of instructional materials and staff development are also included in this category as instructional costs." Our ruling Patrick said: "Of all the money we spend on education, less than 32 percent goes to teachers." This percentage, we found, aligns with the simple comparison of total teacher salaries to all funds spent on public schools.

pomt-11736	"Black homeownership just hit the highest level it has ever been in the history of our country."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-black-homeownership-rate-record/	When President Donald Trump noticed some African-American support at a recent rally in Pensacola, Fla., he offered a statistic about black homeownership. "Look at these guys, ‘Blacks for Trump,’ " Trump said, quoting their sign, on Dec. 8, 2017. "I love you. I love you. By the way, now that you bring it up, black homeownership just hit the highest level it has ever been in the history of our country. Congratulations." He brought up the claim in the company of other boasts about enhanced 401(k) accounts, consumer confidence and job growth since the start of the year. But black home ownership hasn’t hit a new record high. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Attendees hold "Blacks For Trump" signs while waiting in line for a campaign rally with President Donald Trump in Pensacola, Fla. (Bloomberg/Nicole Craine) According to Census Bureau data, black homeownership peaked in 2004 at 49.1 percent. It has fallen incrementally almost every year since. In fact, the rate is now about one-sixth lower than it was at its peak. African-Americans are less than two-thirds as likely as non-Hispanic whites to own a home, and the most recent rate for African-Americans, 41.6 percent in 2016, ranks behind each of the other four major groups -- non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and Native Americans. In fact, in 2005 the Hispanic homeownership rate overtook that of African-Americans, with the two groups diverging ever since. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The only positive news is that the quarterly figures for 2017 have been a little higher than they were in 2016. In 2016, the quarterly black homeownership rate fluctuated between 41.3 percent and 41.7 percent. In 2017, the rates in the first three quarters were 42.7 percent, 42.3 percent, and 42 percent, respectively. But that’s still below the annual levels from 2004 to 2014. So why has the African-American homeownership rate fallen for the past dozen years? More than anything, it’s been the Great Recession and its aftermath. "Blacks were hit disproportionately hard by the foreclosure crisis, in part because they were heavily targeted for subprime and other risky mortgages," said Alex Schwartz, a professor at the Milano School of International Affairs, Management, and Urban Policy at the New School. Those types of mortgages were at the center of the housing crisis that helped cause the recession. As for the continued decline, Schwartz said, "banks and other mortgage lenders adopted much stricter underwriting standards after the crisis, making it far more difficult to qualify for mortgage credit. Since black and Hispanic households tend to have lower incomes and much less wealth than other groups, they are even less likely than before the crisis to purchase homes." Meanwhile, rising inequality and slow income growth for the bottom 80 percent of the income spectrum have made it more difficult for families to accumulate the savings necessary to make the downpayment to purchase a home. "Our research shows that homeownership was not a conduit to wealth accumulation either in the housing boom or in the Great Recession," said Sandee Newman, who directs the Center on Housing, Neighborhoods and Communities at Johns Hopkins University. Our ruling Trump said, "Black homeownership just hit the highest level it has ever been in the history of our country." In reality, the black homeownership rate peaked in 2004 and has fallen almost every year since, due in large part to the Great Recession and its aftermath. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12174	Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz "going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2017/aug/02/usdailynews24/headline-states-debbie-wasserman-schultz-headed-me/	U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been criticized for waiting to fire an information technology employee who did work for her office until his recent arrest. While many other Democratic members fired Imran Awan months ago when news reports stated he was under investigation, Wasserman Schultz waited until July 25, the day after his arrest for bank fraud. (Awan was a shared employee among multiple House members.) For all of the questions about how Wasserman Schultz handled the situation, there have been unsubstantiated attacks on the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman from Broward County. The website US Daily News 24 compiled various news reports, blogs and tweets about the Awan investigation in a July 28 post. However, the clickbait headline of the story is totally unsupported. It states: "Wasserman Schultz going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest." There is no evidence that Wasserman Schultz is headed to a mental health facility. In fact, other than the headline, the article itself makes no mention of her going to a mental hospital or facing arrest -- and it’s unclear what the author is alluding to that she did "overnight." Instead, the article contains some sweeping statements about her alleged state of mind with no evidence, such as there are reports that Wasserman Schultz "has been an absolute wreck since Imran’s arrest" and an unsourced text posted on twitter alleging that she was spotted berating her daughter about buying a $2 purse. We found no contact information for US Daily News 24, although we left a comment in the comments section asking for evidence. We found the same post on Freedom Daily and used their contact form but did not get a reply. The article does correctly state that Awan was picked up by police at the Dulles International Airport while he was attempting to leave the country. The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., states that on July 24 Awan had purchased a flight to Qatar and then to Lahore, Pakistan, with a return flight in January. He was arrested on one count of bank fraud related to allegations that he provided inaccurate information when applying for a home loan. He pleaded not guilty. The criminal complaint makes no mention of allegations reported since February by Buzzfeed, Politico and The Daily Caller that Awan and other relatives were under investigation related to a procurement scam and theft of equipment and data. The articles we read attributed key information to unnamed sources. There is no evidence that Wasserman Schultz faces arrest. Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the United States Capitol Police, told the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida news partner, on Feb. 8 that "no members are being investigated" related to the actions of the House IT support staff. Unrelated to this fact-check, the Miami Herald asked Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman David Damron on July 28 if she had scheduled any public events for the August congressional recess. Damron said that she planned to spend some time with family out of town during the first couple of weeks and would do district events later during the recess. The A. Philip Randolph Institute, an AFL-CIO group, also announced that Wasserman Schultz will speak at the group’s education conference in Broward on Aug. 3. Through Damron, Wasserman Schultz told PolitiFact that the website is a "false story." Our ruling A US Daily News 24 article headline states ,"Wasserman Schultz going to mental hospital after what she did overnight desperate to escape arrest." While there are some statements in the article itself which are accurate -- including that a man who did IT work for her was arrested -- there is no evidence to support the headline. The article contains no information to prove that she is going to a mental hospital, only allegations that she is an "absolute wreck." There is also no evidence in the article that she has tried to escape arrest. The U.S. Capitol Police said in February that no members were under investigation. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-04399	Says his administration put more border patrol agents on the U.S.-Mexico border than at "any time in history, and the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-touts-record-high-border-agents-lowes/	President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney sparred over border-control policy during the second presidential debate at Hofstra University. Here’s one of Obama’s claims: "We put more border patrol on the (U.S.-Mexico border than at) any time in history, and the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years." We’ll look at the two parts of this claim in order. A record number of border patrol officers? As of 2011, the most recent year available, the Border Patrol has 21,444 agents, about 86 percent of them stationed along the southern border. That’s a higher total number of agents than in any year going back to at least 1924, according to data from the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics compiled and provided to PolitiFact by Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied immigration issues. It’s worth noting -- as the Romney camp and others pointed out to us -- that the biggest bump in Border Patrol staffing came under President George W. Bush. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents rose by about 14 percent a year on average. Between 2009 and 2001, under Obama, it has increased by about 3 percent per year. Still, Obama framed his claim carefully. Are there more Border Patrol agents today than in any prior year? The answer is yes. Is the flow of undocumented immigrants the lowest in 40 years? When demographers try to measure the number of people crossing the border illegally, they usually refer to the net flow -- arrivals to the United States minus departures. Lately, that number has been essentially a wash, according to statistics from the Pew Hispanic Center. The center estimated that between 2010 and 2011, the number of immigrants from Mexico declined so much that the flow into Mexico was bigger than the flow out of Mexico since "probably in the 1930s," said Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for Pew. This is consistent with the kind of decline Obama was referring to, but both Passel and Massey said Obama was likely referring to a somewhat different statistic -- namely, apprehensions of individuals crossing from Mexico to the United States. Those numbers also support Obama’s claim. Apprehension statistics are an imperfect gauge of population flow, since they can be affected by the magnitude of the border patrol effort. Still, while this statistic is not a "direct measure of flow across the border," Passel said, it is "widely accepted as an indicator of the magnitude of the flow." So what does that data look like? In 2011, according to federal statistics compiled by Massey, the United States apprehended 327,577 individuals, a smaller number than in any year going back to 1970 -- or just outside Obama’s 40-year window. And if you look at apprehensions per agent, it’s the lowest in an even longer period -- since 1943, Massey said. Assigning reasons for the decline Where Obama’s claim runs into problems is when he credits his policies. Passel said Obama has a point that law enforcement -- something the president has influence over -- has a major impact. "We know from various surveys that the cost of hiring a smuggler to get into the U.S. has increased significantly as enforcement has been ramped up," he said. "We also know that Mexicans have been pushed into more remote areas to try to cross where it is physically more difficult and dangerous." But Massey considers the economy the primary factor. The recession, he said, had an immense impact in slowing border crossing. In particular, dwindling prospects of finding a job in sectors such as construction, which traditionally attract a disproportionate number of Latinos, dampened the urge for potential Mexican migrants to undertake a difficult journey. Two other significant factors were also out of Obama’s control -- the state of the economy in Mexico (which has been relatively healthy) and the activity of the drug cartels (which has increased violence on the Mexican side of the border). Our ruling Obama said, "We put more border patrol on the (U.S.-Mexico border than at) any time in history, and the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years." Obama is right about the numbers of Border Patrol agents and on the immigrant flows across the border. However, it’s a stretch for him to suggest that his administration is the primary reason for record numbers -- the growth began under Bush. And while law enforcement matters, so do economic conditions in both the United States and Mexico as well as crime on the Mexican side of the border. On balance, we rate Obama’s claim Half True.

pomt-05396	Says "I don’t agree with Mr. Hales that we should give a sweeping break to the developers to allow them to build that infill housing without paying for those very basics."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/05/jefferson-smith/does-charlie-hales-want-give-sweeping-break-develo/	Asked about road maintenance at last week’s mayoral debate, state Rep. Jefferson Smith, brought up the very sexy phrase "systems development charges" and used the opportunity to criticize the third leading candidate in the mayoral race, former city Commissioner Charlie Hales. Systems development charges are paid by developers -- of housing, new retail buildings, etc. -- to offset the effect of more people on roads, water, sewer and parks. The money goes toward infrastructure to handle more people. "But one difference is is that I don’t agree with Mr. Hales that we should give a sweeping break to the developers to allow them to build that infill housing without paying for those very basics. So before we talk about spending new money, or even spending old money, let’s make sure we don’t give away the money we already have," Smith said. Does Hales want to give "a sweeping break" to housing developers as Smith claims? Apparently Hales does, but it’s not limited to housing developers. He’s called for a two-year moratorium on systems development charges, saying that they squash business, including the food cart operator looking for a solid building or the retailer who wants to move into bigger space. And yes, we need cheaper, more affordable homes in the city, his campaign says. By limiting his comment to housing developers, who are unpopular in some circles, Smith was suggesting Hales has a cozy relationship with one group when his proposal is broader. Hales wants to grant this "sweeping break" to all developers, including the more sympathetic food cart operators. (In fact, Hales says these charges make no sense within the city, where infrastructure already exists.) We find Smith’s statement needs a little clarification. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-05999	"One generation ago we led the world in college graduation. We're 16th today."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/20/arne-duncan/arne-duncan-says-us-has-dropped-no-1-no-16-world-c/	The cost of higher education keeps rising, but U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan says it has never been more important. He and Vice President Joe Biden focused on the need to keep college affordable in a visit to Ohio this month. Speaking near Columbus at a town hall-style meeting at Lincoln High School in Gahanna, Biden said, "The one ticket today for the middle class is some kind of education beyond high school." Duncan said going to college must stay a part of the American Dream. "One generation ago we led the world in college graduation," he said. "We're 16th today. In one generation, we've flat lined. We've stagnated." Going from first to 16th in international standings sounds like falling off a cliff into shallow water. Is it true? PolitiFact Ohio called the Department of Education. Duncan's office said the secretary frequently cites that statistic, usually stunning his listeners, and that his source is the report on education that was issued last September by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is a 50-year-old group of 34 developed countries that sets international standards on a wide range of topics. Its report shows that the United States has fallen from 12th to 16th in the share of adults age 25 to 34 holding degrees -- trailing leaders South Korea, Canada and Japan, and ranking in the middle of the pack among developed countries. That supports Duncan's statement about the current U.S. ranking. But was the U.S. ever first? We asked the OECD. To compare the current ranking with a generation ago, press officer Spencer Wilson referred us to a chart ranking countries by the percentage of their 55- to 64-year-old post-secondary degree holders. On that list, the United States ties with Canada for second at 41 percent. Israel is first, with 45 percent. "But the OECD itself, when talking about the changing world of global education, uses the U.S. as the world leader 40 years ago because most of the world's graduates at that time were American," Wilson told us in an email. In fact, among the G20 countries that comprise the world's largest economies, every fourth adult with a post-secondary degree is in the U.S., the OECD report said. (China and Japan come in second and third.) The United States still has one of most highly educated labor forces in the OECD. "However," the report adds, "because of the rapid expansion of tertiary [post-secondary] education both in the industrialized world and in emerging economies, the U.S. is fast losing its advantage." The United States, it notes, is the only country in which degree attainment levels among people just entering the labor market -- meaning 25- to 34-year-olds -- do not exceed those of people about to leave the labor market, 55- to 64-year-olds. When President Obama announced in 2009 a goal of retaking the lead in young adults with degrees, the U.S. ranked 12th among developed nations, with 39 percent of young adults holding degrees, according to an OECD report based on 2006 data. That percentage increased to 41 percent in the latest study, based on 2009 data. But the pace of increase was more rapid elsewhere. The rate reached 63 percent in South Korea, and 56 percent in Canada and Japan. "The U.S. also faces significant challenges in the supply of future students," the OECD said. In 2009, it said, the reading level of 42 percent of 15-year-old students was below the level necessary for secondary-level studies, meaning "it will become increasingly difficult to supply institutions of higher education with students who are able to follow and complete their studies." So where does that leave Duncan’s claim? The OECD data shows that his assertion that the United States ranked 16th for college graduation gets high marks. As for a generation ago, the OECD considered the United States the world leader because most of the world’s college graduates were from the United States. In terms of percentage of population, though, the U.S. numbers were slightly behind the much smaller nation of Israel. That’s a point of clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, Duncan’s statement rates as Mostly True.	None	Arne Duncan	None	None	None	2012-01-20T06:00:00	2012-01-12	['None']
pomt-07102	Says a Republican-drawn map of proposed U.S. House districts for Texas "gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/22/nina-perales/maldef-lawyer-says-may-remap-texas-congressional-d/	A lawyer viewing a proposed Republican redo of congressional districts laid out in late May saw no additional gains for Hispanic representation even though "65 percent of the state's growth over the past decade was comprised of Latinos." Nina Perales, vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a May 31 press release that the map just unveiled by Republican legislators "gerrymanders more than nine million Latinos in Texas to make sure that we have no more electoral opportunity than we did in 1991." That’s a heavy charge considering Latino population growth has been key to the state gaining six U.S. House seats since the 2000 census. Is MALDEF’s claim accurate? Let’s start with a dash of law and a 20-year flashback. As noted in a February draft report by the Texas Legislative Council, U.S. Supreme Court decisions bar any state from drawing congressional districts intentionally diluting the "voting strength of members of a racial or ethnic minority group." The Voting Rights Act of 1965, amended in 1982, is the "most important law protecting the voting rights of racial and ethnic minority groups," the report says, because of provisions requiring certain jurisdictions, including Texas, to obtain prior federal approval of any redistricting plan. The act also allows members of a racial or language minority group to challenge a plan limiting or diminishing their opportunity to participate in elections and to elect candidates of their choice. Redistricting expert Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, told us the court has interpreted the act to mean jurisdictions must protect the voting power of a group of racial and ethnic minorities if it’s large enough, compact enough and cohesive enough--and would not be able to exercise political power if the electoral process was left to its own devices. Now, the flashback: Lawmakers in 1991 designed two of three added House districts as "opportunity" districts giving Latino voters a good shot at electing candidates of their choice. Frank Tejeda, a Democratic state senator, then captured the San Antonio-rooted 28th district, while voters in Houston’s 29th district advanced another senator, Democrat Gene Green. Texas wound up with seven Latino-opportunity districts, a number that did not change after last decade’s redistricting. How do those opportunity districts shake out under the map offered in May? For starters, the map breaks up the state into 36 districts, counting four districts gained courtesy of population increases this past decade. Two new districts, one in the Houston area, the other in Dallas-Fort Worth, are not considered minority-opportunity districts. Another, the 34th district, stretches from Brownsville in Cameron County to Hidalgo County north toward Corpus Christi and is 82 percent Hispanic. But observers do not view the district as a Latino-opportunity gain; it’s a swap for the current Latino-opportunity district rooted in Corpus Christi and carried in 2010 by Republican Blake Farenthold. Then again, the remap includes the new 35th district running from East Austin into San Antonio. Its overall population is 63 percent Hispanic, according to information compiled by the legislative council; 45 percent of its 2010 registered voters had Spanish surnames. Perales told us Latino voters could elect the candidate of their choice in the district. This appears to give the state an additional Latino-opportunity district compared with 1991. Not so, Perales said, because it’s offset by redraws of San Antonio’s 20th district and the 23rd district stretching west from San Antonio that dilute Latino voting power. Among factors she aired: The share of Spanish-surnamed voters in the 20th district, which is represented by Charlie Gonzalez, would drop from 58 percent now to 49 percent. In the 23rd district, where Democrat Rick Noriega bested GOP U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in 2008, Cornyn prevails in the redrawn version. "If you create a new opportunity and you take away an opportunity, there’s no net gain," Perales said. State Sen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, who chairs the Senate Redistricting Committee, told us lawmakers had to shift Hispanic residents from Gonzalez’s district to ensure the new Austin-to-San Antonio district would be a Latino-opportunity district. He urged us to visit further with Austin lawyer Bob Heath, an adviser to the committee. Heath said it’s hard for legislators to create more Latino-opportunity districts because the Hispanic population is younger than the rest of Texas, and its proportionate share of voting-age residents is smaller. He said too that such residents aren’t always geographically concentrated and Latino voter registration and turnout tends to run low in part because there are more Latino non-citizens than in other subgroups. Heath said that in his opinion, he said, the 20th district is "always going to elect an Hispanic in the Democratic primary and the Democrat is going to win." He declined to comment on the 23rd district. No doubt, appraising opportunity districts is tricky. "This is why political scientists get paid every 10 years, for taking all the factors into account" and judging districts, Levitt said. "It’s nuanced." It’s also subject to legal argument. Courts have been asked to judge the redo of congressional districts that ultimately won legislative approval. Our judgment: If MALDEF’s characterizations stick, the May remap promised six to seven Latino-opportunity districts -- at best the same as 1991. But if Republican defenders are correct, the remap offers eight Latino-opportunity districts--a one-seat bump. However, the proportion of Latino-opportunity seats circa 2012--22 percent--would be virtually unchanged in 20 years. That’s because greatly Latino population growth has helped Texas edge to 36 total seats, compared to 30 in 1991. We rate MALDEF’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08599	On the success of "Cash for Clunkers"	full flop	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/24/tom-ganley/car-dealer-tom-ganley-changes-directions-auto-sale/	Since her 2006 election to Congress, Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton’s signature achievement has been passage of legislation that established a temporary "Cash for Clunkers" subsidy for auto purchases. The program devised by Sutton provided government rebates of up to $4,500 to buyers who traded in gas guzzlers for more fuel efficient models. The U.S. Department of Transportation says that over the weeks that program lasted in 2009, nearly 680,000 older vehicles were replaced. It says the nation's economy benefited immediately from this stimulus program, which caused a distinct upward movement in GDP and created or saved tens of thousands of jobs at a crucial time in the recovery process. But the Republican candidate seeking Sutton’s congressional seat – Brecksville auto dealer Tom Ganley – says the program was a clunker even though government records show it helped his dealerships sell 934 cars worth $20.6 million. In recent interviews, he has insisted the program sparked a temporary sales spike that was followed by a slowdown, and had negative long-term effects on the industry and used-car consumers who could have bought trade-ins that were destroyed under the program. Ganley’s views on the "Cash for Clunkers" program have evolved dramatically since he decided to run for Congress against Sutton. Ganley had nothing but praise for the program an August 2009 Time Warner Cable interview conducted while he was pursuing the GOP U.S. Senate nomination in Ohio that was ultimately won by Cincinnati’s Rob Portman. Ganley told "In the Spotlight" host Bob Conklin that he generally opposed government bailouts for business, but believed the "Cash for Clunkers" program "really worked." "I don’t think it is a double standard," he said. "Once again, the government was searching for ways to stimulate our economy and create jobs. And I’m sure your read the headlines just recently. General Motors is going to a second shift in Lordstown because of this. That creates jobs it also creates taxpayers. They are bringing back something close to 1,300 employees at Lordstown.. Those 1,300 people are going to begin to pay taxes. That’s 1,300 jobs we’ve stimulated through the Cash for Clunkers. Plus, I have created jobs out of necessity in my stores now because of the large volume of folks coming in. We are bringing back people that we had laid off." Nearly a year later, on August 18, 2010, he told The Plain Dealer that the government stimulus and "Cash for Clunkers" program "created work, not jobs." He said he would have voted against the program if he were in Congress, even though he’s a car dealer. "We had a tremendous spike up of business, and then a tremendous spike down," he said. "Not one job did it create." Ganley spokeswoman Meghan Snyder noted that Conklin’s interview was conducted several days before the "cash for clunkers" program expired. She said her boss was assessing a sales surge that halted almost immediately after the interview was conducted. Sales dropped dramatically when the program ended, she said, citing National Auto Dealers Association statistics that indicated 10.4 million new vehicles were sold in 2009, down 21.2 percent from 2008’s 13.2 million. Furthermore, she said cars that could have been re-sold were deemed "clunkers," and destroyed, shrinking the inventory of low-priced used vehicles. "In mid-August, there was confidence in the program’s success, a notion that proved false when sales totals confirmed this program was an artificial surge and any temporary work was quickly eliminated," said Snyder Ganley clearly changed his tune.

In his keynote speech at the event (commonly known as CPAC) held annually by the American Conservative Union, the Texas Republican equated current events to Democrats telling the Catholic Church, "Change your religious beliefs or we'll use our power in the federal government to shut down your charities and your hospitals." Reading that as a reference to the administration of President Barack Obama, we asked Cruz’s office for backup information. Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton, saying Cruz also was referring to congressional Democrats who voted for the health care overhaul known as Obamacare, emailed us links and articles from conservative and religious sources criticizing government decisions on how churches and affiliated organizations are to comply with the law’s mandate that insurance plans cover preventive care -- including an administration interpretation that this includes birth control without employees paying any out-of-pocket costs. None of the articles Rushton sent, though, showed Democrats or the government saying they would shut down churches’ hospitals or charities for failing to comply. A Feb. 10, 2012, PolitiFact story gave the backdrop: 2010’s health care overhaul required most health plans to cover recommended "preventive health services" without co-pays or deductibles. But the law left to the administration to decide which women’s health services to include. In August 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services ruled that insurance plans would have to cover sterilization and all birth control approved by the Food and Drug Administration, from condoms to hormone shots to "morning-after" pills, starting in August 2012 at the earliest. But according to Catholic precepts, contraception is against moral law. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops says that if contraceptives must be offered without a co-pay, that means the cost is spread among employers and all insured employees -- meaning that Catholics would end up paying for birth control. Those rules were finalized in 2012, and more changes have been proposed as of 2013, amid much public debate. In the 2012 rules, which are still in force, the government exempted some religious employers and gave them a year’s grace period before the requirements took effect. To qualify for the "religious employer" exemption, a group had to be a nonprofit that served and employed people who shared its religious tenets and had as its purpose inculcating religious values. But the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the governing body of the Catholic Church in this country, said that definition was too narrow because it ruled out many universities, hospitals and charitable groups, such as those that serve non-Catholics. Changes that the government proposed Feb. 1, 2013, would widen the definition of "religious employer" and, according to a Reuters news story posted that day, require that arrangements be made for people who work for self-insured religious organizations to get contraception coverage through private insurers. Rushton said the proposal did not go far enough and sent us material from the conservative Heritage Foundation including a Feb. 9, 2013, article saying that the "so-called fix would only apply to certain religious nonprofit organizations, leaving many others — such as business owners, individuals, and non-religious nonprofits — without any recourse from the mandate." Bishops’ spokeswoman Sister Mary Ann Walsh told us by email that "massive fines for non-compliance" would force some groups to close, and the proposed changes would not fix the situation. "If they fail to provide coverage for contraception or sterilization in their health plans," Walsh wrote, "they’re subject to an assessment of $100 a day per employee. ... And if they drop their health plans to avoid the mandate, they’re subject to an annual penalty of $2,000 per employee," she wrote, citing the sections of U.S. law that spell out the fines: 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(b) and 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1). "For a lot of nonprofit entities, such fines could run in the millions of dollars and would render their operations unsustainable," Walsh said. She did not give instances of the government threatening to directly close an institution. We searched for such communication to the church and came up empty. New York’s archbishop, Timothy Dolan, said in a Feb. 9, 2012, "CBS This Morning" interview that Obama had backed down from promises made during a November 2011 meeting at the White House. For his part, Obama said his administration sought to protect religious freedom with its rules for carrying out the mandate. The president said in a Feb. 10, 2012, press conference: I spoke directly to various Catholic officials, and I promised that before finalizing the rule as it applied to them, we would spend the next year working with institutions like Catholic hospitals and Catholic universities to find an equitable solution that protects religious liberty and ensures that every woman has access to the care that she needs. … The result will be that religious organizations won’t have to pay for these services, and no religious institution will have to provide these services directly. Dolan wrote in a March 2, 2012, letter to fellow bishops that "the (p)resident announced that the insurance providers would have to pay the bill, instead of the (c)hurch’s schools, hospitals, clinics, or vast network of charitable outreach having to do so.... since a big part of our ministries are ‘self-insured,’ we still ask how this protects us." White House staff, Dolan wrote, told bishops’ conference staffers that reconsidering the mandate and widening the exemption were off the table. Cruz’s spokesman, Rushton, said companies facing similar contraception-providing requirements have sued and gotten injunctions delaying their fines. But once those delays and the religious groups’ grace period expire, he said, "unless they win in court or the mandate is changed, these institutions will be fined out of existence." When we inquired, White House spokesman Eric Schultz didn’t speak directly to Cruz’s claim that government shutdowns had been threatened, but he emailed materials including a Catholic Health Association release issued Feb. 13, 2013, that said the group of nonprofit health systems was pleased with the new definition of "religious employer" and called the changes "substantial progress." Schultz also sent a Feb. 1, 2013, press release from the nonprofit advocacy group Catholics United that said the changes were a victory for the Catholic church. Alternately, Rushton said, "The idea is, such organizations may choose to cease certain activities rather than violate their conscience." He sent us a Feb. 28, 2012, news story from the conservative Cybercast News Service that quoted the Chicago archbishop, Cardinal Francis George, predicting his area’s Catholic hospitals and health care institutions would close within two years. At that time, George said, he saw four choices: turn secular, pay "exorbitant" fines that are "not economically sustainable," sell out to a non-Catholic operator or shut down. Our ruling Cruz, alluding to Obamacare’s contraception insurance coverage mandate, said Democrats told the Catholic Church they would use federal powers to shut down its charities and hospitals if the church doesn’t change its beliefs. We found no sign of such a statement -- or anything close. The Catholic bishops have said that potential accumulated fines resulting from refusals to carry out the contraception mandate will cause some institutions to shut down. Perhaps. However, such prospects do not reflect a direct threat from Democrats or the government. To the contrary, the administration has moved to widen the mandate’s exemption for religious employers and provide a workaround for those who act as their own insurance providers -- with the goal of allowing affected parties to continue their work without violating or changing their beliefs.

pomt-13136	"Tens of thousands of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2016/nov/01/blog-posting/bogus-ballot-stuffing-story-irks-ohio-secretary-st/	A story ringing alarm about election mischief in Ohio is the latest baseless conspiracy polluting the internet ahead of Nov. 8. The digital publication Christian Times Newsletter ran a story Sept. 30 claiming "tens of thousands of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse." The story -- which can no longer be found on the site -- said the incident happened in Franklin County and was discovered by a Trump supporter. A photo showed the alleged man inside a warehouse beside 12 black bins, some marked "ballot box." A month after the story first posted, readers asked if the story about massive fraud in a crucial swing-state could be true. Far from it. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted issued a press release Sept. 30 knocking down the falsehood. "As a Christian myself, I take offense to reading such unbelievable lies from a publication alleging Christian ties," Husted wrote. "No one from this so-called news outlet bothered to call the Franklin County Board of Elections or the Ohio Secretary of State’s office to verify any facts. It was a deliberate attempt to deceive and mislead. We already get enough of that from the candidates. Enough already." PolitiFact Ohio attempted to trace the origin of the photo that ran with the online story: The urban legend busters at Snopes beat us to it, linking to what appears to be the original photo from the Birmingham Mail in England, published in 2015. It looks like the Christian Times Newsletter flipped the original image and scrubbed off some of the "Ballot Box" labels on the bins. The Christian Times Newsletter identified the man in their photo as Columbus-area electrical worker Randall Prince, and said he discovered the ballots while "doing a routine check" of his company’s wiring and electrical systems. (We left a message for a person with that name but did not hear back by deadline.) The article alleged that the plan was to slip the fake ballots in with real ones when delivered to official election judges on Nov. 8. The Franklin County Board of Elections told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that each ballot box, if real, would be secured with a double lock that must be opened with an official from each political party. The article alleging vote mishandling has popped up on various other websites. PolitiFact Ohio reached out via an online form to the Christian Times Newsletter but has not yet received a response. The Christian Times Newsletter does not call itself a fake-news site. Subscribers are told "each and every email you receive from us will be intrinsically priceless." Our ruling The article claiming "tens of thousands of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse" is fake. State and local elections officials have criticized the website for running a made-up story, and the accompanying photo in the piece is a doctored version of a picture taken by a publication in the United Kingdom.

pomt-07403	"A $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store. Plastic bag police anyone?"	false	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/29/victoria-taft/victoria-taft-warns-250-fine-if-youre-caught-plast/	On Monday, talk-radio host and conservative Victoria Taft sent two tweets regarding a proposed plastic bag ban pending in Salem. The first: "$250 fine for possession of plastic bag if ban goes thru." The second: "‘Plastic’ Bag Ban: A $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store. Plastic bag police anyone?#5vtshow." PolitiFact Oregon knows that under proposed legislation there would be a 5-cent charge for each paper bag. But a $250 fine for mere possession of a bag? A plastic bag police? Those were intriguing concepts. Taft has received one Pants on Fire and one False from PolitiFact Oregon, so we understand her reluctance to talk to us about her tweets. (Her email response to our query asked more questions than it answered.) That said, we did some checking and found that the $250 fine is rooted in reality: It’s the penalty levied on a retailer -- not a shopper -- for continuing to hand out single-use plastic bags at checkout. Palmer Mason, a legislative analyst with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, said if the ban becomes law, the agency likely would use the first year not to fine, but to educate retailers on a new bag ban. "This is a huge behavioral change.This affects most of the retail transactions in the state of Oregon and it will take time for consumers and retailers and for the industry to change their behavior and change what they’ve been doing for many years," he said. (That said, Mason wants retailers to know that DEQ isn’t afraid to ticket flagrant flouters in year one.) To be absolutely fair to Taft, the original language of Senate Bill 536 states that DEQ "may impose a civil penalty on a person" who violates Section 2 -- but again, Section 2 applies to retailers and what the establishments may or may not provide in terms of checkout bags. And, an amendment dated March 3, way before she tweeted, clarifies the original bill to strike out the words "a person" and replace the term with "a retail establishment." Taft is right when she says there is a $250 fine for plastic bag abuse. But her second tweet, which reads in part -- "a $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store" -- gives the impression that the individual shopper would be fined for possessing a plastic bag. And that’s just not true. We would give Taft’s tweet a Pants on Fire if she had plucked the amount of the fine out of thin air. We could give this a Barely True, in that the statement contained an element of truth -- the $250 fine -- but failed to mention that it applied to retailers, which would have given a different impression. But instead, we rate her statement a False. A shopper who is "caught with a plastic bag" does not merit a fine, and indeed, it may not even merit the retailer a fine since shoppers are allowed to bring in their own bags. DEQ officials will not be prowling supermarket exits to pounce on single-use plastic bag users. The statement is not accurate. Return to OregonLIve.com to comment on this Truth-O-Meter ruling.

pomt-14488	"African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-blacks-more-likely-be-arreste/	Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been trying to court black voters ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary by talking about the need to address systemic racism. In a 30-second commercial, Clinton says: "Something is just fundamentally broken when African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do." We wanted to see if there's evidence that being black influences whether someone will be arrested and, once convicted, ordered to do more time. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN IMMIGRATION FACT-CHECKER The question plays out against a stark statistic — although African-Americans make up 13 percent of the general population, they account for 36 percent of the inmate population, according to the latest data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. Risk of arrest A heap of evidence shows African-Americans are arrested at higher rates. The Clinton campaign pointed out a Washington Post blog post (referring to a Brookings Institution piece) that said blacks are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs than whites even though whites are 45 percent more likely to sell drugs than blacks. But the data is from 1980, part of a paper that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self-employment. The campaign also had fresher data in mind, however, including a USA Today analysis of arrest rates around the country in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo. In at least 1,581 of 3,538 police departments, the paper found, blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson. Only 173 departments "arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups," the paper reported. The Bureau of Justice Statistics periodically surveys the public to study police-citizen interactions. Its most recent report in 2008 found that white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police. However, black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. (When a search occurred, evidence was found in only 8.4 percent of the cases, but the report doesn't break that down by race.) The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group, has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data posted in 2014 by Missouri's attorney general's office. It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson, there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found. But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher — 12 percent — and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent). Not only that, blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop. In a spot check, we found similar patterns in Jefferson City. It's not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report, drug arrest rates have long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there's little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites. What surveys have shown "is that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20," said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. "But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest." Sentencing There is also evidence for Clinton’s statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history. Studies have shown, for instance, that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects, they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to use habitual offender laws against blacks more than whites under similar circumstances, particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes, according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology. A 2013 study in the Yale Law Journal reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances. When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history. After controlling for the arrest offense, a person's criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found. The problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity "accumulates at each level," said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project. "You're a little bit more likely to get arrested if you're a person of color than if you're white. You're a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That's going to make it harder for you to get released. You're a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer," she said. "As you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it's going to be significant as you go through the stages." Tonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but "it depends hugely on what crime you're talking about. "If it's a drug crime that's affected by mandatory minimums, it's vastly longer," Tonry said. "If you're talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do." How much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate. The experts say poverty may play a major role, but it can be hard to separate the two. The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas, where crime tends to be higher and there's a greater demand for police. That can skew the numbers. And sentences can be longer for poor people under pressure to cop a plea because they can't afford bail or a good lawyer. Our ruling Clinton said, "African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do." The research suggests that when you compare what happens to black and whites who are engaging in the same illegal activity and have the same criminal history, African Americans are more likely to be arrested, more likely to face tougher charges, and more likely to receive longer sentences than their caucasian counterparts. We rate the claim as True.

pomt-02362	"In Oregon, students are skipping math class to learn about the Bible."	true	/oregon/statements/2014/mar/19/hemant-mehta/are-oregon-students-skipping-math-class-learn-abou/	Religious-freedom issues are on center stage these days. Some religious groups say health-care provisions requiring them to provide birth control for their employees violate their First Amendment rights. At least two bakeries, one of them in Gresham, have made headlines by contending they shouldn’t be forced to bake wedding cakes for same-sex couples because of their religious beliefs. The Claim A Chicago school teacher who moonlights as an Internet blogger picked up a similar theme after seeing a recent story in The Oregonian. Hemant Mehta, whose pen name is "The Friendly Atheist," had this to say after reading that Banks School District students are released from classes in the middle of the day for religious instruction: "In Oregon, students are skipping math class to learn about the Bible." He added, "There’s a law in Oregon -- it’s been around for decades -- that allows public school students to skip classes for up to two hours a week (or five if they’re in high school) in order to get ‘instruction in religion.’" Students are skipping math for religious instruction? PolitiFact Oregon took a look. The Analysis We emailed Mehta, who saw mention of a religious instruction law in a story that ran in The Oregonian on March 10, 2014. Mehta said he didn’t doubt the law existed. His problem with it, he said, is missed instruction time. "In my experience, most students who miss significant time do not perform as well as their classmates," he said. To find out more about the law itself, we emailed Portland attorney Warren Foote, local chapter president of the Christian Legal Society, a group of legal professionals who incorporate Christian principles into their practices. Foote, noting that his practice doesn’t focus on First Amendment or religious freedom issues, said he hadn’t heard of the law. His subsequent research showed that ORS 339.420 was enacted by the 1965 Oregon Legislature. The law, amended twice since, requires parents to apply to have a child excused from school "for periods not exceeding two hours in any week for elementary pupils and five hours in any week for secondary pupils to attend weekday schools giving instruction in religion." Foote said he could find no other legislative history on how it came into being. We called Judy Busch, executive director of PREP4Kids, a Portland-based nonprofit that coordinates release-time religious instruction for about 30 area schools, Banks among them. For legal specifics, she referred us to Herb Grey, a Beaverton attorney active in conservative causes such as Oregon Right to Life. Grey said he lacked detailed information on the origins of ORS 339.420 but suspects it was a reaction to the landmark 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case that banned Bible-reading in American public schools. "Ever since then, courts have generally ruled that these release-time laws are legal," he said. "They’ve said you can’t get school credit for them, but you can certainly have them." Crystal Greene, the state Education Department's communications director, said no numbers are kept on total student involvement in these programs statewide. However, an Internet check shows that numerous Oregon school districts incorporate the law into their policies. We visited the Multnomah County Law Library and learned that ORS 339.420 was part of House Bill 1020, introduced and eventually passed in 1965. The records we examined turned up no detailed information, such as House Education Committee minutes for any hearings held on the bill. We did learn that a young Portland state senator, Vic Atiyeh, sat on the Senate Education Committee that eventually approved the bill. Then-Gov. Mark O. Hatfield signed it into law March 25, 1965. Having at least blown some of the dust off the law, we wondered about the other part of Mehta’s claim: Are students skipping math to get that instruction? We called Banks schools Superintendent Bob Huston, who has the final say in the amount of time students spend in religious study since it’s specified in the law. What he can’t control, he said, is exactly which part of the day the instruction takes place. Huston, working with district parents, has agreed to carve out the last hour of the day for students to receive off-site religious instruction. Asked whether students are missing math to do that, he replied, "No math class is at the same time for every student." In other words, a student whose math class is at the end of the school day would miss that class, while other students are missing other subjects. It’s important to note that parents must grant their permission for students to miss school for religious instruction. As part of that, we looked at Mehta’s use of the word "skipping" to see whether that implies students are truant. But none of the definitions we consulted directly equated "skipping" with an unexcused absence. The Ruling Hemant Mehta, a Chicago teacher and moonlight blogger, recently wrote that a decades-old Oregon law has resulted in public school students "skipping math class to learn about the Bible." An Oregon law passed in 1965 does let children out of school for weekly religious instruction. Under ORS 339.420, hundreds of students are receiving anywhere from two to five hours of religious instruction a week, depending on their age. We also found that at least some of the students who miss classes for religious study are missing math class, with their parents’ permission. We rate Mehta’s claim True.

pomt-01336	A lawyer demanded "several Houston pastors hand over to the city government many of their private papers, including their sermons."	true	/texas/statements/2014/oct/23/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-houston-city-attorney-subpoenaed-/	Greg Abbott, the Republican nominee for governor, accused lawyers representing the City of Houston of infringing on First Amendment protections of religious speech by demanding Houston church sermons. In his capacity as the state’s attorney general, Abbott said in an Oct. 15, 2014, letter to David Feldman, Houston’s city attorney, that Feldman’s "office has demanded several Houston pastors hand over to the city government many of their private papers, including their sermons." Abbott, who posted his letter on his office’s website, was speaking to the city’s legal defense efforts against a lawsuit brought by local voters striving to repeal a city ordinance. Houston’s City Council, led by Mayor Annise Parker, approved the Houston Equal RIghts Ordinance (HERO) in 2014 in a move described by proponents as protecting the rights of transgendered people by permitting Houstonians to use bathrooms in businesses and public facilities of the gender with which they personally identify. Sermons were reportedly sought after a push to put a repeal proposal before voters in November 2014 didn’t succeed. On Aug. 4, 2014, according to a Houston Chronicle news story, Parker and Feldman announced that over half of 50,000 signatures on a petition to put HERO’s repeal on the ballot were invalid. According to the Chronicle, Houston attorneys threw out more than 2,000 pages with about 11,300 signatures because the people who collected the signatures were either not registered voters in Houston or did not sign the petition themselves. In reaction the next day, several residents filed a lawsuit charging the city with wrongfully invalidating the repeal petition. The city issued the subpoenas, as allowed by Texas law, as part of its defense in the lawsuit, in which it had said it will argue against the validity of many signatures on the repeal petition. Feldman told the Chronicle the city included its request for sermons in the subpoenas because pastors who led the petition effort gave instructions on gathering signatures during church service. We sought elaboration from the city -- does Houston’s government suspect preachers of coaxing congregants to fake signatures? -- without success. The city also didn’t respond to our inquiries about the described subpoenas, copies of which came from Abbott’s state office. Legal Documents To our inquiry, Abbott’s state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, emailed copies of five subpoenas, issued Sept. 10, 2014 via a city attorney, Kristen Schlemmer, addressed to Houston pastors Steve Riggle, Hernan Castano, Khan Huynh and Dave Welch and church leader Magda Hermida. Each subpoena lists 17 categories of documents and communications which the church leaders were told they had to submit by Oct. 10, 2014, including: --"All speeches, presentations or sermons related to HERO, the petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by or approved by you or in your possession." --"All communications with members of your congregation regarding HERO or the petition." According to the subpoena, documents and communications include writings, notes, diaries, electronic or videotape recordings, emails, instant messages, text messages, emails or relevant "electronically-stored matter." Meanwhile, two days after Abbott wrote his letter, the city revised the subpoenas to remove mention of "sermons." Parker said opponents deliberately misinterpreted the subpoenas’ original language, which sought speech about the signature-gathering process; then again, she also maintained the changes didn’t preclude sermons from being produced, according to a Chronicle news story. Our Ruling Greg Abbott said a city lawyer "demanded that several Houston pastors hand over to the city government many of their private papers, including their sermons." Five subpoenas, submitted by the City of Houston, required pastors to furnish sermons and personal communications with members of their congregation. We rate this statement True.

pomt-02815	"During the last election, Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans, but because of the way districts are designed, the Republicans got 33 more members of the House of Representatives than the Democrats did."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/nov/26/lloyd-doggett/democrats-outpolled-republicans-who-landed-33-seat/	The Democratic member of Congress from Austin, otherwise represented in Washington, D.C. by Republicans, says Democrats nationally got more votes in 2012 yet Republicans ended up with their House majority. "During the last election, Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans," Rep. Lloyd Doggett said in a Nov. 4, 2013, talk at the University of Texas at San Antonio. "But because of the way" House "districts are designed, the Republicans got 33 more members of the House of Representatives than the Democrats did." The first part of his claim sounded familiar, but is it right that this outcome arose from the way House districts were designed? In every state, districts must be redrawn every 10 years to adjust for population changes as measured by the decennial U.S. census. Each state has its own method for drawing districts. And Texas, like most states, entrusts most of the line-drawing to state legislators. Over the past dozen years or so, Doggett pointed out in his talk, he has represented a variety of communities--at one time holding a district that stretched from the Texas-Mexico border north into Austin--largely due to how districts were drawn by the state’s dominant Republicans. Nationally, he said, the redistricting process "has had a significant impact on more than me and indeed on the whole framing of the national debate that is going on right now." His lecture later touched on the influence of money in politics. Doggett, who currently represents a district snaking south from Travis County into its base in San Antonio, told the university audience that Republican domination of redistricting in statehouses effectively helped the GOP maintain its House majority. To our inquiry, Doggett said by email: "I spoke about a number of factors that explain the composition and conduct of the current Congress. Redistricting looms large among them as a very significant factor. Gerrymandering," district-drawing to partisan advantage, "has only reinforced obstructionists." Doggett’s spokeswoman, Kelsey Crow, sent an email pointing out an Oct. 14, 2013, NBC News report stating: "When Republicans won the majority of statehouses in 2010, it ensured they would be redrawing the maps in those states. And lo and behold, it paid off in 2012. Nationwide, Democrats running for Congress got 1.1 million more votes, but Republicans sent 33 more members to the House." It’s helpful to remember that the Republican margin of 33 seats means Democrats fell 17 victories short of capturing the House majority. Doggett’s raw numbers were accurate. Democrats outpolled Republicans in the 2012 House races, but Republicans ended up with a 33-seat House majority. A December 2012 analysis by the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan D.C. publication, said House Democrats out-drew their Republican counterparts by more than 1 million votes--1.37 million votes to be precise, Cook’s House editor, David Wasserman, later calculated. Between the two parties, Democrats won 50.59 percent of the vote while winning 46 percent of seats, leaving the Republicans with 234 seats and Democrats with 201. The Republican advantage was a decrease from the party’s 49-seat majority in 2011-12; Democrats held House majorities from 2007 through 2010. But political scientists quibble over whether how districts were redrawn entirely explains the GOP majority. (This is a good time to take a gulp of water/beverage of your preference). Writing in December 2012, Wasserman pointed to two "unprecedented" factors that explained the GOP’s House grip: the thick concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas and the GOP’s wide control of drawing congressional districts. Other analyses similarly support redistricting as a reason, but some political scientists suggest other factors were more significant such as the advantages enjoyed by Republicans seeking re-election as incumbents. Even before the 2012 elections, Republican influence over redistricting looked likely to be significant. A George Mason University political scientist, Michael McDonald, who later worked as an expert in a Texas Democratic Party challenge to how Republicans drew districts in Texas, noted in a April 2011 article published by the American Political Science Association that thanks to election results in 2010 and earlier, Republicans would dominate redistricting in more states than Democrats. Among the 43 states with more than one congressional district, he wrote, six would rely on bipartisan commissions to draw new districts, 16 would have Republicans in control, six would have Democrats in charge and 15 would act as a divided government. But different sometimes complex methods of analyzing the 2012 results generate different conclusions about the effects of the line-drawing, though all point to Republicans benefiting most: --On Nov. 8, 2012, Dylan Matthews of the Washington Post’s Wonkblog compared how well Democratic President Barack Obama fared in 2012 in most of the states where Republicans controlled redistricting leading up to the election year compared with how Democrats running for House seats came out. In Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and Pennsylvania, Matthews wrote, Democrats won clutches of seats as Obama prevailed statewide: "In Virginia, for instance, 27 percent of seats went to Democrats, while Obama got 52 percent of the vote. In Pennsylvania, 28 percent of seats went to Democrats, and Obama won 53 percent." There was balance in two states, Matthews wrote: "Utah gave a quarter of its vote to Obama and a quarter of its House seats to Democrats and New Hampshire sent two Democrats to the House despite Obama's only having a six-point margin there." --Just before the 2012 elections, an Oct. 25, 2012, preliminary study by the Brennan Center for Justice, part of the New York University School of Law, concluded that the way districts were drawn would give Republican hopefuls six seats more than they would have won if the election was carried out under the previous district lines. After the elections, a center analyst, Sundeep Iyer, wrote that the prediction mostly held up because five seats flipped from a Democrat to a Republican due to redistricting, he wrote, while six Republican-held seats were saved by redistricting. "In states where Republicans controlled redistricting," Iyer said, "Republican candidates for the House won roughly 53 percent of the vote and 72 percent of the seats." Then again, Iyer wrote, "even under the old district lines, that disparity would have persisted, as Republicans still would have likely won about 65 percent of the seats." Still, Iyer said, where Democrats held redistricting sway, Democrats won three more seats than they would have under the old district lines, while Republicans lost five additional seats. --Another proponent of the "redistricting matters" school, Princeton University neuroscientist and election forecaster Sam Wang, described how partisans can make the line-drawing work to their partisan advantage in a Feb. 2, 2013, opinion column in the New York Times. "Gerrymandering is not hard," Wang wrote. "The core technique is to jam voters likely to favor your opponents into a few throwaway districts where the other side will win lopsided victories, a strategy known as ‘packing.’ Arrange other boundaries to win close victories, ‘cracking’ opposition groups into many districts." By his own methodology, Wang estimated that redistricting cost Democrats 15 House seats in the 2012 elections. --Earlier, Washington University post-doctoral student Nicholas Goedert, said in a Nov. 15, 2012, post on the Monkey Cage blog, founded in 2007 to publicize research by political scientists, that redistricting most likely cost Democrats seven races nationally. Likewise, political scientists John Sides and Eric McGhee said redistricting cost Democrats seven seats, writing that they reached their figure by looking at what would have happened if the election took place in the pre-2012 House districts. "This" seven "is not nothing, but it’s far less than what the Democrats needed to take back the House," the two wrote in a Feb. 17, 2013, commentary on the Wonkblog. Sides and McGhee concluded that once they considered the effect of incumbency on the 2012 results, the seeming pro-Republican impact of gerrymandering vanished. "That is, the ability of Republicans to retain the House majority may have been due to incumbency advantage, not new and more favorable districts," they wrote. Conversely, they wrote, removing the percentage point gains attributable to incumbency generated results indicating that Democrats would have won 219 seats, "virtually eliminating" any GOP advantage traced to redistricting. By telephone, McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, said Republicans nationally pulled off "spectacular gerrymanders" before the 2012 elections. "But there’s no clear evidence that there’s been this systematic ability of Republicans to draw better districts going way back on a national scale," McGhee said. With help from Keesha Gaskins of the Brennan Center, we queried others who have weighed in on redistricting and the 2012 results, among them University of Chicago law professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, who said by email that he thinks Doggett got it right, but reaching that conclusion depends on whether one interprets his statement as speaking to redistricting over more than the past couple years. "It's clear that the party preferred by a minority of voters won a majority of seats in 2012," Stephanapoulos said. "Whether this is because of redistricting depends entirely on what your benchmark is. If your benchmark is proportional representation for each party, then it's clear that redistricting (together with single-member districts) is to blame. If your benchmark is the districts that were in place before the latest round of redistricting, then redistricting may only have won the Republicans 11 seats….But the districts in place before 2012 themselves were drawn by legislatures, and most observers thought the pre-2012 districts already favored Republicans in several states." Next, we ran the range of these analyses past Austin lawyer Steve Bickerstaff, who has advised legislative leaders about redistricting issues since the 1970s. Bickerstaff said by phone that the Republicans’ majority isn’t due solely to how districts were designed. "It’s more complicated," Bickerstaff said. Our ruling Doggett said Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans in 2012 but because of the way districts are designed, Republicans got 33 more House seats. Democratic House nominees drew nearly 1.4 million more votes than Republicans and the GOP landed a 33-seat House majority. Redistricting was a major factor in that result, but experts also diverge over whether how districts were designed was the key driver. Incumbency and the concentration of Democrats in congested cities also have been aired as significant. We rate Doggett’s statement, which lacks this clarification, as Mostly True.

pomt-08403	Republican candidate for governor Nathan Deal fought to weaken Georgia's rape shield law.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/22/roy-barnes/barnes-said-gubertorial-race-opponent-deal-tried-w/	It's the most incendiary TV ad in the race for governor so far. An empty Volvo station wagon sits in a desolate parking lot. Its alarm pulses. The driver's side door hangs open. Groceries litter the ground. "It was my niece," a woman's voice says. "If Nathan Deal had won his fight to weaken the rape shield law, and my niece took the stand, she would have been forced to defend what she wore and that she didn’t deserve to be raped." Supporters of Democratic candidate Roy Barnes, whose campaign authorized the ad, said the actions of Deal, a Republican, show he doesn't protect women's interests. Deal's camp called it a new low in a political season dominated by negative attacks and reminded voters Deal was once a prosecutor who put rapists in jail. They also accused Barnes of being soft on child molesters. Barnes and Deal face off Nov. 2. All the ugliness of using victims for political gain aside, is there any truth to the ad? Did Deal really fight to weaken the rape shield law? Barnes' evidence is a heated, well-documented 1991 General Assembly battle over the state's rape shield law. It pitted Deal against an alliance of women's and victims' rights advocates and prosecutors. The law, established in 1976, blocks defense attorneys from entering a victim's sexual history into evidence in court under most circumstances. This barred evidence includes whether she has a reputation for promiscuity and her "mode of dress." Deal, who was Senate president pro tem at the time, sponsored a 164-page bill that would have overhauled Georgia's rules of evidence. These are the state's rules on what kinds of evidence is admissible in court. Then and now, these rules were a patchwork based on old Georgia code. There is a decades-old movement to update them by making them more like federal rules of evidence. Supporters of this broad-ranging change think the federal rules are more cohesive and in certain cases better. The movement has supporters at the State Bar of Georgia, which produced the bill Deal introduced in 1991. Women's rights advocates, victim advocates, prosecutors and others were furious that the Bar's proposal included changes to the rape shield law. In a meeting with Deal, his opposition warned that they would make it a "major issue of the General Assembly session, and the next session if necessary," according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Deal moved ahead without their support, but the opposition galvanized against him. Women barraged their legislators with phone calls of protest and filled the chambers of the state Senate to show their solidarity. A headline in what was then called the Fulton County Daily Report, the state's major legal news publication, warned "New Rules of Evidence Threatened Rape Shield." A Columbus Ledger-Enquirer editorial described Deal's bill as a "Neanderthal law." Deal bowed to pressure and amended the bill to address their concerns, but the damage was done. It passed the Senate but never made it out of committee in the state House. To evaluate Barnes' claims, AJC PolitiFact Georgia dug up Deal's failed two-decade-old, 164-page Senate bill from the Georgia Archives and looked up state and federal rape shield rules that were in effect then. We also evaluated arguments made publicly for and against the changes in 1991 and recently. Both the bill proposed by Deal and existing Georgia law barred the victim's sexual past from being admissible in court in most cases. Both included an exception if the victim's sexual history with the accused showed the incident may have been consensual. But the law proposed by Deal permitted four new exceptions to the rule. The biggest was this: If prosecutors presented physical evidence including semen, injury, pregnancy, or disease to prove the victim was raped, then a judge could allow a defense attorney to enter evidence about a victim's sexual past. And unlike the existing rape shield, the proposed version did not explicitly bar the accuser's "mode of dress" from entering into evidence. In Deal'sproposed law, if defense attorneys wanted to include a victim's sexual past, they would make a motion on the issue when the jury was not present. The judge would then hear arguments from both sides in his chambers, and might hear testimony from witnesses. If the judge found the value of the evidence outweighs the "danger of unfair prejudice," it would be admissible, the proposed law said. The judge would then lay ground rules for what would be allowed in the courtroom. The author of the proposed 1991 changes is Georgia State University law professor Paul Milich. He declined to comment for this story, but confirmed he did argue in online comments on The AJC's Political Insider, the blog of columnist Jim Galloway, that no one "was remotely suggesting" Georgia weaken or reduce its protections for rape victims. The proposal actually strengthened protections for them. Milich said that the changes would have broadened the shield to cover all sex assault victims, not just rape victims. This is argument is technically correct, but has its limits. By 1991, judges had already ruled the law applied to victims of other sex crimes, according to case law. Milich also noted that Barnes was on the state Bar's Evidence Study Committee, which would have had to review the proposal before the Bar backed it. The Bar confirmed that both Deal and Barnes were part of that committee, but said they do not keep records on its votes. We asked Deal's camp and others for evidence Barnes voted in favor of the law, but they did not provide it. Barnes said through a spokeswoman that he doesn't recall attending meetings of the group. Third, Milich said his version of the law would require a judge to evaluate whether to admit the victim's sexual past based on a strict standard. It's correct that the proposal would require a judge weigh the "danger of unfair prejudice" against the victim against the value of the evidence. That standard was absent from Georgia's existing statute. Still, it remains that if Deal's bill passed, because of the additional exceptions, defense attorneys would gain new opportunities to enter an accuser's sexual past into evidence. So Deal did push for a bill that would give the defense more options. But did he actually fight to weaken the rape shield law, as the Barnes ad said? Deal said he was actually trying to make the rape shield law conform to federal standards and strengthen it against possible constitutional challenges. But these defenses have serious weaknesses. Georgia's rape shield law did not face a clear threat of being overturned by a constitutional challenge. By 1991, the rape shield law was 15 years old and had withstood a constitutional challenge in state Supreme Court. There has been no successful challenge since. That spring, the U.S. Supreme Court made its first ruling on a rape shield law, and upheld it. Furthermore, Deal's proposed revisions fell short of conforming to 1991 federal standards. They would have given defense attorneys more leeway than those rules allowed. Under federal rules, defense attorneys had to warn prosecutors and the accuser 15 days before trial if they planned to present evidence about the victim's sexual past. Deal's proposal didn't require this advanced warning. Also, federal rules list only semen and injury as the kinds of physical evidence that could open a victim's sexual past to being entered as evidence. Deal's law added pregnancy, disease, "or other physical evidence" to the list. So what does all this mean? Barnes' claim is correct, but it leaves out important details. Because Barnes's ad is so incendiary it's important to note that we have no proof that Deal's effort came from anything but out of concern for the rights of the accused. While in hindsight there was no looming threat that the rape shield would fall to a constitutional challenge, there were concerns at the time that rape shield laws in general may not be fair. And while the proposed law would have opened more opportunities for the defense to question an accuser on his or her past sexual behavior, it did include a process to prevent it from becoming a free-for-all for the defense. It's also important to note that this debate took place nearly 20 years ago, not recently. A more balanced way to put it is this: Deal started by leading a fight to overhaul the state's rules of evidence. This included making changes to the rape shield that gave the defense leeway that didn't exist in state law or federal rules. Legislators, prosecutors and victims advocates gave Deal fair warning that they would wage war if he didn't back off. Still, Deal pursued the change until public protest reached a fevered pitch. And while he didn't fight to help rapists or hurt victims, he invested his political capital as second-in-command in the state Senate on behalf of a law that weakened the rape shield act. Statements that are accurate but leave out important details or take things out of context meet the Truth-O-Meter's definition of Half True. That's what we rule.

pomt-07557	PolitiFact Wisconsin "concluded that the charge that Justice Prosser prejudges matters that come before the court is True."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/01/joanne-kloppenburg/supreme-court-candidate-joanne-kloppenburg-says-po/	At a candidate forum a week before the April 5, 2011, Wisconsin Supreme Court election, Justice David Prosser cited an article that PolitiFact Wisconsin did about a claim made by his opponent, assistant state attorney general JoAnne Kloppenburg. Kloppenburg had claimed that Prosser prejudged matters likely to come before the court. That’s a serious accusation, given that the Wisconsin Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judicial candidates from making statements that commit them regarding "cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court." Prosser correctly stated at the March 29, 2011, forum, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Milwaukee, that Kloppenburg’s campaign provided to us no examples of prejudging to back her claim. A few minutes later, Kloppenburg responded: "Well, I’d like to note first that the PolitiFact concluded that the charge that Justice Prosser prejudges matters that come before the court is true." Really? Sometimes our memories fail us here. But we remember our article about Kloppenburg’s prejudging claim. It was published just two days before the forum was held. This was our conclusion: "The statements cited by Kloppenburg indicate Prosser is politically conservative, has views similar to (Gov. Scott Walker) and GOP leaders in the Legislature, and that his re-election would maintain a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The fact that Prosser disavowed one statement, about his being a ‘complement’ to Walker and other GOP leaders, indicates he had concern about signaling how he might rule on cases. "But Kloppenburg didn’t accuse Prosser of giving signals. She said he had ‘prejudged matters that are likely to come before the court.’ Yet she could provide no examples. "We rate Kloppenburg’s claim Barely True." We asked Kloppenburg’s campaign spokeswoman, Melissa Mulliken, why Kloppenburg said we rated her claim True. "There’s True and there’s False," Mulliken said. "You rated it True." Actually, there aren’t two, but rather six possible ratings on the Truth-O-Meter. Barely True, which is what we concluded about Kloppenburg’s prejudging claim, is a statement that "contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That’s a long way from True, which means a statement "is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing." At the opposite end of the meter from True is Pants on Fire, for a statement that is ridiculously false. And Pants on Fire is what Kloppenburg gets for her claim about our earlier ruling.

pomt-06844	"Rick Perry ended full-day Pre-K for 100,000 Texas children."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/aug/05/progress-texas/liberal-group-says-rick-perry-ended-pre-k-100000-c/	On a website devoted to criticizing Gov. Rick Perry, liberal advocacy group Progress Texas rotates about 50 Twitter-ready statements on Perry’s "accomplishments" during his nearly 30 years in state office. Among those drawing our attention: "Rick Perry ended full-day Pre-K for 100,000 Texas children." Really? To support its claim, Progress Texas pointed us to a May 28 report on the 2012-13 state budget bill, which the Republican-controlled Legislature wrote during this year's session and Perry later signed. The report was written by the Legislative Study Group, a caucus of the Texas House whose staff analyzes legislation for its one Republican and 48 Democratic members. The state's leaders, who began the 2011 session facing a projected state revenue shortfall of more than $20 billion, balanced the two-year budget without raising taxes and partly by cutting expenditures. The $172 billion budget spends 8 percent less in state and federal money than the current one. The legislative group's report notes in a section on the Texas Education Agency that the adopted budget lacks funding for the state’s Prekindergarten Early Start grant program, which began in 1999. In contrast, the current two-year budget included about $200 million for the grants, which school districts could use to improve their prekindergarten programs. Some background: The state provides funding through the Foundation School Program for districts to offer a half-day of prekindergarten for eligible children: those who do not speak English, are from low-income or military families, have ever been or are currently in foster care, or are homeless. (The 2012-13 budget maintains that aid.) In the past, if a district wanted to expand its half-day program to a full day, it could apply for an Early Start grant and use that money, among other funding sources, to do so. Gina Day, a TEA deputy associate commissioner, told us that most grant recipients used their awards to pay for the expansion to full-day prekindergarten. Last school year, 351 of the state’s more than 1,000 districts fielded the grants, which served 101,000 children, according to the TEA. We asked Day whether the elimination of the Early Start grants "ended full-day pre-K for 100,000 Texas children," as Progress Texas says. Day said it would be more accurate to say the move ended state support for full-day pre-K. That’s because some districts, rather than scaling back prekindergarten offerings to a half day, decided to keep their full-day programs going. We touched base with the four districts that received the most Early Start grant money during the last school year. None plans to end full-day pre-K. In the Houston school district, which received $5 million in grant money in the 2010-11 school year, spokesman Jason Spencer told us that federal aid and cuts in other areas will help keep its full-day program going. Spencer said that the district had 16,847 students in its full-day pre-K program last year and that about 6,600 were served by the grant. In Dallas, Beth Steerman, director of early childhood education, told us that the district used its $5 million in Early Start money to provide full-day pre-K for about 3,100 children. Facing the loss of the grant funding, the district considered cutting its full-day classes back to a half day, Steerman said. However, its board decided to use local money not only to maintain the district’s full-day classes but also to expand all its half-day classes to full day. The Austin district received the second-highest amount of pre-K Early Start money last school year ($4.6 million). Jacquie Porter, director of early childhood education, told us that the grant funds paid for all of the district’s 5,200 pre-K students to have a full day of class. In the 2011-12 school year, she said, the district plans to use federal and local money to keep full-day classes. Also, the district for the first time will allow children who don’t qualify for free pre-K to pay tuition to attend, and that money will help finance full-day pre-K, Porter said. The Fort Worth district is financing its full-day program with a mix of local and federal funds, according to Patricia Rangel, director of early childhood education. Rangel said in 2010-11, the district’s $4.2 million in grant funds served about 4,400 pre-K students. On June 21, the Texas Tribune reported that the Pharr-San Juan-Alamo district in the Rio Grande Valley, which received about $3 million in grant money last school year, had decided to make cuts in other spending areas so it could continue to offer full-day prekindergarten. Superintendent Daniel King told us that the state grant money paid for about 1,000 of the district’s pre-K students to attend for the full day. The TEA's Day said the agency doesn't know how many school districts are planning to reduce their full-day pre-K programs to a half day as a result of the elimination of the state grant program. She said the agency doesn't collect that information. To get a snapshot sense of how districts are handling the end of the grants, we asked Kara Johnson, president of the Texas Early Childhood Education Coalition, whether she knew of districts cutting their programs from full- to half-day as a result. Of the 12 districts she sent in a list to us, we confirmed that six are scaling back at least in part because of the loss of grant funding. Four of the districts are in Central Texas — Temple, Smithville, Giddings and Del Valle. Two, Winona and Westwood, are in East Texas. Last school year, Temple had about 620 students in its full-day pre-K program while the other five had a total of about 450. We circled back to Progress Texas, explaining our findings. Its executive director, Matt Glazer, stressed that to craft the statements for the group’s anti-Perry site, complex ideas had to be boiled down into 140 characters or less so they could be sent out via Twitter. He said the pre-K statement was written to show that Perry’s decision to sign the budget legislation would have an effect on children who normally benefit from the state grant support and that budget cuts like the loss of the pre-K grants "pass the buck" to local districts. So, where does that leave us? All in all, we see flaws in Progress Texas' statement. First, the loss of Early Start funding doesn't mean districts that previously received grants are eliminating pre-K. The state is continuing its funding of half-day programs for eligible students. Second, the end of the grants — which helped about 100,000 kids attend a full day of pre-K last school year — doesn't mean all grant recipients are cutting back to half a day. Some are, and some are not. Finally, while Perry signed the legislation that ends the grant money, the budget was the handiwork of the Republican-led Legislature. He didn't stop the grants by himself. We rate Progress Texas' statement Mostly False.	None	Progress Texas	None	None	None	2011-08-05T06:00:00	2011-07-05	['Texas', 'Rick_Perry']

We decided to turn to the Flip-O-Meter to determine if the challengers to incumbent Superintendent Tony Evers -- a Common Core supporter -- merit that label. Adopted by many states, the kindergarten-to-12th grade standards were designed as a rigorous national effort that would base teaching on college and job-world needs and allow comparison of U.S. students to their international counterparts. In Wisconsin most school districts, if not all, have adopted Common Core as the standards for English and math, said Thomas McCarthy, spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction. The Flip-O-Meter, of course, does not rate whether it’s good policy or politics to switch a position. It simply measures consistency in positions over time. Some argue a change demonstrates an openness to new facts or a willingness to compromise. Others say it is evidence of inconsistent principles or lack of backbone. So, where does Holtz stand? Holtz is a former Wisconsin principal of the year at Peshtigo Elementary School. He served 13 years as a school district administrator in the Palmyra, Beloit and Whitnall districts. He was running Whitnall in 2010 when Evers determined to put Common Core in place in Wisconsin after the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices led the drafting process. In 2012, a CNI NOW newspaper story quoted Holtz saying he supported the standards. Holtz told the publication the standards concentrate on facts as related to real life rather than the traditional straight ahead factual approach. In 2013, the same publication quoted Holtz this way: "The change is absolutely in the best interests of the kids of Wisconsin. Raising the bar will make our kids more competitive not only at the state level but at the national level." He called it a "fun, exciting time to be involved in education." By July 2016, when he announced his bid, it was clear Holtz was taking a different tack. He stressed local control and said Common Core was not necessarily effective because each community is different. The Beloit Daily News quoted Holtz as saying the Common Core must be fought. "Happy to be part of a panel discussing Education Reform and the dangers of Common Core," he tweeted in November 2016. Holtz explained the switch in a Feb. 6, 2017 blog post about his plan to work with the governor and legislators to wipe out Common Core if elected. State and school leaders, he said, were misled through "high pressure marketing" to adopt Common Core at the risk of politicizing curriculum decisions. His new position won support from conservatives including former state Rep. Don Pridemore, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully in 2013 for state school superintendent. "Dr. Holtz will fight for local control and against Federal takeover programs like Common Core," Pridemore is quoted on Holtz’s campaign web site. Holtz campaign spokesman Brit Schiel acknowledged that Holtz’s position has changed. He said it had evolved in line with Gov. Scott Walker’s. In January 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated as a Half Flip Gov. Scott Walker’s change in position to oppose Common Core. During most of his first term, the governor showed tacit support. By mid-2013, he was hitting the pause button on further implementation of the standards. In mid-2014, Walker called for an outright repeal. But by January 2015, he was saying only that he didn’t want school districts required to use Common Core. Holtz, Schiel said, "grew uncomfortable with Common Core’s inefficiencies, its one-size-fits-all approach to education, and the fact that the standards were coming from Washington, not from the local school boards." Our rating Holtz definitely was for Common Core before he was against it. The change is stark. This major reversal of position merits a Full Flop.

pomt-06996	"In our proposal, we would have expanded school aid across the board … Governor Christie slashed school aid in this budget, preferring instead to extend a tax break for millionaires over funding in the classroom."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/11/jim-whelan/state-sen-jim-whelan-says-gov-chris-christie-slash/	Gov. Chris Christie recently wielded his veto pen to wipe out more than $900 million in spending passed in the state Legislature’s budget. A flood of press releases from Democrats condemning the governor’s cuts followed. And state Sen. Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) was among those expressing disapproval. "In our proposal, we would have expanded school aid across the board and finally realized the promise of the 2008 school funding reform act by fully funding all schools – urban, rural and suburban. Governor Christie slashed school aid in this budget, preferring instead to extend a tax break for millionaires over funding in the classroom," Whelan said in a July 5 news release. But Christie claimed otherwise. "This budget is not only constitutionally balanced, but represents my commitment to education," the governor said in a June 30 news release. "This year’s budget managed to increase funding by $850 million and does so in a fiscally prudent budget." So, who’s right? They both are. Whelan's statement was included in a news release about the governor's line item vetoes of the Democrats' budget proposal and Whelan confirmed to PolitiFact New Jersey that his statement was about the governor’s reductions from the Democrats’ budget. In that case, Whelan is correct: the governor did cut state aid for schools from the budget approved by the Legislature. But year over year, Christie increased overall funding for schools. Let’s break it down. The governor always fires the first shot in the state’s budget war. In Christie’s February proposal, state aid to school districts was increased by about $250 million over last year’s budget. Then, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered another $500 million in state aid go to 31 urban school systems, the so-called Abbott districts. When Democrats unveiled their budget for Fiscal Year 2012 late last month, an additional $1.1 billion in state aid for schools had been added over the governor’s proposed budget. They also put another $412 million in state aid for non-Abbott districts in a separate bill that would have been enacted only if an income tax rate increase was approved for individuals earning more than $1 million. Christie vetoed both measures. The increases in the Democrats’ spending plan also did not withstand Christie’s veto pen. The governor cut nearly $500 million in state education aid from the Legislature’s budget. However, he left in more than $446 million in funding that will go to Abbott districts per the court order and another $167 million for other districts. That aid, as well as the $250 million in the governor’s original budget proposal that went untouched, equals about $863 million. So, year over year, funding for schools increased. Whelan recognized this when PolitiFact New Jersey spoke with him. "There’s more school aid than last year," he said, but argued that the aid still didn’t fully fund all districts. As a spokesman for the Senate Democrats put it: the year over year increase "only tells a partial story, as the only districts being made whole are the Abbotts." State Treasury Department spokesman Andrew Pratt said, "Everyone would like to see more aid for schools, however there’s a limit to what we can spend." Let’s briefly touch on the second part of Whelan’s statement, which said Christie made the cuts in state aid for schools, "preferring instead to extend a tax break for millionaires over funding in the classroom." Christie vetoed a bill that would have raised the income tax on individuals with incomes over $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent for two years. But is vetoing a tax increase a tax break? PolitiFact New Jersey tackled this issue before and rated it half true. Let’s recap. Whelan said, "Governor Christie slashed school aid in this budget" and Christie did cut funds from the Legislature's proposal. And although Christie slashed school aid in his first year as governor, he in fact increased school aid year over year from Fiscal Year 2011 to Fiscal Year 2012. For these reasons, we rate Whelan’s statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Jim Whelan	None	None	None	2011-07-11T05:15:00	2011-07-05	['None']

pomt-04930	FCAT tests "account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/30/gerard-robinson/florida-education-commissioner-says-fcats-equal-le/	The perennial cry from parents and teachers who criticize the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test is that students are spending too much time on those tests. And that cry grew louder when the state announced that FCAT scores plunged in 2012 after a revamping of the test. Students take the high-stakes exam for math, reading and other subjects in grades 3 through 10. Third-graders who get low scores are at risk of being held back. Students ultimately must pass the FCAT -- or earn an equivalent score on the SAT or ACT -- to graduate with a standard diploma. Gov. Rick Scott said in July that it’s time to take a second look at the FCAT after the state has received so many complaints from parents about the tests. Scott told a conference of newspaper editors that between the FCAT and other tests, students may be tested too much. Scott’s education commissioner appointee, Gerard Robinson, has been playing defense about the FCAT since the state announced earlier this year that a new grading formula would result in a drop in school grades. Statewide, the percentage of A schools dropped from 58 to 48 percent. Reflecting a backlash against testing, more than a dozen individual school boards in the state, including Broward and Palm Beach, have passed a resolution against the FCAT. The Florida School Boards Association passed its own version of a resolution criticizing the FCAT in June. Robinson penned a June 15 response, which included these comments: "The FCAT neither drives the curriculum nor narrows the educational experience of Florida students. ... These assessments average two to three per student per school year and account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year. ... It is worth noting that local school boards require students to take many more assessments than those required by the state." There are a few interesting claims in Robinson’s statement, but the one that caught our eye was that tiny figure: The FCAT accounts for "less than 1 percent of instructional time." Heck, we wonder if lunch or recess could add up to more than 1 percent. So we decided to research whether Robinson’s 1 percent claim was correct. The Education Department’s explanation Robinson’s chief of staff John Newman told us in a July 19 interview that the education department staff pulled together figures for Robinson about a month ago in response to the public’s concerns about the amount of time spent on the FCAT. He sent us a copy of an excel spreadsheet showing how much time is spent taking the test. This refers only to the minutes to take that exam -- not the amount of time spent preparing for it during regular school hours or after-hour extra sessions that some students participate in. By dividing the number of minutes spent on the FCAT by the number of minutes in a school year (54,000 minutes based on 900 minimum hours of school instruction a year), the education department determined that students spend anywhere from .26 to .90 percent of their time taking the test. But Robinson used the phrase "instructional time" in his claim, which could fairly be interpreted to mean classroom time spent preparing for the test. School districts aren’t required to track how much time they spend preparing students for the test. For example, multiplication and division are included on the FCAT for certain grade levels, but math teachers don’t have to document how many minutes the class spent on multiplication versus division. And an English teacher doesn’t have to document how many minutes are related to reading comprehension portions of the FCAT. That’s why determining how much time is spent "teaching to the test" is somewhat subjective. "I guess you could say the whole year is test prep," Newman, Robinson’s chief of staff, told PolitiFact. We asked Newman: Why is it valid to only look at the minutes spent actually taking the test and not factor in how much time is spent preparing for the test? He said it’s up to the school districts to determine how to teach those standards that are assessed on the FCAT -- and those methods can vary from school to school. "If they choose to do that sitting there drilling practice tests all day, that’s their choice," Newman said. A state law says that schools can’t suspend "a regular program of curricula for purposes of administering practice tests or engaging in other test-preparation activities for a statewide assessment." But the law also says that schools can administer sample tests, teach test-taking strategies and teach the skills that will be assessed. What educators say We asked a few Florida teachers how much "instructional time" they spend on the FCAT. Our teachers from Miami-Dade included Alexandria Martin, an English teacher at Carol City High School, Whitson Carter, a math teacher at Filer Middle School, and Cassandra Harley, a third-grade teacher at North Beach Elementary School. In Broward we interviewed Angel Welsh, who teaches sixth-grade language arts at Nova. All three of our Dade teachers said that FCAT preparation accounts for the majority of their school year -- or at least through the dates in the spring when the students take the FCAT. Students take practice tests at certain points during the year so schools can measure their progress toward the FCAT and prepare students to take timed tests. And FCAT prep isn’t limited to school hours -- districts have the option of adding extra help before or after school or on the weekends. "The tests are always on the forefront of teachers’ minds, students’ minds," said Martin, who has taught for seven years. Throughout the year, teachers have benchmarks to prepare students for the FCAT. So if Martin’s class is reading Othello, she makes sure they understand vocabulary, the author’s purpose, and reference and research skills. "Hopefully I am preparing them for the real world, but the test is always at the forefront," she said. Welsh, who has taught for 23 years, said that about six weeks before the FCAT she spends about half of each 90-minute period on FCAT preparation. But she also spends time throughout the year on teaching vocabulary and reading comprehension, which is assessed on the FCAT. "I know what I’m going to cover and how I’m going to cover it, with or without FCAT," she said. "I feel good teaching leads to a good FCAT score. … I know (the test) is in my peripheral vision back there. I really try not to let it guide my instruction, but does it sometimes? I’m sure it does." Our ruling Robinson said that the FCAT tests "account for less than 1 percent of the instructional time provided during the year." This was a prepared statement, based on research done by his staff, in response to FCAT critics who say that schools devote too much time to the tests. Readers could assume that by "instructional time" Robinson was including regular lesson time in the classroom preparing for the FCAT. He wasn’t. His office says that referred to the number of minutes taking the test out of the total minutes of instruction per year. But he didn’t provide that explanation in his statement. In reality, there is no clear way to quantify how much time teachers spend preparing students for the test. Some teachers say they spend practically all their time on the FCAT. Robinson’s goal was to deflect criticism that too much time is spent "teaching to the test." He is suggesting that the FCAT eats up only a smidgen of a school year. But for students, parents and teachers who spend months preparing for those tests, Robinson’s words are misleading. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09211	Steve Poizner "increased his department's budget nearly 14 percent."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/20/meg-whitman/whitman-accuses-poizner-14-percent-budget-increase/	The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two frontrunners for the GOP nomination. One recurring theme in numerous Whitman ads is that Poizner presided over a big increase in the insurance department budget. The implication was that his fiscal skills aren't up to the task of easing the state's deep budget crisis -- an argument especially potent for many in the Republican base who will be voting in the primary. The charges about Poizner's stewardship of the department are similar, but the particular ad we'll be checking tells viewers that Poizner "increased his department's budget nearly 14 percent." The numbers we found do not support that claim. Poizner was elected to his post in November 2006 and took the reins of his department in January 2007. Given how the California budget works, the last budget completely assembled by his predecessor, John Garamendi, was the 2006-2007 budget. Work on the following fiscal year's budget, for 2007-2008, was begun under Garamendi, but Poizner had a chance to put his stamp on it after he took office. And the budget after that, 2008-2009, was entirely Poizner's. Meanwhile, until July 1 -- the start of the new fiscal year -- we're still in the 2009-2010 fiscal year. This provides us with a wealth of possible data points to compare. Should you use Garamendi's last solo budget as the basis for comparison? Or the budget the two men effectively shared? And at the other end of the comparison, do you use the final year for which we have a "closed-books" number (which would be 2008-2009) or do you use an estimate of the current year's budget, even though the numbers might eventually change due to late revisions? We ran all the possible combinations and found that the changes ranged from an increase of three-tenths of a percent to an increase of 9.4 percent. None of them reach 14 percent. So how did the Whitman campaign come up with the 14 percent figure? It started with the 2005-2006 budget year and stopped with the 2008-2009 budget year. Using those years produced an increase of 13.5 percent or, rounding up, 14 percent. While one can make a case for using the end date of 2008-2009 (that's the last closed-books year), it doesn't make sense at all to begin the calculation with 2005-2006. The budget increase that occurred between 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 was entirley under Garamendi's control, not Poizner's. The Poizner camp points out another factor. A portion of the insurance department's budget consists of funds for local law enforcement to pursue insurance fraud. These funds are determined by a formula, and Poizner has no control over them. We also ran the numbers for the remainder -- essentially, the department's operating budget -- and found that the changes ranged from a 6.2 percent increase to a 7.3 percent decrease. Once again, none was close to 14 percent. A final point: Poizner's department is not funded by general revenues, but rather by fees and penalties imposed on the insurance industry. So the money doesn't exactly revert back to taxpayers if it isn't spent. Nor, for that matter, does it go back to the insurance companies. Rather, it goes back into the insurance fund as reserves that can be spent in the future. We won't go so far as to confirm that Poizner actually presided over a shrinking budget, as his camp has claimed. Even if you just stick to the more limited operating budget under his control, there are credible ways to come up with a modest increase, just as there are ways to come up with a decrease. We also won't wade into the question -- tussled over by the two camps -- of whether Poizner or Schwarzenegger should get the credit for the department's budgetary reductions in the past year or two, since that's not relevant to the specific claim we're addressing here. What is clear to us is that no plausible calculation approaches the 14 percent figure that Whitman has cited repeatedly in her ads. So we rule her claim False.

pomt-14687	Until the new Iran deal, China and Russia "have never voted with us at the U.N. on any sanctions on Iran in the past."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/13/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-until-iran-deal-russian-and-china-had/	House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., deflected criticism about the Obama administration's deal with Iran following the temporary detention of 10 Navy sailors by Iran, saying that the biggest threat posed by that country was a possibility of a nuclear weapon and "we have taken them off that course." "Global security has been served by the Iranian treaty," she said in the Jan 13 interview with CNN. "It is quite remarkable. In fact, since you are asking more about it, it is a masterful work on the part of President Obama to bring the P-5, Russia, China, into the fold. They have never voted with us at the U.N. on any sanctions on Iran in the past. So from a diplomatic standpoint to get us to this place was masterful." Some readers asked us to check whether Russia and China have never endorsed sanctions against Iran. When we initially contacted Pelosi's office for their evidence, we quickly heard back from her spokesman, Drew Hammill, who said, "The leader misspoke." Russia and China often aren't aligned with the United States' interests, but they have, in fact, joined the United States in endorsing sanctions against Iran at least eight times before the 2015 nuclear deal. We confirmed eight Security Council resolutions threatening, imposing or continiung sanctions against Iran in which Russia and China approved sanctions. The votes date back to July 2006. Five of them were passed before Obama took office in 2009. Acknowledging Pelosi's error, Hammill said in an email that holding together the coalition that resulted in an agreement with Iran "was a very difficult task." "Many times in the recent past, these countries have not supported sanctioning Iran," he said. "Frequently, efforts to sanction Iran were abandoned before a formal vote because any one nation on the UN Security Council has a veto." That may be the case, but Pelosi's statement was absolute: China and Russia "have never voted with us at the U.N. on any sanctions on Iran in the past." That's ridiculously wrong.

Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz., much of the public discussion focused on whether political rhetoric has grown too heated. Giffords is a Democratic representative from a conservative-leaning district. During the 2010 election, Republicans believed Giffords' seat and others like it were likely wins for their party. Republican Sarah Palin included the district on a map that put the crosshairs of a gun sight over selected districts held by Democrats. Back in March, Giffords herself said in an interview that political rhetoric was growing too heated, and specifically mentioned the map. "For example, we're on Sarah Palin's targeted list. But the thing is, the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize there's consequences to that action." (A Palin spokeswoman said they were surveyors marks, not crosshairs.) To be clear, there's no evidence so far that shooter, Jared Loughner, was involved in politics or even saw the map. Still, some have criticized Palin the wake of the Tuscon shooting for using gun imagery regularly in her public comments. Several days later, on Jan. 12, 2011, Palin responded to the criticism with a video statement posted to her Facebook account. "Like millions of Americans I learned of the tragic events in Arizona on Saturday, and my heart broke for the innocent victims. No words can fill the hole left by the death of an innocent, but we do mourn for the victims' families as we express our sympathy," Palin said in her statement. But Palin also rejected those who would blame her. "Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own," Palin said. "They begin and end with the criminals who commit them, not collectively with all the citizens of a state, not with those who listen to talk radio, not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle, not with law-abiding citizens who respectfully exercise their First Amendment rights at campaign rallies, not with those who proudly voted in the last election." She added that "journalists and pundits" were manufacturing a "blood libel" that political rhetoric somehow played a part in the shooting. Palin then noted that she has publicly condemned violence. "As I said while campaigning for others last March in Arizona during a very heated primary race, 'We know violence isn't the answer. When we "take up our arms", we're talking about our vote.' Yes, our debates are full of passion, but we settle our political differences respectfully at the ballot box – as we did just two months ago, and as our Republic enables us to do again in the next election, and the next," Palin said. We wanted to know the context of her comments and if Palin was giving an accurate rendering of them. We found that Palin was referring to comments she made at a campaign stop with Sen. John McCain in Tuscon. Palin was supporting McCain, who was facing a primary challenge from J.D. Hayworth. "And hearing the news reports lately, kind of this ginned up controversy about us common-sense conservatives inciting violence because we happen to oppose some of the things in the Obama administration," Palin said. "We know violence isn't the answer. When we take up our arms, we are talking about our vote. We're talking about being involved in a contested primary like this and picking the right candidate, too, John McCain. We thank you for that. But this BS coming from the 'lame stream media' about us inciting violence -- don't let the conversation be diverted. Don't let a distraction like that get you off track. Keep fighting hard for these candidates who are all about the common-sense conservative solutions that we need." Palin said that back in March she condemned violence and said, "We know violence isn't the answer. When we 'take up our arms', we're talking about our vote." We checked the transcript and found that was the case. We rate her statement True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2011-01-12T11:52:22	2011-01-12	['Arizona']

pomt-14033	Says the Human Rights Campaign is secretly funded	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/may/27/pat-mccrory/gov-pat-mccrory-wrongly-says-we-dont-know-who-fund/	One of Gov. Pat McCrory’s talking points during his many interviews on HB2, the controversial new state law, is that the pro-LGBT group Human Rights Campaign is an immensely powerful group that’s stifling debate. On May 24 his campaign sent out a mass email with a link to a radio interview he had done that morning, asking people to listen. So we did, and a minute in, we heard the familiar refrain. The Human Rights Campaign "is probably the most powerful special interest group out of Washington, D.C.," McCrory said in the interview, with Charlotte station WBT. "And it's funded – their funders? We don't know who funds them, but they have about $32 million a year." We previously rated False his claim that the group is more powerful than the National Rifle Association. For this fact check, however, we were intrigued by McCrory’s claim that "we don’t know who funds them." This interview wasn’t the first time McCrory has made a statement like that, so we figured we ought to look into it. Political nonprofits known as 501(c)(4) groups, like the HRC, are not required to disclose their donors. But the HRC does so voluntarily, at least for its large corporate donors. That’s the first crack in McCrory’s argument. The Human Rights Campaign files public Form 990 tax records each year, said spokesman Brandon Lorenz. That’s good; doing otherwise would be unlawful. "Additionally, we voluntarily and proudly annually publish a list of our major donors in Equality Magazine, our quarterly magazine that both lives online and is mailed to approximately 350,000 homes," Lorenz said. That is also true. The magazine lists dozens of major sponsors, although it doesn’t say how much they gave to reach the various levels of sponsorship, which are bronze, silver, gold and platinum. We reached out to McCrory’s campaign with this information and asked if there was anything we were missing or misunderstanding about his claim, but we never heard back. In total, the Spring 2016 issue of Equality Magazine lists 47 "corporate partners" and 32 "foundation partners." Some show up in both lists, like Microsoft and Nike, while others only show up in one. The corporate donors contributed toward the group’s total revenues, which tax records show was $37.4 million for the year between April 2014 and March 2015 – actually a bit higher than what McCrory said in the interview. The list of partners reveals a menagerie of supporters: Banking, pharmaceutical, energy and tech giants alongside companies like vodka distiller Ketel One and defense contractor Northrop Grumman. For the full list of corporate sponsors, see page 31 of the print magazine’s Spring 2016 edition or page 32-33 in the online magazine. Identifying PAC donors But much of the money donated to the nonprofit as a whole can go to more mundane expenses like salaries, rent, travel and educational initiatives. What about the explicitly political giving? In 2016 so far, the group’s PAC and super PAC – which are used to give directly to candidates or purchase ads – have raised a combined $1.37 million. And for that money, we know not only the names of every major donor but also how much they gave, where they live and what they do. It’s all listed in publicly available Federal Election Commission reports, which are helpfully aggregated by the Center for Responsive Politics at www.opensecrets.org. Of the 10 largest individual donations to the group’s PAC, called Human Rights Campaign 2016, three were from North Carolina residents. The names, occupations, hometowns, dates and giving amounts of anyone who donated more than $200 are listed. So far, there have been 396 such donations – but 70 percent of the PAC’s $1,052,936 was donated in increments of less than $200, from donors who are not required to be identified, and whom the HRC does not identify voluntarily. As for the super PAC, called Human Rights Campaign Equality Votes 2016, the group lists 265 donations of more than $200 this election cycle. Unlike the PAC, these large donations accounted for the majority of the $316,154 donated to the super PAC. One notable donation was the $1,000 from Robert Williams, co-owner of the North Carolina design company Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, which is itself a platinum-level corporate sponsor of the HRC. There was also $2,500 from Joni Madison, who recently left the Durham ad agency McKinney to become the HRC’s chief operations officer. Combined, all these publicly listed donations from North Carolina and elsewhere add up to more than $500,000 out of the total $1.37 million raised by the PAC and Super PAC. Our ruling McCrory is clearly wrong that "We don't know who funds them." In the case of the group’s overall budget, we know the name of 47 corporations who are major contributors, ranging from Nationwide Insurance to Starbucks. We don’t know much they gave, but we can at least see how they stack up in a tiered sponsorship system. In the case of the purely political donations, we don’t know the identity of the majority of the donors, who gave in small amounts. But an easy search of public data shows hundreds of people, from business owners and activists to farmers and dentists, who gave more than $200 to the group’s PAC and Super PAC, along with how much they gave. The Human Rights Campaign is not fully transparent, but it’s more transparent than other so-called dark money groups. We rate this claim Mostly False. Update: This article has been updated to include the correct spelling for Brandon Lorenz. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/560d842a-f632-44f2-b254-d57d393ed278	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-05-27T19:30:29	2016-05-24	['None']

pomt-01929	After Massachusetts passed a mandatory health insurance law "their mortality rate went down...it saved lives."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/27/dave-marsden/marsden-says-massachusetts-health-reforms-lowered-/	State Sen. Dave Marsden says expanding Medicaid in Virginia will save lives. And he points to Massachusetts’ experience as proof. "When Massachusetts got health care, their mortality rate went down either 2.9 or 3.9 percent -- whatever -- but it saved lives," Marsden, D-Fairfax, said during a June 18 radio interview. Marsden’s comments, made on the John Fredericks Show, came amid fiery partisan debate over whether to expand Medicaid eligibility to as many as 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Uncle Sam would pay the entire tab through 2016 and 90 percent of added cost down the road. On June 12, the Republican-led General Assembly passed a two-year state budget designed to close Democratic routes toward expansion. We found Marsden’s comment interesting and wondered whether whether the death rate in Massachusetts really did fall by at least 2.9 percent after then-Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, signed a health reform bill in 2006 that expanded Medicaid and mandated individual health care coverage. Brent McKenzie, Marsden’s legislative assistant, said the statement was based on a study by the Harvard School of Public Health that was published in May 2014 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers examined the death rates in Massachusetts counties before and after the reforms were enacted, looking at the periods from 2001-2005 and 2007-2010. They concluded that the death rate per 100,000 people aged 20 to 64 dropped dropped 3.2 percent during the years after the reforms. The data was compared to statistics of people in the same age group from 531 counties in 46 states that had not undergone coverage expansions. The researchers concluded that the decline in Massachusetts was 2.9 percent greater than the average of the U.S. counties that had not expanded coverage. "What we found in Massachusetts after reform was a significant reduction in deaths from the kinds of illnesses where we expect health care to have the biggest impact, including infections, cancer and cardiovascular disease," Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor of health policy at Harvard and a report co-author, said in a news release announcing the results. The study also found the largest death rate drops occurred in Massachusetts counties that had low insurance coverage prior to the reforms. A key advantage of the Harvard study was its size -- examining an estimated 270,000 Massachusetts adults gained insurance through the reform. Although the study found a correlation between health care coverage and lower death rates, there’s on-going debate over whether the reforms caused that result. The Harvard School of Public Health report estimated that state’s mandatory insurance laws prevented about 320 deaths a year. But researchers cautioned that they couldn’t definitively "establish cause and effect" between the lowered death rate and the reforms. They also noted that the results in Massachusetts "may not generalize to other states." "We find significant reduction in mortality among nonelderly adults in Massachusetts since its 2006 reform relative to a control group in counties of similar counties in states without such reforms," the report says. "Although this analysis cannot demonstrate causality, the results offer suggestive evidence that the Affordable Care Act -- modeled after the Massachusetts law -- may impact not only coverage and access but also mortality." An article in the New York Times said health economists viewed the report as strong evidence that the Massachusetts’ health care overhaul had saved lives, but noted experts also said the study "will not settle the long-debated question on whether being insured prolongs life." Some analysts quoted in The Times and in a Boston Globe article said the results add to a body of research showing health care coverage extends lives. But skeptics questioned whether the death rate drop found in the study would occur so quickly after the Massachusetts reforms took root. The Harvard report notes other studies have looked at the effect of health insurance on mortality and the results have been mixed. A 2012 report in the New England Journal of Medicine found that several states that expanded their Medicaid eligibility programs before Obamacare passed in 2010 saw "significant decreases in mortality." The researchers noted, however, that they "cannot definitively show causality." In contrast, a 2011 study of Medicaid expansion in Oregon did not find a link between health insurance and death rates. A 2013 follow-up study found that the state’s Medicaid expansion led to better mental health and lower financial strain among beneficiaries, but researchers did not find improvement in important physical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Our ruling Marsden said that after Massachusetts enacted its sweeping health care reform in 2006, its mortality rate dropped by at least 2.9 percent, "saving lives." His statement correctly summarizes a recent study finding the state’s death rate dropped by 3.2 percent among 20-64 year-olds. The decline was 2.9 percent greater than the average of a comparison group of 531 counties across the nation. But Marsden reaches a little when he says the results proved the health reforms "saved lives." Researchers believe that’s the case, but caution they could not establish a "cause and effect" between the lowered death rate and the health reforms. So Marsden’s statement is accurate, but needs a little clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Dave Marsden	None	None	None	2014-06-27T10:41:21	2014-06-14	['Massachusetts']
pomt-04322	Says Multnomah County libraries "are open 44 hours per week … the lowest of any library in the four-county region."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/26/libraries-yes-committee/are-multnomah-county-librarys-hours-shortest-area/	Supporters of a new Multnomah County Library District say a new tax structure is necessary for keeping one of the nation’s busiest libraries "working for all of us." In a mailer, the Libraries Yes! Committee paints an already dim picture of the system. The mailer notes reduced hours and compares them to other metro-area counties: "Right now, our libraries are open 44 hours per week, down from 57 hours just a few years ago. That’s the lowest of any library in the four-county region." PolitiFact Oregon was well aware that the system has cut back in certain areas, but it surprised us that the cuts had gone so far as to put operating hours behind Clackamas, Washington and Clark counties. We thought a quick check was warranted -- and quick it was. We checked the website for each of the counties’ libraries and calculated the weekly operating hours for the main branches. Here’s what we found. In Multnomah County, the Central Library is open 44 hours each week. In Washington County, the Hillsboro Main Library is open 64 hours each weekand the Beaverton City Library is open 63 hours. In Clackamas County, the library system is open 52 hours a week. And up in Washington’s Clark County, the main Vancouver Community Library is open 60 hours a week. We also called the group responsible for the mailer and asked them about the statement. They sent us a slightly different group of numbers -- the average number of hours a library was open in each county. Their findings supported the same conclusion: Multnomah County library hours are the lowest in the four-county region. We find this statement True.	None	Libraries Yes!

pomt-13605	"The Pentagon itself says that we could eliminate 20 percent of U.S. bases."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/15/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-said-pentagon-has-endorsed-eliminatin/	When it comes to saving money in the federal budget, presidential candidates are often long on generalities and short on specifics. But libertarian candidate Gary Johnson offered a few specifics when interviewed Aug. 11 on Fox News. "Bill Weld (Johnson's vice presidential candidate) and I are pledging in our first 100 days to submit a balanced budget to Congress," he said. "That has to include the entitlements — reform to the entitlements, Medicaid and Medicare, ensuring that there still is a safety net. It would be reforming Social Security, not cutting Social Security, but raising the retirement age. You could have a very fair means-testing when it comes to Social Security." Then Johnson turned to military spending, saying, "The Pentagon itself says that we could reduce U.S. bases by 20 percent, and yet there's not the political will to do that. Our heads are in the sand over all of this, while there's a fiscal crisis out there looming if we don't cut spending to go along with the equation." He repeated the point about military installations less than a minute later: "The Pentagon itself says that we could eliminate 20 percent of U.S. bases." We wondered if Johnson's base statistic was correct. We found a more complicated situation than Johnson suggested, with cost-savings slow in coming. When we asked the Johnson campaign about it, they sent us links to two articles, one from Defense News, the other from Military Times. Both detail the results of a Pentagon report which looked at 251 military installations but did not recommend cutting 20 percent of them. Instead, the report said the bases have, in total, 22 percent more installation space and infrastructure than the military will need, based on force levels projected for 2019. That could mean getting rid of a lot of small bases, or a few large ones, once operations are consolidated. For example, the report said that, overall, the Army has a 29 percent excess in administrative space, the Marine Corps has 27 percent more base acreage than it needs, and the Air Force has 24 percent more space than required for parking Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard planes. Exactly where the cuts would be made and where the consolidations occur could be determined by a bipartisan commission known as the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission, which would come up with a comprehensive plan. Or the Pentagon could act on its own. In either case, such decisions are politically volatile because no member of Congress wants an installation closed in their district. The BRAC process is intended to ensure closures are made based on the merits, not on political influence. Two more things are important to note. Although the Pentagon report is saying that it has 22 percent more base capacity than it needs, that doesn't mean it wants to reduce its capacity by the full amount, which could could hamper the military's flexibility. A BRAC review "is not designed to eliminate all excess," the report cautions. "The focus of every BRAC round is to reduce excess where needed in balance with the need to have room for changed missions, tactics, and technology while enhancing military value and achieving recurring savings." Second, even if there was a 22 percent reduction in capacity, that wouldn't guarantee a savings of 22 percent. Historically, in the short run, the cutbacks actually cost more more than they save because of consolidation and other costs. The report estimates that if the military initiated a BRAC and trimmed its military base costs, it would cost an extra $7 million over six years to implement. After that, the military would be saving $2 billion annually. Yet those estimates need to be regarded with skepticism. The last BRAC was done in 2005. It closed 24 bases, changed operations in 24 others and eliminated roughly 12,000 civilian jobs. As PolitiFact reported last year, it was supposed to save $3.9 billion a year. But because it cost $35.1 billion to implement (the original estimate was $21 billion) actual savings won't begin to accrue until 2018, five years later than originally projected. Our ruling Johnson said, "The Pentagon itself says that we could eliminate 20 percent of U.S. bases." What the Pentagon actually said was that the Defense Department has 22 percent more installation space and infrastructure than it's going to need in 2019. That's not the same as reducing the number of bases by 20 percent, as Johnson said. Past experience shows that closing bases involves upfront expenses, with savings taking some time to accrue. Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cd11a13e-bf76-4bd7-b0b1-c8abfe690b89	None	Gary Johnson	None	None	None	2016-08-15T17:19:37	2016-08-11	['United_States', 'The_Pentagon']

pomt-13127	Says Donald Trump "doesn't believe in equal pay."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/02/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-doesnt-believe-e/	With just a week before the election, Hillary Clinton reminded Florida voters that Donald Trump has been called out for "demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women." "But I guess the bottom line is, he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man. And I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like," Clinton said in Dade City, one of her three stops in Florida on Nov. 1. "We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and our grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said," Clinton said of Trump. "He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry." That’s a long list. Here, we wanted to know if Trump has taken a position against equal pay. We found that Trump has said various things but at times has said he supports the concept that women and men should make equal pay. Equal pay We’ve detailed key issues about the gender wage gap in our PolitiFact Sheet, but a consistent argument is that women earn 77 cents on the dollar that men earn. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Institute for Policy Women’s Research says discrimination is a big factor for why the gender wage gap still persists. Experts consider "occupational segregation" another reason for the wage gap, which means women more often than men work in jobs that pay low and minimum wages. In her campaign website, Clinton says she will work to close the pay gap and to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill she introduced when she was a senator. Trump’s stance Trump’s campaign website does not include specific policies for how he would handle equal pay concerns if he was elected president. But his campaign refuted Clinton’s claim that Trump doesn’t believe in equal pay. "We support equal pay for equal work and will enforce all statutes against discrimination," Trump’s campaign said in a statement. At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, said that at Trump Organization "women are paid equally for the work that we do." She said her father had made wage equality a practice at his company. "He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him," Trump said. But before the convention, in January, the New York Times reported a former female Iowa field organizer filed a discrimination complaint, saying men at Trump’s campaign doing the same jobs were paid more and were permitted to plan and speak at rallies, but her requests were ignored. Trump told the New York Times the former organizer was a disgruntled employee and that his people told him "she did a terrible job." Factcheck.org in June noted Trump has likened equal pay legislation to socialism, and that performance, not gender, should determine compensation. On Nov. 19, 2015, Trump said: "Here is the problem. If you start getting involved with government on ‘this one gets this pay and this one gets that pay,’ and then you say — ‘Where does it all start?’ Because you could have a woman that’s much better than a man, or you could have a woman that’s not as good as man, if you sort of say, ‘Everybody gets equal pay,’ you get away from the whole American Dream. You get away from capitalism in a sense. "I can tell you, that I have women, honestly that are just, in many cases, they’re better than men, and I pay them more than men. And to a certain extent, people have to go out there, they have to fight for themselves. … I don’t know if people agree with me, once you get where everybody gets the same, I mean, you’re into a socialistic society." In August 2015, Trump said on MSNBC's Morning Joe that if men and women do the same job, they should get the same pay, "but it's very hard to say what is the same job." Clinton’s campaign pointed to another August 2015 interview, in which CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Trump if he would pass equal pay legislation. Trump said he was looking into it "very strongly." "One of the problems you have is you get to have an economy where it's no longer free enterprise economy," Trump said. Trump said he favored the concept, but that it’s "very complicated." "I feel strongly -- the concept of it, I love," Trump said. "I just don't want it to be a negative, where everybody ends up making the same pay. That's not our system. You know, the world, everybody comes in to get a job, they make -- people aren't the same." Our ruling Clinton said Trump "doesn't believe in equal pay." Trump’s campaign website does not have a stipulated stance on equal pay for men and women, but his campaign says he supports "equal pay for equal work." Trump has said men and women doing the same job should get the same pay, but it’s hard to determine what’s "the same job," and that if everybody gets equal pay, "you get away from capitalism in a sense." Trump has also said pay should be based on performance, not gender -- so he does appear to favor uniform payment if performance is alike. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-03368	Paula Deen supported and campaigned for Barack Obama.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/12/larry-elder/claim-deen-backed-obama-lacks-key-ingredients/	The controversy surrounding Southern cuisine queen Paula Deen has been hotter than a pan of bacon grease. Last month Deen confirmed that she testified she had used a racial slur in the past. The testimony was part of a pending racial discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit that a former manager of one of her restaurants filed against Deen and her brother, Earl "Bubba" Hiers. Since the revelation, several companies have cut ties with Deen, including Target, Smithfield Foods and Atlanta-based Home Depot. On the other hand, Deen’s fans have rallied around her, and Deen is still a draw in her hometown of Savannah. To counter critics claiming that Deen is racist, political commentators have noted her supposed support of President Barack Obama. "Did (Deen) refuse to hire blacks? Has she mistreated them or paid them below the wages of white workers?" conservative radio host Larry Elder wrote recently in an op-ed posted on Investors.com (Investors Business Daily). "And, for what it’s worth, Deen supported and campaigned for Barack Obama." Elder’s claim about Deen’s political affiliation was the latest we’d seen. But the claim has been picked up by various media outlets, including The Daily Caller, Breitbart.com and Naked DC. Many celebrities decline to get publicly involved in partisan politics. We wondered whether Deen had actually bucked that trend, so we decided to investigate. We sought comment from Deen, but her publicist was unable to provide one. PolitiFact Georgia checked with Elder, and through his producer we learned that the source for his Deen claim was an article last month on the conservative website Breitbart.com. That article references an Us Weekly entertainment magazine slideshow of celebrities and their political affiliations. In fact, most of the outlets that have reported a Deen-Obama connection have relied on the Us Weekly item as their source for information. The magazine’s online slideshow, produced in October, features about 40 celebrities (including such famous faces as Oprah, Kevin Bacon, Chuck Norris and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson), the party they support and a short write-up of their political involvement. Some of the information includes quotes directly from the celebrities about their party affiliation. But the basis for other items is not so clear. For example, wrestler Hulk Hogan’s description says he is "reportedly" a registered Democrat. And the magazine lists porn star Jenna Jameson as a Republican, with this quote she gave CBS News: "I'm very much looking forward to a Republican being back in office. When you're rich, you want a Republican in office." But that statement doesn’t necessarily equate to Jameson being a Republican. For Deen’s description, the magazine says she campaigned for Obama back in 2008 and invited first lady Michelle Obama to cook with her on an episode of "Paula’s Party." The write-up goes on to say that Deen later said she "just loved" being around Michelle and praised the first lady for her healthy eating and exercise platform. We contacted Us Weekly, but it was unable to provide any information on the source for its political listing for Deen. But let’s break down Deen’s description. Deen did have Michelle Obama on her show for a segment in September 2008. The pair fried shrimp. But Deen also invited then-Republican presidential challenger John McCain’s wife, Cindy, as well as McCain’s running mate, Sarah Palin, to appear in a segment. Neither McCain nor Palin appear in the show credits from September 2008 to the end of that year. At the time of the Obama invitation, Deen’s publicist made sure to note that the invite was simply an invite and not an endorsement of Obama’s campaign. President Obama did visit Savannah in March 2010 on a four-hour jaunt focused on jobs and energy efficiency. He did stop for lunch, but not at Deen’s Lady and Sons restaurant, nor her brother’s place. Instead, Obama ate at Mrs. Wilkes’ Boarding House Restaurant, which also features Southern cuisine. We also checked out Deen’s alleged support through either her checkbook or her vote, and we came up empty. A search of the federal campaign database doesn’t turn up any campaign contributions to Obama by Deen, her husband, Michael Groover, or under the name of Paula Groover. And a look at the Georgia voter rolls shows that Deen voted in the 2008 general election but does not show her party affiliation. In 1996, the last year for which a party affiliation is attached to her votes, Deen voted in the Republican presidential primary. In an interview with The New York Times last year, Deen was prodded to reveal her choice for president. "Obama or Romney,?" the interviewer asked. "Quick, go." Perhaps on death glares from her publicist, Deen didn’t answer, but instead gave a list of things she’d implement if she were president. Think soda cups with no size limits. Finally, we consulted with The Associated Press’ Savannah-area reporter, the metro editor of Savannah’s daily newspaper and a Georgia political science professor and longtime politics watcher. All three cried foul on Elder’s claim and said they were unaware of Deen ever publicly supporting Obama or getting involved in politics. So Elder’s claim that Deen campaigned for and supported Obama falls like a biscuit with no baking powder. The source for these claims traces back to an Us Weekly magazine item, and unless Us Weekly is privy to some information that it is not willing to share, there seems to be nothing to substantiate its claim. And because its information is wrong, so is everyone else -- including Elder -- who has used the magazine data as a source for their claims of Deen backing Obama. We rated Elder’s claim False.

"22nd Circuit Court of Appeals Justice Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith made headlines this week when he overturned a ruling out of Dearborn, Michigan," said the opening line to the Feb. 28 webviners.com story, headlined "BREAKING Trump Removes Muslim Federal Judge For Trying To Implement Sharia Law In America." The problem is, there is no 22nd Circuit Court of Appeals. There are only 13 appellate courts below the U.S. Supreme Court — 12 Circuit Courts of Appeals and the Federal Circuit Court. And there is no Judge Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith. Overall, the story claims that a judge "allowed two critical and violent tenets of Sharia Law" to be practiced in the United States and that Trump used his executive power to remove him from the bench. Here’s a breakdown of the story and how separated it is from reality. "When asked why the feds have the right to allow a man to brutalize his wife for speaking with another man and to beat her nearly to death if she were to act on her impulses, the judge mentioned the systematic infusion clause and said the Sharia Law should be allowed because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by other states," the story claimed. But as fellow fact-checkers have noted, there is no "systematic infusion clause," and the 14th Amendment largely deals with citizenship rights. "President Trump used an old precedent and an executive order to remove al Allalawaralahali-Smith from the bench, citing gross negligence of his duties and wanton disregard for the United States Constitution, reports As American As Apple Pie," the story continues. However, the website asamericanasapplepie.org is not a source of accurate news. That website’s About page claims everything posted on its site is fiction. "It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical." Webviners.com’s story also uses different names for the supposed judge, at times calling him "Hansam al Alallawalahi-Smith," "al Allalawaralahali-Smith" and "Alallaha-Smith." The Feb. 28 post is a variation of other stories debunked in 2017. Previous fake news posts claimed it was "Judge Mahal al Alallaha-Smith" who ruled in favor of Sharia law in the United States. PolitiFact Texas reported that in November 2017, the Facebook page for Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, shared a post from a website called trumpsolidsupporters.me, which made the same fake news claims as webviners.com did in February 2018. The link to trumpsolidsupporters.me remains on Miller’s Facebook page, yet an amended description for the link says: "Well it looks like I may have been duped. This may be fake news, but I still think Sharia law has no place in the United States of America." A webviners.com post claimed Trump removed a Muslim federal judge for trying to implement Sharia law in the United States. But the post is riddled with inaccuracies and cites as a source a purveyor of fake news. We rate webviners.com’s post Pants on Fire!

pomt-10191	Obama ad contends that John McCain endorses Rush Limbaugh's comments about immigration.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/19/barack-obama/limbaughs-not-a-mccain-spokesman/	(Published Sept. 19, 2008) A new Spanish-language TV ad from the Barack Obama campaign called "Dos Caras" (Two Faces) begins as most of the attack ads against John McCain do — with McCain pictured next to President Bush. The ad then cuts to a bewildering cameo from Rush Limbaugh. In an ad targeted to Spanish-speaking Latino audiences in Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada, the voiceover begins (according to translations provided by the Obama campaign): "They want us to forget the insults we’ve put up with…the intolerance…they made us feel marginalized in this country we love so much." The screen flashes a picture of conservative radio talk show host Limbaugh above two quotes: "…stupid and unskilled Mexicans" Rush Limbaugh "You shut your mouth or you get out!" Rush Limbaugh After the Limbaugh references, the announcer continues: "John McCain and his Republican friends have two faces. One that says lies just to get our vote and another, even worse, that continues the policies of George Bush that put special interests ahead of working families. John McCain…more of the same old Republican tricks." The whole thing raises the question, what are quotes from Limbaugh doing in an attack ad against McCain, especially one that highlights immigration? Limbaugh is hardly a McCainiac and in particular has been highly critical of McCain’s views on immigration. Limbaugh and other grass-roots conservatives derided McCain’s 2006 efforts to forge a compromise immigration plan in the Senate that combined border security and work-site enforcement to root out undocumented employees, with a guest worker program for most of the illegal immigrants in the country. Limbaugh called the plan "amnesty," as did some of McCain’s opponents during the Republican primary. We looked at the claim and ruled it True when McCain said his plan was not "amnesty." We based that on the fact that it would have required illegal immigrants to apply for a six-year conditional nonimmigrant visa. They then could apply for legal permanent residence — a green card — on the condition that they pay $1,000 in fines, pay all back taxes, pass a criminal background check, stay employed and demonstrate an effort to learn English and civics. However, when asked about his support for that immigration plan during a Republican debate in California on Jan. 30, 2008, McCain backtracked some and said he would no longer favor that plan because public opinion favored enforcement over citizenship measures. Instead, he would focus first on securing the border. In his radio show on Sept. 18, Limbaugh took some time to discuss the Obama campaign ad, and it sure didn’t sound like he’d forgotten McCain’s previous efforts. "This is just absurd because Bush and McCain were both for amnesty!" Limbaugh said. "Bush and McCain were these illegals’ best friends, along with Ted Kennedy." There’s another big problem with the Obama campaign ad; the Limbaugh quotes are lifted out of context. Let’s take the two quotes in order. First: "…stupid and unskilled Mexicans." This is a quote from 1993, during the debate over NAFTA. Said Limbaugh: "A caller called here and was giving me grief for not wanting to do what it took to protect American jobs, and so I said to him, ‘If you are unskilled and uneducated, your job is going south. Skilled workers, educated people are going to do fine ‘cause those are the kinds of jobs NAFTA is going to create. If we are going to start rewarding no skills and stupid people, I’m serious, let the unskilled jobs that take absolutely no knowledge whatsoever to do — let stupid and unskilled Mexicans do that work.’" As is clear here, Limbaugh was not calling Mexicans "stupid and unskilled." The second quote: "You shut your mouth or you get out!" This one comes from 2006, and as you’ll see, Limbaugh here is setting up for a punch line — that he is actually citing Mexican law. "Everybody’s making immigration proposals these days, let me add mine to the mix. Call it the Limbaugh Laws. "First, you emigrate to our country you have to speak the native language, you have to be a professional or an investor, no unskilled workers allowed. Also, there will be no special bilingual programs in the schools with the Limbaugh Laws, no special ballots for elections, no government business will be conducted in your language. Foreigners will not have the right to vote or hold political office. "If you’re in our country, you cannot be a burden to taxpayers. You are not entitled to welfare or food stamps or other government goodies. You can come if you invest here an amount equal to 40,000 times the daily minimum wage. If not, stay home. But if you want to buy land, it will be restricted: no waterfront, for instance, and as a foreigner, you have to relinquish individual rights to the property. "And another thing, you don’t have the right to protest. You’re allowed no demonstrations, no foreign flag waving, no political organizing, no bad-mouthing our president or his policies. You’re a foreigner. Shut your mouth or get out. If you come here illegally, you’re going to jail. "Now, you think the Limbaugh Laws are harsh? Well, every one of the laws I just mentioned are actual laws of Mexico today. That’s how the Mexican government handles immigrants to their country. Yet Mexicans come here illegally and protest in our streets. How do you say, 'double standard' in Spanish? How about, ‘no mas’?" In backup material for the ad, the Obama campaign cites a story in which McCain did not come out strongly against Minutemen. McCain said he did not agree with them, "but they are certainly exercising their legal rights as citizens." Hardly damning stuff. The Obama campaign also noted that McCain and other Republican candidates declined an invitation last summer to address NALEO, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. And they suggest that McCain has waffled in his support of something called the DREAM Act, Developmental Relief and Education for Alien Minors, a bill he co-sponsored that would allow people under age 16 who have been in the country for five years to remain and apply to be permanent residents. McCain told the editorial board of the Sun News in Myrtle Beach, S.C., last November that although he agreed with it, he would vote against any issue related to immigration reform until the borders are secured. The Obama campaign suggested McCain presented to a different face when speaking to Latinos at the National Council of La Raza Convention in July, but the full text of his answer does not back that up. Anyway, these relatively minor points raised by the Obama campaign are overshadowed by the larger import of the TV ad, which attempts to link McCain to seemingly racially insensitive remarks by Rush Limbaugh. As ABC’s Jake Tapper so aptly notes in his Political Punch blog , "even if one is uninclined to see Limbaugh’s quotes as having been taken unfairly out of context, linking them to McCain makes as much sense as running a quote from Bill Maher and linking it to Obama." We are inclined to think the Limbaugh quotes were lifted out of context, and we think that presenting them in an ad about McCain’s immigration policy — as if McCain somehow endorsed those comments — isn’t just wrong, it’s "pantalones en fuego" wrong.

pomt-00600	"One out of five of our children live in a family that’s on food stamps."	true	/texas/statements/2015/jun/03/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-1-5-us-children-lives-family-food-/	Addressing Iowans, expected Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry said he’s optimistic about the country’s future once there’s a leadership change, even though Americans remain unemployed and children continue to be hungry. "Now I understand there’s pessimism out there and there’s good reason for it," the former Texas governor said May 16, 2015. "One out of 10 Americans are out of a job or underemployed or just completely quit looking for a job. One out of five of our children live in a family that’s on food stamps. What did we have, 0.2 (percent) growth last month? That may be good enough for Barack Obama, it may be good enough for the Democrats, but it’s not good enough for me. I know America can do better." Perry’s first couple of figures didn’t seem new to us. In April 2015, the federal government announced the economy had grown 0.2 percent in the year’s first quarter. And according to the government, 10.8 percent of the American workforce in April 2015 were unemployed, underemployed or wanting a job but not lately looking--compared to 12.3 percent a year before. For this fact check, we wondered if one child in five lives in a family on food stamps, meaning government aid for buying groceries. A note: paper food stamps have not existed for nearly a decade since Congress in 2008 required states to shift to plastic cards, like credit cards, that may be presented at checkout stands. The one-time Food Stamps Program is now the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (In January 2010, the Smithsonian acquired ye olden food stamps for possible exhibits, J.C. Dwyer, a Texas anti-hunger activist, pointed out to us.) Perry’s backup To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry reached his statement based on a February 2015 U.S. Census Bureau press release stating the number of children receiving SNAP benefits remains higher than it was before the start of the Great Recession in 2007. In 2014, the release said, an estimated 16 million children, or about one in five, received the assistance compared with the roughly 9 million children, or one in eight, getting such help before the recession. The bureau said the declared 2014 ratio was based on responses to a supplemental part of its 2014 Current Population Survey. Confirmation We followed up with the Census Bureau, where demographer Jonathan Vespa said by email that Perry got it right. We wondered about comparable Texas figures and didn’t get perfectly comparable numbers. Results of the Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey indicated nearly 1.3 million of the state’s 9.1 million households, or 14 percent, reported receiving SNAP aid sometime in the previous 12 months. The Texas households where respondents said they got the benefits included more than 842,000 with children under the age of 18, 9 percent of all Texas households, according to the survey. We also asked Feeding Texas, a nonprofit whose mission is a hunger-free state, to assess Perry’s claim. Celia Cole, the group’s CEO, said by email: "Perry is right." And how does Texas stack up? By email, Dwyer, a Feeding Texas official, pointed out data posted online by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission indicating that in April 2015, 2 million Texas children received SNAP benefits. Given that the state demographer estimates that 6.9 million to 7.3 million children live in the state, Dwyer suggested, it looks like up to 30 percent of the children received SNAP benefits--similar to the rate the previous four Aprils based on Dwyer’s methodology. Nationally, Dwyer pointed out, previous bureau reports indicate that as few as 1 in 6 children received SNAP benefits in the past four years. "Texas generally has a higher percentage of its population receiving SNAP compared to the nation," Dwyer said. "This is because the primary factor in determining eligibility for SNAP is low-income, and Texas has a significantly higher percentage of families with low income / living in poverty." In January 2015, we found Half True a Democratic claim that since Perry became governor in late 2000, "poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% — which is higher than the national average." Those figures were supported by federal surveys, but they did not tell the full story. Texas’ poverty rate went down and then up again over Perry’s decade-plus as governor, and the gap between the nation and Texas ultimately narrowed. We also suggested it’s unreasonable to lay all blame for a state’s poverty rate on its governor; national economic factors dominate. Our ruling Perry said: "One out of five of our children live in a family that’s on food stamps." To be precise, the latest federal estimate is that in 2014, 1 in 5 children received SNAP benefits. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-09276	The new Arizona immigration law "says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/28/alfredo-gutierrez/arizona-immigration-law-allows-police-question-any/	When Arizona's Republican Gov. Jan Brewer signed the nation's toughest immigration law on April 23, 2010, did it open the door for rampant racial profiling? Generally speaking, the law -- which would go into effect in 90 days -- makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. One of the key questions to emerge has been what standard law enforcement officers would need to use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. This topic came up on the April 26 edition of the MSNBC program Hardball, in a three-way discussion between host Chris Matthews; Republican state Sen. John Huppenthal, a supporter of the new law; and former Democratic state Sen. Alfredo Gutierrez, an opponent of the law. Here is an excerpt from their conversation, edited for space: Matthews: "Under the law you passed and was signed by the governor this week, can a police officer who spots a car with five or six people in it, who he thinks because of instinct, experience, whatever, evidence, whatever you use -- can he stop that car and say, I think these people are here illegally, I'm going to stop and check them? Can he under the law do that, without any crime involved? Can he do that?" Huppenthal: "No, he cannot. That would be -- that would just simply be racial profiling, and that would not be permitted under the law. Now, if he stopped them for speeding or something like that, he can inquire of the driver at that point if they were an illegal immigrant. But you're not going to find that kind of activity. That kind of kind of activity is not going to be -- that's not going to be a part of training. What is going to be a part of training, I arrest somebody for burglary, I arrest them for DUI, I arrest them after they've maimed somebody." Gutierrez: "Obviously, the senator hasn't read his own bill. What this bill does is, it says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person. And I'm going tell you something, if you and I are walking down the street, you're not going to be the subject ... of reasonable suspicion. He is simply wrong about his own bill. I suggest he read it." We'll rate Huppenthal's contribution to this conversation in a separate item. Here we'll tackle Gutierrez' comment. Let's start by looking at exactly what the law says. Here's the part telling law enforcement officers that they need to check on individuals' immigration status: "For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of this state or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person, except if the determination may hinder or obstruct an investigation." But elsewhere, the bill inserts some limitations. Here's one: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not solely consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona constitution." And here's another: "This section shall be implemented in a manner consistent with federal laws regulating immigration, protecting the civil rights of all persons and respecting the privileges and immunities of United States citizens." These provisions cross-cut in a way that can be described either as nuanced or murky. On the one hand, law enforcement officers are told that "for any lawful contact" they have with an individual, they have to try to determine the individual's legal status if "reasonable suspicion exists" that the person is in the United States illegally. However, they cannot pursue an immigration status check "solely" because of race, color or national origin. So a key question is whether the law's stated protections against racial profiling are enough to protect someone from questioning if they are not suspected of committing a crime. If so, that would undercut Gutierrez' argument. In discussing these questions with legal experts, we found that everyone agreed that there's some gray area that will need to be sorted out in future court decisions. That said, the general consensus was that the protections against racial profiling will have some effect, but that it is unlikely to be a foolproof barrier. Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor, said that while racial profiling is not permissible, profiling based on, say, clothing or behavior is legal -- and rather common -- as long as the profile isn't based solely on race. "Police departments come up with profiles that can establish a resonable suspicion," Spiro said. Such profiles "entitle an officer to stop someone and say, 'I'd like to ask you some questions?' The officer can then investigate, which could lead to probable cause." And at that point, Spiro said, an immigration status check would be acceptable under the Arizona law. To be fair, it's not necessarily easy to use profiles in this way. Spiro said that the challenge is drawing up a defensible profile for spotting illegal immigrants. "You can't stop someone just because they look Hispanic," Spiro said. "There has to be some other factor or factors, not all of which are race-based, as well as some empirical explanation of why that profile establishes a reasonable suspicion. You have to come up with something beside race that sounds plausible as correlating with undocumented status, and it's hard to say what that would be." In addition, nothing we've learned guarantees that law enforcement officers will fully exercise the powers they're granted under the new law -- or that judges will let them. But most legal experts we asked felt that the law opened the door to widespread police questioning of individuals. "In my mind, the ambiguity creates the danger of police abuse of persons of particular national origin ancestries and backgrounds," said Kevin Johnson, the dean of the law school at the University of California (Davis) and a specialist on immigration law. It's worth noting that Brewer herself provided little guidance as she explained her decision to sign the bill. When she was asked at a news conference how illegal immigrants would be identified, she said, "I do not know what an illegal immigrant looks like. I can tell you that I think that there are people in Arizona that assume they know what an illegal immigrant looks like. I don't know if they know that for a fact or not." Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, an adjunct law professor at Cornell University, agreed that this is a recipe for confusion. "The courts will have a hard time deciding what constitutes a reasonable suspicion," he said. As we try to rate the accuracy of Gutierrez' statement, the degree of uncertainty about the law gives us pause, making us reluctant to rule either statement fully True or fully False. That said, we think that a close reading of the law and the views of the experts we contacted do allow us to draw some conclusions. Gutierrez' statement -- that the law "says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person" -- is fairly accurate, but not entirely. While the law does appear to provide significant latitude for law enforcement officers in Arizona to question people about their immigration status -- on a pretext as basic as a broken taillight -- the law also says the grounds cannot be based on race or ethnicity alone. This is a somewhat more narrow standard than Gutierrez indicated, so we will downgrade his comment to Mostly True.	None	Alfredo Gutierrez	None	None	None	2010-04-28T17:29:29	2010-04-26	['Arizona']

"He was for immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship before he was against it. It is really unfortunate that he has chosen the most politically expedient path on issues that matter the most to people here in Florida." Has Rubio back-tracked? While Rubio has changed his opinion on how the legislation should be passed, we also found that he hasn’t changed his views on the underlying policy issues. Rubio and the Senate bill Rubio and seven other senators unveiled bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate in April 2013. The law required beefed-up border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status. Specifically, the bill would have allowed people to seek "registered provisional immigrant status" if they met certain criteria. After 10 years, they could seek a green card. Under pre-existing law, those with green cards can later apply for citizenship. Within months the bill had died, and Rubio said he would support a different approach: a series of bills to change immigration laws. 'American Dreams' book Rubio’s most specific recent comments on immigration are in his book American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone, released in January. (His spokesman pointed us to it when we asked.) Rubio wrote that a comprehensive bill "is simply not realistic," but that a series of bills could still get to the same end. (Remember, the Senate bill also called for security measures first and a work-based system.) He outlined three steps for handling illegal immigrants already here: They would have to register, and those who have committed serious crimes or haven’t been here long enough would have to leave. Those who qualify would then pay an application fee and fine, undergo a background check and learn English in order to apply for a temporary visa. They would not qualify for government programs including health care, welfare or food stamps. After at least a decade at this status, "they would be allowed to apply for permanent residency if they so choose. Many who qualify for this status will choose to remain in it indefinitely. But those who choose to seek permanent residency would have to do it the way anyone else would, not through a special pathway." Rubio’s book doesn’t specifically explain how a permanent resident would then become a citizen. However existing law allows permanent residents -- commonly referred to as green card holders -- to apply for citizenship a few years later. Rubio "is on record repeatedly saying it would be a bad idea to change existing law in that respect," his spokesman Alex Conant said. As recently as December 2014, Rubio said it was a bad idea to bar people from citizenship permanently: "We might prohibit people who came here illegally and got green cards under this process from ever becoming citizens. And if that’s what we have to do to get this thing passed, I would be open to it. But I don’t think that’s a wise thing to do." He made similar comments to CNN in January 2015. But it’s not like Rubio doesn’t finesse his message for different audiences. The DNC pointed to an interview that Rubio gave to conservative radio talk show host Simon Conway in June 2014. "The part that’s difficult is, is what do you do with millions of people in this country who are here illegally? What do you do about it? And I think that the couple of things we’re not going to do -- we’re not going to award citizenship to people or give them a benefit they wouldn’t otherwise have. And we’re also not going to round up and deport 12 million people. So the problem with finding a solution between those two different positions is people are not willing to even talk about it until they believe the laws are going to be enforced." Changing tacts We asked a few experts on immigration policy if Rubio is now "against" immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship. "There is no substantial policy difference," said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Sen. Rubio's current position on handling the illegal immigrant population is very similar to his opinion in 2013. The only difference is that now Sen. Rubio wants several piecemeal bills rather than one comprehensive bill -- a stylistic rather than a substantive change." However, Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, which advocates for a path to citizenship, says Rubio’s new approach is no tiny tweak. "From the perspective of those of us working on immigration reform from day one, the idea of piecemeal approach is another excuse not to get to the piece that makes Republicans uncomfortable, which is legalization or a path to citizenship," he said. "I don’t think retreat to piecemeal process is a small concession, I see it as a huge problem." If Wasserman Schultz’s "point is his new position makes a path to citizenship virtually impossible, I would agree with that statement," Sharry said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Rubio "was for immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship before he was against it." The 2013 Senate bill which Rubio co-sponsored to overhaul our immigration system included a pathway to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants, albeit one with significant hurdles. After that died, Rubio said he still favored immigration reform, but that it’s only chance was through piecemeal bills. In his book, Rubio outlined specific steps for illegal immigrants to obtain legal status, and after many years eventually pursue citizenship. There is a kernel of truth to Wasserman Schultz’s claim, though, because some immigration advocates say Rubio’s piecemeal approach greatly reduces the chance that Congress would ever get to the point of addressing residency and citizenship.

RNZ asked Labour for its source material, which were Ministry of Health elective surgery documents provided under the Official Information Act. Fact or Fiction has ignored Labour's commentary around the OIA material and only used the raw data to assess this and the following claim. No captionJonathan Coleman Photo: RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King Since the 2015/16 year, the Ministry of Health has monitored two sets of elective surgery figures: elective surgical discharges (i.e. completed elective surgeries); and elective surgical discharges and 'arranged' surgical discharges (same-same-but-different to elective surgery). The second set of figures is the one currently used to report on the government's much-touted 'more elective surgery' health target. In the 2015/16 year, the target was 200,460 elective surgeries - Jonathan Coleman said in Parliament that this target had been met. In his press release announcing National would 'lift' the number of elective surgeries from 174,000 to 200,000 by 2021/22, Dr Coleman appears to be using the first, older definition - which the Ministry of Health still measures, but does not use as the target it sets for district health boards to meet.

pomt-04993	The Affordable Care Act "will likely go down as the biggest tax increase in history."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/20/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-obamacare-will-ultimately-be-bigg/	The Supreme Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act settled the question of its constitutionality, but only seemed to intensify debate over the law. Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel joined other Republicans in calling for its repeal, saying the decision "sets the stage for the November election." He identified the law as a pivotal issue in his campaign to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown. Mandel issued a statement on the day of the decision asserting that Brown had voted "for what will likely go down as the biggest tax increase in history." That claim about the health care legislation has been a talking point opponents of the law, repeated many times since the ruling. But PolitiFact first examined it after Florida Gov. Rick Scott made the statement more than a year earlier. The claim is wrong. Here’s why: The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, gave members a detailed breakdown of the tax impact of the health care law from 2010-2019. • A 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services that started in 2011 is expected to bring in $2.7 billion over 10 years. • A new fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that started in 2011 is expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with annual incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2013, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices starts. The 10-year total: $20 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. • Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax kicks in on high-cost health plans, so-called "Cadillac plans" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families). That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. There also is money in the law going the other way. The plan includes government money, in the form of tax credits, to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower-income people who don't get insurance through their employer. And there is a tax cut for some small businesses that allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees. Combined with various other revenue-generating provisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenues coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019. Does that translate to the biggest tax increase in American history? There are many ways to define or measure the size of a tax increase. The health care tax provisions, for instance, take effect between 2011 and 2018, meaning the full effect of the legislation won't be felt until near the end of the decade. On top of that to compare the costs today with other years you have to adjust for inflation to measure the relative impact of a tax provision at the time it was enacted. For our comparison, PolitiFact used a method perfected by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940-2006. He used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation and calculated the impact as a percentage of GDP. For 1940-1967 calculations, he used a single-year snapshot of the revenue impact of the tax legislation. For more recent tax bills, from 1968-2006, Tempalski used a two-year average of the revenue effects. Tempalski wrote: "The comparison of tax bills for the first period should be examined with some caution, because the revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. The comparison for the second period can be viewed with more confidence, because the estimates are relatively consistent." As a percent of GDP, here are the top five tax increases from 1940-2006, according to Tempalski: 1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP; 2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP; 3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP; 4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP; 5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: .97 percent of GDP; And here are the top five tax increases from the "modern" era of 1968-2006: 1. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP; 2. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: 0.8 percent of GDP; 3 (tie). Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: 0.5 percent of GDP 3 (tie). Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; 0.5 percent of GDP; 5. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; 0.49 percent of GDP. The list does not include the health care law, which passed in 2010, and a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury said it hasn't been updated. So PolitiFact calculated its own figure for percent of GDP. We used 2019 as our baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of the law will be in effect. In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion. That $104 billion includes the penalty or tax that individuals might pay if they do not purchase health insurance -- a figure estimated to be $14 billion for 2019. We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to 0.49 percent of total GDP. That would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. The health care-related tax increases are smaller than the tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961. We asked Mandel's campaign how his claim is supported. The most relevant source they cited was an editorial from the Wall Street Journal asserting that Obama "has imposed the largest tax increase in history on the middle class." The Journal cited Congressional Budget Office projections that 76 percent of the people who will have to pay an annual penalty tax (because they do not have health insurance and are not exempt for, say, cases of hardship or religious belief) will have a household income of 500 percent of the federal poverty level or below. For a family of four, that comes to about $120,000. But who pays the tax is a different question than whether it is the largest tax increase in history. Mandel's camp also cited sources saying that the Affordable Care Act contains "the largest tax increase since 1993," which we noted earlier and which was not his statement. And they cited a chart from FactCheck.org showing the Affordable Care Act producing the largest tax increase since 1968 in raw dollars. In the article the chart accompanied, however, FactCheck.org called raw dollars a "rather useless yardstick" and "a poor way to measure the size of a tax increase," because it makes no adjustment for inflation and takes no account of a population that is steadily rising. The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993. But they are not the largest in the history of the United States. It would have to grow more than 10 fold to match the wartime tax increase from 1942. It would have to nearly double just to match the 1982 increase under Reagan. And that still wouldn’t crack the top 5 since 1940. They are so far from the largest that it is not now possible, much less "likely," that they will "go down as the biggest tax increase in history."

pomt-06406	The STAR Ohio fund "just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/27/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-touts-investment-pools-/	Critics of Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel describe him as an overly ambitious politician who focuses on his next election rather than his current job. This gripe has grown louder as Mandel, elected treasurer last November, recently emerged as a candidate for U.S. Senate to oppose incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown, who is up for re-election next year. While he campaigns for the Senate race, Mandel has promoted his work as state treasurer, whose responsibilities are to safeguard and invest the state’s money. The treasurer also invests money for local governments through the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion. Mandel, a former Lyndhurst City Councilman, touted the fund’s credit rating in an email to supporters in early October. The STAR Ohio fund "just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive," he wrote in the Oct. 5 email. Mandel went on to praise his staff for making tough decisions in the midst of an unpredictable economy. He also contrasted the fund’s performance against the recent downgrade of the United States’ credit rating. Given his Senate candidacy and the consistent accusations he is an absent officeholder, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Mandel’s claim about his performance as treasurer. The treasurer’s office directed us to its news release on Sept. 8. The release included a letter from the credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s, along with recent news stories about local government investment funds. Like other credit rating agencies, S&P analyzes the creditworthiness of various governments, government-backed funds and other investments. On Aug. 23, S&P sent a letter to the state affirming a AAAm rating for the STAR Ohio fund. Unfamiliar with the lower-case "m" attached to the rating, we looked it up under S&P’s ratings definitions. The "m" subscript signifies a money market fund rating, which assesses the fund’s ability to maintain a stable net asset value. AAAm is the highest of these ratings. "Higher rated funds are expected to have stronger capacities to pay investor redemptions in cash during times of high market stress because they generally comprise shorter maturity and higher quality investments," according to S&P. Mandel is accurate in saying the fund received the highest possible rating. He also told supporters the fund "just" received the rating, so we wanted to check whether the rating was upgraded under Mandel, or if the fund maintained a high rating established under previous treasurers. Jeff Sexton, a spokesman for S&P, said STAR Ohio has received a AAAm rating since 1995, the first year S&P rated the fund. Although Mandel has simply maintained the high rating, a public finance expert said the treasurer deserves some credit. The highest praise, however, should be reserved for the fund managers who maintained the rating during the financial crisis in 2008, said Kevin O’Brien, executive director at the Center for Public Management in the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University. "He deserves credit for maintaining that (rating) from January until now," said O’Brien, a former financial analyst for Moody’s Investors Service, another credit rating agency. "They maintained the bond rating; they didn't achieve the bond rating." We checked with Mandel’s office to get an idea of how the STAR Ohio fund is managed. Spokesman Seth Unger said the office’s investment department works with financial advisers to manage the fund. Unger said investments are bought and sold daily. The STAR Ohio fund did, in fact, receive the highest rating possible, as Mandel’s email claimed. But the rating already had been in place for 16 years. It did not improve under Mandel, as a reasonable person might assume from his email. And while he gets some credit for maintaining the rating, his email overstated the case. Those are important details that add context. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2011-10-27T18:00:00	2011-10-05	['None']
pomt-03079	"Up to half of all Americans have a pre-existing condition."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/27/barack-obama/obama-says-half-americans-have-preexisting-conditi/	The Obama administration is trying to rebut critics who have labeled Obamacare one of the most destructive laws in the nation’s history. At an event in Maryland on Sept. 26, 2013, President Barack Obama highlighted the program’s benefits. High on his list was the new rule about pre-existing conditions, health problems that insurance companies use to deny coverage to would-be new customers. Under the Affordable Care Act, no insurer will be allowed to turn someone down due to a pre-existing condition. This, Obama said, will make a big difference. "Up to half of all Americans have a pre-existing condition," he told the crowd in Maryland. A reader found this confusing and asked us, "So that meant 150 million people could not have insurance?" The answer is "no" and here we’ll explain why and rate the accuracy of the president’s claim. We looked into a very similar statement not too long ago. A problem with your health versus a problem with the insurance company When Obama said as many as half of all Americans have a pre-existing condition, he was describing the number of people who have heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, mental illness or any of a number of other maladies. It was a statement about the prevalence of those illnesses across the population. If you already have insurance and develop one of these problems, generally, your insurance company will pay for treatment. But if you show up in the individual insurance market wanting to buy coverage, and you already have one of these diseases, generally speaking, you would be out of luck. In the view of the insurance company, you would have a pre-existing condition and they would not pay to treat it. Or they might charge you a much higher premium. Since about 85 percent of Americans already have insurance, many through large group plans, this would not be a concern. But for those who don’t, it matters. The Affordable Care Act provision is aimed at those people. By the way, the law has had this protection for children since it was passed in 2010. As of Jan. 1, 2014, the rule extends to adults. Getting back to the reader’s confusion, while half of all Americans might have one of these illnesses, most of them don’t bump up against the insurance companies’ restrictions. Obama was talking about the benefit to the smaller group for whom this would be a problem. Now, let’s consider whether in fact, up to half of all Americans have one of these health problems. Pre-existing is in the eye of the insurer There are a range of estimates for the number of people with health issues that would put them at risk of running afoul of an insurance company. One reason is that insurers have different lists of conditions that raise a red flag. Similarly, researchers can take a conservative approach and use a short list or be more expansive with a longer one. White House staff pointed us to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That study used a short list of diseases and a longer one, with both lists based on the policies of private and public insurance programs. The report found a range of 19 percent to 50 percent of all Americans with health conditions that could disqualify them for coverage or lead to higher premiums. The president reflected that range when he said "up to half of all Americans." There are other studies that generally mirror the Health and Humans Services findings, although they focus on adults. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, examined five studies on the prevalence of pre-existing conditions. The lowest estimate counted just eight diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. That study came up with about 36 million people between 19 and 64 who have one of those health issues. Another study used a list of 60 conditions and arrived at 60 million who might be vulnerable to denial of coverage. The GAO itself used medical survey data and reached a high-end estimate of 122 million. As percentages, this translates into a low-end estimate of 20 percent of American adults potentially at risk, 66 percent on the high end. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, notes that projections of the scope of the problem can miss the mark. The administration expected about 375,000 people would enroll in a special insurance program for those who had been denied coverage but as of January 2013, only about 107,000 had. That said, many factors apart from health could have affected enrollments. Our ruling Obama said up to half of all Americans have a pre-existing condition. A government study put the range at 19 percent to 50 percent. Most other studies suggest the percentage is less than 50 percent. The president relied on the highest estimate but qualified his claim by saying "up to" which is technically accurate. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13434	"300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance" as a result of Obamacare.	false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/19/americans-prosperity/ad-hitting-patrick-murphy-revives-zombie-statistic/	Florida’s closely watched U.S. Senate race pits incumbent Republican Marco Rubio against Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy. Recently, Rubio got some help from the free-market group Americans for Prosperity, which created an ad attacking Murphy as "Pay-More Patrick." One of the claims in the ad was an attack on Murphy’s support for the Affordable Care Act, a law sometimes called Obamacare after the president who signed it into law. In the ad, a narrator says, "Patrick Murphy says he wants to serve in the U.S. Senate, but who does he really want to serve? As a member of Congress, ‘Pay-More’ Patrick has voted for big payouts to special interests. Our health care premiums are going up, and 300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance. And yet, ‘Pay-More’ Patrick voted not once, not twice, but nine times for Obamacare." Here, we’ll check the assertion that "300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance" as a result of Obamacare. Where the number came from The 300,000 figure has a long history. As we have noted previously, it stems from the 300,000 policyholders in October 2013 who received notices from the insurance company Florida Blue that their insurance plans didn’t meet the new rules under the Affordable Care Act. Those rules were intended to phase out "bare bones" plans that didn’t include features like prescription drug coverage or hospital stays. Florida Blue sent those 300,000 customers letters informing them that their plans would end and offering guidance on how to get signed up for a new plan. "Florida Blue is proactively communicating to these members to help them understand how this transition affects them," the company said at the time. "Prior to their 2014 renewal date, each member will receive a letter that instructs them to contact Florida Blue to review their migration options. These new plans will offer members access to more comprehensive benefits in 2014." Opponents of the Affordable Care Act seized on the 300,000 number as a sign of problems for the newly implemented law, and it became an issue during the 2014 campaign cycle. Twice, we took issue with the use of the statistic for not providing full context about the number. Rubio himself earned a Mostly False for saying, "300,000 people are going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance." Since the company provided assistance with switching plans, we argued that Rubio was jumping the gun by saying flatly that they wouldn’t have insurance. What has happened since? So what happened to those 300,000 people in the succeeding three years? As it turns out, the vast majority of the 300,000 found coverage -- with Florida Blue. "More than 80 percent of the approximately 300,000 members remained with Florida Blue," company spokesman Paul C. Kluding told PolitiFact. That would leave at most 60,000 people -- not 300,000 -- who lost their health insurance as a result of that provision of the law. But even that number is probably high. Remember, the 80 percent figure refers to the policyholders who remained with Florida Blue. But the other 20 percent didn’t necessarily become uninsured -- they just didn’t get a Florida Blue plan. They could have found another private plan, or they could have found other private insurance -- including a plan purchased on one of the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. So at the very least, the ad reanimates a years-old number that was known to be preliminary and in flux. Florida’s new insurance signups The use of the 300,000 number is misleading in a second way: It ignores the coverage gains of the Affordable Care Act in the state. More than 1.7 million Floridians purchased plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces between Nov. 1, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2016. And the number affected by the law could have been many more if Florida had moved to expand Medicaid under the law, as many other states did. This is a big enough increase to wipe out the 300,000 policies "lost" -- which, as we noted, is an exaggerated number -- and it positively dwarfs the 60,000 number, which itself might be exaggerated. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on Florida can be seen clearly in newly released federal data on uninsured residents in every state. In 2013, 20 percent of Floridians lacked health coverage. In 2014, that number fell to 16.6 percent, and in 2015, it fell again to 13.3 percent. That’s a decrease in Florida’s uninsured population by one-third over two years. Americans for Prosperity responds Andres Malave, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, made several arguments for why the message of the ad was valid. One is that those 300,000 faced administrative headaches in continuing their insurance or finding a new plan, sometimes more than once. He also had a point that not all of the 1.7 million residents who purchased a marketplace plan were uninsured before that. However, the overall uninsured rates suggest that many people were indeed moving from uninsured to insured over the previous two years. (Malave argued that the recovering economy in the state deserves credit for the higher insurance coverage rates, rather than just the Affordable Care Act.) Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said that "300,000 Floridians have lost their health insurance" as a result of Obamacare. Even in 2013 this assertion was not entirely correct, and now, more than three years later, we know it’s not correct. Only about 60,000 people failed to re-up with Florida Blue, and there’s a good chance that many of those 60,000 found coverage elsewhere -- including through the Obamacare exchanges. Indeed, in the most recent year, the Obamacare marketplace has enabled 1.7 million Floridians to sign up for coverage, a far bigger number than the losses cited in the ad. Finally, the uninsured rate in Florida has fallen by one-third since 2013, which paints a very different picture than the ad’s zombie statistic.

pomt-12216	"We went from zero A elementary schools when I took office to 16 when I left, and our total A and B schools went up by 260 percent."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jul/21/rick-baker/did-number-schools-increase-under-former-mayor-ric/	Rick Baker has used mailers, forums and social media to relay one big message in his campaign for St. Petersburg mayor: Schools in St. Petersburg saw drastic improvements when he was mayor from 2001 to 2010. During an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board July 13, Baker touted his efforts to help improve public schools in the city, which included a mentoring program he started in 2001. "We went from zero A elementary schools when I took office to 16 when I left, and our total A and B schools went up by 260 percent," Baker said. "I don’t take credit for that, I honestly don’t. I know that there’s a lot of factors that build into that, but I’m just saying we were a helper and the schools did not feel abandoned in St. Pete when we did that." With this talking point coming up again and again, we wondered about the number of A schools Baker referenced. Baker’s data is right on the numbers, but as he acknowledged, there are a lot of factors that can affect school grades. The number of A elementary schools increased The relevant data comes from the Florida Department of Education. Every year since 1999, the Florida Department of Education has released individual grades for schools in the state after the academic year. The grading formula gauges schools’ performance based on how many students score at grade level and how many students made improvements in core curriculum areas of math, language arts and science. Schools can receive a grade of A, B, C, D, F or I (incomplete). Baker’s evidence for his statement is based on the grades of elementary schools included in his "Mayor's, Mentors and More" program, which included the majority of elementary schools in St. Petersburg starting in 2001. The program included initiatives such as scholarships, corporate partnerships and business mentoring. Baker spokeswoman Brigitta Shouppe said schools that had 51 percent of their students living in the city of St. Petersburg were included in the program, ranging from 27 to 30 schools each year. According to the state data, there were zero A elementary schools from that group in 2001. At the end of Baker's last full year in office in 2009, the number of A elementary schools had jumped dramatically to 16. The number of A and B total schools (not just elementary schools) went from seven in July 2001 to 26 in July 2009. That’s an increase of about 271 percent. The improvement in A-rated schools was not a steady build; the number fluctuated year to year. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The education department made significant changes to the grading system between 2001 and 2009, so schools were not graded based on the exact same criteria over the eight-year period. "In the past the department has shown grades over time but has generally also pointed out the changes made from one year to the next," said Audrey Walden, Florida Department of Education spokeswoman. School improvement takes a village As Baker acknowledged, a mayor can only do so much when it comes to local education. The school board sets local education policy and the superintendent carries it out. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Baker stressed again that the gains were a team effort. "It’s great for the St. Pete schools to have an advocate in the mayor’s office and do it in partnership with the School's Board and the school system," Baker said. Julie Mastry (formerly Julie Janssen), who was Pinellas County superintendent from 2008-11 and deputy superintendent from 2006-08, said the school board and Baker’s office had a "healthy partnership." Current Pinellas County School Board member Rene Flowers served on St. Petersburg City Council for a potion of Baker’s term and was clear that she supports Mayor Rick Kriseman in this election. She said "the mayor has nothing to do" with daily operations in county schools. "School reform is complex, and it is hard to attribute improvement to one program or source," said Alyson Adams, a clinical associate professor of education at the University of Florida. Adams said that it’s possible Baker’s mentoring program put a greater focus on learning, but added there may also be other programs happening in these schools that contributed to the improvements. Baker’s tenure did not see as much of the effects of the School Board’s vote in December 2007 to end integration and create neighborhood schools. (Baker said he did not have a position on that.) The decision and a lack of follow-up with resources by the board created a concentration of poverty in schools in St. Petersburg's black neighborhoods. The Tampa Bay Times documented the outcome of five elementary schools in its "Failure Factories" investigation. Our ruling Baker said, "We went from 0 A elementary schools when I took office to 16 when I left, and our total A and B schools went up by 260 percent." Baker’s evidence comes from the Florida Department of Education and the statistics he cites are accurate. Local community members gave him credit for starting a mentoring program, but Baker himself has acknowledged that many factors outside of the mayor’s control influence school grades. His statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we it Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Correction: The original version of this story inaccuratedly described the years of Baker's tenure. The article has been updated.

pomt-13683	In Liberia, "a girl is more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read."	mostly false	/global-news/statements/2016/aug/01/tina-rosenberg/are-liberian-girls-more-likely-be-married-literate/	Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and author Tina Rosenberg recently drew attention to a shocking statistic about women’s education in the African country of Liberia. "This is education in Liberia," Rosenberg wrote in the New York Times on June 14. "A girl is more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read." Liberia was devastated by civil war between 1989 and 2003. More recently, its schools were closed for six months following the outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2014. Our partners at Africa Check looked at the available survey data to determine the accuracy of Rosenberg’s claim. Recent data doesn’t support claim Rosenberg, who won the Pulitzer for non-fiction The Haunted Land: Facing Europe's Ghosts After Communism, told Africa Check that her claim was based on a Liberian database of statistics collected from the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The database reported that 37.9 percent of children are married in Liberia by 18. That is fractionally higher than the female youth literacy rate of 37.2 percent, according to the UNICEF database. The problem is those figures come from 2007 reports and are out of date. The 37.9 percent figure for child marriage appears to track back to Liberia’s Demographic and Health Survey from 2007. The youth literacy figure is likely from a 2007 UNESCO Institute for Statistics’ estimate. The estimate covers women between the ages of 15-24, not just girls 18 and under. The most recent data comes from the country’s 2013 Demographic and Health Survey. Teen marriage rates in Liberia The Demographic and Health Survey presents data in five year increments for people aged 15 to 49. Women who are 18 fall into the youngest age group of 15 to 19. However, the survey is missing data for marriage rates for this age group. Instead, a United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund note on interpreting child marriage data recommends using the next age group: "Looking at the group of women 20 to 24 years old is simpler and allows for the inclusion of all girls who were married or in union by age 18 within the closest time period for which complete data are available." Following this standard, the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey shows that 35.9 percent of Liberian women aged 20 to 24 reported being married by the time they were 18. This method is imperfect because it doesn’t tell us about the chances that a girl under 20 today will have been married by 18. However, it gives us the best estimate for youth marriage rates for a group of young women who could reasonably be called girls. Literacy rates in Liberia The 2013 survey reported a literacy rate of 64.2 percent for women between 15 and 24 years of age. Someone is considered literate if they went to high school or if they can read a whole sentence or part of that sentence. The literacy rate decreases slightly to 58.9 percent when you look at women ages 20 to 24. Other organizations define literacy more strictly. For example, UNESCO doesn’t include people who can only read part of a sentence in the literate population. If we apply UNESCO’s literacy definition to Liberian women aged aged 20 to 24, literacy drops to 51.2 percent – still much higher than the marriage figure of 35.9 percent. Our Ruling Rosenberg made the claim that a Liberian woman is "more likely to be married by 18 than to know how to read." This claim relies on data from an old 2007 survey. Using a more recent survey and the closest age group for which data are available, the comparison doesn’t hold. Young Liberian women are more likely to know how to read than be married. We rate this claim Mostly False. This fact-check originally was published by Africa Check.

pomt-14980	"The oil and natural gas industry provides or supports 141,600 jobs in Georgia."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/16/american-petroleum-institute/group-gets-it-close-oilgas-jobs-georgia/	Anything that has to do with jobs captures the scribes’ eyes here at PolitiFact Georgia. And it was an eye-popping number of jobs that the American Petroleum Institute attributed to the oil and gas industry in a recent press release. "The oil and natural gas industry provides or supports 141,600 jobs in Georgia," according to the blog posting designed to highlight the economic and job impact the energy industry has on the Peach State. This for a state that has yet to produce a single drop of commercially produced gas or oil, we wondered? The numbers The API cited a 2013 report that it commissioned, Economic Impacts of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry on the U.S. Economy in 2011, from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The report includes state-by-state breakdowns on how many jobs have been created, as well as the overall economic impact of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. The analysis arrives at the 141,600 job estimate first with data from the U.S. bureaus of Economic Analysis and of Labor Statistics for a dozen job codes. The report breaks that job tally into three categories. It says 42,638 jobs were directly involved in the oil and natural gas industry. That includes the expected extraction and production jobs and – as we will get to in a moment – a total of 29,146 jobs at gas stations with and without convenience stores. If that were the only category, those jobs would account for just 0.8 percent of all Georgia jobs. But the report classifies another 33,502 workers as indirectly involved in the oil and gas industry, or with positions in activities in outside industries that supply those fields. Drew Lyon, principal and leader of the national economics and statistics group at PwC and the author of the report, said care was taken to eliminate double counts so that some suppliers who would have been in the direct jobs tally were removed. Then the largest number of jobs -- 65,490 -- are counted as "induced" jobs. Lyon said those are the positions that are created to meet the demand from the spending of employees in the direct and indirect jobs. In that category, the general "service" field has by far the most indirect and induced jobs, with 43,349 workers – or 711 more employees than work directly for the oil and natural gas industries. Considering those jobs are apt to be in professional services, healthcare, education and the like – all known powerhouses in metro Atlanta’s economy -- those numbers are not surprising. And to Lyon, they show how many of those back office jobs -- say in human resources -- owe their existence to an industry thought of as minor in the Peach State. "It’s no surprise, for example, that a significant amount of employment in Texas is directly related to oil and gas," Lyon said. "But it’s of interest in how other states, either as suppliers to in-state or out-of-state producers, or through some of these other industries, are impacted by the oil and gas industry." Taken together, that brings the total to 141,600 jobs, or 2.7 percent of the Georgia workforce. But is it fair to count all of those jobs, knowing that two thirds of the positions in question are outside the oil and gas industries? Bruce Seaman, an economist at Georgia State’s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said he was not troubled with the methodology of the study. The report took care not to count jobs twice and also used commonly accepted input-output models to show the known relationships between industries (Basically, the output from one industry become inputs in another but must be adjusted not to exaggerate the impact). That said, Seaman wondered about the service station employees, who primarily are not working as pump attendants or mechanics. Especially at stations with stores, those workers are apt to run the cash registers, do janitorial work or even cook. "Those jobs are more accurately convenience store retail jobs," Seaman said. The BLS codes back up that assessment, listing those positions as retail, versus the mining or production jobs expected in oil and gas. Lyon said PwC included those gas station positions as a best estimate of companies and jobs that exist only because of the gas and oil industry. Reid Porter, a spokesman at API, agreed, adding "What happens in the oil and natural gas industry reverberates throughout the entire economy." Our ruling The American Petroleum Institute recently released a series of press releases, drawing attention to the economic impact of the oil and gas industry on every state. Georgia, it said, has 141,600 jobs provided or supported by oil and gas. A 2011 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers backs up the number by looking at direct positions in the industry, supportive jobs and, accounting for most of the workers, all of the positions created from the industry and its supply chain. The math and economics are right – to a point. But careful examination of the report shows that 68 percent of the jobs counted as directly working in the oil and gas industry could just as easily be classified as retail workers. Adjusting the base number up by 29,146 workers, then, amplifies the number of jobs that support the industry or caters to its whims. The report is clear that it counts those positions, though. And the claim takes care to say the industry "supports" that large number of workers. It’s accurate, but somewhat misleading. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-06360	Proof of citizenship isn't necessary before you register to vote in Florida.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/nov/04/alan-hays/sen-alan-hays-says-proof-citizenship-isnt-necessar/	Florida state Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatilla, ignited a firestorm of criticism when he said congressional districts should not be drawn to benefit potentially illegal Hispanic immigrants and that the state should first check their citizenship. Here's what Hays said at an Oct. 18, 2011, meeting of the Senate reapportionment committee: "Before we design a district anywhere in the state of Florida for Hispanic voters, we need to ascertain that they are citizens of the United States. We all know there are many Hispanic speaking people in Florida that are not legal, and I just don't think that it's right that we try to draw a district that encompasses people that really have no business voting anyhow. If we know registered voters are people who have proven their citizenship then that's a completely different story, but I'm not aware of any proof of citizenship necessary before you register to vote." Reapportionment is a once-in-a-decade process that divides the U.S. House's 435 seats among the states based on the results of the U.S. census. In 2012, Florida will add two new congressional seats as part of that realignment. It's up to Hays and the other members of the state House and Senate to redraw the maps to include the two new seats. What Hays might have been getting at in his comments (we don't know for sure because his spokesman said he didn't want to comment) is that the census attempts to include all people living in the United States, including illegal immigrants, children and legal immigrants who cannot vote. So while some people are talking about a proposal to draw a Hispanic-majority congressional district in Central Florida -- an area that has seen considerable growth in the Puerto Rican population -- Hays was at least suggesting it was possible that many people living there might be doing so illegally. Therefore, according to his thinking, they should not have a seat drawn to benefit them. We'll get one thing out of the way: People from Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens and have been since 1917. If they're living in Florida, they are eligible to vote in Florida. But what about the requirements to register to vote? Hays said you don't need to prove that you're a citizen in order to cast a ballot. That's what this Truth-O-Meter item will focus on. Registering to vote Floridians can register to vote a variety of ways -- but the most common registration method is at driver's license offices. In 2010, more than 270,000 people registered to vote at driver's license offices. The second-most common method was what the state division of elections calls the "other" category, which includes registering in person at supervisors of elections offices. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, better known as the Motor-Voter law, went into effect in 1995 in Florida and was intended to boost turnout by allowing residents to register to vote at driver's license offices, other federally designated voter registration agencies and by mail. The national law does not address the question of proof of citizenship, but each state has its own laws about registration requiring that only citizens vote, according to Bryan Whitener, a spokesman for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. In Florida when drivers apply for a driver's license, they must provide proof that they are in the country legally. U.S. citizens could show a passport or a proper birth certificate to verify their citizenship. Immigrants who are not U.S. citizens would have to provide the proper visa. Applicants who prove they are citizens are asked if they want to apply to register to vote, said Ann Howard, spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The driver's license office then sends along that voter registration application to the Secretary of State. Applicants who are not citizens are not given the option to register to vote, Howard said. But non-citizens may still obtain a driver's licenses if they are in the country legally -- including immigrants who have green cards, Howard said. The documentation requirements to get driver's licenses have been tightened as part of the Real ID Act implemented in Florida in 2010 as part of a nationwide effort to tighten the security of driver's licenses and state IDs to fight terrorism. This state website about the Real ID Act explains the criteria for citizens and non-citizens to get driver's licenses. By December 2017, everyone in the U.S. will need a license that is compliant with the Real ID Act in order to fly or enter federal facilities. But what if someone walks into a supervisor of elections office and asks to register to vote? In those cases, people registering to vote must sign an oath on a registration application attesting that they are qualified to vote and that all the information on the application is true. (Usually at driver's licenses offices applicants who want to apply to register to vote don't have to sign that particular form since the office already has their signature as part of the driver's license application process.) The application includes a question: Are you a citizen of the United States? If you answer no, the form says "you cannot register to vote." We asked state Division of Elections spokesman Chris Cate if the state does anything to verify citizenship. "The answer is no," he said. "The law doesn't require someone to provide proof of citizenship when they register. If they swear, attest and sign under oath that their information is accurate and that they are a citizen we will accept their voter registration." State law does not require any new voter applicant to provide proof or evidence of eligibility other than a sworn statement that he or she satisfies all the requirements to be able to register -- including being a citizen (or being 18, or living in Florida), Cate told us in an e-mail. The only information that is required to be verified is a personal identifying number such as a driver's license number or state ID or the last four digits of their social security number. It's possible for non-citizens to have those documents, and the purpose of providing them is to verify identity -- not citizenship. A person who willfully submits false voter registration information or votes knowing that he or she isn't qualified to vote can be charged with a third-degree felony. Individual supervisors of elections do have the ability to determine if an applicant is an U.S. citizen, Cate said, though it would be difficult for a supervisor to ascertain citizenship. Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho said the state doesn't "forbid any election official from determining the eligibility of any voter -- that is the role of any supervisor of elections. The state has no requirement for checking citizenship and there is no easy way to do it since the INS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) is not available to do any checking." But Sancho said the idea that illegal residents are voting is "laughable it's so wrong." "We are not seeing any problem with illegal citizens voting in the U.S. anywhere, not just in Tallahassee or Florida. It's a canard that illegal individuals are registering and voting. ... Voting requires putting your name and address on an official document and that is not something undocumented individuals tend to do." The local elections supervisor in Hays' own district, Lake County, sees it the same way. "We've never had a problem with illegal voting in Lake County, no way,'' said Emogene W. Stegall, who has served in the county's election's office for 40 years. Cate said the state doesn't track how many times non-citizens attempt to, or actually manage to, register to vote. Our ruling Sen. Hays said that Florida doesn't require "any proof of citizenship necessary before you register to vote." There is a kernel of truth here: According to the state Division of Elections, state law doesn't require new voter applicants to prove their citizenship in some physical sense. They simply must sign a sworn statement attesting that they meet the voting requirements -- including being a citizen. But there are a couple of critical caveats. First, willfully lying on a voter registration form about your citizenship status can lead to a felony conviction. Second, the most common way to register to vote in Florida is during the process of obtaining a driver's license -- in 2010, 57 percent of those who registered to vote in Florida chose that method. And during that process, people are asked to verify their citizenship. Lastly, we have to consider the experiences of two actual supervisor of elections, who said there is no widespread problem of illegal immigrants registering to vote. For those reasons, we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Alan Hays	None	None	None	2011-11-04T09:45:04	2011-10-18	['None']

pomt-01676	In Ferguson, Mo., "you've got three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/17/andrea-mitchell/ferguson-police-department-has-50-white-officers-t/	Sunday show talking heads brought up a staggering statistic to explain racial division and outrage in Ferguson, Mo., surrounding the killing of an unarmed black teen by a white police officer. Viewers of the Sunday shows heard variations of the same claim: The majority of Ferguson’s residents are black, but black police officers make up just a sliver of city law enforcement. The point was made on ABC's This Week by Cedric Alexander, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, and on NBC’s Meet the Press by U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell. "You've got three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American," said Mitchell, who hosted the Aug. 17 show in place of ousted moderator David Gregory. (Gregory’s full-time replacement is Chuck Todd, who starts Sept. 7.) PunditFact confirmed her claim is largely accurate. The racial makeup of the police force emerged as a widely reported story line after the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by white officer Darren Wilson, 28. Mitchell’s statistic about Ferguson’s black population checks out through the city’s QuickFacts profile from the U.S. Census Bureau. As of 2010, 67.4 percent of the city’s 21,000 residents are black, and 29.3 percent are white. The state of Missouri, by comparison, is 83 percent white and 11 percent black. Ferguson’s black population was almost nonexistent four decades ago, when 99 percent of the population in 1970 was white, Census data show. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who is white, said the police department has 53 officers, three of whom are black, according to the Los Angeles Times and the Associated Press. He also said that the other 50 officers are white, according to newspaper reports. Put another way, Ferguson police officers are 94 percent white and 5.6 percent black. Timothy Zoll, a spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, said Sunday that there actually are four African-American officers among the 53-person officer corps. "The discrepancy may have been that we really don't see black or white among our colleagues," Zoll said. So there is some question whether the number is three or four, but there is no question that an imbalance exists. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles, who is also white, has addressed the lack of diversity in the police department. According to an Aug. 12 report by St. Louis-based TV station KSDK, Knowles told reporters that young African-Americans aren’t interested in police jobs. Knowles said: "We hire everyone that we can get. There's also the problem that a lot of young African-American people don't want to go into law enforcement. They already have this disconnect with law enforcement, so if we find people who want to go into law enforcement who are African-American we're all over it because we want them to help us bridge the gap." The lack of racial diversity on the police force compared with the city population is not unique to Ferguson. It’s actually comparable to other cities its size around the country. A 2007 Department of Justice survey of local police departments found the national average for all local police was 75 percent white. The average for an agency serving a city around Ferguson’s population was 87.5 percent white. Missouri law requires the state’s attorney general to issue an annual Vehicle Stops Report detailing demographic information for people pulled over by officers in each city. In 2013, the attorney general’s office reported that black drivers in Ferguson were about twice as likely to be arrested after police stops than whites. Blacks made up 93 percent of 2013 arrests after car stops. Our ruling Mitchell said Ferguson has "three black officers and 50 white officers with a town that is 67 percent African-American." This claim has emerged as a central talking point in the fallout from Brown’s shooting. Her numbers are backed up by news reports quoting the city's police chief and Census data. The only caveat is that a police spokesman now says that the department has four African-Americans, while the chief previously has said three. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14905	"My plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/nov/05/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-middle-class-get-biggest-tax-break-u/	Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said at a recent debate that his plan to streamline the tax system will benefit everyone, but it will benefit the middle class the most. "Look, the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family," Bush said during the Oct. 28, 2015, CNBC debate. He added that simplifying the tax code will boost economic growth. We wondered, does the middle class really stand to benefit the most from Bush’s proposed tax cuts? That could be accurate if you examine the rates in a particular way, experts told us, but in practice it’s likely the highest earners would see the real windfall from Bush’s plan. The Reform and Growth Act of 2017 Bush released his tax plan in September 2015, with an emphasis on streamlining the code, lowering rates and easing up on corporate taxes. Some analyses point out the plan could add to the budget deficit. Bush’s plan: • Cuts the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three with rates of 10, 25 and 28 percent, down from a current top rate of 39.6 percent; • Lowers the top corporate tax rate and taxes on capital gains to 20 percent; • Eliminates the estate tax, gift tax, Alternative Minimum Tax and the Affordable Care Act (and its 3.8 percent surtax on investment income); • Limits itemized deductions to 2 percent of adjusted gross income, except for charitable contributions, and eliminates deductions for state and local taxes; • Increases standard deductions for single filers by $5,000 and for joint filers by $10,000 and doubles Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers. It’s the last point that Bush’s campaign has claimed will be one of the biggest boosts to the middle class. There are myriad ways to define "middle class," but several experts told us a good rule of thumb is a family of four making the median family income, which was $53,657 in 2014. When we asked the Bush campaign for specifics, they referred us to the plan online, which includes a table showing their calculations for how the changes would affect certain levels of income. According to Bush, the savings after paying taxes are a higher percentage gain for middle incomes than for higher incomes. Some analysts and economists we contacted said that $2,000 figure could be about right, considering the difference in the 25- and 28-percent tax brackets Bush proposes. But one caveat is that his comparison is only counting people who take the standard deduction when filing their income tax returns. Because people with higher incomes tend to itemize, that means the sample of wealthy people to which Bush is comparing his middle class savings is much smaller than it could be. Vanessa Williamson, a governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said roughly 90 percent of people making more than $100,000 per year itemize, and higher for people who earn more than that. Only about 58 percent of people making between $50,000 and $75,000 itemize. "Wealthier people are not, as a general rule, filling out the 1040EZ and calling it a day," said Williamson said. "The vast majority of high-income people itemize their taxes ... and cut their taxes a great deal by doing so." (Think Warren Buffet paying just 17 percent.) Now, Bush’s plan does limit the value of itemized deductions, and many middle-class families would benefit from a higher standard deduction. Some researchers think this plan will significantly decrease the number of people who itemize by simplifying their returns. Other analyses, however, show that the highest earners get a much bigger break than Bush has implied, because they would benefit disproportionately from changes like lowering corporate taxes and repealing the estate tax. One report by research group Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates for tax fairness, said the middle fifth of earners would see a 3.2 percent change in their income, but the top 1 percent would realize a 10.2 percent benefit. They said middle income families would be getting $1,572 back, but the top 1 percent would average more than $177,000. The pro-business Tax Foundation examined the plan, too. A projection based on exceptionally robust growth showed middle earners saw their adjusted gross incomes go up as much as 12.9 percent over an unspecified length of time. The top 1 percent’s incomes would go up 16.4 percent. Our ruling Bush said, "My plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break: $2,000 per family." Middle-class families could potentially realize a higher percentage tax break, based on Bush’s plan. But that’s only counting those who would file their tax returns using the standard deduction, something the wealthy aren’t likely to do. Even with caps on itemized deductions, a range of experts said the wealthiest Americans stand to benefit more than the middle class, thanks to Bush’s proposed changes in corporate, estate and other taxes. Bush’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08479	"According to independent analysis, unfair trade deals have resulted in the loss of over 64,000 jobs in Wisconsin ... But Ron Johnson favors those deals."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/12/russ-feingold/sen-russ-feingold-says-unfair-trade-deals-have-cos/	Even in a U.S. Senate contest of ideological near-opposites, the gap between Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold and Republican challenger Ron Johnson on trade issues is notable. Feingold, supported by labor unions, consistently has voted against foreign-trade agreements over his three terms, saying they unfairly punish Wisconsin workers -- especially on the manufacturing line. Johnson, the manufacturing plant executive, extols global trade as the gateway to job growth and higher profits, citing his own Oshkosh firm as an example. There are unfortunate casualties, he says, but they are necessary to boost employment overall. With the unemployment rate stubbornly high, a new TV and radio ad blitz from Feingold is aimed at hitting home with disgruntled workers. Here is the central claim, stated on the radio, implied with graphics on TV: "According to independent analysis, unfair trade deals have resulted in the loss of over 64,000 jobs in Wisconsin. That’s why Russ Feingold has consistently voted against them. But Ron Johnson favors those deals." There is a lot in that statement, but we’ll take it apart piece by piece. First, the trade deals being cited are those such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). The radio ad cites no source or time frame for the 64,000 number, but Feingold senior campaign strategist John Kraus says it came from a database generated by Global Trade Watch, a project of the liberal consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Is that group independent, as the ad claims? Public Citizen is a leading critical voice on trade deals, so it comes to the issue from that perspective. The group holds Feingold in high regard because his stance fits the group’s agenda. It has publicly praised Feingold for campaign finance reform and his trade votes, and even filed a legal brief with the U.S. Supreme Court against a challenge to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reforms. With that in mind, let’s look at the origin of the numbers. The group’s job-loss database is based on U.S. Department of Labor data from a program that helps workers who have lost their jobs as a result of foreign trade. It’s called the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The U.S. Department of Labor does not use that data to measure job losses due to foreign trade, a spokesman said, because of undercounting (not every company or union applies to the voluntary program) and overcounting (some workers apply but aren’t ultimately laid off). The department doesn’t specify the extent of either over- or under-counting. But researchers, even pro-trade deal ones, say the Labor Department program serves only a fraction of those who lose their jobs in industries facing heavy import competition. A 1999 study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics -- a group in favor of free trade -- found that only 10% of those workers showed up in the federal program. Indeed, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a Peterson Institute expert, said the data is commonly used by researchers as the best available for showing how trade can close factories. The 64,000 figure cited by Feingold goes back to 1994, when NAFTA kicked in. When PolitiFact Wisconsin downloaded company-by-company figures from the group’s database, it came up with the same figure. But there’s a larger issue on claims of job loss. Looking at one side of the coin, as Feingold does, provides a one-sided view. It does not take into account job gains made elsewhere in part by trade agreements. Said Hufbauer: "It isn’t the whole story." Hufbauer said trade deals had helped fuel big increases in trade, though in his view the business climate, monetary policy and spending policy are much bigger drivers for job losses and gains than trade pacts. So, in presenting only one side of the coin, Feingold leaves out important context. This leaves us with Feingold’s suggestion that the trade deals he opposed -- and Johnson supports -- were "unfair." The characterization depends on your point of view. In short, Feingold believes they are "unfair" to workers who lose their jobs. Johnson says they are fair because long-term they are the engine behind the wheels of capitalism. Johnson says he would not support an "unfair"’ deal. He has not addressed every trade deal specifically, but at a July WisPolitics luncheon, Johnson did say he would have supported NAFTA, favored-nation status for China and the pending Korea-U.S. trade pact. Feingold uses quotes from that luncheon in his ad, including this one:. "Yeah, I think history has proven if you really take a look at the economic statistics, free trade works, so I’m definitely supportive." Johnson emphasized "free and fair" trade, something omitted from the ad. The ad also quotes Johnson as saying: "In a free market capitalist system, there are always winners and losers. It’s creative destruction." The ad leaves off the rest of the "creative destruction" quote: Johnson said the natural cycle of business births and deaths was unfortunate, "but let’s face it -- if it weren’t for that we’d still have buggy whip companies." So where does this leave us? Russ Feingold uses Ron Johnson’s own words to capture his rival’s support for several trade deals that Feingold asserts cost the state some 64,000 jobs. The source of the analysis is not independent, as Feingold claims, but it uses numbers both sides agree are the best available -- and ones that may vastly understate the number of jobs lost. Nevertheless, those numbers leave out the other side of the equation -- jobs created through the deals. As for defining the deals as "unfair," it is a characterization by Feingold that is disputed by Johnson. We rate Feingold’s claim Half True.

pomt-01885	"Thanks to #ObamaCare, average E.R. wait in California is 5 hours."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/08/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-thanks-barack-obama-five-/	Republican criticism of Obamacare may have been overtaken by other talking points -- from the influx of unaccompanied minors at the border to the Internal Revenue Service’s handling of tax-exempt organizations -- but it hasn’t disappeared entirely. On July 7, 2014, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus sent the following tweet: "Thanks to #ObamaCare, average E.R. wait in California is 5 hours: http://gop.cm/6015YqKd And 'it’s only going to get worse.' " The tweet is based on, and links to, a July 4 report aired on the Fresno, Calif.-based TV station KMPH, a Fox affiliate. "If you have to go to an emergency room get ready to wait more than five hours," says the Web version of the KMPH report. "Right now, that is the average wait in the state of California. Health experts say you can blame Obamacare and Covered California for that long wait and they say it's only going to get worse. One of the promised benefits of the Affordable Care Act was to reduce the pressure on emergency rooms by expanding Medicaid and giving the poor better access to primary care. But instead, a survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians suggests something else. The organization says President Obama's health care reform actually has had a destructive effect on the nation's emergency rooms." (The version that aired is archived here.) But when we took a closer look, we found several problems -- including that the alleged 5-hour wait time was measured before the health care law took effect. What does 'average E.R. wait' mean? Actually, there isn’t just one definition. A study published in October 2013 by the California HealthCare Foundation offered three different measurements. The one Priebus references is "patient arrival to being admitted to hospital as inpatient." For California, this wait was five hours and 26 minutes -- longer than the national average of four hours and 34 minutes. But this is by far the longest of the three measures. The second longest is "patient arrival to emergency room departure for discharged patients" -- basically, the entire length of the visit for someone who isn’t actually admitted as an inpatient after being seen by the E.R. For Californians, this wait time was two hours and 49 minutes, once again a bit higher than the national average of two hours and 19 minutes. The third measurement is by far the shortest -- "patient arrival to being seen by health care professional." In California, this was 31 minutes, slightly more than the national average of 29 minutes. One might take away from Priebus’ tweet that someone going to a California E.R. can expect a wait of more than five hours just to get in to see a doctor or a nurse. In reality, they’re seeing a health professional in about a half an hour -- and if their injury or illness isn’t serious enough to keep them in the hospital overnight, then they’re on their way home in under three hours. For those patients, their entire visit is much shorter than the five hours Priebus indicates. Steven Birenbaum, a spokesman for the California HealthCare Foundation, said the wait time to see a health professional -- the shortest of the three measures -- is actually the most useful statistic in this context, because the longer figure "mainly reflects the inpatient service and how full the hospitals is." Julie Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said there’s no "definitive answer" on which measurement is better. Her group focuses more on the wait time to admission or discharge, but she said hospitals market themselves based on wait time to see a doctor. The wait time to see a doctor is likely more familiar to ordinary Americans. Are long E.R. waits really due to Obamacare? At this point, any link between the Affordable Care Act and longer E.R. waiting times is speculative at best, because post-ACA data on wait times do not yet exist. The data from the California HealthCare Foundation is from 2012 -- in other words, long before provisions of the law began taking effect on Jan. 1, 2014. "It is too early to confirm that wait times are increasing under the ACA, due to the delay in data being released," Birenbaum said. Indeed, E.R. wait times "have been a serious problem for many years," said Lloyd of the emergency physicians’ group. "This is not anything new. It is often incorrectly blamed on nonurgent patients, who only comprise 7 percent to 8 percent of all E.R. patients." The real reasons for long wait times, Lloyd said, include "increasingly complex workups for patients, particularly older patients with multiple health problems, and the hospital practice of ‘boarding.’ ‘Boarding’ occurs when a patient admitted to the hospital from the E.R. is held in the E.R. while waiting for an inpatient bed. That ties up a bed and physicians’ attention, preventing them from getting to the next patients in line. Some patients are boarded for many, many hours." This doesn’t mean there’s no support at all for the notion that the ACA has complicated matters for emergency rooms. An online survey of 1,845 emergency physicians, conducted in April 2014 by the American College of Emergency Physicians, found evidence that caseloads had increased since the start of Obamacare -- though even here, the results were mixed. The TV report that Priebus linked to cited this recent survey. When asked whether the volume of emergency patients in their own E.R. had changed since Jan. 1, 2014, 9 percent said it had increased greatly and 37 percent said it had increased slightly. However, a larger percentage said it had remained the same (27 percent), decreased slightly (20 percent) or decreased greatly (3 percent). And while 86 percent of emergency physicians said they expected to see an increase in emergency visits over the next three years, it’s not clear that the ACA will be the dominant -- or even a significant -- reason for this. When asked what type of long-term impact the Affordable Care Act will have on access to emergency care, "positive" (34 percent) outweighed "negative" (29 percent), with another 29 percent saying it would have no impact. It’s also worth noting that the survey data -- the only post-ACA data we have -- speaks to patient volume in emergency rooms. It doesn’t speak to wait times, which was the focus of both the KMPH report and Priebus’ tweet. Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, stood by the KMPH story the tweet cited. "If you have to go to an emergency room, get ready to wait more than five hours," she said. "Right now, that is the average wait in the state of California. Health experts say you can blame Obamacare and Covered California for that long wait and they say it's only going to get worse." KMPH did not return an inquiry for this article. But Birenbaum of the California HealthCare Foundation added a footnote: The San Joaquin Valley, where the TV segment was reported, "has one of the lowest rates of primary care physicians to population. It would make sense that patients often end up" in the E.R. Our ruling In a tweet, Priebus said, "Thanks to #ObamaCare, average E.R. wait in California is 5 hours." The statistic was based on data from 2012 -- two years before the provisions of the ACA could have had any impact. Meanwhile, the five-hour figure is just one of three measurements of E.R. wait times -- and not even necessarily the best one. If you count from the time of a patient's arrival to being seen by a health care professional, the wait time was 31 minutes in California. Even the strongest support for the claim is far from solid: A survey of emergency physicians found signs that E.R. traffic had increased since the ACA took effect in January, but the results were mixed, and this documents patient volume, not wait times. We rate the claim False.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2014-07-08T16:13:37	2014-07-07	['California']

pomt-01130	"Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago."	true	/texas/statements/2014/dec/23/kevin-brady/kevin-brady-says-sales-tax-deduction-has-saved-tex/	A declaration about how Texans have benefited from a federal tax deduction led Austin economist Stuart Greenfield to call for the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Greenfield asked us about the accuracy of a statement by U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Houston, in a Dec. 17, 2014, press release issued after the U.S. Senate agreed with the House to extend the ability of Texas taxpayers to deduct sales taxes on federal income tax returns. Brady, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said: "Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago." Greenfield speculated the $10 billion figure was an overstatement. Congressman’s back-up information To our inquiry, Brady spokeswoman Tracee Evans pointed out a news story posted online Sept. 22, 2014, by the Dallas Morning News. That story said that according to the Texas state comptroller’s office, if Congress failed to extend the option of deducting state and local sales taxes, Texans would owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April 2015. Evans emailed us: "If it’s $1.2 billion a year, extrapolate that over ten years and what do you get?" In most states, the News’ story noted, taxpayers can deduct state income tax payments from their federal tax bill. And since 2004, Congress has let taxpayers in states with no income tax — Texas and six others — deduct state and local sales taxes instead. In 2012, the story said, 2.3 million Texas filers (about one in five) used the sales tax deduction with the average deduction for those who claimed it being $1,906, according to a September 2014 Pew Charitable Trusts report. We asked the comptroller’s office about the cited estimate. By phone, spokesman Chris Bryan said its revenue-estimating experts reached the $1.2 billion figure by taking the total amount deducted by Texans for sales tax in 2012 -- $4,353,996,000 -- and multiplying that by what its experts calculated to be the average marginal tax rate that year, 27 percent. So, the calculation suggests, Texans who took the deduction in 2012 reduced their federal income taxes by an estimated $1.18 billion all together. (We ran the same numbers, starting from an IRS chart showing federal taxes paid by Texas residents in 2012, reaching the same result.) In October 2007, Evans pointed out, State Comptroller Susan Combs estimated the deduction was saving Texans $1 billion a year. Bryan told us, though, the office doesn’t routinely estimate the effect of the deduction and doesn’t have a 10-year impact figure. Greenfield, apprised of the comptroller’s approach, said its methodology and Brady’s cumulative figure seemed to add up after all. Texas tax expert: Beneficiaries tend to be higher-income earners Separately, Dick Lavine, a tax analyst for the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, stressed by email that Texans at higher income levels disproportionately enjoy the deduction, which only helps taxpayers who itemize deductions. In 2012, 39 percent of Texas filers with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 to $100,000 took the deduction; 14 percent of filers with earnings of $25,000 to $50,000 did so. Lavine pointed out, too, that Texans deducted $3.2 billion in 2004, the first year the deduction was restored, which might indicate the value of the deduction in reduced taxes over 10 years might be less than $10 billion, he said, especially if the marginal tax rate on average was 25 percent. PolitiFact estimate To reach a savings estimate of our own, we added up all the sales tax deductions claimed by Texas residents for 2004 through 2012, as reported by the IRS. A figure for 2013 has yet to be posted by the agency so we reached an estimate for that year based on averaging what Texans deducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012. All this ultimately led us to estimate the Texas deductions over the decade totaled nearly $40 billion. Next, we calculated the likely tax savings -- that is, money not paid by Texas residents to Uncle Sam thanks to these deductions. Assuming the 27 percent marginal tax rate applied by the comptroller’s office to 2012, the deduction would have left $10.8 billion in Texas pocketbooks over the 10 years. At a 25 percent marginal rate, Texans’ money not spent on federal taxes would have amounted to nearly $10 billion ($9.998 billion, by our calculation.) Asked to comment on our calculations, Alan Cole, an economist for the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, a non-partisan tax policy research organization, emailed that he would have taken a similar tack. He also cautioned, though, that individuals who take the deduction tend to earn more and hence have higher marginal tax rates, which could justify a larger 10-year savings estimate. Our ruling Brady said: "Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago." While that’s a squishy figure -- an estimate that can’t be pinned as a fact unless you somehow divine every Texan’s marginal tax rate for each of the 10 years, for starters -- it appears to be reasonable. It’s also so that families that had these savings were mostly better off; lower-income taxpayers tend not to itemize deductions. We rate the statement True.

pomt-03844	Eighty-five percent of Floridians who will benefit from expanding Medicaid are "single, childless adults."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/mar/15/will-weatherford/weatherford-says-85-percent-people-covered-medicai/	House Speaker Will Weatherford offered a compelling personal story to emphasize his support for a robust social safety net despite his stance against expanding Medicaid under the federal health care law. Weatherford’s parents relied on a safety net program -- he didn’t say which one in his speech on the opening day of the legislative session -- to pay medical bills for his 20-month-old brother Peter, who died from cancer. That program, Weatherford’s father told the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald, was funded with Medicaid dollars. The news angered advocates of the expansion who said Weatherford wanted to deny other families relief that helped his own. "I should have done a better job, and I take ownership of that, of having more facts before I gave my speech," Weatherford said on March 8, 2013. "But it doesn’t change my belief, which is that what we’re talking about is 85 percent of the expansion are for single, childless adults. That’s what this Medicaid expansion goes to. Single, childless adults, it puts them on a government-run system that we potentially will have to pay for." Weatherford’s main complaint seems to be that these people are "able-bodied," as he put it (i.e. slackers). We wanted to give Weatherford’s stat, so instrumental in his opposition to the expansion, the PolitiFact Florida treatment. Weatherford was referring to internal figures determined by budget experts on his staff, said spokesman Ryan Duffy. But Duffy quickly acknowledged that Weatherford quoted the wrong numbers, which were derived from data supplied by the Legislature’s Social Services Estimating Conference on March 7. The 85 percent figure Weatherford cited for "single, childless adults" was actually an estimate of all adults who would be covered if Medicaid expanded. (The House's actual estimate is 82 percent.) How many of that group would single and childless? We don't know. The state didn't estimate that. The closest it came was estimating the impact on childless adults. Duffy said 62 percent of those who would receive Medicaid as part of the expansion would be childless adults. (That makes sense because childless adults currently cannot receive Medicaid under any circumstances in Florida. The expansion would change that.) We wondered what other experts know about the percentage of childless adults -- again we can't measure childless and single -- who could get Medicaid coverage under an expansion. The state’s chief economist, Amy Baker, told us there are many ways of analyzing who could be covered by the Medicaid expansion. Her group, the Legislative Office of Economic and Demographic Research, identified a pool of 1,079,337 potential Medicaid beneficiaries using public microdata from the American Community Survey. Of that pool, 87 percent were adults 19 and over. Childless adults comprise 67 percent of beneficiaries, Baker said. Non-disabled childless adults (excluding 19- and 20-year-olds) would be 61.8 percent. The Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, which supports the expansion, came up with its own breakdown of who would benefit from the expansion. By the center’s calculations, about 58 percent of the newly eligible would be childless adults. We should note the center uses a larger pool of newly eligible enrollees than Baker’s group, about 1.3 million people. The center offers a deeper dive into that population: About 22 percent are childless adults who do not have jobs. About 25 percent represent childless workers. The other 10 percent is comprised of young adults age 19-25 and the disabled. (There was not a way to extract the disabled from the center's calculations.) "This is NOT the number of newly eligible adults that we think would actually enroll in Medicaid," said Greg Mellowe, FCEFP director of health research and analysis. "In fact, not all of those who appear to be eligible based on income will even qualify due to other factors such as immigration status." So what about our ruling? We know Weatherford’s assertion that 85 percent of the expansion’s beneficiaries would be childless adults is wrong. (He later corrected the number in an op-ed for the Tampa Bay Times.) The number should have been, by the House’s calculation, 62 percent. Weatherford, however, erred additionally by referring to only "single" adults. No one measures that. Weatherford is off on his number and his characterization. Yet, the statement contains an element of truth in that Medicaid is expected to benefit childless adults more than any other population.

pomt-02962	"Wisconsin is not as obese as the national average is. The national average, 35.7 percent of the population is obese. In Wisconsin, it's closer to 26 percent."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/24/tommy-thompson/former-governor-says-wisconsin-not-obese-national-/	Editor’s note: On Oct. 7, 2013, we rated this statement True. Several readers cited additional information we hadn’t considered, so we have issued a new rating. Since losing to Democrat Tammy Baldwin in a U.S. Senate race in 2012, former Republican Wisconsin governor and U.S. health and human services secretary Tommy Thompson has put energy into getting the nation into better shape. Thompson -- who, at 70, showed during the campaign he could do 50 push-ups -- gave a speech in Madison on Sept. 25, 2013, about obesity in America. In an interview the same day with WISC-TV (Channel 3) in Madison, Thompson made a claim that might surprise those us who push our love handles out of the way to make sure we don’t miss a belt loop. After Thompson stated that "we are not very healthy in America," one of his interviewers said, "Well, in Wisconsin, it’s a particular battle. We’re always battling. We’re one of the fattest states in the country." Thompson responded by saying: "Yes, we are (battling)," he said. "But you know something, but you look at the statistics, and across the board, and Wisconsin is not as obese as the national average is. The national average, 35.7 percent of the population is obese. In Wisconsin, it's closer to 26 percent. "So, one out of four, versus one out of three. That’s still not very good, but the truth of the matter is, we’re healthier. But we have to do a better job, in Wisconsin as well as across the country." Beer-bellied Wisconsin has less-than-average obesity? What’s "obese?" We went to the CDC, a corner tavern, to check on Thompson’s claim. Just kidding. CDC, of course, is short for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It defines obesity as something less than you might imagine. Height and weight are used to calculate a body mass index. Your BMI determines whether you’re considered obese. An adult, male or female, who is 5-feet-9 and 203 pounds or more is considered obese. The CDC notes that although BMI is correlated with body fat, BMI doesn’t actually measure body fat. So, some people, such as athletes, may have a body mass index that identifies them as overweight even though they do not have excess body fat. At the same time, obesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Now, that Uncle Sam has us feeling unduly chubby, let’s check Thompson’s claim against the statistics. Apples and oranges On a national level, CDC calculates obesity rates by weighing and measuring a sampling of the population. The most recent figures are from a January 2012 report. In 2009-2010, an estimated 35.7 percent of U.S. adults were obese. No estimates using measurements are done for the various states. Conversely, at the state level, height and weight are self-reported by Americans who participate in phone surveys conducted by state health departments. This type of study can produce lower-than-reality obesity rates, according to CDC, because some people overstate their height and understate their weight. Indeed, in the phone surveys, no state had an obesity rate above the 35.7 percent found in the national survey in which people were actually measured. The CDC told us that, given the different methodologies, comparing the two studies would be like comparing apples to oranges. The latest state data available when Thompson made his statement was for 2012. Based on the responses in the phone survey, 29.7 percent of Wisconsin residents were rated obese. Nationwide, the figure was 28.1 percent. So, Wisconsin’s obesity rate was slightly higher than the national rate in the telephone survey study. That gives a very different impression that what Thompson said. Meanwhile, here’s how Wisconsin's 29.7 percent obesity rate in the phone survey compared with neighboring states: Michigan (31.1 percent), Iowa (30.4 percent), Illinois (28.1 percent) and Minnesota (25.7 percent). Our rating Thompson said: "Wisconsin is not as obese as the national average is. The national average, 35.7 percent of the population is obese. In Wisconsin, it's closer to 26 percent." In one study, 35.7 percent of American adults were estimated to be obese. In another study, which used a different methodology, the rate was 28.1 percent, slightly below Wisconsin’s 29.7 percent. The percentages cited by Thompson contain an element of truth, but the conclusion he drew isn’t valid because the two studies can’t be compared, so we rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-06371	"They talk about this problem with binding arbitration. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me to have somebody from Los Angeles fly into Zanesville and impose a wage settlement on you ... and then they’re on the plane back to Los Angeles."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/03/john-kasich/john-kasich-slams-use-out-state-arbitrators-contra/	The elimination of binding arbitration for public safety forces is among the changes Issue 2 would make to Ohio’s collective bargaining law. Binding arbitration calls on a neutral third party to settle an impasse in labor negotiations. This process is reserved for police, firefighters and other safety forces that cannot strike under Ohio law. Republican Gov. John Kasich, the most high-profile supporter of Issue 2, has consistently called for the elimination of binding arbitration because it allows an outside arbitrator who doesn’t understand local issues to settle labor disputes with taxpayer dollars at stake. Kasich recently described his opposition to binding arbitration at an event in Zanesville: "They talk about this problem with binding arbitration. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me to have somebody from Los Angeles fly into Zanesville and impose a wage settlement on you that you have to pay and then they’re on the plane back to Los Angeles." This is not the first time Kasich has characterized an arbitrator as an out-of-touch transient with little knowledge about issues facing local governments in Ohio. He described a similar scenario in a speech last December.(The Ohio Capital Blog recorded and archived both speeches.) With the Nov. 8 election just days away, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check one of the governor’s go-to arguments in favor of Issue 2, the most high-profile statewide issue on the fall ballot. A "yes" vote on Issue 2 would uphold Senate Bill 5, the new collective bargaining law that would restrict public workers’ collective bargaining power, ban public workers from striking, eliminate binding arbitration and make several other changes. A "no" vote would repeal SB 5. First, we looked at Ohio’s existing collective bargaining law, which was passed in 1983. The current law includes a "final offer settlement procedure," also known as binding arbitration, that is available to police, firefighters and other safety forces that cannot strike under Ohio law. Disputes involving teachers or other public workers afforded the right to strike cannot be settled through this procedure. Under binding arbitration, a neutral third party called a conciliator considers the final offers from both sides and imposes a settlement. A conciliator must be an Ohio resident, according to a provision in the state law that outlines the rules for binding arbitration. The law is cited on the State Employment Relations Board’s eligibility requirements to be a conciliator. SERB maintains the list of state-approved conciliators. Jay McDonald, president of the Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio, said he never understood why Kasich kept referring to arbitrators as people who swoop in from out of state to impose a wage settlement on local taxpayers. He recalled the speech Kasich gave last December, about a month after he was elected. We found the video, originally posted by the Ohio Capital Blog, online. Kasich’s words then mirror his talk in Zanesville on Halloween. "I don't know if you all know what biding arbitration is. When there's a labor dispute, they bring somebody in from Kokomo, Ind. He comes into Ohio, he imposes a settlement on our cities, he goes back to Kokomo and we pay the bill," Kasich said in December. McDonald said the only way such an outsider can settle an impasse is if the union and the employer agree to an alternative settlement process. We went back to the current collective bargaining law and found it does allow both sides to make their own rules for resolving disputes. The process is commonly referred to as a "MAD" (Mutual Alternative Dispute resolution procedure) and must be agreed to at least 45 days before their collective bargaining agreement expires. McDonald said police unions rarely enter into a MAD. "It’s definitely not common. I cannot tell you any off the top of my head," he said. When we checked Kasich’s claim with his staff, a spokesman pointed to the same alternative settlement process. "Under state law, a person can come in from outside Ohio and settle these disputes," Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said. Nichols said he considered certain alternative resolution procedures to be a type of binding arbitration. Further, Nichols said the governor’s main point was that someone from outside the community - whether from California, Kokomo or another place in Ohio - should not be making financial decisions for that community. "It’s someone who doesn’t have a stake in the financial state of the local government," he said. The fact remains an out-of-state mediator cannot resolve disputes under the state’s rules for binding arbitration - and that is the specific process Kasich has repeatedly criticized. And citing a procedure seldom used by safety forces, who are covered by the binding arbitration rules, doesn’t make this claim more accurate. And as the state government’s chief executive and leading spokesman for reforming the state’s collective bargaining rules for public employees, Kasich should know that. Rather, the governor has been stumping for Issue 2 arguing a point that is not accurate. That’s ridiculous. A statement that is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim gets a special rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Pants On Fire.

pomt-02054	Says Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., only needs about 40,000 to 50,000 votes to win election to Congress compared with the 120,000 votes King needs, because Waters has a higher immigrant population.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/30/steve-king/rep-steve-king-says-maxine-waters-wins-election-co/	Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, is one of the most outspoken opponents of illegal immigration in Congress. On May 22, 2014, during a speech on the House floor, he argued that proposals to overhaul immigration laws are a Trojan horse for Republicans, since allowing illegal immigrants a path to citizenship will boost the number of Democratic voters and eventually doom the GOP. This is not the first time King has made this argument. Just over a year ago, King said that Ronald Reagan was wrong to have signed an "amnesty" law in 1986 that "gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012." We found King’s math faulty and rated the claim False. This time, King sought to illustrate what’s at stake electorally by discussing how large immigrant populations can affect congressional elections. He said that while congressional districts are drawn to be roughly equal in population, the number of immigrants -- legal and illegal -- varies widely from district to district. "If you would go to a district in California like Maxine Waters' district, she only needs about 40,000 to 50,000 votes in her district to get re-elected to the United States Congress," King said. "If you go to my district, it is well over 120,000 votes for me to be re-elected to the United States Congress. ... I have a very, very high percentage of real American citizens that do vote in my district; she has a lower percentage. And I have a higher turnout of people who are responsible enough to vote; she has a lower percentage." King continued, "Democrats are happy enough to see the country filling up with people that they get to count when they do a district, because they get a Democrat district that is another vote here in the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker. They want to turn this country into a single-party country." We thought we’d check whether King, a Republican from northwestern Iowa, was right when he said that Waters, a Democrat who represents a Los Angeles-area district, typically wins her seat in Congress with fewer votes than he does because of lower turnout and a higher illegal immigrant population. First, some background on how congressional districts are drawn. Each state is guaranteed at least one U.S. House seat, and the remainder of the chamber's 435 seats gets divvied up based on the states' total resident population. This means that both citizens and noncitizens are counted by the Census, even though only citizens can vote. This is one of the major reasons why the number of voters can vary from district to district. To check King’s statement, we took a deep dive into election returns for both districts. As we’ll see, King makes some valid points but ignores a few critical factors. First, let’s look at the election results for both lawmakers going back to 2002. The following table includes the votes won by either King or Waters, the number of votes won by the runner-up, the total votes cast for all candidates in the general election, and one-half the total votes cast. What’s important to note here is that the votes "needed" to win can either be characterized as one vote more than the runner-up won, or one more vote than half of all votes cast. Remember that King said he needed 120,000 votes to win and Waters needed only 40,000 to 50,000 to win. As you’ll see, King is only partially correct. Year Winner’s votes Runner-up’s votes Total votes Half of total votes King 2002 113,257 68,853 182,237 91,119 King 2004 168,583 97,597 266,341 133,171 King 2006 105,580 64,181 180,464 90,232 King 2008 159,430 99,601 266,617 133,309 King 2010 128,363 63,160 195,239 97,620 King 2012 200,063 169,470 377,883 188,942 Waters 2002 72,401 18,094 93,407 46,704 Waters 2004 125,949 23,591 156,407 78,204 Waters 2006 82,498 8,343 98,506 49,253 Waters 2008 150,778 24,169 182,579 91,290 Waters 2010 98,131 25,561 123,694 61,847 Waters 2012 143,123 57,771 200,894 100,447 This table shows a big difference in turnout between presidential and non-presidential years. The only years in which half the vote total in Waters’ district is about "40,000 to 50,000" (as King put it) are midterm elections. In presidential years, winning half the votes in Waters’ district takes much more than that. The same pattern holds for King -- he has to win "well over 120,000 votes" only in presidential years and can get by with nearly 30,000 less than that in midterm elections. So right off the bat, King is cherry picking the elections he’s talking about -- midterm elections for Waters, presidential elections for himself. That said, King has a point that voting totals are consistently higher in his district than in Waters', even if the differences aren’t quite as dramatic as he indicates. According to experts, there are a few reasons for this -- some of which King cited, some of which he didn’t. • King’s district is home to more people than Waters’ district. While in theory congressional districts across the country are supposed to be roughly equal, in practice they tend to vary somewhat. The voting-age population in Waters’ district, which counts just adults and not children, is 517,004, compared to 584,777 in King’s, according to U.S. Census Bureau surveys cited by George Mason University political scientist Michael McDonald. That’s almost 68,000 more voting-age residents for King right off the bat. • Waters has more noncitizens in her district. King has a point that Waters represents more noncitizens, who can’t vote. Waters’ district has 118,576 noncitizens, compared to 20,062 in King’s district. That’s enough of a difference to make a significant dent in the pool of potential voters. • Waters’ district has a disproportionate share of Latinos and Asian-Americans, who tend to vote with less frequency. Even the citizens in Waters’ district who are legal voters are less likely to turn out to vote, which means Waters would need fewer votes to win. So on this point, King is on to something. Almost half of the residents in Waters’ district are of Hispanic origin, and another 13 percent are Asian-American. Nationally, Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that Hispanic turnout was 51.6 percent and Asian-American turnout was 47.3 percent -- both lower than non-Hispanic white turnout (64.1 percent) and African-American turnout (66.2 percent). King has far fewer Hispanics and Asians in his district. • During presidential years, Iowa is a much more competitive state than California, which draws Iowa voters to the polls. No Republican presidential candidate has made a serious play for California in a generation, but Iowa is consistently an up-for-grabs state in the quadrennial presidential showdown. Presidential voter-mobilization efforts by the parties tend to bolster turnout on the margins in Iowa, and the lack of it depresses turnout in California. • King’s district is considerably more competitive electorally than Waters’ is. In the 2012 election, the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan handicapping service, rated King’s district a +5 Republican district, meaning that the GOP presidential candidate performed 9 points better in the district than he did in the nation as a whole. While that doesn’t exactly make King’s seat a toss-up district, it did make it much more competitive than Waters’, which was rated a +26 Democratic district. Why does this matter? Three reasons. First, King is more apt to draw a credible challenger, and a credible challenger is more apt to draw votes, raising the threshold King needs to reach to win. Second, the minority party in King’s district, the Democratic Party, has more of a voter base that will vote for their party’s candidates up and down the ballot. This also raises the threshold King needs to win. Third, generally speaking, the more competitive a race it is, the more it energizes voters to come to the polls. By contrast, the GOP is so weak in Waters’ district that only the most hopeless Republican candidates bother to run against a long-serving incumbent like Waters. This tends to depress the vote in her races: People are apt to think there’s not much of a reason for anyone to come out to the polls. When we ran our assessment by King's office, spokeswoman Sarah Wells said the additional points we raised are all "viable reasons, but for our purposes we would say that they are factors that lead to lower turnout, rather than additional factors to accompany Mr. King's two points." That's a judgment call, and one we disagree with. We believe the array of factors calls into question King's decision to zero in on immigration in this comparison. Our ruling In a warning to Republicans about the risks of allowing illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, King said Waters wins election to Congress with fewer votes than he does because of ‘two things’ -- lower turnout and a higher immigrant population. King is correct that both lower turnout rates and a higher population of immigrants who aren’t allowed to vote accounts for some of the difference in their respective vote totals. But he gets some of the key numbers wrong, cherry picks the type of election he’s talking about and ignores the role of the districts’ size, the level of presidential competitiveness and differences in the quality of the competition they face.

pomt-09803	As a candidate, President Obama "declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/11/john-boehner/boehner-says-abortion-access-was-always-key-goal-o/	To build opposition to the health care bill, Republicans have been saying it would expand coverage of abortion. To back up that claim, House Republican Leader John Boehner sent a "GOP Leader Alert" that said President Barack Obama was doing that to fulfill a campaign promise. "During his quest for the presidency, now-President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president," Boehner wrote in the Sept. 10, 2009, message. There's never been any question that Obama favors abortion rights. On Jan. 22, 2008, for instance, Obama released a statement on the 35th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion that said, "Throughout my career, I've been a consistent and strong supporter of reproductive justice, and have consistently had a 100 percent prochoice rating with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America." But he has been somewhat more coy, or perhaps strategically fuzzy, about exactly where he would draw the line on federal funding for abortion in his own health care plan. His comments on abortion rights have often used the phrase "reproductive care" rather than abortion. We'll take a separate look at the three parts of Boehner's sentence. Did candidate Obama say that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care? Did he say that such issues are at the heart of his health care reform plan? And did his definition of "reproductive health" care include abortion? On the first and second questions, we think then-candidate Obama did say something that closely matches what Boehner says he did. In a July 17, 2007, appearance before the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Obama said the following: "In my mind, reproductive care is essential care. It is basic care, so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose. Essentially what we're doing is, we’re going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they don’t have health insurance. It will be a plan that will provide all essential services, including reproductive services, as well as mental health services and disease management services, because part of our interest is to make sure that we’re putting more money into preventive care." (This one is not included in our Obameter database of promises, but we'll examine next week whether it should be.) The words Obama used are slightly different from the ones cited by Boehner, but we think that to say reproductive care is "essential" means that "everyone deserves" to have it. Meanwhile, inferring from Obama's language that it's a "right" requires a slight leap, but it's close enough that we won't quibble. So the key to whether Boehner is right comes with the third question: Does Obama's definition of "reproductive health care" necessarily include abortion? On this question, the evidence is suggestive but not quite a slam dunk. Abortion opponents rely on a few pieces of evidence to support the assertion that Obama believes reproductive health care includes abortion. One is a story that ran in the Chicago Tribune on July 18, 2007, the day after Obama's Planned Parenthood speech. In it, Washington bureau reporter Mike Dorning wrote that when Obama was asked about his proposal for expanded access to health insurance, the candidate "said it would cover 'reproductive health services.' Contacted afterward, an Obama spokesman said that included abortions." Another source is a candidate questionnaire by RH Reality Check, which describes itself as "an online community and publication serving individuals and organizations committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights." Posted Dec. 21, 2007, the questionnaire was filled out by "Sen. Barack Obama's campaign staff." The question that's most relevant to Boehner's assertion is this one: Q: Does Sen. Obama support the Hyde amendment (which bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortions)? Under what circumstances does he believe that Medicaid should cover abortions (all pregnancies, life- or health-threatening pregnancies, pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest, extreme fetal malformation)? A: Obama does not support the Hyde amendment. He believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor woman's decision whether to carry to term or to terminate her pregnancy and selectively withhold benefits because she seeks to exercise her right of reproductive choice in a manner the government disfavors. Both of these comments suggest, fairly strongly, that Obama would include access to abortion in his health care plan — but they leave a degree of doubt. While we are not aware of any pushback from the campaign once these two items were published, both statements were made by campaign staffers, not the candidate himself. On his campaign Web site, Obama did not specifically address the federal funding issue. In the "women's issues" section, the campaign said only that "Barack Obama understands that abortion is a divisive issue, and respects those who disagree with him. However, he has been a consistent champion of reproductive choice and will make preserving women's rights under Roe vs. Wade a priority as president. He opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in that case." Asked for any additional evidence to back up Boehner's assertion that Obama was referring specifically to abortion, Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee, told PolitiFact that Obama was speaking in "terms of art" that his Planned Parenthood audience would immediately grasp. "'Reproductive health services' is one of those conventions that all of the players understand. It is not limited to abortion, but it always encompasses abortion. It is like when a prolife candidate says, 'I support strong legal protection for the right to life of unborn children.' Everyone on all sides understands that this means he thinks abortion generally should not be legal, and no doubt he also supports fetal homicide laws . . . I suppose someone could argue that since he didn't specifically mention abortion, there is the theoretical possibility that he wants to keep abortion completely unrestricted and only wants to pass fetal homicide laws. But that would be to ignore the lexicon that groups develop on these issues and the way they are understood in context." So back to Boehner's claim. He said that candidate Obama "declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president." The record shows that Obama did indeed make those statements. His message to the abortion rights group may have been deliberately fuzzy, but it's clear what he meant — and it was confirmed by the campaign to the Tribune reporter. We find Boehner's claim to be True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2009-09-11T18:05:17	2009-09-10	['Barack_Obama']

"In 2005 or '06 he (Schumer) voted for the wall. So again Schumer seems to be changing his positions all the time...," said Renacci on Fox Business Network on Jan. 24. "This is something that he (Schumer) voted for in 2005 or 2006. This is something we need, to get immigration moving in the right direction. This is something he already negotiated." Renacci, who hopes to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in the Nov. 6 election, supports Trump’s campaign promise to build a wall and is a co-sponsor of a bill to provide billions of dollars in border security measures. We fact-checked Renacci’s claim that Schumer voted for the wall about 12 years ago and found that Schumer supported the construction of a fence. But it was far less extensive than Trump’s wall. This has become a familiar talking point by Republicans, including Trump, to attack Democrats who voted for the fence but have taken stances against Trump’s wall. Schumer voted for Secure Fence Act of 2006 Renacci’s spokeswoman pointed to Schumer’s vote in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Schumer was one of 26 Democratic senators, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, to vote in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law. The legislation authorized about 700 miles of fencing along parts of the border of the United States and Mexico. It also authorized the use of several tools in an effort to curb illegal immigration, including more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting, as well as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. So how is that different from the wall that candidate Trump promised to build? What was voted on in 2006 varies from what Trump promised during the campaign. Trump promised an "impenetrable" physical wall. But since the election has toned down that rhetoric and said that parts of the wall could actually be "see-through" and fencing could be constructed in some areas instead of a wall. Trump was initially vague on the details about his wall and during the campaign gave varying cost figures, from $8 billion to $12 billion. Trump has continued to say that Mexico would pay for it — but did not offer concrete details on how or a clear timeframe — but he also sought money from Congress. The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 5 that his administration outlined to a group of senators plans requesting nearly $18 billion over 10 years to build new and replacement barriers along more than 700 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile long U.S.-Mexico border. The administration's document called for a barrier, referred to as a "wall system," but officials did not specify where it would be constructed. Renacci’s congressional spokeswoman Kelsey Knight said that there isn’t any significant difference between the barrier that Schumer supported in 2006 and Trump’s wall. "Both are meant to deter physical entry from one side of the border to the other," she said. Trump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign. "Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad," Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) It’s also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different from Schumer’s statements about Trump’s wall in the past year. Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process. Around that same time, the House passed legislation that would make any undocumented immigrant a felon. Our ruling Renacci said that in 2005 or 2006, Schumer "voted for the wall." Schumer voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. But that fence is not as substantial as Trump’s proposed wall. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a "nothing wall." We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-06746	Says Texas gained 21,000 doctors due to tort reform.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/25/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-added-21000-doctors-because-/	Ask any Republican candidate about reducing the cost of health care and part of the answer is likely to include rewriting the rules for medical malpractice. In 2003, Texas lawmakers passed a package of changes to malpractice law, plus the state added a few more through a referendum known as Proposition 12. These turned the state into a beacon of hope among tort reformers and Texas Gov. Rick Perry talks proudly of the good the changes have done. When he was asked about medical malpractice at the Politics and Eggs Breakfast in Bedford, N.H., on Aug. 17, 2011, he had some precise numbers at his fingertips. "I’ll tell you what one of the results was," he said. "This last year, 21,000 more physicians practicing medicine in Texas because they know they can do what they love and not be sued. Some 30 counties that didn’t have an emergency room doc have one today. Counties along the Rio Grande, where women were having to travel for miles and miles outside of the county to see an ob-gyn, for prenatal care and now they have that care." For this fact-check, we're examining his claim that that the state gained 21,000 doctors because of tort reform. First, we found the number is wrong. Perry’s campaign relies on data from the Texas Medical Association, a physician trade group, which counts the number of medical licenses issued in Texas. The problem is, not everyone with such a license practices in Texas. The Texas Medical Board issues licenses and tracks whether those doctors actually work in the state. According to their numbers, between 2003 and 2011, the accurate increase is 12,788. That’s about 8,000 doctors fewer than the governor’s claim. Still, thousands of additional physicians is nothing to sneeze at, and the next question is, can credit be put at the feet of tort reform? Not much. By far, the biggest driver is population growth. From 2002 to 2010, the population of Texas grew by 20 percent. At the same time, the number of doctors went up 24 percent. Jon Opelt, executive director of Texas Alliance for Patient Access, a group that supports tort reform and is funded by health care providers, sent us some analysis he had done that filtered out the population effect. Opelt said the higher rate for doctors -- 24 percent -- translates into an additional 1,608 physicians thanks to tort reform. At least, that’s what he said when we first spoke to him. Later, after we showed him that the growth of doctors increased at a faster rate in the pre-reform years, Opelt sent us new numbers, saying tort reform brought 5,000 more doctors to the state and the ratio of doctors to residents has never been better. (We found those numbers to be a stretch: The upward revision comes from including administrators, teachers and other licensed doctors who don’t actually treat patients.) In any event, from the pro-reform vantage point, the most accurate figure is 5,000 -- a far cry from 21,000. But the case for Perry’s statement gets even shakier when you review numbers prior to the new malpractice rules. It turns out that in the nine years before tort reform, the number of doctors grew twice as fast as the population. So Texas did a pretty good job attracting doctors before the law changed. Tom Banning, chief executive officer of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, said that back in the early 1990’s the state began passing laws that made it physician-friendly. Among them, a prompt-pay rule to "to ensure that insurers pay physicians promptly and correctly," Banning said, "which creates a very good environment for practices." Banning said tort reform was more good news for doctors, a sentiment borne out by opinion surveys from the state’s medical association. But he acknowledges that population growth is the biggest force behind the growing ranks of doctors. "It’s like the Willie Sutton rule," Banning said, referring to the famous bank robber. "Go where the money is. From a doctor’s standpoint, you go where the patients are." Especially patients who can pay. Banning and other observers in Texas note that most of the new doctors are clustered in the affluent, fast growing suburbs around the state’s biggest cities. This puts a damper on one of Perry’s additional points, that tort reform opens the doors for physicians to practice in the state’s most rural counties. The results here are mixed. The governor is right about emergency room doctors. The state has 60 percent more of them then it did in 2003 and tort reform likely played a major role, experts told us. ER doctors got more protections from tort reform than just about any other medical specialty. But Perry also boasted that rural counties were getting specialists in obstetrics and gynecology that they never had before. The reality here is murkier. A report from the Texas Alliance for Patient Access says 14 counties (of 254 total) gained an ob-gyn. We looked at one community along the Rio Grande, Starr County, and found that yes, four years after tort reform, they got one. But the situation has flipped back and forth, and as of May 2011, Starr County had no ob-gyn specialist. Our ruling There is no question that tort reform drove down medical malpractice insurance premiums and reduced the number of malpractice suits. And there is no question that most health care providers like the change and say it’s a factor that leads them to practice in the state. But the wholesale transformation that Perry describes is not backed up by the numbers. Perry said Texas has 21,000 more doctors thanks to tort reform. That’s flat out wrong. Texas has only about 13,000 more doctors in the state and the historic trends suggest that population growth was the driving factor. We rate his statement False.

pomt-09066	"If there were not derivatives, there would be no bank loans at all today."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jun/28/jeff-greene/greene-claims-banks-need-derivatives-make-loans/	A derivative a day keeps the bad economy away. That seemed to be the message from Jeff Greene during last week's Democratic U.S. Senate debate between him and his opponent, Rep. Kendrick Meek. Talking about the subprime mortgage crisis, Greene, a real estate billionaire and investor, touched on the topic of financial derivatives: "Do we have to regulate derivatives? Yes, we do. Cause when I did this in my investments, frankly, no one knew who could pay who. But derivatives have an important place in our economy. If there were not derivatives, there would be no bank loans at all today, because people want to get fixed-rate 30-year loans, but banks don't want to keep 30-year loans on their books," said Greene. Derivatives have recently gotten a lot of criticism in the press for helping to fuel the ongoing economic crisis, so we wondered whether Greene was right that banks need them to make loans. First, however, a little primer on "derivatives." The conversation could become very technical very quickly, so we'll just say that a derivative is fundamentally a contract between two or more parties. The value of the contract depends on (i.e. is derived from) some other asset. If you think that the U.S. housing market is on the verge of collapse, you can use derivatives to make a bet that will pay out only if you prove to be right. If you're wrong, you'll lose the money. In this context, banks can use derivatives as a form of insurance policy -- if the borrower defaults on his home loan, for example, the bank won't crumble because the derivative will pay out instead. That said, let's look at Greene's statement. We contacted numerous experts on finance, most of whom told us pretty much the exact same thing: Banks have been making loans way before derivative use became widespread, and as long as there is money to be made, banks will continue to make them. "A claim that banks won't make (sound) loans without derivatives is ridiculous," wrote Lynn A. Stout, professor of corporate and securities law at UCLA. John Cochrane from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business specifically said that "banks made lots of 30-year loans many years ago before ... derivatives were even invented." Still, Greene wasn't completely off when he said that eliminating derivatives now could impact lending. Don Chance from Louisiana State University said that he agrees with Greene's underlying point but disagrees with the wording. It is likely that banks would "significantly" reduce giving out both long- and short-term loans, said Chance. Peter DeMarzo from Stanford agrees. "Eliminating all derivatives would ... very likely significantly reduce loan-making activity," wrote DeMarzo. Cochrane emphasized that derivatives allow banks to make more loans and to do so more efficiently. It is also thanks to derivatives that banks can offer loans to clients who are considered more risky, such as first-time homeowners. Nevertheless, even without derivatives to help them hedge against risk, banks could still give out loans, even the 30-year fixed interest mortgage loans that Greene specifically referenced in the debate. Kenneth French from Dartmouth College said that if derivatives suddenly disappeared, the banking sector would undergo lots of restructuring, but "almost all the banks that remain would continue to make loans." Jeff Greene said that "if there were not derivatives, there would be no bank loans at all today." Many of the experts we spoke with told us that Greene's underlying point that using derivatives makes it easier for banks to issue long-term loans is sound. Still, there was a consensus that Greene did take his argument too far by categorically declaring that banks would stop making loans. Banks were making mortgage loans before the derivatives that Greene was talking about even existed, and they would continue to make them even if derivatives disappeared tomorrow, albeit perhaps in decreased quantities. We rate this one Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04543	Says Daniel Webster "used taxpayer funds to build a lobbyist lounge."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/sep/28/val-demings/val-demings-says-daniel-webster-used-taxpayer-fund/	For a few seconds, the political attack looks like a scene from Mad Men. A man wearing a suit relaxes in a tall leather chair, his hand holding a cigar as smoke wafts above a crystal decanter of brandy nearby. He’s inside no ordinary members-only club. This space is reserved for lobbyists, paid for by taxpayers and the brainchild of Republican U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster. Well, so says a TV commercial from the Democrat seeking to unseat Webster from his Orlando-based seat, former Orlando Police Chief Val Demings. "Thirty-year politician Daniel Webster used taxpayer funds to build a lobbyist lounge," the narrator says in the ad. Sounds like a pretty swank idea for a man who’s made a career of preaching frugality (and who, by the way, doesn’t drink). We wanted to know if he really spent tax money on a lounge for lobbyists. Webster became speaker of the Florida House in 1996 -- a huge year for House Republicans, who regained control of the House for the first time in 122 years. Webster wanted to do something special for the Republican minority leaders outnumbered all those years by Democrats. Many of those former Republican leaders had since become lobbyists. Webster spent about $100,000 for renovations to the speaker’s office suite when he took power, according to news accounts (PolitiFact Florida examined how that compares to other speakers in this 2010 check). Of that, no one knows how much -- if any -- he spent furnishing one office he wanted to reserve for the past minority leaders to use. PolitiFact Florida asked the Department of Management Services and the Florida House for expenditures from the makeover, but did not hear back. (The state worker who kept tabs on the renovations is on vacation, we’re told.) "The room cost nothing to create, and was a converted windowless office with a threadbare couch and House archived photos on the wall," Webster campaign spokeswoman Katie Patchett said in a statement. Demings’ spokeswoman pointed us to a 2000 Tampa Tribune article about the close relationship shared by former legislators-turned-lobbyists and current lawmakers. The story mentioned Webster’s special room for leaders in connection with how these lobbyists enjoy "special privileges at taxpayer expense." The article did not include a breakdown of costs for the office. People who remember the "leaders room" paint a picture of simplicity: a loveseat, some chairs, pictures of the leaders on the walls, a TV and a telephone. "And that’s it," said Ronald Richmond, who was House minority leader from 1982-84 before turning to lobbying. "There’s no liquor in there, there’s no beer in there, no Cokes in there, no water in there. Unless they know something I don’t know, and I go there a lot, it ain’t a big deal." Webster had one big rule, they say: No lobbying. No bringing in clients. "There was no lobbying," Richmond said. "Oh, heavens no." The former Republican House leaders who could use the room, though, had new jobs as lobbyists, which bothered Democrats. Five minority leaders-turned-lobbyists were singled out in 1997 as having access to the room: Curt Kiser, James M. Lombard, Dale Patchett, Richmond and Jim Tillman. As the former leaders rested their feet or watched session unfold on a boxy TV, Webster occasionally stopped by to ask them for advice about the legislative process. They were his sounding board, said Kiser, a minority leader-turned-lobbyist-turned general counsel for the Florida Public Service Commission. The gesture garnered some criticism, and not necessarily about the costs of such a room. "I just think it was a hypocrisy of pretending you’re gonna be fiscally responsible and then bam, you’re gonna turn around and do that," said former House Democratic Leader Buzz Ritchie, who was in line to become speaker before the Republicans took over. Capitol observers don’t remember Webster as being particularly friendly to lobbyists. In fact, he put new rules in place during his tenure that sought to diminish the influence of lobbyists by keeping them out of his office the last -- and most critical -- week of session. Still, some saw the leaders-only lounge as a blemish on his transparency scorecard, including the editorial board of the Tampa Bay Times. The board called for the room’s closure and dubbed it a "Republican clubhouse." "Webster wants to honor the Republican leaders who preceded him and share the spoils of power. A nice painting and a plaque ought to be enough." Webster moved on, first to the Florida Senate and in 2010 to Congress, but the room remained in some form. His successor, current state Sen. John Thrasher, moved the room to the Majority Office area and converted the old lounge to a staff office, according to the 2000 Tampa Tribune story. Former minority leaders, speakers and Republican majority leaders still congregate there, lobbyist or not. "I have to tell you more of the more hilarious moments in my life go on there," Richmond said. "Sandy Mortham (a former minority leader who became Secretary of State) can keep you in stitches." Richmond has few complaints, save for the absence of the landline phone and the "ancient" box TV. "The picture’s good, but we don’t have a changer," he said, referring to a remote control. Our ruling Demings is attacking Webster for using "taxpayer money to build a lobbyist lounge." It’s true that some newspapers characterized a room Webster set aside for a select group of former Republican leaders turned lobbyists as a "comfortable lounge" enjoyed "at taxpayer expense." There is plenty of deception and hyperbole mixed in here, though. Webster did not build the room (it was an existing office); it’s unclear how much, if any, taxpayer money went toward its furnishings (maybe a phone line at one point?); and access was generally limited to former Republican leaders. Moreover, the room is a far cry from the Cognac-ridden and smoke-filled country club-style lounge the ad would have viewers imagine. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-09055	If Rhode Island applied a 1-percent sales tax on all items exempt from sales tax, ''the state would receive an additional $89,376,857.''	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/30/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-expanding-ri-sales-tax-could-raise-893/	Former U.S. Sen. Lincoln Chafee shook up the political world in January when he called for a sales tax increase as part of his formal announcement of his candidacy for governor. Specifically, he proposed a two-tiered sales tax in which exempt items, including food, clothing and over-the-counter drugs, would be taxed at 1 percent to help close the gap between state revenue and state spending. He outlines the plan on his website: "Currently all exempt items total $8,936,785,714 in untaxed revenue. If we were to tax these items at 1% the state would receive an additional $89,376,857. This money plus reforming the mandates on cities and towns and continuing to cut government spending could help us be the master of our economic destiny in this state." Such specificity begs to be verified, so we decided to see whether Chafee’s numbers add up. Would Chafee’s plan raise what he promises? The most authoritative source of information on how much the state collects from the assorted taxes and fees it levies is the state Department of Revenue. In addition to monitoring what the state takes in, the department is also required to prepare a report every even-numbered year on how much revenue the state has relinquished by granting various tax exemptions. If the actual amount lost from particular exemptions can’t be determined precisely, the department, comes up with estimates, with varying degrees of reliability. The most recent report is for 2008, based on 2007 statistics. (Paul L. Dion, chief of the department’s office of revenue analysis, said the 2010 report is in its final stages.) The report said state law, in 2007, carved out 72 sales-tax exemptions. There are the well-known ones, such as food and clothing, and others such as coffins, aircraft parts, mobile homes and newspapers. Dion said more exemptions have been added since the last report; the 2010 report will have around 83. The best estimate is that those 72 exemptions cost the state $625,575,000 in lost revenue, assuming the transactions were taxed at 7 percent. And $625,575,000 is 7 percent of $8,936,785,714, the exact number the Chafee campaign cites on its website. And if you taxed that at 1 percent, it would raise $89,376,857. Dion said the Chafee campaign’s calculations are correct. But because many of the report’s figures are based on extrapolations, not hard data, real-world results may vary, Dion said. For example, the estimated $125-million cost for exempting food -- items “sold for ingestion or chewing by humans for their taste or nutritional value” -- is derived by updating a 1999 sales-tax model, not actual sales receipts. "Those are huge numbers," Dion said. "You’ve got to use caution." Chafee’s sales-tax math is accurate. But it’s based on numbers that even the people who compiled them say are less than reliable. For that reason, we rate Chafee’s projection Mostly True.	None	Lincoln Chafee	None	None	None	2010-06-30T15:30:57	2010-06-18	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-06413	"For each $1 billion in infrastructure investment, 42,000 jobs are created."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/26/steve-latourette/us-rep-steve-latourette-says-infrastructure-invest/	Congressman Steve LaTourette is a self-described huge proponent of infrastructure spending, because, he says, it generates good-paying jobs and spurs economic development. The Bainbridge Township Republican, who spent 14 years on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, says on his House website: "Major infrastructure projects are proven job generators and spur economic development. For each $1 billion in infrastructure investment, 42,000 jobs are created." That figure has been used by Republicans and Democrats alike. With the White House and Congress engaged in a standoff over how best to revive the American economy and create jobs, and with infrastructure spending on the table, now seems a good time to look into this figure. Although cited by a number of industry-backed groups that want the government to invest heavily in highway, bridge, airport and rail projects, the number actually comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration. But it is outdated. It comes, in fact, from 1996. An updated federal study is expected in 2012, so for now the department pointed us to its most recent number, from 2007: $1 billion in highway spending supports 27,800 jobs. That’s a big difference from 42,000. The Department of Transportation explains why: The figure changes over time. It was higher a decade earlier. For that matter, the figure was higher only months ago, when the federal government (and news stories) used extrapolations from earlier studies and said the number was around 30,000. In a recent update to its website, the DOT said: "Increases in construction materials prices and wages over time will tend to reduce the number of jobs supported by each $1 billion invested." The particular figure used by LaTourette and others was considered accurate 15 years ago. Said the DOT at the time: "Per $1 billion of investment in 1996, the Federal-aid highway program supports approximately 42,100 total full-time equivalent jobs." Of those jobs, 7,900 were for on-site highway construction. This meant laborers, engineers, specialists and managers. Another 19,700 were indirect jobs in industries that support highway construction. This included jobs in stone and clay mining and quarrying, lumber, steel and concrete, and professional services. The final 14,500 jobs were "induced," or jobs supported by the general economy as a result of the other workers spending their wages. Note that the government figures included not only jobs created but also jobs supported. This is tricky territory; remember when then-President-elect Barack Obama said the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 would create or save up to 4 million jobs? Critics complained that was a broad way of measuring. There have been still other figures cited by federal transportation authorities, including one in 2007 that said with $1 billion from the federal government plus a match from states, 34,799 jobs would be supported. But that would mean spending a total of $1.25 billion, with $250 million coming from the states, according to the Congressional Research Service. Remove the state portion and consider only the federal government’s fanciful $1 billion and the figure drops to 27,800 -- the same number the feds say is the most recent. Had LaTourette been referring to infrastructure in general, and not specifically transportation infrastructure, he might have cited pre-recession work from the University of Massachusetts, where economists said that $1 billion in general infrastructure spending creates 18,000 jobs. Then there’s the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, which said in a 2008 report on the nation’s infrastructure, "For example, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimates 42,000 jobs are created for every $1 billion dollars invested in transportation projects." That’s the same figure LaTourette used. And just this week, another figure came across our desk, with extraordinary timing. Cleveland Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, announcing the latest infrastructure bill, said in a news release: "According to the Federal Highway Administration, for every $1 billion spent on highway and bridge construction, nearly 35,000 jobs are created." Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown used the same 35,000 figure in September, and his office notes that the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials uses that number, too. That number, however, assumes states will kick in $250 million, as the Congressional Research Service explains. It’s a model based on $1.25 billion in spending; otherwise, that $1 billion gets you 27,800 jobs. So which is it? We’re inclined to go with the one that the Federal Highway Administration gave us -- 27,800 -- and regard all the others as outdated or built on assumptions that cash-strapped states are ready to gear up their highway spending. Every one of these figures comes with caveats anyway. Large construction projects take years to plan, with only about a quarter of the money being spent in the first year, so some economists question their stimulative value. Highway advocates say the early funding is a catalyst, improving the outlook for future years at a time many people are afraid of the uncertainty. Libertarians disagree with moderate Republicans over whether the government should even stay in the road-building business. Democrats and Republicans disagree over details of the various bills that have been proposed, particularly their funding. Yet there appears to be widespread agreement within Congress that America’s roads and bridges need repair, and general consensus in Washington that this is a way to create some number of jobs -- if and when lawmakers can come to terms on the other points. In the most general sense, then, this makes LaTourette’s claim halfway accurate. His communications director, Deborah Setliff, says the 42,000 figure was put on his website in February 2010. Federal highway authorities were not just citing it 15 years ago but also in 2002, she noted, and House and Senate members working on transportation legislation that passed in 2005 gave the higher figure of 47,500 jobs per $1 billion in federal highway spending (note the emphasis on "federal"). Former Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta in 2008 and 2009 used the ratio of 37,000 jobs per $1 billion in infrastructure spending. Senate Democrats used the same figure in 2009. And just this year, Nick Rayhall, the ranking Democrat on the House transportation committee, put the figure at 36,000 jobs. But fellow committee member Corrine Brown of Florida, also a Democrat, separately said the number of jobs per $1 billion was 42,000. These, fellow Americans, are your lawmaking experts. LaTourette’s number was off, but his general concept has plenty of support, which is why we say pick a number. Any number. It’s also why LaTourette’s claim is rated Half True.

pomt-12854	Says Neil Gorsuch "comes down on the side of felons over gun safety."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/02/nancy-pelosi/pelosis-misleading-claim-gorsuch-sides-felons-over/	President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee favors felons over gun safety, says House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pelosi said nominee Neil Gorsuch has ruled against liberal positions on a litany of issues like employee rights, food and water safety, reproductive rights and guns. Gorsuch is a conservative federal judge for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Denver. "If you care about that for your children, he's not your guy," Pelosi said during a Jan. 31 town hall on CNN. "(Former Democratic Rep.) Gabby Giffords' group, the group for responsible solutions relating to gun safety, said that he comes down on the side of felons over gun safety." Pelosi’s claim that Gorsuch "comes down on the side of felons over gun safety" caught our attention. Her office sent us a press release that Giffords’ gun control advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, put out along with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. "In his time on the 10th Circuit, (Gorsuch) made repeated efforts to weaken the federal law that’s prohibited felons from possessing guns for the past 50 years, a law that has saved thousands of lives and enjoys near-unanimous support among Americans and elected officials on both sides of the aisle," wrote Robyn Thomas, the law center’s executive director. It’s fair to assume that Gorsuch takes a right-leaning approach to the Second Amendment; the National Rifle Association supports him. But it’s misleading to say Gorsuch’s past rulings demonstrate that he thinks more felons should be allowed guns than what is already permitted under the law. Games-Perez The primary case in question is United States vs. Games-Perez. The defendant, Miguel Games-Perez, was a convicted felon, and he possessed a gun — an apparent violation of the federal law that bans felons from knowingly possessing guns. (Remember the word "knowingly.") Games-Perez, however, wanted to make the case that he shouldn’t be convicted for this offense because he didn’t know he was a felon. He said that the state trial judge who ruled on the prior crime (the felony) repeatedly suggested to Games-Perez that he wasn’t being convicted of a felony but instead a lesser charge. In line with precedent, the 10th Circuit denied Games-Perez’s request. But Gorsuch disagreed. Gorsuch said he believes the federal law is written in such a way that a defendant must have both knowledge of being a felon and knowledge of possessing a gun in order to be convicted. Thus, Games-Perez should have the opportunity to make his case in court. If it’s decided that Games-Perez really didn’t know he was a felon, he shouldn’t go to prison on this charge. The upshot is that Gorsuch’s opinion did not say felons should be allowed guns or that the law violates the Second Amendment. It said a defendant who didn’t know he was breaking the law should have the chance to make his case in court instead of going straight to prison. He did, though, make the point that this is especially important in this case because possessing a gun is a constitutionally protected right. While this case has a gun component, Pelosi’s claim has it "quite backwards because I don’t think Gorsuch’s opinion is about guns. For him, it’s about treating people fairly before sending them to prison," said Eric Citron, a partner at Goldstein & Russell who profiled Gorsuch for SCOTUSblog, and a self-described liberal. In theory, if courts adopted Gorsuch’s interpretation of this law, it could marginally weaken the federal law because some people charged with possessing a gun as a felon might successfully convince a jury they didn’t know they were felons and thus not go to prison for that offense. But it doesn’t change the fact that felons are not allowed to possess guns, and people generally know whether they’ve been convicted of a felony. Adam Skaggs, litigation director for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, emphasized the fact that Gorsuch’s reading of the statute deviated from the majority of justices on the panel, as well as other federal courts. And if Gorsuch’s opinion were to be adopted, "The immediate effect is to create the possibility that this guy would be back on the street," Skaggs said. Reese Gorsuch’s 2014 decision in United States vs. Reese has also been cited against Gorsuch. But it takes a tremendous leap of logic to view this decision as an attempt to rethink the federal ban on gun possession by felons. In this case, a court had convicted defendant James Reese of being a felon in possession of a firearm. But Reese appealed the decision to the 10th Circuit and won because the state of New Mexico had restored his civil rights. If a felon’s civil rights have been restored under state law — including the right to vote, serve on a jury, hold public office and own firearms under state law — federal law allows the felon to legally own a gun. The 10th Circuit’s decision was uncontroversial. The opinion was unanimous and written in just 300 words. Even the government attorneys who brought the original charges conceded "that Mr. Reese’s federal firearms conviction is unsustainable." Had the court come to a different conclusion, it would have been "appalling," said Eugene Volokh, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law, who clerked on the Supreme Court with Gorsuch. Pope We won’t spend much time on this third case, United States vs. Pope. We wanted to note, though, that here, Gorsuch had the opportunity to address the question: Is there a situation in which the federal ban on gun possession by people with domestic violence convictions is unconstitutional? Here, he intentionally chose not to answer the constitutional question. Instead, he relied on procedural rules to affirm a grand jury’s decision to charge the defendant, convicted of domestic abuse, with violating the federal ban. Rule of law Volokh and Citron both noted a touch of irony: In both Games-Perez and Reese, Gorsuch advocated in favor of a big-picture principle generally associated with liberals more so than conservatives: defending the rights of criminal defendants. This is an area where the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat Gorsuch might fill, found common ground with liberals, too. "This is a standard liberal position historically," Volokh said. "It’s a standard rule-of-law conservative position, as well. The criticism of (Gorsuch) for this is misplaced." Skaggs sees it differently. He said Gorsuch is willing to "bend over backwards" to make rulings outside the mainstream opinion on the law banning felons from owning guns, noting that it’s important to consider whether Gorsuch would advocate for criminal defendants’ rights in the same manner in cases that don’t involve guns. Our ruling Pelosi said Gorsuch "comes down on the side of felons over gun safety." There’s one case, Games-Perez, where Gorsuch wouldn’t immediately send the defendant, a felon, to prison for having a gun, despite the federal ban on felons possessing guns. But Gorsuch’s reasoning wasn’t about whether the law infringed on the defendant’s Second Amendment rights. Instead, he thought the law allowed the defendant an opportunity to make the case in court that the he didn’t know he was a felon. Two other cases that came up in our research, Pope and Reese, turned out to be irrelevant. Pelosi’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-12535	"All pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/20/donald-trump/while-mentioning-keystone-xl-donald-trump-errs-say/	Visiting the Badger State for the first time as president, Donald Trump made a claim about steel and the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that is similar to one his staff has already had to correct. While in Kenosha on April 18, 2017 to give a speech touting his "Buy American" agenda, Trump said in an interview with WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee: I support the concept of everything from the U.S. You know, I don't know if you saw, but I approved a pipeline, right, called the Keystone pipeline, and other pipelines. And I want them to use American steel, American product. I want it manufactured here. And I made those changes just before we signed it. I said, Where's the steel coming from? So, all pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel, which is really a big factor. So, while mentioning the Keystone, which still needs approvals before it can be built, Trump is claiming "all pipelines that are coming into" the United States have to be made with American steel. The Keystone XL Proposed by energy giant TransCanada, the 1,179-mile Keystone XL would transport more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Western Canada to Nebraska. Then it would connect with an existing pipeline system to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where the oil would be turned into petroleum products such as gasoline. The refineries export about two-thirds of their products; the rest is sold in the United States. The project had been in limbo for more than seven years when the company’s application to build the pipeline was rejected in November 2015 by President Barack Obama. He said the pipeline wouldn't serve U.S. national interests and would undercut America's global leadership on climate change. In contrast, Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would build the Keystone and get "a piece of the profits" -- a pledge that’s been rated In the Works on PolitiFact’s Trump-O-Meter. An important step was taken in March 2017 when, at Trump’s urging, the State Department issued a presidential permit for the Keystone. The permit is necessary for the pipeline to cross the U.S.-Canadian border. But before the pipeline can be built, it must win approval from the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners. The steel connection, meanwhile, relates to a memorandum regarding construction of American pipelines that Trump signed in January 2017. Keystone and steel The memorandum calls for U.S oil pipelines to use American steel in their construction -- but it is not an order carrying strict requirements. The memo directs the secretary of commerce to "develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States," use materials and equipment produced in the United States, "to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law." Five weeks after Trump signed the memorandum, the White House stated explicitly that it does not apply to the Keystone XL. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that because the Keystone is not a "new" project, it is not bound by the memo. "But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that (memorandum)," she said. (The White House didn't provide us any information to back up Trump's claim.) While carrying the weight of the president’s signature, the memorandum has the force of law only over the executive branch of the federal government. (And for that matter, it is arguably a lesser form of presidential action than an executive order.) Moreover, as Reuters has reported, the memorandum contains "legal language about ordering things to the maximum extent permitted by law, which is designed to preserve lots of wiggle-room"; and the attempt to mandate the use of American steel "would almost certainly violate 70 years of settled international trade law." Chris Weld, a Washington trade lawyer whose firm represents American steel companies, told the Washington Post that the memorandum is not a mandate, but rather "a message to U.S. pipeline operators to consider steps to purchase U.S.-produced iron and steel." Meanwhile, the Keystone, while not yet under construction, is nevertheless well under way. TransCanada has said it already has purchase agreements for the 660,000 tons of steel it will use for the Keystone XL. Half is to come from the Arkansas plant of an India-based steelmaker, 10 percent from a plant in India and the rest imported from Canada and Italy. Trump, meanwhile, reportedly will sign an executive order directing the Commerce Department to investigate whether steel imports into the United States should be blocked on national security grounds. Our rating While mentioning the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, Trump said: "All pipelines that are coming into this country from now on has to be American steel." The White House made it clear weeks earlier that a memorandum signed by Trump related to the use of American steel does not apply to the Keystone -- only to new pipeline projects. And though the memorandum could put pressure on pipeline companies to use American steel, it does not contain any requirements that only American steel be used.

pomt-02443	A Georgia religious freedom bill would help Catholic institutions that, under Obamacare, could be forced to provide abortion-inducing drugs.	false	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/28/joshua-mckoon/politifact-religious-freedom-bill-targeted-obamaca/	Josh McKoon, a GOP state senator from Columbus, authored one of two bills that pulled Georgia into the national debate over religious freedom and discrimination. Critics say Senate Bill 377, McKoon’s legislation, and House Bill 1023, by Rep. Sam Teasley, R-Marietta, could open the door to private business owners declining on religious grounds to serve people they believe are gay, bisexual or transgender. McKoon and Teasley have said they did not intend to target the gay community, but their bills were pulled into the political firestorm over a religious freedom bill passed in Arizona and vetoed Wednesday by that state’s governor, Jan Brewer. Major corporations that lined up against the Arizona measure voiced similar concerns about the bills by McKoon and Teasley, both of which have been given slim chances of passage heading into the final days of the General Assembly session. McKoon was selling his bill, in part, by capitalizing on the backlash against the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. He told reporters Monday that SB 377 would be "another tool in the tool kit of those who are fighting on the Obamacare front --- Catholic health institutions who are being asked to provide abortion services, that sort of thing." Others dispute McKoon’s assessment. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a deeper look. McKoon said one of his intentions was to help Catholic institutions that, under the ACA, could be expected to provide services they normally find objectionable, such as making available abortion-inducing medications. "At minimum, I would like for those institutions to have the potential to have the religious-liberty test that this law would give them," said McKoon, an attorney who has served in the General Assembly since 2011. Several experts we checked with said they can’t see McKoon’s bill having the stated effect. "What I am given to understand is that state law that tries to alter federal law, such as the Affordable Care Act, is superseded by that federal law and ignored," said William S. Custer, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University. Chad Brock, a staff attorney at ACLU Georgia, and Robert A. Schapiro, the dean of Emory University’s School of Law, generally agreed. "How can an organization use state law to exempt itself from a federal mandate?" Brock said. Custer said "the ACA specifically states that federal subsidies do not pay for abortion services, so that’s a moot point." On March 24, 2010, President Barack Obama signed an executive order declaring that federal funds would not be used for abortion services, except in the case of rape, incest or a woman’s life safety, in accordance with long-standing restrictions commonly known as the Hyde Amendment. That’s not slowed the rumors or their spins through the Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact has ruled in the past that the health care law does not provide federal funding for abortion. Some individuals may have the opportunity to buy abortion coverage on the exchanges, but they won’t be forced to buy it. Some states have passed laws banning abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on their state exchanges. Georgia has not. In an interview Wednesday, McKoon acknowledged that his religious freedoms bill, if challenged legally, might not be able to stave off ACA requirements. But he said the bill would address what he perceives is a bigger issue -- an attack on religious freedom. McKoon pointed out that the state Senate recently passed legislation to safeguard Christmas trees and holiday greetings such as "Merry Christmas" and "Happy Hanukkah." "That speaks to the level of fear people have to speaking their faith," he said. People of faith currently carry the burden of having to justify their practices, McKoon said. He said he hopes his legislation would turn that on its head and require the government to show why a certain rule, regulation or policy is so important that it needs to supersede a person’s religious liberty. Thirty-one states have similar religious freedom laws on the books -- 18 passed by their legislatures, McKoon said. His bill did not make the Senate calendar for Monday, the last day for most bills to clear at least one chamber with a serious chance of passing this session. McKoon said he wants Georgia to become the latest state to have a religious freedom law on the books. But our fact check looked specifically at his comment that his bill would create a law that would serve as "another tool in the tool kit of those who are fighting on the Obamacare front --- Catholic health institutions who are being asked to provide abortion services, that sort of thing." We don’t see that he has made that case. We rate his statement False.	None	Josh McKoon	None	None	None	2014-02-28T00:00:00	2014-02-24	['Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']
pomt-12069	Says President Barack Obama’s policy known as DACA "contributed to a surge of minors at the southern border."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/05/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-questionable-claim-daca-helped-cause/	During his announcement that the Trump administration would phase out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, Attorney General Jeff Sessions blamed the Obama-era policy for a surge in unaccompanied minors at the southern U.S. border that spiked in 2014. Speaking from prepared remarks at the Justice Department, Sessions said that DACA, "among other things, contributed to a surge of minors at the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences." Did DACA really help spawn the surge of minors from Central America? Based on statistical patterns and consultation with experts, we find the evidence to be weak. "As far as I can see, there is no logical or empirical linkage between DACA and the child migrants from Central America," said Douglas Massey, a Princeton University sociologist who has written about and done field work with immigrants on the southern border. How does DACA work? Under DACA, enacted as an executive-branch policy in 2012, undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States before turning 16 could apply for a renewable status that protected them from deportation as long as they met several requirements. They needed to be in school, have a high school degree or be an honorably discharged veteran. They had to be younger than 31 by June 15, 2012. They had to have no significant criminal record. And -- most relevant for analyzing Sessions’ claim -- they had to have lived in the United States continuously since June 15, 2007. This residency requirement meant that none of the unaccompanied minors showing up at the southern border of the United States in 2014 would have qualified for DACA. Most of the unaccompanied minors came from Central America, particularly Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. By definition, they would not have been living in the United States continuously since 2007. What motivated the migrants to come to the border? But what if the migrants were under the belief that the United States would welcome them? The Justice Department pointed us to an article published in the Washington Post on June 13, 2014, headlined, "Influx of minors across Texas border driven by belief that they will be allowed to stay in U.S." According to the Post, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said that while on a tour of a Border Patrol station in Nogales, Ariz., that was housing hundreds of unaccompanied minors, her aides found that "many of the children were smuggled across the border after hearing radio ads promising they would not be deported. My staff also heard that religious organizations are spreading the same message." The Post went on to cite a leaked memo written by Border Patrol agents that had been circulated to reporters and lawmakers by the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for limited immigration. It was based on interviews with 230 youths and women from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The memo said many migrants wanted "to take advantage of the ‘new’ U.S. law that grants a free pass or permit" from the government. "The news of these ‘permisos’ is spread by word of mouth and international and local media," the memo said. Then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told Congress that he disagreed with the memo’s conclusions, though the Post noted that Cecilia Muñoz, the Obama White House’s director of domestic policy, acknowledged that unfounded "rumors" could be playing a role in the influx of minors, though not as the leading cause. Sources of the rumors So how did these "rumors" arise? As we’ve previously written, the most likely explanation is that Central Americans turned themselves in to immigration authorities in order to seek asylum protection. To apply for asylum, individuals must be physically present in the United States and can do so regardless of how they arrived or of their current immigration status. It’s important to note that asylum policy is an entirely different aspect of the immigration framework than DACA. As we’ve noted, some of the policies that governed unaccompanied minors stem from the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a broadly bipartisan measure signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. So for Sessions to use the situation with unaccompanied minors as a justification for ending DACA is to target one set of rules for the consequences of another. Is it conceivable that people in Central America might have heard about DACA and used it as one more data point to reinforce a perception that the United States was growing more welcome to immigrants, and that they should try to send their unaccompanied children here? Yes. Still, even that doesn’t mean that the DACA policy itself "contributed to a surge of minors at the southern border" -- only that misperceptions and unfounded rumors in foreign countries about DACA did. The DACA policy itself would have done Central American migrants no good once they got to the border. What do the numbers say? And even if it sounds plausible that DACA may have accidentally helped spawn the surge in unaccompanied minors, the timeline undercuts that notion. Let’s first look at Border Patrol apprehensions at the Southwest border -- a metric often used as a rough estimate of the number of people attempting to cross the border into the United States. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com DACA was announced near the end of the 2012 fiscal year. (The graph above uses fiscal rather than calendar years.) So if DACA prompted a spike in the number of unaccompanied minors, that should show up in the data starting in 2013. In reality, while the number of apprehensions did increase, it did so steadily -- as if DACA had never happened. The slope of the increase is consistent from 2011 to 2014, after which it fell. (It’s also less than a third of the level it was in 2000.) A second data set also calls into question Sessions’ linkage -- data showing non-Mexican apprehensions at the Southwest border. While not all of these apprehensions involved Central Americans, they are considered a pretty good approximation. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com This time, the scale of the spike is bigger, but the data shows the same general pattern. That is, the number goes up at a more-or-less steady rate between 2011 and 2014, before declining. So, for both data sets, the increase was steady -- and it began more than a year before DACA was even implemented. "We have no data that links DACA with increases in apprehensions of unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border," said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew Research Center who studies immigration. So if not DACA, why did they come? Why did they come then? To flee violence, primarily. Denise Gilman, director of the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, pointed to a 2014 study by Vanderbilt University’s Latin American Public Opinion Project. It surveyed residents of the three main Central American countries about their intentions to migrate and whether they had been victimized by crime in the previous 12 months. The study found that those who had been victimized were considerably more likely to consider migration than those who had not been victimized. In Honduras, for instance, 28 percent of non-victims reported having intentions to migrate, compared to almost 56 percent of those victimized more than once by crime. Other analyses have agreed about the importance of crime, along with poverty. An August 2016 Congressional Research Service report we’ve cited concluded that gang-related violence, poverty and lack of educational and employment opportunities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras played a key role in children’s decisions to leave their homes on their own and cross illegally into the United States. "We believe what has largely motivated migration of unaccompanied minors and families from Central America has been a combination of ‘push’ factors -- violence, instability and endemic poverty in Central America -- coupled with ‘pull’ factors -- a desire to reunite with family in the U.S. and an understanding that people from Central America presenting themselves at the border would be allowed in, pending review of their case in immigration court," said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, which is generally favorable toward immigration. Our ruling Sessions said that DACA "contributed to a surge of minors at the southern border." Since the DACA policy itself didn’t address the situation of unaccompanied Central American minors at all, the only way it could have had any effect was through mistaken understandings among potential migrants in Central America about what the program did and didn’t do. While there is evidence that such mistaken ideas did exist, the data shows that the upticks at the southern border were already under way by the time DACA was announced, and that the trend line didn’t change significantly after the announcement. So the effect, if there was any at all, would have been too small to measure. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-07091	Every 10th dollar spent by the Social Security Administration on its program for the poor is "waste, or fraud, they can’t validate that the people should have gotten it," totaling about $8 billion a year.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/24/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-large-percent-social-security-paymen/	Pundits may have decided Newt Gingrich’s bid for president is on life-support. But the former U.S. House Speaker hasn’t gotten the memo. Days after his campaign staff quit en masse, the Republican was back to skewering the media, liberals and government ineptitude on "The Neal Boortz Radio Show" on Atlanta’s AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB. The June 15 interview made news because Gingrich railed against an ABC News investigation that called into question cash transactions between his charity and one of his for-profit companies. But PolitiFact Georgia reporters took note because true to wonkish form, Gingrich peppered his arguments with factoids. He used this one to argue the government is inept: "They reported this morning that every 10th dollar spent by the Social Security Administration on its program for the poor -- every 10th dollar -- is waste, or fraud. They can’t validate that the people should have gotten it. That’s about $8 billion a year, just in that one program," Gingrich told Boortz. That sounds like one big, wasteful problem. Is Gingrich right? Waste in entitlement programs has been much on Gingirch’s mind lately. Two days earlier during the Republican presidential primary debate in Manchester, N.H., he said "we think you can save $70 billion to $120 billion in Medicare and Medicaid annually by not paying crooks." The Washington Post’s Fact Checker column disputed the claim, noting that while there were about $70 million in "improper" payments in those programs, that doesn’t mean the money is going to "crooks." The federal definition of "improper" includes non-criminal mistakes such as underpayment of benefits as well as fraud or cases of insufficient documentation. Gingrich’s statement to Boortz was different. He didn’t mention "crooks" and used different figures. We took a look. An Associated Press story posted Tuesday on AJC.com gave us the scoop. Bear with us. The explanation involves an alphabet soup of government programs. In July 2010, Congress passed legislation aiming to reduce improper payments to beneficiaries by $50 billion in 2012 for a variety of programs, including some run by the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Administration, or SSA, administers two "High-Error Programs," programs that have a track record for making improper payments. One is the Supplemental Security Income program, or SSI. It helps the elderly, blind, and disabled by giving them cash for necessities such as food, clothing and housing. Patrick P. O’Carroll, Jr., the SSA’s inspector general, testified June 14 before a joint subcommittee of the U.S. House Ways and Means committee to discuss the Administration’s progress. O’Carroll said that overall, the SSA made an estimated $6.5 billion in overpayments and $1.5 billion in underpayments in fiscal year 2009, according to the AP article. This means it made $8 billion in improper payments. SSI issued an estimated $4 billion in overpayments and $800 million in underpayments, the AP article said. Since SSI paid out $48.3 billion in payments, about 10 percent of SSI payments were improper. This means that according to the AP, Gingrich was right about the overpayment rate for Social Security’s program for the poor. But he was wrong about the amount of SSI’s improper payments. The overall amount of improper payments by the SSA is $8 billion, but Gingrich was talking about SSI, SSA’s program for the poor. This initiative accounted for 60 percent of the Administration’s total improper payments -- $4.8 billion. We checked the AP figures against a copy of O’Carroll’s statement and data from PaymentAccuracy.gov, the website of the federal payment accuracy improvement program. The AP’s numbers checked out. So, as Gingrich said, "every tenth dollar" paid out by the Social Security Administration on its program for the poor is "waste, or fraud," or "they can’t validate that the people should have gotten it." But he’s wrong about the amount of improper payments. Still, Gingrich’s broader point holds true. SSI makes billions of dollars in improper payments. Dollar-wise, they account for a majority of the Social Security Administration’s mistakes. We therefore give him a Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84e46582-0caa-4e67-817f-61134e3ea461	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-06-24T06:00:00	2011-06-15	['None']
pomt-06012	Says Rick Santorum "voted to let convicted felons vote."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/17/restore-our-future/super-pac-rick-santorum-felon-voting-rights/	A super PAC that supports Mitt Romney is attacking Rick Santorum with an ad that says he can’t beat President Barack Obama. Santorum confronted Romney about the ad, which is airing in Florida, at a debate in South Carolina on Jan. 17, 2012. "Gov. Romney's super PAC has put an ad out there suggesting that I voted to allow felons to be able to vote from prison, because they said I'm allowing felons to vote, and they put a person in a prison jumpsuit," Santorum said. "I would ask Gov. Romney, do you believe people who were felons, who served their time, who have exhausted their parole and probation, should they be given the right to vote?" Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, ended up in an extended back-and-forth with Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. Both men are seeking the Republican nomination for president. We’ll get back to the exchange in a minute, but here, we wanted to fact-check the ad put out by the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. "Barack Obama knows four facts about Rick Santorum that you don’t," the ad states. "Santorum pushed for billions in wasteful pork, voting for the ‘Bridge to Nowhere,’ a teapot museum, even an indoor rain forest. Santorum voted to raise the debt limit five times, increasing spending and debt by $3 trillion. He even voted to let convicted felons vote. So, how will Rick Santorum beat Obama? Obama knows, he can't." We’ve fact-checked claims about Santorum’s alleged pork-barrel spending before. We rated the claim that he voted for a tea pot museum Half True -- he voted for a large appropriations bill that included an earmark for the project, but there’s no evidence he specifically supported the museum. We also rated the claim that he voted for the Bridge to Nowhere as Mostly True -- in a separate vote to strip funding, Santorum voted to leave it in. He defended that vote by saying the people of Alaska knew best how to spend their transportation dollars. Here, we want to look at whether Santorum "voted to let convicted felons vote." The ad points to a 2002 vote on a failed amendment sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. We looked up the amendment and found that it did attempt to grant rights to convicted felons to vote, as long as they were not currently in a correctional institution or on probation or parole. The amendment failed 63 to 31. Santorum was one of three Republicans on the losing end. (The other two were his fellow Pennsylvania Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter, and Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio.) At the debate in South Carolina, Santorum argued that the ad gave the misleading impression that he voted to allow felons who were still in prison to vote. Santorum is correct that the ad shows a man in an orange prison jumpsuit with a jaunty "I voted" button pinned to his chest. Santorum argued that he only supported voting rights for people who had served their sentences and successfully completed probation. Then he charged Romney was a hypocrite, noting that Massachusetts allowed felons who had completed their sentences to vote and that Romney had never moved to change those laws. Romney responded that he had a Democratic Legislature when he was governor but that he still opposed restoring voting rights for felons after their release. Romney also said he wasn’t responsible for the super PAC’s ads. Our ruling Here, we’re fact-checking the original television ad from the super PAC Restore our Future, which claimed Santorum "voted to let convicted felons vote." Santorum argued during the debate that the ad is particularly misleading because the ad’s visual -- a jump-suited prisoner wearing an "I voted" button -- could give people the impression that Santorum supported allowing people in prison to vote, which he does not. When we saw the ad, we were already familiar with efforts in various states to restore voting rights to felons who have completed their sentences, so we didn’t think that it meant that Santorum wanted to allow current prisoners to vote. Still, we can understand that people who haven’t followed this issue before might be confused into thinking Santorum supported allowing incarcerated prisoners to vote. Santorum’s vote was actually to restore voting rights for felons who had completed their sentences and probation. The ad muddies that point, so we rate the its claim Half True.

pomt-06802	Says that under President John F. Kennedy, "government took up" 27 percent of the economy, and today it "consumes 37 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/mitt-romney/romney-says-government-has-grown-27-percent-37-per/	During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney offered statistics designed to show how much the federal government had grown over the past five decades. Romney said that "back in the days of John F. Kennedy, the federal government took up, along with the state and local governments, 27 percent of the economy. Today, government consumes 37 percent of the economy. We're inches away from no longer having a free economy." We separately checked the claim that "we're inches away from no longer having a free economy" here. So for this item, we’ll focus on his statistical comparison. We found that the numbers Romney cited were close to correct -- but he also left out some important context. The Office of Management and Budget produces a table every year that tracks total government expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. Here are the statistics for the years in question: Fiscal year 1961: 27.4 percent Fiscal year 1962: 27.8 percent Fiscal year 1963: 27.7 percent Fiscal year 2009: 36.5 percent Fiscal year 2010: 35.0 percent Romney’s figures aren’t exact -- he could have said 28 percent under Kennedy rather than 27 percent, and 35 percent today rather than 37 percent, making it a rise of seven percentage points rather than 10. But he’s got the general trend correct. However, using only the big-picture numbers is only part of the story. Digging deeper into the numbers provides a much fuller sense of what’s going on. For simplicity, we’ll choose the 1963 and 2010 figures for a more detailed analysis. Once again, the listed figures are expressed as a percentage of GDP and are rounded. 1963 Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 9.8 percent Federal net interest expenditures: 1.5 percent Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 2.6 percent Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 2.6 percent Federal spending in all other categories: 2.3 percent State and local government: 8.9 percent Total: 27.7 percent 2010 Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 5.1 percent Federal net interest expenditures: 1.4 percent Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 8.4 percent Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 7.3 percent Federal spending in all other categories: 1.6 percent State and local government: 11.1 percent Total: 35.0 percent So let’s look at the components of government that expanded and contracted between 1963 and 2010. Defense spending was cut almost in half as a percentage of GDP, as was "other spending." Net interest barely budged, while state and local government increased by about one-fifth. But the big increases came from two categories: Social Security and Medicare, which more than tripled as a share of GDP, and other federal payments to individuals, which fell slightly short of tripling. First, we should note that Medicare didn’t exist until 1965, so a big share of the increase Romney pointed to stems from this single program. More important, there’s something that ties together all of these fast-growing expenditures: They are all payments made by the government to individuals. Why is this important? It’s a question of control, says Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. These transfer payments, as they are known, "can be more or less freely spent by private individuals," Burtless said. "Your mom can spend her Social Security check any way she wants -- on food, shelter, vacations at Disney World or deposits in her bank account or her favorite mutual fund. Even cash public assistance recipients have pretty wide freedom over how they spend their welfare checks." Some transfer payments are more restrictive, such as food stamps or Medicare and Medicaid benefits, but these still allow some degree of consumer choice. "This distinction is important for a simple reason," Burtless said. While lawmakers and government officials have direct say over many types of government expenditures, "their say over government transfers is a lot more restricted." In addition, he said, many government transfer payments "are paid for with earmarked taxes – FICA and unemployment insurance taxes. When we get transfers from the government under Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, we’re getting back the money that we or our employers contributed when we were working." While these are undoubtedly government expenditures, one could argue that they are actually pass-throughs of payments from the American public to itself. And it’s worth noting that Social Security and Medicare -- the drivers of government growth -- are among the most popular of all government programs. So how would taking this into account change the equation? If you subtract the share for federal transfer payments from figures above, it turns out that government spending as a percentage of GDP actually declined between 1963 and 2010, from 22.5 percent to 19.3 percent. And this trend is confirmed if you use a different data set. The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes statistics that break down the components of national GDP. If you take the category "government consumption expenditures and gross investment" for all levels of government -- a figure that doesn’t include transfer payments -- and divide it by GDP, government accounted for 22.0 percent of GDP in 1963 and 20.7 percent of GDP in 2010. So Romney’s numbers are nearly correct, but they don’t tell the whole story. Yes, government spending has risen as a share of GDP, but the actual control on spending exerted by government has not risen by anywhere near that amount, because the bulk of the growth has come in transfer payments that individual Americans ultimately control (and, in many cases, under programs which they had paid into to begin with). On balance, we rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-08-12T18:03:53	2011-08-11	['None']

pomt-07018	Says Gov. Scott Walker’s budget "includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/06/one-wisconsin-now/group-says-gov-scott-walkers-budget-has-tax-breaks/	We’ve heard a lot about how Wisconsin’s new state budget erases a $3 billion shortfall without raising taxes. But could it be true that the budget also provides billions of dollars in tax breaks? On June 24, 2011, two days before Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed the budget into law, this declaration was made by liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now: "Walker’s budget, includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade." Versions of the $2 billion-plus claim have also been made in a joint news release from four left-leaning groups and on at least three occasions by Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha. The state Democratic Party put the $2 billion claim first on its list of "worst items" in Walker’s budget. So, let’s see what’s what. When asked about the claim, Scot Ross, executive director of One Wisconsin Now, pointed to a June 9, 2011, memo by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, long considered by both parties the neutral scorekeeper on budget matters. The memo was written at the request of Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller, D-Monona. The memo projects that various tax provisions adopted in 2011 will result in a reduction of $2.33 billion in general fund tax revenue over 10 years. That appears to back the One Wisconsin Now claim. But the claim is a little more complicated than that -- it really has four elements: "Walker’s budget (1) includes tax breaks for corporations (2) and the rich (3) that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade (4)." 1. "Walker’s budget" The group says the $2.3 billion in tax breaks over 10 years is part of the 2011-2013 budget that was proposed by Walker and modified and adopted by the Legislature. But the fiscal bureau reached its projection by considering tax breaks not only in the budget, but in five other business-related measures that were adopted by the Legislature early in 2011. Ross conceded his group made a "misstatement." He noted that less than two weeks earlier, his group had issued a news release that attributed the $2.3 billion figure to both the budget and the earlier action. One cautionary note. Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, says it is difficult to project the effects of tax law changes over 10 years: "It’s so volatile, I just don’t think you can forecast very far out." So, the first part of the claim is off because it cited only Walker’s budget -- but that’s relatively minor, since the budget built the earlier tax reductions into its assumptions. 2. "Tax breaks for corporations" Ross pointed out that nearly $1.6 billion of the $2.3 billion tax breaks would go to corporations through three tax provisions. Tax cuts: On production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. The cuts would apply to small businesses as well as large corporations. The production tax cuts are by far the largest of the breaks, according to the fiscal bureau, resulting in a reduction of an estimated $874 million over 10 years. "Combined reporting": A partial rollback of a tax increase that was adopted two years ago on multi-state corporations. The fiscal bureau estimates the rollback would reduce tax revenue by $366 million over 10 years, making it the second-largest tax break. Tax deduction: For hiring new full-time employees. Ross argued that regardless of the size of a company, the money from the tax deduction "is not going to average individual taxpayers." The new-hire deduction is the third-largest tax break, with an estimated loss in revenue of $335 million over 10 years. So, many of the tax breaks are geared toward corporations and business. That’s not surprising. The focus of the Walker-called special session of the Legislature in January was on improving the state’s business climate. 3. Tax breaks for "the rich" Ross told us a "a clear majority" of the remaining $700 million in tax breaks will go to the "rich." Of course, by saying "clear majority," Ross is acknowledging not all of the remaining tax breaks are aimed at the rich. What’s more, there are many differing views of what constitutes the "rich." The point behind the loaded language is they don’t help the average taxpayer. Ross highlighted three tax breaks: -- Health savings accounts: This legislation allows employees -- not employers -- to deduct contributions they make to their HSAs, which are used to pay medical expenses, from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Ross cited a May 2008 memo from the U.S. Government Accountability Office that says the average taxpayer who used an HSA in 2005 had an annual adjusted gross income of $139,000. He argues that that figure shows HSAs benefit "the rich" because the adjusted gross income of other tax filers was only $57,000. Berry doesn’t buy that argument. He said large corporations and the rich "are more likely to have employer-paid health insurance and would not need an HSA." He noted that nearly every other state allows the deduction, which conforms with federal tax law. -- Two capital gains changes: One change eliminates state capital-gains taxes on long-term investments in Wisconsin businesses; the other would defer taxes on capital gains reaped anywhere if the proceeds are plowed back into a Wisconsin business. Together, they would result in an estimated tax revenue reduction of $436 million over 10 years. Ross cited a fiscal bureau report on the two measures that said "capital gain income is concentrated among high-income taxpayers." Berry said eliminating the long-term investment capital gains tax would tend to benefit people with higher incomes. The deferral measure, however, merely delays taxes and isn’t a tax cut, he said. So, Part 3 of the claim is mixed. Ross himself acknowledged not all of the $700 million in question goes to the wealthy, only a "clear majority." But the claim gets support from both the legislative fiscal bureau and the taxpayers alliance, who said the capital gains measures benefit higher-income taxpayers. 4. Tax breaks "cost" Wisconsin taxpayers Ross argued that the tax breaks "cost" Wisconsin taxpayers "because they are reducing the amount of revenue taken in by the state" and because most taxpayers won’t benefit from them. He added: "We remain steadfast in our belief that tax breaks are a form of spending." But we looked at that question in February 2011 when One Wisconsin Now claimed that $140 million in tax breaks backed by Walker amounted to "new special interest spending." As we concluded then, cutting taxes is "not spending. You can’t spend what you don’t have." We gave the group a Pants on Fire on that claim. Let’s return to the current claim. One Wisconsin Now said the new state budget "includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade." The state fiscal bureau estimates tax breaks will bring in $2.3 billion less in revenue over 10 years. The group attributes it all to the budget, when much of it was in separate legislation. The group’s larger point -- that the tax breaks benefit corporations and wealthier residents, rather than average taxpayers -- is generally on target, given that the largest amounts of the tax breaks go to businesses and to individuals with higher incomes. But as we said in a past ruling, a tax break is not spending or a "cost" to taxpayers. It is money that stays with taxpayers. The statement contains accurate claims, primarily on who will benefit from newly adopted tax breaks, but shades the language (all in Walker’s budget, a "cost" to taxpayers) to amplify its political point. We rate the statement Half True.	None	One Wisconsin Now	None	None	None	2011-07-06T09:00:00	2011-06-24	['Wisconsin']

pomt-01599	Thomas Jefferson said, "That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves."	false	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/03/jody-hice/so-says-thomas-jefferson-you-might-reconsider/	Even political junkies could be forgiven for not paying much attention to election in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. Pundits expect the heavily Republican swath of exurbs and rural land in the northeast corner of Georgia to pick GOP nominee Jody Hice over Democrat attorney Ken Dious come November. A former minister and radio talk show host, Hice has generated plenty of attention from his conservative takes on topics as disparate as religion (Islam not a religion but a "geopolitical structure and, as such, does not deserve First Amendment protection") and qualifications to run for political office ("If the woman’s within the authority of her husband, I don’t see a problem."). But certainly no one could roll their eyes to Hice’s decision to showcase what he calls his Constitutional conservatism via quotes from political idol Thomas Jefferson on Hice’s Facebook and Twitter pages. "That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves," reads the quote attributed to Jefferson, over the image of a waving American flag. A reader asked PolitiFact Georgia to check out the quote. So we did. To quote the Internet, 'Merica! To quote Anna Berkes, the research librarian at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello in Virginia, "That sounds like something that he might have said or written, but in fact, he did not." It turns out that our third president, the lead author of the Declaration of Independence who left this earthly plane 188 years ago, remains a prolific "author" on the Internet. He, too, has tackled topics as disparate as religion ("The Bible is the source of liberty," a bogus quote) and the qualifications to run for political office ("No man will ever bring out of that office the reputation which carries him into it," a verified quote). The misattributions floating around the web got so bad that a few years ago, Berkes set up the Spurious Quotations page on the Monticello website. The fake posted by Hice is a common mistake that was first incorrectly attributed to Jefferson in 1853. Historians long attributed the quote to Henry David Thoreau, who used a variation of it in his 1849 essay, "Civil Disobedience," to argue that individuals should not let governments to make them agents of injustice. New research indicates, though, that Thoreau himself was likely quoting the magazine, The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, where the sentiment first appeared in 1837, Berkes said. "The opinion has been associated with Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican party ideology, which is probably why people think he said it," Berkes said. "The association is what has been called a natural Jeffersonian maxim. It’s just not a Jefferson quote." Hice did not respond to requests for comment. He may, as Berkes’ suggests, find the dubious quotes still prove useful to convey a long-held ideology, regardless of the source. Or, as librarian and Jefferson researcher Eyler Robert Coates concludes, the attribution may belie a misunderstanding of Jefferson’s views. Coates argues the quote does not represent Jefferson because of its vague, abstract use of "best" and "least." One thing that is clear, is that there is no verifiable evidence that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote the sentiment. Correcting the record would surely square with Jefferson, who once said, "If we are to guard against ignorance and remain free, it is the responsibility of every American to be informed." OK, he didn’t say that, either. Thanks to Berkes’ carefully footnoted research, we can rate both our claim and that from Hice as False.

pomt-15108	"Inspections of abortion centers around Virginia have found multiple violations of parental consent laws … but Gov. Terry McAuliffe and his administration have done nothing."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/14/victoria-cobb/victoria-cobb-says-gov-mcauliffe-has-ignored-viola/	At a recent protest outside Planned Parenthood’s office in Richmond, several hundred anti-abortion activists heard accusations that Gov. Terry McAuliffe is refusing to enforce many abortion laws. Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation -- a socially conservative lobbying and public interest group -- made the charges in a speech. She said McAuliffe, a Democrat, is ignoring the laws as payback to the "abortion industry" for contributing to his 2013 campaign. Records from the Virginia Public Access Project show that abortion rights groups, led by Planned Parenthood, backed McAuliffe with nearly $1.8 million in contributions. Among Cobb’s accusations was this: "Inspections of abortion centers around Virginia have found multiple violations of state parental consent laws but, because it’s the abortion industry, Governor McAuliffe and his administration have done nothing." Fact-checking Cobb’s statement requires two determinations: Have inspections turned up "multiple violations" of the parental consent law for abortions on minors and, if so, did the McAuliffe administration do "nothing"? Let’s start with some background. For many years, Virginia abortion clinics were regulated under the general category of "physicians offices," and the Virginia Department of Health Professions inspected them only for cleanliness or in response to a complaint. That changed after the General Assembly in 2011 passed a bill -- signed by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican -- requiring that the clinics adhere to hospital standards. Regulations passed later that year by the State Board of Health required that all clinics receive at least one unannounced inspection every two years to determine if they were complying with building codes and a variety of rules regarding medical treatment, sanitation, drug storage and record-keeping. When violations are found, the administrator of the clinic is required to implement a plan of correction within 30 days. The Virginia Department of Health may suspend or revoke a clinic’s license if it determines the facility is "permitting, aiding or abetting" illegal abortions. The inspections began in 2012, and among the checklist items is determining whether clinics are following Virginia’s parental consent law that requires physicians, before performing an abortion on an unemancipated minor, to receive notarized permission from a parent or legal guardian, or an order from a judge. Inspectors randomly pull the files of three or four minors who received abortions at each center to see whether the requirement is being followed, said Erik Bodin, director of licensure and certification for the Virginia Department of Health. There were 20 abortion clinics in Virginia when the inspection program began. Today, there are 18. Chris Freund, spokesman for the Family Foundation, backed Cobb’s statement by referring us to the inspection reports of three clinics that have been cited for not following parental consent mandates. Let’s explore these citations and see what, if any, corrective action was taken. Roanoke Medical Center for Women On Dec. 18, 2012, inspectors found violations in three of four records of minors they pulled. In one case, no parental consent record was found for a 16-year-old who received an abortion. An unidentified staff member at the clinic said, "I don’t know how it slipped through the cracks." In the other two cases, consent letters were on file, but they were not notarized and, therefore, did not properly validate the relationship between the patient and her parent or guardian. Inspectors demanded an immediate correction plan, and the administrator of the clinic obtained certification as a notary public and installed a system of checks to make sure all records are in order before minors get abortions. A March 27, 2013, inspection found the corrections had been carried out. Although the Family Center sent us the original report, it should be noted that all of these actions occurred under McDonnell’s administration, which ended in January 2014. Charlottesville Medical Center for Women Three records of minors were reviewed during a July 9, 2014, inspection. Two of the consent forms were notarized but had no notary seal. A staff member reported "he/she left the official notary stamp in Richmond," according to the citation. The clinic’s administrator promised to correct the problem by having more staff members certified as notaries to ensure a seal always is on hand and by improving the review of patients’ charts before abortions are performed. A subsequent unannounced inspection on Oct. 8, 2014, found no deficiencies with the center’s parental consent procedures. Planned Parenthood Metro Washington-Falls Church A review of electronic records on Oct. 30, 2014, found no parental or guardian consent signature for a 17-year-old who had received an abortion six months earlier. A staff member told inspectors the clinic had experienced "a problem with the system capturing electronic signatures," according to the citation. The administrator promised to create special red files and electronic checklists for minors to ensure required steps are carried out before abortions. Bodin said the clinic has not been re-inspected, because the violations there "did not require a revisit." Our ruling Cobb said, "Inspections of abortion centers around Virginia have found multiple violations of state parental consent laws but, because it’s the abortion industry, Governor McAuliffe and his administration have done nothing." Inspections since McAuliffe took office in 2014 have turned up consent problems in two of the state’s 18 abortion clinics. Inspectors found one instance where there was no record of parental or guardian consent for a minor who had received an abortion. And there were two instances when the consent forms were not properly notarized. Some might say that the cited problems have been few and accidental. Cobb is technically correct in using the term "multiple violations." But Cobb’s claim that McAuliffe did "nothing" about the violations doesn’t hold up. The Department of Health followed state regulations by requiring both clinics to adopt procedures to prevent the violations from recurring. The department followed up with an unannounced re-inspection at one of the facilities. The response largely was identical to actions taken under the previous governor, McDonnell, when inspectors in 2012 found a Roanoke clinic had given abortions to one minor for whom there was no parental consent record and to two minors whose forms were not notarized. On the whole, Cobb’s statement contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That makes it Mostly False.

[Sam] Olens took on the ACLU and won!"	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/03/sam-olens/olens-says-he-beat-aclu-cobb-prayer-case/	Republican attorney general candidate Sam Olens recently fought back against critics questioning his conservative credentials. He is locked in an Aug. 10 runoff with Preston Smith for the Republican Party's nomination for attorney general. The winner takes on Democrat Ken Hodges in the Nov. 2 general election. Olens, the former Cobb County Commission chairman, released a campaign ad a few weeks ago to show he's as conservative as the other guys in the race. The television ad focused on the county's legal battle with the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued Olens, the Cobb Board of Commissioners and its Planning Commission primarily over the way invocations are done at their meetings. "In Cobb County, every meeting opened with a prayer," the ad began with ominous music. "The ACLU objected. Sued." The voice in the ad says, "Olens took on the ACLU and won!" Jeffrey Selman, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, has said Olens made erroneous claims in the ad. He distributed a letter to "set the presently distorted record straight. At best, for all concerned, the decision was a draw." The Olens campaign insists the ad is correct. So who's right here? Let's begin with a recap about the case. Selman and four other men filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in August 2005. The plaintiffs said in the complaint they objected to Cobb's practice of allowing speakers at most of their commission meetings to begin with an invocation with references to a "Christian God -- to the exclusion of all other Gods." "The plaintiffs are affronted by the defendants' overtly Christian prayers ... and unwelcome religious messages sponsored by the county," the complaint said. The plaintiffs had a similar complaint about Planning Commission meetings. "Since February 2003, only two non-Christian clergy has given the invocation at the Board of Commissioner Zoning meetings. None of these prayers included sectarian references." Olens and others countered that legal precedent, specifically a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court case, found the content of prayer is of no concern, unless it is used to disparage one faith or advance another. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2008 that the Cobb commission did allow religious leaders of other faiths to offer prayers at meetings and that those prayers do not advance one faith or disparage another. The court did rule that the process the Planning Commission used in its invocation process excluded minority faiths during a certain period. Olens did not preside over Planning Commission meetings. Selman and the plaintiffs contend that the ad is misleading because it suggests that they were upset about Cobb commissioners allowing prayer in their meetings. Olens said the ad is not misleading because Selman gave testimony complaining about prayer in the commission meetings. The Olens campaign provided PolitiFact Georgia with what it considered the smoking gun, eight pages of an April 24, 2006, deposition by Selman. "If any prayer is specifically identified with any particular religion, whether or not it names the deity of the religion, it would be a prohibited prayer from your approach?" Selman was asked. "Yes," Selman said, according to the transcript. "I admit it. That's me talking," Selman, who is Jewish, told PolitiFact Georgia. "But I recognized [those changes were not] going to happen." Selman gave PolitiFact Georgia the entire 160-page deposition. In it, Selman argues several times in that deposition in favor of allowing people of various religious faiths to give the invocation at County Commission meetings. The court did rule in favor of the County Commission, so we find that the claim in the Olens ad that he "took on the ACLU and won" is correct. However, we had trouble with the language in the first part of the ad, "every meeting opened with a prayer. The ACLU objected. Sued." The plaintiffs objected in their complaint to the types of prayer at the beginning of the meeting. That part of the ad suggests the plaintiffs objected to any type of prayer, which PolitiFact Georgia found is misleading. We rate the Olens statement as Half-True.

pomt-05739	"In 2010 about 75 percent of child abuse and neglect reports in Oregon were made by those required to report by law."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/02/laurie-monnes-anderson/do-most-child-abuse-reports-come-people-required-r/	While the 2012 Legislature has been hung up on some issues, lawmakers approved a law that expanded the sorts of professionals required to report child abuse and neglect. The legislation came in response to the recent scandal at Penn State University. There, former assistant Coach Jerry Sandusky was charged with more than 40 counts of child sex abuse involving multiple boys over a 15-year period. Longtime coach Joe Paterno, who had supervised him, was fired. Before the bill passed, a long list of professionals were required to report abuse, but employees of higher education institutions and organized youth activities were not. During the Senate debate on the legislation, Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson, a Gresham Democrat, spoke briefly in favor of the mandatory reporter expansion. "It really will help all adults recognize their responsibility to protect our kids," she told her colleagues. "In 2010, about 75 percent of child abuse and neglect reports in Oregon were made by those required to report by law. It is clear, very clear, that mandatory reporting is a very important tool to keep our kids safe." We thought a quick check on her 75 percent figure would be interesting. As always, we started with the speaker and gave Monnes Anderson’s office a call. Molly Woon, a spokeswoman for the Senate Democrats, pointed us to the 2010 Child Welfare Data Book published by the Oregon Department of Human Services. According to the report, which was released last March, 74.4 percent of the abuse and neglect cases were reported by school and medical officials, police, clergy, child-care providers, court and mental health personnel and therapists -- all of whom are required to report. The other 25 percent of reports came from the abusers themselves, parents or, according to department spokesman Gene Evans, victims, relatives, friends, neighbors, ex-live-ins, ex-spouses and anonymous reporters. The figures make this claim an easy one to rule on. Monnes Anderson said 75 percent of the abuse and neglect reports the state collected in 2010 came from mandatory reporters. The Department of Human Services backs her up. We rate this claim True.	None	Laurie Monnes Anderson	None	None	None	2012-03-02T18:09:59	2012-02-24	['Oregon']
pomt-10661	Former business partner Robert Gay says: "The man who helped save my daughter was Mitt Romney."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/28/mitt-romney/romney-did-help-save-teen/	A TV ad by Mitt Romney features former business partner Robert Gay crediting Romney with helping reunite Gay with his daughter after she went missing. On July 6, 1996 the girl sneaked off during the weekend to go to a rave party in New York City, where she took the drug Ecstasy, according to news reports at the time. She had told her parents she was playing tennis. When she didn't return, Boston-based Bain Capital, where Romney was founder and CEO, essentially shut down to help search for Gay's 14-year-old daughter Melissa. Bain Capital's 50 employees went to New York, where they convinced more than 200 other people to help search the streets for two days. They printed and passed out fliers. Romney clearly had a leading role in the company's operations, but news reports from the time also said other Bain partners helped coordinate the search effort. According to news reports, the teen was found in suburban New Jersey. A teenaged boy, who took her in after her partying, called authorities late on July 11. Lt. David Peterson of the Montville Township Police said police reports at the time do not mention Romney, but Peterson and reports at the time show the Bain Capital search generated important attention to the case of the missing girl. "The thing was it was a 911 caller that saw her on channel 7 and called in," said Peterson, who recalled waiting for the girl to be picked up from Montville police station. Gay says Romney helped "save" his daughter, though previous reports have differed on the condition she was in. "Doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day," according to the Boston Globe in 2002. Newsday reported in July 1996 that "Melissa's parents said she was physically unharmed though she appeared 'very fragile.' The family's doctor had examined the girl and pronounced her in fairly good condition. ..." "She was not harmed," Robert Gay said at new conference after she was found, according to the New York Daily News . "She was in tears. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home." The ad says Romney "helped save" the girl, and we certainly aren't going to argue over the physical condition of the girl when she was found. Her Dad says she was "saved," and under the circumstances we won't disagree. The ad also says Romney "helped." Hard to argue with that either. True.

pomt-10562	"She said, you know, 'I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass.' That was a quote on live TV."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/11/barack-obama/thats-not-the-actual-quote/	Sen. Barack Obama took several swipes at Sen. Hillary Clinton, his rival in the race for the Democratic nomination, at a Feb. 10, 2008, campaign rally in Alexandria, Va. In one, he used an example of something she said to illustrate his point that Americans "don't want political talk." "I think part of what the American people are looking for right now is straight talk," Obama said. "They don't want political talk. I'll just give you one example. Sen. Clinton and I were debating and she was asked about the bankruptcy law that she voted for in 2001. . . . During the debate she said, you know, 'I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass.' That was a quote on live TV. That kind of talk, I think it makes people not trust government." Problem is, that's not what she said. Obama is referring to a Jan. 15, 2008, Democratic debate in Las Vegas when Clinton was asked by moderator Tim Russert if she regretted her vote in favor of the 2001 bankruptcy bill. Here's what Clinton said: "Sure I do, but it never became law, as you know. It got tied up. It was a bill that had some things I agreed with and other things I didn't agree with, and I was happy that it never became law. I opposed the 2005 bill as well." The 2001 bankruptcy bill was intended as a dramatic overhaul of the bankruptcy laws, making it harder for people to eliminate debts in bankruptcy court and keeping wealthy debtors from using their homes as a shield for assets. It was hugely backed by the banking, credit card and retail credit industries. It passed the Senate, 83-15, on March 15, 2001, with the yes vote of Clinton, but because of differences in the House legislation, it never became law. Four years later, bankruptcy reform finally did become law. Clinton missed that vote; Obama opposed it. But back to the 2001 bill. Clinton said she was "happy that it never became law." He says she said, " 'I voted for it, but I hoped it wouldn't pass.' " The thing is, being happy about something after it happens is not the same as hoping along the way that it wouldn't happen. And yet, the latter is how Obama characterizes Clinton's words. We need to be clear on this point, given that Obama sets up his charge against Clinton as an example of "political talk" and follows it up with, "That kind of talk, I think it makes people not trust government." Absolutely, Clinton said she regretted her vote. And, had Obama phrased his charge differently, he would have a case here. But because he portrays her wording as a precise quote, and is so incorrect about it, we give him a False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-02-11T00:00:00	2008-02-10	['None']

pomt-05887	In the 2011 legislative session, DEQ's budget was cut 18.5 percent — a disproportionate cut compared to other natural resource agencies.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/07/oregon-environmental-council-oregon-business-assoc/did-oregons-department-environmental-quality-take-/	In an effort to spare the budget of the Department of Environmental Quality, the Oregon Environmental Council and the Oregon Business Association sent a letter to legislators in January, ahead of the monthlong session that started Feb. 1. "In the 2011 legislative session," the letter states, "DEQ's budget was disproportionately cut compared to other natural resource agencies. Overall, DEQis budget cuts totaled 18.5 percent, while the Department of Agriculture experienced a 1.5 percent budget decrease, and the Department of Fish and Wildlife received an 18.3 percent increase." Is that true? We know DEQ’s job is to make sure our vehicles aren’t smoggy and that businesses aren’t polluting our water. We also know the agency is a lightning rod for legislators who claim it over regulates. We didn’t know it had been hit disproportionately when compared with other natural resource agencies. Andrea Salinas, legislative director for the Oregon Environmental Council, quickly clarified in an interview that she did not mean to pit DEQ against the other natural resource agencies. She also said they meant to limit the comparison to the two agencies cited -- Agriculture and Fish and Wildlife. She called the letter a preemptive plea, with projected state revenue down roughly $300 million since the 2011-13 budget was approved in June 2011. We should note that natural resource agencies take up just a fraction -- about $300 million -- of the state’s $15 billion general fund budget. "Natural resources in the general fund is hurting," Salinas said, "and we’d like to see natural resources in the general fund remain whole." See how Salinas refers to the general fund. That’s the part lawmakers control most directly, and it’s what they need to re-balance this month. In the letter, however, the environmental and business group are talking about the agency’s total budget, which includes federal money, grant money and user fee money, as well as state money. It’s true that DEQ’s total budget decreased 18 percent in 2011-13, from 2009-11, and that Agriculture decreased only 1.5 percent and Fish and Wildlife increased 18 percent. But other natural resource agencies were harder hit in total funds, notably the Department of Energy and the Department of Land Conservation and Development. As we’ve said, legislators don’t have control over how much money we get from the federal government, and that’s not what they’re in Salem to re-jigger. If you look at the part they can re-balance, Fish and Wildlife took a much greater hit than DEQ: a 34 percent decrease, compared with an 18 percent decrease for DEQ. (Yes, the decrease in both DEQ budgets was 18 percent.) For Agriculture, the hit was 14 percent. That’s a telling bit of information. The uptick in Fish and Wildlife’s overall budget, by the way, came from a 30 percent increase in user fees and a 12 percent boost in federal money. The bottom line is that there are other natural resource agencies that have taken greater budget hits than DEQ, whether you measure by total funds or general funds, including one of the agencies cited. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate the statement Half True. Return to OregonLive to comment.

pomt-08114	"Last year, ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit. Guess what. They paid zero in taxes. They got a $156 million refund from the IRS."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/10/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-filibuster-exxon-mobil/	On Nov. 30, 2010, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, made a Senate floor speech about the gap between rich and poor in America. It soon went viral on the Internet. After receiving a number of requests by readers to fact-check it, we're doing so. (This predated Sanders' filibuster on Dec. 10, but he made many of the same points in both speeches.) We'll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made in the Nov. 30 speech. In this item, we'll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil. In a separate item, we examined how Sanders characterized the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. In the Nov. 30 speech, Sanders said that the government wasn't doing enough to hold companies such as ExxonMobil accountable. "These people want to cut back on the powers of the EPA and the Department of Energy so that ExxonMobil can remain the most profitable corporation in world history while oil and coal companies continue to pollute our air and our water. Last year, ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit. Guess what. They paid zero in taxes. They got a $156 million refund from the IRS. I guess that is not good enough. We have to give the oil companies even more tax breaks." When we asked Sanders' office for a source of his claim that the company "paid zero in taxes," they pointed us to page 92 of the company's "10-K" form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 26, 2010. The form does indeed include a line that suggests that the company was refunded $156 million in income taxes to the federal government in 2009. But there are two caveats that need to be included when citing this figure. What does the number actually mean? Douglas A. Shackelford, a tax professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina told PolitiFact that the $156 million number refers "to the U.S portion of the current and deferred income tax expense." But he added that this number does not refer to the cash taxes paid by Exxon to the U.S. government. "It is a (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) number, not a figure from their U.S. corporate tax return," Shackelford said. "The actual income taxes paid by the Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. It is not reported in their financial statements." The company agreed with that description. "The U.S. income taxes reported in the financial statements include more than ExxonMobil’s tax bill for 2009," said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. The financial statements, he said, "reflect financial transactions related to U.S. federal income taxes booked by the corporation during the year and include finalization of the taxes for prior years." For instance, the liberal Center for American Progress quoted Jeffers saying that the company's tax figure for 2009 was heavily influenced by a holdover tax issue from 2008 that was technically recorded on its 2009 books. "ExxonMobil was required to bolster its pension plan by $3 billion when the market went down in 2008," wrote CAP's Sima J. Gandhi. "This overpayment reduced the amount of taxes owed in 2008, but the tax adjustment wasn't made until one year later, which led to an overpayment and the refund in 2009." The three-year tax numbers listed on the 10-K do seem to suggest that the company's 2009 tax bill was unusual. In 2007 and 2008, the equivalent tax totals on the 10-K were $4.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, which suggests that some unusual factor reduced the ExxonMobil tax bill into negative territory for 2009. While the company is not obligated to publicize its tax return, and thus the actual amount it paid in taxes, ExxonMobil has voluntarily released a figure for its actual federal income tax bill in response to media requests that questioned why the company reported a negative tax liability in 2009. Jeffers told PolitiFact that the "U.S. income tax expense for 2009 activities was approximately $500 million." The company declined to provide documentation for this number, however. U.S. income taxes aren't the only taxes ExxonMobil paid According to the 10-K, ExxonMobil remitted $6.3 billion in sales taxes, $110 million in state income taxes, and $1.5 billion in "other taxes and duties." All told, the company's tax liability according to its 10-K was $7.7 billion. (These numbers are not necessarily totals actually paid but derived using generally accepted accounting principles.) And that only counts taxes paid in the U.S. It paid an additional $70 billion-plus in taxes to foreign governments in 2009, $15 billion of which was for income taxes. The company does receive credit on its U.S. taxes for many of these foreign tax payments, which helps keep its domestic tax bill lower than it would otherwise be -- a complaint of many of its critics, who would like to see a curtailment of such benefits. Another criticism is that the company is (legally) able to shield some of its income by steering it through subsidiaries based offshore. Sanders spokesman Will Wiquist said that "some have argued that these facts are not accurate because the company paid state and foreign taxes and because they lawfully wrote off the foreign taxes when paying their American federal taxes. Clearly, that is not the point of this statement by Sen. Sanders. He is arguing that the law should be changed to make companies like Exxon pay U.S. income taxes on their massive profits." We agree that the tax policy toward companies like ExxonMobil is a fair subject for debate, but we do think that Sanders' articulation of the facts in his floor speech was misleading, because he omitted several important caveats, including a failure to note that the $156 million number only refers to one specific type of tax -- U.S. income taxes. To his credit, Sanders did make that distinction in a June 9, 2010, speech, saying that ExxonMobil "reported to the SEC that not only did it avoid paying any federal income taxes, it actually received a $156 million refund from the IRS." Still, while focusing on the negative-$156 million figure and saying that the company "paid zero in taxes" in 2009 was eye-catching, it is, at best, misleading. And it ignores the fact that the company paid hundreds of millions in state income taxes, sales taxes and other types of taxes. We can't verify the company's claim that its net tax was $500 million in 2009, but it's incorrect for Sanders to say "paid zero in taxes." We rate his claim False.

pomt-07264	One of every two Wisconsin residents are "on some kind of government handout."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/26/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-/	Addressing the Wisconsin Republican Party’s annual convention on May 21, 2011, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, reflected on the transformational 2010 elections. The GOP swept to power, taking from Democrats the governor’s office as well as control of the Senate and Assembly. "That election needed to happen. Our country is facing challenges we simply can’t ignore," Fitzgerald told hundreds of convention-goers at a Wisconsin Dells resort. "Our government is growing too fast, too big; it’s becoming too expensive. One out of every five people in Wisconsin are on Medicaid or Medicare. One out of every two are on some kind of government handout." One out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half the state’s residents -- receive a "government handout?" That’s a lot of Wisconsinites. We asked Fitzgerald’s spokesman, Andrew Welhouse, for evidence to back up the statement. Welhouse initially said his boss’ claim "looks wrong, but the larger conversation about entitlements and government spending is long overdue." That’s not much of a defense. Welhouse did cite this passage from an April 2011 analysis of federal data done by USA Today: "A record 18.3 percent of the nation's total personal income was a payment from the government for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs in 2010. Wages accounted for the lowest share of income — 51 percent — since the government began keeping track in 1929." That all may be true. But it’s off point. The article indicates what percentage of Americans’ overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance. We told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts. Welhouse didn’t say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today article, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans. The article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however. We contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Here’s what we found: Medicaid: 1,174,874 people, including more than 465,000 children, receive Medicaid, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Medicaid, including the state’s BadgerCare programs, pays for health care for low-income people. Food stamps: 802,979 people, including 353,310 children, were in the FoodShare program as of March 2011, according to the same department. Unemployment insurance: 140,055 people are on unemployment, according to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development. Wisconsin Works (W-2), which replaced traditional welfare: 43,093 people, including 27,614 children, were receiving W-2 cash assistance as of April 2011, according to the Wisconsin Department of Children & Families. Since Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone. If you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention. But the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number – nor could Fitzgerald. We also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a "government handout." All of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term. The article cited by Fitzgerald’s aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts. Here’s the bottom line: Fitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents "is on some kind of government handout." He was able to provide no evidence to back the claim, and even one of his aides essentially acknowledged it was wrong. The Senate leader later provided a different number, but the data he relied on is not specific to Wisconsin. We rate Fitzgerald’s statement False.

This time the accused is state Sen. Jeff Atwater, the Republican candidate for chief financial officer. The accuser is his Democratic opponent, former state Rep. Loranne Ausley. "Tallahassee's a mess, and Jeff Atwater's part of the problem," a narrator says in a TV ad Ausley unveiled Oct. 11, 2010. "Atwater's busy helping his friends and wasting our tax dollars -- $48 million for a government building so lavish it's dubbed the 'Taj Mahal,' $100,000 for a golf museum, and $110 million to build a private prison to help a big contributor." Enter the ad's foil, who (can you believe it?) just happens to be Ausley. "I'm Loranne Ausley, and as chief financial officer I'll eliminate pay-to-play contracts and hold politicians like Jeff Atwater accountable for how they spend our tax dollars," Ausley says. "It's time to clean up the mess in Tallahassee." The three projects Ausley questioned span seven years of Atwater's legislative history, starting in 2003. Let's take a look at each. The $100,000 for a golf museum As a freshman state senator in January 2003, Atwater requested $100,000 to help cover future expenses at the PGA Historical Center in Palm Beach Gardens. The money was included in Community Budget Issue Request -- which is a budget request legislators make for local projects, the state's version of an earmark. State Rep. Carl Domino, R-Jupiter, made a matching request in the state House. The historical center is akin to a golf museum, according to the PGA's website, and features displays of the four major championship trophies and the PGA Golf Professional Hall of Fame. CBIRs, love them or hate them, have been part of the legislative process. (The Legislature stopped the practice in 2009). Ausley has her share of budget requests over eight years in the state House: $400,000 for design, development and construction of public improvements adjacent to the Capitol Center in Tallahassee; $300,000 to help create an information kit for new parents; and $400,000 to restore Tallahassee's waterworks building, are just a few. A lot of times, CBIRs don't get funded. That's the case here -- Atwater's $100,000 request didn't make it into the final 2003-2004 budget. The 'Taj Mahal' courthouse The genesis of the $48 million 'Taj Mahal' 1st District Court of Appeals courthouse came in the form of a bond issue slipped into a 142-page transportation bill on the last day of the 2007 session. Plans for the Tallahassee courthouse included mahogany paneling, 60-inch LCD flat screen televisions for each judge, a private bathroom for each judge (featuring granite countertops) and an accompanying kitchen (complete with microwave and refrigerator). The construction project has been widely panned by elected leaders who said they didn't know that funding was inserted into a transportation bill or blame someone else for letting the building costs rage out of control. The Department of Revenue, for instance, recently constructed a new building at $225 per square foot. The cost of the new courthouse, which will house about 120 state employees? About $425 a square foot. What was Atwater's role in approving the courthouse project? The only link we could find, and the only one the Ausley campaign provided, was that he voted for the transportation bill, HB 985. The bill passed the Senate 37-2. Atwater says he simply voted for a bond issue for the project and that the construction details were handled by the court system and the state building agency. "Apparently I personally went out and hand-built the 1st DCA building," he told the St. Petersburg Times. The Times' Lucy Morgan obtained an e-mail circulated among the judges on the courthouse building committee identifying "heroes'' in delivering the money to build it. The list includes five Republican state senators, then-House speaker Marco Rubio, and others, but not Atwater. And an audit of the courthouse project, ordered by current Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, largely laid blame for the project at the feet of the court and the Department of Management Services, the state agency that oversees construction and leasing of state buildings. Authorization of the bond issue put DMS in charge of the project. Ausley voted against the transportation bill in the House, but says she did not know about the amendment that was added to build the courthouse. The $110 million private prison In 2008, with Florida's prison population growing and expected to continue to grow rapidly, lawmakers added hundreds of millions of dollars in the state budget to construct new prison facilities. Included in the budget was a requirement that the state use some of the money to build a 2,000-bed, $110 million privately operated correctional facility. Proponents say privately run facilities cost taxpayers less, but they are opposed by police unions. It wasn't a new concept -- the state already had six privately managed prison facilities. Atwater's role in the private prison deal? All we could find is that he voted for the state budget, which included the appropriation. Ausley voted against the budget that year. The private prison clause, it turns out, was inserted by former state Rep. Ray Sansom, the one-time Republican House speaker who resigned in disgrace in 2010. The deal did include a requirement that the contract to build the facility be competitively bid. The contract was won by The GEO Group, of Boca Raton -- one of two companies already managing private prison facilities in Florida. The GEO Group manages or owns 116 corrections facilities worldwide. Fast forward to this spring. The private prison, now called the Blackwater River Correctional Facility, was nearing completion but because the prison population hadn't grown as anticipated it had no potential prisoners to take in. Atwater, as Senate president, helped craft a budget deal to allow the new private prison to open by shifting some inmates from state-run prisons to the Blackwater River facility. As we already noted, The GEO Group won the contract to build Blackwater River after Atwater voted for the state budget, which passed the Senate 32-8. But since Ausley talks about The GEO Group as a "big contributor" in the ad, we decided to check that claim out, too. Since 2000 when Atwater was first elected to the state House, The GEO Group, its political action committee and subsidiaries have donated $2,500 to Atwater's campaigns, according to a review of campaign finance records. In the 2010 election cycle alone, The GEO Group's PAC has contributed almost $236,000 to candidates -- including $500 to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink and $500 to Democratic House leader Franklin Sands. Summary Along with the claims, Ausley's ad includes visuals of an actor who plays Atwater accepting envelopes from men in suits and then tucking those envelopes into his jacket pocket. That's an obvious and dubious suggestion that somehow Atwater is taking bribes or kickbacks for his votes. We note it only for its ridiculousness. Ausley makes three claims about Atwater helping his friends and wasting taxpayer dollars. The $100,000 for the PGA golf museum was not included in the state budget. The only connections between Atwater and the 1st District Court of Appeals courthouse project and a 2,000-bed private prison are that Atwater voted on massive bills that included these projects and lots of other things. The ad makes it sound somehow like Atwater was spearheading or directing these projects, when there is zero evidence he was. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02215	"ObamaCare enrollment lie: Obama counts an enrollee as a web user putting a plan in ‘their online shopping carts.’"	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/21/donald-trump/trump-putting-plan-online-shopping-cart-all-it-tak/	News from President Barack Obama that 8 million people have signed up for health insurance plans through state and federal marketplaces has drawn plenty of skepticism from the program’s critics. On Friday, billionaire and occasional presidential contender Donald Trump tweeted that the president’s claim is based on a fundamental deception. "ObamaCare enrollment lie: Obama counts an enrollee as a web user putting a plan in ‘their online shopping carts’," read Trump’s tweet. Anyone curious about the first real test of the health care law is waiting to see how many people actually pay their first premium, so we thought it would be helpful to check the accuracy of Trump’s statement. There is a measure of truth to it, but it glides over many steps in the enrollment process. Applying for coverage We buy so many things online, it’s easy to think that buying health insurance through the government marketplaces follows a familiar pattern. You decide what you want to buy and then you pay for it. But getting health insurance coverage through an Obamacare marketplace is more complicated. Here’s a summary of the steps involved: Create an account Give the names and personal details for the people to be covered Provide Social Security numbers Report your household income List other insurance carried Option to explore Medicaid eligibility Report incarceration, recently gained immigration status, etc. Review and confirm accuracy of submitted information under penalty of perjury Select tax credit (if eligible) and report tobacco use Compare and select a plan -- plan details and monthly premiums displayed Confirm plan selection, access to your tax returns (if using tax credits) Submit application -- payment instructions The final screen on the federal site looks like this: Staff at the press office for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that handles Obamacare, told us that two things happen when this screen appears -- the government counts the person as enrolled and a data record called an 834 goes to the insurance company to start the billing process. If the person clicks the green button at the bottom to pay, what they will see depends on the insurance company. If the company accepts online payment, in theory, they will end up on the company’s payment page. Otherwise, they will get more details on the company’s billing process. The government doesn’t itself accept payments. The mechanics of paying take place between the buyer and the insurance company. At a couple of points in this process, the buyer clicks buttons that say "Enroll," however, at the very end, they learn, "Your payment must be received and processed by the effective date to be fully enrolled." Trump’s tweet included a link to an article on the conservative news website, Townhall.com. The article said "The federal government counts people putting Obamacare plans in their online shopping carts as 'enrolled' before they pay for the plan or check out." A gradual path to full enrollment While it’s accurate that the government will count someone as enrolled before they have paid their bill, in a limited fashion, the insurance companies will also treat them as if they were. America’s Health Insurance Plans is a leading trade association for insurers. According to the AHIP press office, most states require a grace period of 30 or 31 days to give the company time to bill and the buyer time to pay. During that time, the health plan is required to pay claims, so long as the person ultimately pays the premium. Anyone who fails to pay after that first month has troubles. Jonathan Katz is an independent insurance broker in Northern Virginia. Katz told PunditFact that in his area, very few carriers accept online payments and typically, billing takes place through the mail. So far, Katz said the process has worked. "The vast majority pay," Katz said. "Why would you go through that long process and not pay?" The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said that figures from early February show that 80 to 85 percent of new customers have paid their first premium. Other insurance companies have reported similar numbers. Our ruling Trump said that the administration lies about enrollment figures because it counts people when all they have done is put a plan "in their online shopping carts." We've probably all put something in an online shopping cart, thought about it for a couple minutes, decided not to buy it and left it sitting there. If that same scenario occurs on healthcare.gov, does the White House consider a person enrolled? No. For a person to be considered enrolled, they must have submitted their application for health insurance. That information is transmitted to the federal government and the private insurance company. In a literal sense, that’s more than just popping something into an online shopping cart a la Amazon. Trump also is guilty of oversimplifying a highly regulated private industry. While some insurance companies accept online payments and give Obamacare enrollees the option to pay immediately, many do not. In the Virginia-Maryland market for example, most companies mail bills to the new customers who come through the government marketplaces. That means customers don’t even have the option of paying straight away. Also, while customers may not have paid, most states require a grace period of 30 or 31 days where insurers are required to pay claims. So maybe they don’t intend to pay and will eventually lose their coverage. But for now, they are treated as if they were enrolled. And they did a lot more than just load up an online shopping cart. We rate Trump’s claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2014-04-21T16:05:39	2014-04-18	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-13881	"If you're a terrorist you can't fly," but "an assault weapon you can buy."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/01/gwen-moore/poem-rep-gwen-moore-says-terrorists-can-be-banned-/	On Facebook and Twitter, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore describes herself as a mother and grandmother who "loves poetry, reading, knitting and crocheting." With poetry, she not only reads, she writes. The Milwaukee Democrat has penned odes that tweak job creators and Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. (There are videos of her reciting both.) Most recently, Moore turned her rhyming to guns. On June 23, 2016, about a week after the Orlando mass shooting, she tweeted out her poem, "No More Moments of Silence." One line reads: How ironic that if you're a terrorist you can't fly / But quite moronic that an assault weapon you can buy. Leaving aside the adjectives, let’s check the veracity of the verse. Two lists Moore’s claim alludes to two U.S. government lists whose origins stem from 9/11. 1. Terrorist watchlist: The Terrorist Screening Database, commonly called the "terrorist watchlist," contains people "known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in terrorism or terrorist activities." It helps agencies "identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the country, board aircraft, or engage in other activity." As of mid-June 2016, there were about 1 million people on the terrorist watchlist, though fewer than 5,000 were Americans, according to a federal agencies memo to Congress. 2. No Fly List: This is a subset of the terrorist watchlist. People on the no fly list are "prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft that will fly into, out of, over, or within United States airspace." A person can be added to that list if there is "credible information that demonstrates the individual poses a threat of committing a violent act of terrorism with respect to civil aviation, the homeland, United States interests located abroad, or is operationally capable of doing so." There are about 81,000 people on the no fly list, including fewer than 1,000 Americans. A key difference between the two lists, of course, is there is no constitutional right to fly but there is one to own a gun. Moore’s claim The first part of Moore’s claim, that terrorists can’t fly, is pretty straightforward. You don’t have to be a known terrorist to be prohibited from flying. As we noted, people who the government believes pose a threat of committing terrorism in connection with air travel, and are on the no fly list, also are prohibited. The second part of her claim -- that terrorists can buy assault weapons -- goes a bit too far, in that not all of the people on the terrorist watchlist are terrorists. Many are only suspected to be involved in terrorist activities and, like the Orlando shooter was, are removed from the list. Moreover, terrorists who have been convicted of a felony, or are under indictment, can’t legally buy a gun. But Moore’s point, contrasting the no fly list with the terrorist watchlist, is on target in that people on the watchlist can buy guns. Under federal law, there is no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing firearms simply because they appear on the terrorist watchlist. There must be some other disqualifying factor, such as a felony conviction, illegal immigration status, or being under indictment. In fact, from 2004 through 2015, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, individuals on the terrorist watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 2,477 times, of which 91 percent were allowed to proceed. Our rating Moore said: "If you're a terrorist you can't fly," but "an assault weapon you can buy." Terrorists, as well as people deemed potential terrorists who are on the federal government’s no-fly list are prohibited from flying. Terrorists who have a felony conviction can’t legally buy guns, but people on the government’s terrorist watchlist can, assuming they aren’t disqualified for some other reason.

pomt-13795	Says "(Clinton) called President Assad a ‘reformer.’ She called Assad a ‘different kind of leader.’ "	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-clintons-reformer-quote/	The second night of the Republican National Convention turned into the court of political opinion when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the stage. Christie reached back into his days as a federal prosecutor to do something the Justice Department said it would not do: prosecute Hillary Clinton for her performance as secretary of state. Christie pulled out criticisms of example after example — the end of the Cuban embargo, the Iran nuclear negotiations, her support for ousting fallen Libya dictator Muammar Gaddafi — before asking the crowd to shout its "guilty" or "not guilty" verdict. One of his charges included an oft-referenced comment she made about President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. "In Syria, imagine this, imagine this. (Clinton) called President Assad a ‘reformer.’ She called Assad a ‘different kind of leader,’ " Christie said. "There’s now 400,000 now dead — think about that. Four hundred thousand dead at the hands of a man that Hillary defended." PolitiFact has heard this claim before, first from Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace in June 2014, and again from U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio in October 2015. The attack has stuck to Clinton but the quote requires more context. The Arab Spring of 2011 pitted Assad, who assumed the presidency in 2000, and his government against citizens rising up for change. The starting point for what became a bloody civil war came in the remote city of Daraa, where 15 schoolchildren were arrested for spray-painting anti-government graffiti on their school with messages such as "the people want to topple the regime," according to CNN. The military used brutal force to address sit-ins in Damascus and Daraa over the treatment of the jailed protesters, which spurred thousands more Syrians to turn against Assad. Clinton talked about the developments Syria on CBS’ Face the Nation on March 27, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer pressed her on why the U.S. reaction would be different from its response to Libya with air strikes. Syria, Schieffer noted, is no friend of the United States as an enemy of Israel and ally of Iran, and Assad’s father had "killed 25,000 people, at a lick" in 1982. Clinton’s response did include the word "reformer" in regards to Assad, but there was more to it than Christie and others let on. Here’s her response to Schieffer on March 27, 2011: "Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don't think that it's yet clear what will occur, what will unfold. "There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer. "What's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning, but there's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities than police actions which, frankly, have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see." Two days later, Clinton was questioned by a Wall Street Journal reporter over what critics interpreted as her defense of Assad’s regime. "I referenced opinions of others," Clinton said. "That was not speaking either for myself or for the administration." The video shows she attributed the "reformer" opinion to "members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months." But there is a problem, as both PolitiFact and the Washington Post reported, with the "both parties" part. Democrats who visited with Assad around that time included California’s Nancy Pelosi, who was the House speaker in 2007, and Sen. John Kerry, then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Kerry had an optimistic view of Assad’s leadership when he said, "Syria will change, as it embraces a legitimate relationship with the United States and the West." But Republicans? The Washington Post counted 13 Republicans who traveled to Syria, but they expressed skepticism, not hope, for Assad’s government. As the military crackdown on Syrians grew worse, Obama and Clinton called on Assad to go. Clinton was interviewed in November 2011 by Jake Tapper, who noted how she "at one point seemed to have optimism that Assad was a reformer." Clinton said, "Well, we had hoped so because there was a lot at stake, we wanted to see an agreement, for example, between Syria and Israel. That was something that people have been working on for 30 years. We heard what Assad said about what he wanted to do for reform. But when it came to it, in the Arab Spring and as people actually demanded some freedom and their rights, he responded, as we have seen, very violently." Christie didn’t include this chapter in his prime-time "indictment." A query to Christie’s spokesperson was not returned by deadline. Our ruling Christie attacked Clinton for calling Assad a "reformer" and a "different kind of leader." She did use those words, mostly, but there is more to the story. When she used the word "reformer," Clinton was referencing the opinions of members of Congress who had interacted with the Syrian president and hoped he represented change for the country. And she said, "There is a different leader in Syria now," and not "a different kind of leader." Christie is taking quotes by Clinton out of context, and ignoring historical events that followed, when Clinton denounced Assad and called for his exit.

pomt-07446	Under a proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, people on Medicare will only have $15,000 from the federal government to spend on their health care.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/20/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-gop-proposal-would-limit-seniors-1/	During the April 15, 2011, edition of HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, the liberal host and his ideologically diverse panel had an animated discussion about a proposal to overhaul Medicare that has been offered by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan’s plan was included in a budget resolution that passed the House on a near party-line vote earlier that day. Republicans argue that bold proposals like Ryan’s are needed to rein in rising federal debt, while Democrats counter that the Ryan’s proposal for Medicare is too radical. Here’s what Maher said. (For purposes of clarity, we’ve cut a few interjections by other panel members.) "This Ryan plan for Medicare … is to … get rid of Medicare as we have known it, give seniors a $15,000 voucher to buy Medicare, which probably does not cover the health costs for a lot of seniors. Not to mention, what insurance company is going to want to sell insurance to a 75-year-old sick person? Well, what happens when you run out of the $15,000? You get sick and die. … "What happens to a person, if this plan is enacted, who uses the $15,000 -- which, by the way, if they’re in an assisted living facility, they’ll go through it in three months -- what happens to them? What do they do when they use up the $15,000 by this time of the year? What happens for the rest of the year? What happens to them? What happens? I’m just asking. ... "But this seems pretty black and and white. (What happens) if you have $15,000 to spend and you run out of the $15,000 and still have more days to live?" A reader who watched the show asked us to check whether Maher had described the proposal accurately. So we did. We turned to Ryan’s official proposal, but we found its description too general to fully compare it to what Maher had said. So we looked instead at an April 5, 2011, analysis of Ryan’s proposal released by the Congressional Budget Office. CBO is Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of fiscal matters. According to CBO, Ryan’s proposal would "convert the current Medicare system to a system of premium support payments." People who turn 65 in 2022 or later "would not enroll in the current Medicare program but instead would be entitled to a premium support payment to help them purchase private health insurance." (People who turn 65 before 2022 would remain in traditional Medicare.) This premium support payment is similar (though not identical) to a voucher. With the payment in hand, beneficiaries "would choose among competing private insurance plans operating in a newly established Medicare exchange," CBO says. "Those plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the Office of Personnel Management. Plans would have to issue insurance to all people eligible for Medicare who applied and would have to charge the same premiums for all enrollees of the same age." The size of the premium support payment would vary depending on the beneficiary’s health status and income. The payment for 65-year-olds in 2022 would average $8,000 -- roughly the same as the federal government currently pays for 65-year-olds in traditional Medicare (when calculated by subtracting beneficiary premium payments from the government’s Medicare outlays). The payment to beneficiaries would increase annually according to the general rate of inflation and the beneficiary’s age. The premium support would be reduced for those in the top 8 percent of the annual income distribution. CBO says that the "projected net federal spending per capita for all people age 65 and older in traditional Medicare would be about $15,000 in 2022." That appears to be the source of Maher’s $15,000 figure. That’s an average for all Medicare beneficiaries over 65 in 2022, so there would actually be quite a bit of variation in the amount paid to various beneficiaries. But that's not the basis for our ruling. Our takeaway from Maher’s comments is that he believes the elderly would have $15,000 to spend on health care overall, and if that money were to run out, they’d be out of luck. As Maher put it, what would happen "if you have $15,000 to spend and you run out of the $15,000 and still have more days to live?" Problem is, that’s not an accurate portrayal of how Ryan’s plan would work. The average Medicare beneficiary in 2022 wouldn’t have $15,000 to spend on all health-care-related expenses. They’d be given $15,000 to purchase a health insurance plan. That plan, in turn, would pay at least part of their medical bills. That plan might have limits and co-pays and deductibles -- as current Medicare does -- but the money the plan could spend on any given beneficiary’s health expenses would not be capped at $15,000 per year. The $15,000 limit only refers to what the government will pay for the insurance plan itself. We don’t take a position on whether the Ryan prescription for Medicare is good or bad policy. There’s a debate to be had, for instance, over whether $15,000 will be enough to purchase a good insurance plan for Medicare beneficiaries, who are older and sicker, on average, than Americans as a whole. And according to CBO, the typical 65-year-old would be responsible for a bigger share of costs -- including premiums, deductibles and co-payments -- under Ryan’s plan than under traditional Medicare, due to such factors as higher administrative costs (including profits) for private plans and a slower increase in the government’s contribution over time than the rate at which medical costs increase. Still, we think that Maher’s basic description of what Ryan’s proposal would do -- which was essentially unchallenged by his fellow panelists -- misleads viewers who are unfamiliar with Ryan’s proposal. So we rate his comments False.	None	Bill Maher	None	None	None	2011-04-20T18:01:23	2011-04-15	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Paul_Ryan']

pomt-14191	Says Ted Cruz "wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/22/great-america-pac/pro-donald-trump-pac-hits-ted-cruz-amnesty-illegal/	As Donald Trump was being rebuked for saying women who get an abortion should be punished, a pro-Trump political action committee attacked Ted Cruz on Syrian refugees and illegal immigration. Great America PAC aired its TV ad in Wisconsin and other markets on March 31, 2016, a day after Trump’s abortion comments in Green Bay and six days before Wisconsin’s primary election. Refugee center in Hoxter, Germany, that primarily serves refugees from Syria. (Mark Hoffman photo) The 30-second spot shows a woman in her kitchen with two children. She starts by talking about Trump and terrorist attacks in Europe and California. "Sure, I get some grief when I say I'm voting for Donald Trump. But you know what? I want to protect my family. Paris, San Bernardino and now Brussels? I want a president that will keep us safe. "We need to control our borders and stop letting in dangerous people. Trump will do that. And Ted Cruz? He wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants. That won't protect my family. Donald Trump will." Cruz -- who handily won Wisconsin, but has almost no chance to win the Republican presidential nomination on the first ballot at the party’s convention -- has cast himself as tough on terrorism and border control. We found that the ad’s clever use of the past tense -- in saying the Texas senator wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants -- has some foundation. But the foundation isn’t entirely solid. And when the woman in the ad returns to speaking in the present tense -- "That won’t protect my family" -- the ad leaves a misleading impression of Cruz’s current positions. Setting the table A few notes up front: Great America PAC, founded in February 2016 and formerly known as TrumPAC, didn’t respond to our requests for information to support the ad’s claim. A Cruz campaign spokesman told us that on immigration, the senator never backed amnesty and that on Syrian refugees, he never backed an increase in the numbers. The Washington Post Fact Checker gave the ad two Pinocchios -- its rating for a claim that has "significant omissions and/or exaggerations." Our evaluation was similar. ‘Wanted to let in more Syrian refugees’ As reported during the presidential campaign by the Huffington Post, Cruz in 2014 expressed support for allowing Syrian refugees into the United States. He said in a Fox News report on Syrian refugees (as shown in a video is on Cruz’s own Senate web page): "We have welcomed refugees — the tired, huddled masses — for centuries. That’s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so." He added: "We have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that." The Fact Checker found in reviewing other Cruz statements in 2014 that he was not a particularly vocal advocate for accepting more refugees, but he supported the idea. After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Cruz changed course, seeking to ban Syrian refugees who are Muslim from entering the United States. Wanted to ‘give amnesty to illegal immigrants’ Some consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements. Both the Fact Checker and FactCheck.org found it impossible to sort out Cruz’s position on the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill from the so-called Gang of Eight. FactCheck.org noted that one Cruz amendment to the bill would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally -- but, purposefully, also left intact provisions to provide legal status for them. And the Fact Checker pointed out that Cruz introduced five amendments to the bill, including one that expanded legal immigration, and gave passionate speeches in support of his amendments. Cruz now contends his amendments were meant as a "poison pill" to kill the bill, which ultimately fell apart. But as the Fact Checker observed, "there’s no way to prove which version of the story is the truth; what we can say is that Cruz was being disingenuous then or disingenuous now." As for now, Cruz is adamantly against amnesty. Our rating Great America PAC says Cruz "wanted to let in more Syrian refugees and give amnesty to illegal immigrants." Cruz in 2014 supported continuing to allow Syrian refugees into the United States and in 2013, he appeared to back measures to give legal status to illegal immigrants. At the same time, the political action committee’s ad suggests those positions are current ones, when they aren’t. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84579ab4-4915-4d6f-b127-4fd5f9fd9bb7	None	Great America PAC	None	None	None	2016-04-22T18:22:42	2016-03-31	['Ted_Cruz', 'Syria']

pomt-03054	"At the time that (Medicare Part D) was passed (it) was actually less popular than the Affordable Care Act, according to the polls."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-medicare-part-d-was-less-popular-obamac/	In the midst of a government shutdown stemming from Republican opposition to the Affordable Care Act, we’ve heard many times that the controversial law has a consistently low approval rating. President Barack Obama’s response to that criticism is that his signature health care law isn’t the only one that had a rocky start in the polls. He says Medicare Part D, the subsidized prescription drug program for seniors, faced the same struggle at first. "At the time that (Medicare Part D) was passed (it) was actually less popular than the Affordable Care Act, according to the polls," he told NPR in an interview that aired Oct. 1, 2013. We decided to check into the poll results. The prescription drug benefit was signed into law by President George W. Bush in December 2003 as part of the Medicare Modernization Act. The program passed by a close margin after Republican leadership whipped votes for several hours. February 2004 poll results from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which experts told us did the most thorough work on the issue, show that 25 percent of adults favored Part D, while 38 percent had an unfavorable view. The rest were either neutral or didn’t know. Those numbers didn’t change much until November 2006, after the enrollment period had been open nearly a year, said Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University. By contrast, in September 2013 the Affordable Care Act registered a 39 percent favorable rating and a 43 percent unfavorable rating, according to Kaiser. That hasn’t changed all that much since the law was drafted in 2009. So if Obama was measuring how many people liked Medicare Part D (25 percent) compared with the health care law (39 percent), he’s right that Obamacare is more popular. But the health care law also has higher unfavorable ratings. Polling shows that 43 percent have an unfavorable view of Obamacare, while fewer, 38 percent, had an unfavorable view of Medicare Part D. We’ll note that those who didn’t want to express an opinion about Medicare Part D was much higher than the health care law, at 37 percent versus 17 percent. Both polls have a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Factoring these in leaves unfavorability ratings a wash, while Obamacare still sees a significantly higher favorability rating. As for the point Obama intended to make by noting the statistics, that Medicare Part D became more popular as people became familiar with it, we found that also holds water. Today, 9 out of every 10 seniors are satisfied with Medicare Part D, though we should note that’s according to the Healthcare Leadership Council, which is made up of health care executives. "When you think of the popularity of Part D today, it’s easy to forget how divided people were," Hoadley said. "People felt like they didn’t have enough information to understand the program." Of course, it’s too soon to say if Obamacare will have the same long-term success in the public eye. Robert Blendon, a Harvard University health policy professor, said that poll results could start to shift as early as May, after enough people have had personal experiences with the law. "It’s going to be a consumer issue rather than a policy issue," Blendon said. Obamacare’s popularity will also be affected in the next few years by the rhetoric of elections in 2014 and 2016, Hoadley said. So while people could look back years from now and not remember the act being a sharply divided policy issue, that shift won’t likely happen overnight. Now, the comparison Obama sets up isn’t the most straightforward, Blendon said. The prescription drug program for seniors is just one part of Medicare, which began in 1965. For students of politics, comparing Medicare itself with Obamacare would be more apples-to-apples. The former was favored by a majority of Americans at the time it was passed. Our ruling To illustrate that the Affordable Care Act can overcome its low popularity ratings, Obama claimed that Medicare Part D was even less popular when it first passed. Polling data shows that a lower percentage of people favored Part D in 2004 than favor Obamacare in 2013. However, depending on the margin of error, a slightly higher percentage of people may view the president’s reform unfavorably compared with Part D. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-01026	Atmospheric conditions could push a football’s pressure "down approximately one-and-a-half pounds per square inch."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/29/bill-belichick/factchecking-bill-belichick-deflategate/	The New England Patriots might wish this entire business of under-inflated footballs would vanish in a puff of smoke, but it’s a boon for physics teachers who have found themselves suddenly relevant in the world of sports. Patriots coach Bill Belichick, a self-declared non-scientist, held a pre-Super Bowl news conference where he attempted to explain why a football inflated indoors would lose pressure after being used outside. "When the footballs are delivered to the officials' locker room, the officials were asked to inflate them to 12.5 pounds per square inch. What exactly they did, I don’t know," Belichick said. "When the footballs go out on to the field into game conditions ... That’s where the measurements would be different than what they are, possibly different, than what they are in a controlled environment." Belichick said when Patriot staffers tested this, they found that the balls "were down approximately one-and-a-half pounds per square inch." There are too many unknowns to resolve Deflategate, as this flap is called. But we couldn't help but give Belichick's main assertion the PunditFact treatment. The question in this case is what physics tells us about Belichick’s point. Could conditions outside (basically temperature and humidity) bring down the pressure of a football by about 1.5 pounds per square inch? A quick recap The Patriots advanced to the Super Bowl on Jan. 18, 2015, by defeating the Indianapolis Colts 45-7. But by the next day, the most interesting number wasn’t the point spread, but the inflation pressure of the Patriots’ footballs. Under NFL rules, each team provides 12 balls, and about two hours before the game, an official verifies that they are inflated to the regulation pressure range of 12.5 to 13.5 pounds per square inch. At half-time, the NFL re-checked the Patriots’ footballs -- reportedly at the request of the Colts but there’s a bit of conflicting information on this -- and found 11 of the 12 were under inflated. By how much? That’s unclear. Some reports say by 2 pounds per square inch. Others say while one ball might have measured that low, the rest were only about 1 pound under. One other essential variable: The temperature on game day was around 50 degrees. No one knows the exact inside temperature. Most people assume it was about 70 degrees. Doing the math After Belichick spoke, ABC News turned to Bill Nye, the popular explainer of all things scientific, to assess the coach’s claim. ABC played up Nye's verdict that Belichick's words "didn’t make any sense," but from the video, it sounds as though Nye was talking about Belichick's claim that rubbing the footballs would change the pressure, not the impact of temperature. CBS Sports relayed a tweet from another science luminary, physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson who also expressed skepticism. "For the Patriots to blame a change in temperature for 15 percent lower-pressures, requires balls to be inflated with 125-degree air," Tyson wrote. CBS reported that "Every 10 degree drop in temperature (F) results in about .2 PSI loss in a football." According to CBS, that meant the weather would account for just a 0.4 pound of pressure loss, and tied that conclusion, loosely, to an Ohio State University physicist. We’ll get back to that CBS story (and its flaws) in a bit. On the other side of the ledger, USA Today interviewed Bowdoin College physics professor Dale Syphers who declared that a drop from room temperature in the 70s down to 40 degrees would reduce the pressure in a football by 1.3 pounds per square inch. The Daily Beast turned to the chair of the Physics Department at Boston College who said that with a 30 degree drop in temperature -- 75 down to 45 degrees -- you would expect the ball pressure to fall by by 1.54 pounds per square inch. Finally, the world of physics is divided between the theoretical physicists and the experimentalists. The physicists cited in the news worked with formulas. HeadSmart Labs, a private firm in Pittsburgh, tested actual footballs. It found that footballs inflated at 75 degrees, then cooled to 50 degrees lost 1.1 pounds of pressure. The lab took one more step. Since it was raining on game day, the staff dampened the balls. This led to a drop of an additional 0.7 pounds of pressure for a total of at least 1.8 pounds per square inch. The physics teachers come off the bench Enter Robert Hilborn of the American Association of Physics Teachers. The Harvard-trained physicist showed in detail how a law of physics, the ideal gas law, applied to the Patriots’ footballs. When a gas cools, it contracts. The ideal gas law helps us put numbers to that relationship between pressure and temperature. Math alert: We’re going to show you pretty much everything, so you can do it yourself at home. "As almost every chemistry and physics student knows, the ideal gas law tells us that Pf = Pi (Tf/Ti)," Hilborn wrote. The final pressure Pf equals the initial pressure Pi times the final temperature divided by the initial temperature Tf/Ti. Plugging in the numbers is simple, so long as you keep two things in mind. First, the pressure isn’t the pressure you see on your pressure gauge. It’s that amount plus the pressure of the atmosphere that’s all around you. It might feel counterintuitive, but when a football comes off the assembly line, before it's ever pumped up, it actually has an internal pressure that you wouldn't notice because it's the same as the pressure we always ignore. That's the pressure that comes from all those miles of air in our atmosphere pushing down on us. That pressure averages around 14.7 pounds per square inch. When you pump air into the football, you are adding pressure on top of the 14.7 that are already there. In Hilborn's math, you'll see he's added in the atmospheric pressure. The other key step is to measure the temperature in Celsius and count from absolute zero. That’s the Kelvin scale. Hilborn used a starting temperature of 70 degrees and a final temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit and a starting pressure of 12.5 pounds per square inch. "Those numbers give us 27.2 psi for Pi, 294 K for Ti, and 283 K for Tf resulting in Pf = 26.2 psi for the total pressure and a corresponding gauge pressure of 11.5 psi, about 1 psi below the NFL lower limit." In short, taking the balls outside would bring the pressure down 1 pound per square inch. Hilborn then accounted for the rain that day. Cooling the moist air inside the footballs would shed another 0.2 pounds per square inch. "Combining the air temperature change effect with that of water vapor gives us a total of 1.2 psi, not too far from the figure of 1.4 psi given in one of the early NFL statements," Hilborn wrote. Hilborn’s results are pure math, and they are largely in line with the test results from the lab in Pittsburgh. The results in other news reports We were troubled by the CBS item that came up with a much lower number of 0.4 pounds per square inch due to a lower outdoor temperature. But when we called Prof. Michael Lisa, the Ohio State University physicist quoted in the CBS article, Lisa said, "CBS got it wrong." Lisa sent us this chart that you can download showing that for each 10 degrees drop in temperature, pressure drops 0.5 pounds. (The chart’s different lines show that the higher the starting pressure, the greater the impact of falling temperature.) We found that news reports that undercut the Patriots’ explanation used a high number for the loss of pressure. CBS said the footballs lost 2 pounds of pressure. Ditto for a Toronto Sun article. If it turns out that there really was a loss that large, then those arguments hold up. For the moment, we are simply assessing whether the physics back up what Belichick said and he used the 1.5 pound figure. Lisa also affirmed Hilborn’s analysis. "That AAPT guy did a nice job," Lisa said. Nevertheless, Hilborn himself said no one should rush to judgment. "A conservative conclusion is that temperature changes alone can account for much of the under-inflation," Hilborn wrote. "But until more accurate information is available about the preparation of and measurement of the footballs’ air pressure, we should not assert that conclusion with a great deal of certainty." The NFL is investigating and at some point, all the numbers might be known. Or not. Hilborn told PunditFact that the accuracy of the pressure gauges is unclear. One number that will be of interest is the starting pressure for the Colts’ footballs. It's possible they may have deflated as well, but stayed within the legal limits. Our ruling Belichick said that moving the footballs from indoors to outdoors could explain the loss of about 1.5 pounds per square inch of pressure. Experimental and mathematical results are in that ballpark. Lab tests said air temperature alone could bring down the pressure by 1.1 pounds. The ideal gas law predicted a 1 pound loss. The rain that day would explain at least another 0.2 pound shift and possibly as much as 0.7. We lack firm numbers on the actual pressure drop in the Patriots footballs, as well as precise information on the starting and ending temperatures. Within the limits of what the physics alone can tell us at this point, the math gets us pretty close to what Belichick said. With allowances for the uncertain data, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12315	The Trump administration has granted amnesty to "nearly 100,000 'Dreamers' "	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/21/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-trump-granted-amnesty-nearly-1000/	Conservative pundit Ann Coulter, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, is calling him out for stalling on key immigration promises, including the deportation of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants. Trump campaigned on a hardline stance against immigrants who violated immigration laws, promising to deport them and to "immediately terminate" programs created during the Obama administration. One of those programs, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), gives deportation reprieves to immigrants who came to the United States as children and have no legal authorization to live here, so-called "Dreamers." As of June 8, DACA was still in effect, and the Trump administration continued to take applications, prompting Coulter to tweet: "HOW TRUMP LOSES THE NEXT ELECTION. Nearly 100,000 ‘Dreamers’ Granted Amnesty In Trump’s Opening Months." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Her tweet linked to an article from conservative news outlet The Daily Caller, headlined "Nearly 100,000 ‘Dreamers’ Granted Amnesty In Trump’s Opening Months" — part of the text in Coulter’s tweet. We wondered if her tweet was accurate. We found that the numbers are in line with data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, but whether the program grants "amnesty" is a matter of debate among experts. DACA by the numbers About a month into Trump’s administration, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly rescinded all previous enforcement priorities memos. But he kept in place a June 2012 memo that created DACA and a November 2014 memo for a separate deferred action program that would have benefitted immigrants in the country illegally who are parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. On June 15, the Trump administration revoked the memo that benefitted the parents, but said DACA would remain in place. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on June 19 said DACA is under review but did not provide a timeline for a final determination. Close to 800,000 immigrants have been approved for DACA, according to USCIS data released June 8. The latest numbers show approvals from 2012 up to March 31, 2017. From January 2017 to March 2017, immigration officials approved more than 124,000 applications: 107,524 renewal cases plus 17,275 initial cases. How many have been approved since Trump took office Jan. 20? The Daily Caller, citing USCIS numbers, reported that the Trump administration through DACA had "given amnesty to an estimated 98,000 illegal immigrants." We reached out to The Daily Caller’s reporter, Alex Pfeiffer, who told us he reached the estimated 98,000 by dividing the total number of cases approved from January through March by the number of business days in that period, and removing days in January that Trump was not in office. Pfeiffer said he only used business days in the calculation, because those are the only days that USCIS accepts DACA applications. USCIS told us DACA applications are not accepted online, only by mail, and that the lockbox where requests are sent typically accepts mail from Monday through Friday. We did our own calculation using Pfeiffer’s parameters and also got about 98,000. We asked USCIS for a month-by-month breakdown of approved applications, but did not receive the information by deadline. Coulter did not respond to our inquiries sent via social media or her booking company. DACA recipients granted amnesty? Whether DACA beneficiaries are getting amnesty is a not a settled matter among experts. We’ve noted before that a legal definition of amnesty is "a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out … Amnesty is not a pardon as some believe, since a pardon implies forgiveness, and amnesty indicates a reason to overlook or forget the offenses." The common reference for amnesty in modern American politics is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law paved the way for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become lawful permanent residents if they met certain requirements, including being in the country by Jan. 1, 1982. Individuals granted DACA are protected from deportation for two years and are eligible for work permits. Recipients can apply to renew their DACA protection, but are not granted a lawful status. DACA is a temporary and limited kind of relief that can be revoked by the president, said Kevin R. Johnson, an immigration law expert and dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. "DACA does not create a lasting ‘amnesty’ and lawful permanent residence" as did the 1986 law, Johnson said. Others see it differently. Based on the benefits it offers, DACA is amnesty, said Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels. "I would define an amnesty as such whenever the law is set aside and the normal penalty is waived as a matter of policy," Camarota said. "The normal penalty for being in the U.S. illegally is removal." Our ruling In a tweet, Coulter said the Trump administration granted amnesty to "Nearly 100,000 'Dreamers.' " Trump assumed office Jan. 20. Data from USCIS shows more than 124,000 people have been approved for DACA from January to March. Calculations of the total applications approved January through March that only include days Trump has been in office show that, at least, about 98,000 were approved. Whether the program is amnesty is subject to interpretation. For that reason, we rate Coulter’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-13999	"I've cut the budget of the (lieutenant governor’s) office by more than half."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/06/carlos-lopez-cantera/carlos-lopez-cantera-says-he-slashed-his-office-bu/	In the crowded Republican primary to replace U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera says he has evidence that he takes care of taxpayers’ wallets. "I've cut the budget of the office by more than half, reduced the staff," he said in an interview on the April 30 Money, Power, Politics show on Fox 13 in Tampa. "I'm the only lieutenant governor to not take a security detail." He has declined his security detail, breaking from his predecessors. Lopez-Cantera has also cut the budget and reduced staff positions. But he is leaving out some context. The only official role of the lieutenant governor is to replace the governor if he leaves offices or dies. What he or she does in the meantime varies with the governor and his or her vision. Lopez-Cantera is not as active or in the public eye as much as some of his predecessors, rarely posting official events on his public calendar and not tasked with any special assignments from Gov. Rick Scott. Scott’s first lieutenant governor, Jennifer Carroll, resigned in March 2013 after she was questioned by law enforcement about her ties to a charity group that was the subject of probes. (She was not charged with wrongdoing.) She chaired a task force about Florida’s Stand Your Ground law after Trayvon Martin’s death and chaired the Space Florida Board. Scott tapped Lopez-Cantera, a former state legislator and Miami-Dade property appraiser, to replace her almost a year later in February 2014. Let’s see how the budget changed. Reducing budget and staff The lieutenant governor’s budget has ranged from about $245,000 to $540,000 in recent years. Lopez-Cantera’s office does not have its own budget like other state agencies. Scott proposes a budget that includes the lieutenant governor. It is then up to the Legislature to pass a budget, which Scott then signs into law. The amount of money below includes the $125,000 annual salary for the lieutenant governor. Year Allotment Expenditure 2009-10 $439,646 $433,006 2010-11 $540,440 $537,664 2011-12 $504,169 $587,389 2012-13 $509,806 $471,091 2013-14 $245,016 $156,435 2014-15 $485,160 $415,522 2015-16 $240,693 $242,875 2016-17 Not announced yet NA So for a few years the lieutenant governor’s budget was about $500,000. The it was chopped in half to $245,016 for the 2013-14 budget year that started July 1, 2013, a few months after Carroll resigned. It’s no surprise that the allocation dropped since the office was vacant. Since Lopez-Cantera took office in February 2014, it is also not surprising the allotment nearly doubled to $485,160 for the 2014-15 budget year. The next year, the budget allotment dropped to slightly less than when Lopez-Cantera started to $240,693 — a 50 percent decrease. Most of the budget is staff salaries. Employee Count (excluding LG) As of January 1, 2010* 3 As of January 1, 2011** 5 As of January 1, 2012** 5 As of January 1, 2013** 5 As of February, 2014*** 4 As of January 1, 2015*** 2 As of January 1, 2016*** 1 * Kottkamp ** Carroll *** Lopez-Cantera Lopez-Cantera cut the staff, but it’s worth noting that the size of the staff was small for starters. It's also worth keeping in mind that Lopez-Cantera has access to the full weight of the governor's office for his needs, including the press office, legislative aides and budget analysts. Under Carroll, there were five employees in the lieutenant governor’s office each year, which included a chief of staff and assistants. When Lopez-Cantera started in February 2014, there were four staffers. Then the number dropped to two, and now he just has one employee whose title is a special assistant. The governor’s office said no one was laid off. We asked if that meant that Lopez-Cantera cut empty positions or shifted jobs to the governor’s office or elsewhere. The governor’s office didn’t answer that question. Our ruling Lopez-Cantera said, "I've cut the budget of the office by more than half." He omits some context about how his office budget works. Scott recommends a budget, which is then approved by the Legislature. Lopez-Cantera's own resources may be limited, but he downplays the access he has to Scott's vast governing operation for assistance. Months after Lopez-Cantera started, the budget rose by roughly double to bring it more in line to where it was when a lieutenant governor in the office. But after that increase, the budget allotment dropped the next year to slightly less than when Lopez-Cantera started to $240,693 — a 50 percent decrease. The budget largely pays for Lopez-Cantera’s salary as well as a special assistant.

pomt-10057	"There is no disagreement that we need action by our government, a recovery plan that will help to jump-start the economy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/30/barack-obama/some-economists-disagree-obama/	There's plenty of debate about how to respond to the economic crisis, but you wouldn't know that from the comments of President Obama and fellow Democrats. "Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we don't act swiftly and boldly, we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double-digit unemployment and the American dream slipping further and further out of reach," Obama said in his weekly address on Jan. 3, 2009. "Every economist from right to left, Republican, Democrat, advises that (a government stimulus) has to be a very substantial package," said Democratic Congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland on Jan. 4. "There's no disagreement that we need action by our government — a recovery plan that will help to jump-start the economy," Obama said at news conference on Jan. 9. "Everybody, I think, from economists on the left to economists on the right realize that we must make critical investments at this time," said White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel on Jan. 18. The libertarians at the Cato Institute got weary of this line of argument and took out a newspaper ad in the New York Times on Jan. 28, 2009. "With all due respect Mr. President, that is not true," the ad said. "More government spending by Hoover and Roosevelt did not pull the United States economy out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. More government spending did not solve Japan's 'lost decade' in the 1990s. As such, it is a triumph of hope over experience to believe that more government spending will help the U.S. today," the ad says. "Lower tax rates and a reduction in the burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth." The Cato ad has 203 signatories, including three recent Nobel Prize winners. We talked to one of the Nobel winners, Edward Prescott of Arizona State University, who won in 2004, about Obama's plan. "I agree with his wants, but just because you want something, that doesn't make it happen," Prescott said. "I guess he thinks that everything can be solved by people's goodwill and good actions coming from Washington, D.C." Prescott advocates for a permanent reductions of the income tax or, failing that, nothing. "I hope Obama succeeds, but benign neglect is a good policy," he said. Before we go much further, we should point out that there are many economists who do believe a stimulus is needed, and yesterday. For what it's worth, the most recent recipient of the Nobel for economics, Paul Krugman, supports the stimulus and has written about how wrong the opponents are. "Conservatives really, really don’t want to see a second New Deal, and they certainly don’t want to see government activism vindicated. So they are reaching for any stick they can find with which to beat proposals for increased government spending," Krugman wrote recently in his New York Times column . Far be it from us to referee a knife fight between Ph.D. economists. But for those who are interested in how economists deal with facts, we would point you to the very interesting blog and podcasts of economist Russell Roberts of George Mason University. Roberts also opposes the stimulus bill, though he did not sign the Cato ad. Roberts said that economists actually agree on lots of things, but when it comes to big, new problems like the recent crisis, things get complicated. It's difficult to look back in history and pinpoint exact causes for economic turnarounds. "We're trying to tease out the effect of one social policy in the face of hundreds of thousands of other changes," he said in a podcast on the role of empirical evidence and bias in economics. So where does that leave us for our ruling? We can't tell you which side is right on the stimulus bill. But we do know that Obama is wrong when he says there is "no disagreement that we need action by our government." Clearly, there is disagreement. We rate his statement False.

pomt-08164	"Pls refer to Jan.1 tax changes appropriately: they're OBAMA TAX HIKES & they'll slam every American's savings, investments & job opportunity"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/02/sarah-palin/obama-tax-hikes-just-easily-call-them-bush-tax-hik/	Sarah Palin has been traveling the country this week promoting her new book, America by Heart, and her new reality television show, Sarah Palin's Alaska. But she's still taking time to comment through her Twitter account on national tax policy. "Pls refer to Jan.1 tax changes appropriately: they're OBAMA TAX HIKES & they'll slam every American's savings, investments & job opportunity," Palin wrote on Dec. 1. We'll give Palin credit for cramming a ton of tax policy into the 140 character-limit on the Twitter messaging service. But is her statement accurate? To answer this question, we need to deconstruct the tweet almost word by word. We'll start with the "Jan.1 tax changes." As of today, the law, which was backed by President George W. Bush, states that the nation's current tax rates will expire on Jan. 1, 2011, and revert back to the rates in place prior to 2001. Tax rates differ depending on your income. But here's how the tax brackets would look on a before-and-after basis for married couples filing jointly based on their incomes. For simplicity, we're ignoring modest adjustments for inflation. Tax brackets for other categories such as individual filers broadly follow the same pattern. • Up to $16,750: Rate rises from 10 percent to 15 percent • From $16,751 to $58,200: Stays same at 15 percent, but entire bracket pays 5 percent additional on the first $16,750 • From $58,201 to $68,000: Rises from 15 percent to 28 percent • From $68,001 to $137,300: Rises from 25 percent to 28 percent • From $137,301 to $209,250: Rises from 28 percent to 31 percent • From $209,251 to $373,650: Rises from 33 percent to 36 percent • $373,651 and up: Rises from 35 percent to 39.6 percent We have noticed that Palin and some other Republicans talk as if Obama and the Democrats want to see tax rates go up for all incomes. That's not the case. President Barack Obama campaigned on a promise to keep the same tax rates for couples making less than $250,000 and individuals making less than $200,000. He has consistently maintained that position, as do most Democrats. Republicans, on the other hand, want the current tax rates to stay in place for everyone. Will Obama and Congress be able to reach an agreement? They're negotiating as we report this, so that's a question we can't answer. The tax rates are expiring on Jan. 1, 2011, because of the way they were created in the first place. Back in 2001 and again in 2003, Republicans used a process known as reconciliation that only requires 50 votes to pass the Bush tax cuts. (You might remember that Democrats used reconciliation to pass part of the health care bill earlier this year.) But there are a number of rules that govern reconciliation, and one of those rules says that you can't include things that affect the budget for more than 10 years. That's why the tax cuts are expiring. Republicans didn't have the 60 votes they needed in the Senate to make the tax cuts permanent. We should point out that the 2001 reconciliation bill passed in the Senate with some Democratic support, 58-33. In 2003, the vote was closer, 50-50, with then vice president Dick Cheney breaking the tie. "Republicans very deliberately engineered this set of tax cuts to expire after 10 years," said Norman Ornstein, a long-time observer of Congress and politics and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "They did it for utterly political reasons." Palin's statement is "a vast stretch of the truth," he said. The ten-year limit also masked the effects that the new tax rates would have on the deficit in later years, he said. Both parties now want to continue most of the tax rates that will significantly increase the deficit, even as they say they want to fix the budget picture. "This is one area where neither party can be proud," he added. "Nobody is standing entirely on principle." Palin calls the tax changes "OBAMA TAX HIKES & they'll slam every American's savings, investments & job opportunity." If she's talking about all the tax cuts expiring, though, you would also have to give some blame to the people who passed the temporary tax cuts in the first place: President George W. Bush and previous Congresses. And they certainly wouldn't belong to Obama alone, since it would take a gridlocked Congress to fail to produce any legislation. But there's an alternate reading. Let's say Palin is only talking about Obama's stated plan, which is tax increases for the wealthy. Then she would be more accurate. Here's what Daniel Mitchell, an economist and senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said when we asked him about it: "Obama wants the higher tax rates to happen, so I definitely think it's fair to link him to the policy (though I also thinks it's fair for people to castigate Bush for adopting tax cuts with expiration dates)," Mitchell said. "The accuracy of the 'every American' accusation depends on how narrowly you want to measure impact. A narrow look, which counts only direct effects, would lead one to say that the 'rich' are the ones getting penalized. Economists, however, look at indirect effects such as the impact on investment and job creation. And that's why lower and middle income Americans would be adversely affected. I'm an economist, so I think her statements (on this issue) are accurate." In September, the conservative Heritage Foundation released a paper titled "Obama Tax Hikes: The Economic and Fiscal Effects," that made a similar case that tax increases on higher incomes will affect economic growth and thus hurt all taxpayers. Left-leaning analysts see it differently, though. "I think there's a great irony here," said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "All the focus is on the Bush tax cuts, but Obama cut taxes, too. And they don't really talk about that, but the Republicans want to stop it." Marr is talking about tax cuts included in the economic stimulus act. The tax cuts were implemented right away and the Internal Revenue Service issued new withholding tables, so people saw small increases in their regular paychecks. The problem is that the increases were small enough that a lot of people didn't notice them. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in September showed that fewer than one in 10 people knew that the Obama administration had lowered taxes for American workers. The Obama tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and like the income tax rates, it's not clear whether Congress will act to extend them. "It's very strange because you have this populist anger over taxes, and the working class is probably going to have to pay higher taxes next year," Marr added. We then turned to Bob Williams, an economist with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. He said he didn't think it was accurate to call tax increases "Obama's tax hikes," because Obama has proposed extending the current rates for the vast majority of tax payers. He said assigning blame for the expiration of the tax increases is probably less useful than deciding what tax policy should be in the future. "What really matters is where you end up," he said. Getting back to our ruling statement, Palin said that "Pls refer to Jan.1 tax changes appropriately: they're OBAMA TAX HIKES & they'll slam every American's savings, investments & job opportunity." This pretty clearly makes it sound like Obama wants to raise taxes on everyone, which is not the case. Also, if you want to give Obama the blame, you'd also have to give a good portion of blame to the current Congress. It's been well-known that the tax cuts are going to expire, and there was nothing stopping the Democratic-controlled Congress from addressing the issue earlier. Finally, you'd also have to give some blame to Bush and the previous Congresses for passing tax cuts that expire. So we don't think Palin's statement is accurate and we rate it False.

pomt-07238	"Betty Sutton and her fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/31/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-rep-betty-suttons-spending-spree-maxed-o/	Our government gets some of the cash it needs by borrowing from foreign governments and other investors. As happens when your bills come due and your current income cannot keep up, the United States now needs to borrow even more. To get the money, Congress first must approve a debt limit higher than the current one of $14.294 trillion. This is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit, an analogy that Republicans happen to like, too. In an attack used in some variation on 59 other Democrats in the U.S. House, the National Republican Congressional Committee claimed on May 18, "Betty Sutton and her fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out." Sutton, from Copley Township, Ohio, near Akron, will probably face a re-election challenger next year. For now the NRCC is playing proxy for an eventual foe, accusing Sutton of recklessly spending and driving up the debt to dangerous levels. But is it Sutton’s and her fellow Democrats’ fault -- is she such a profligate spender -- that the federal credit card has been maxed out? This struck us as worth checking because of all the other spending and debt debates that have come up over the last decade, and the way that money flows in and out of the federal treasury. Taxes are one part of the equation, spending the other. You might remember the tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush, tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say these were needed to give the economy a kick, they also meant less money came in from tax revenue. Before the most recent extension, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits. Some will argue that tax cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth, but PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office last year said extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits. Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. These began during the Bush years and continue under Obama. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities posits that just two policies dating from the Bush Administration — tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — accounted for over $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 "and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs." That’s deficits, but it applies to the debt (formed by cumulative and mounting deficits), says the center. The "Bush-era tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — including their associated interest costs — account for almost half of the projected public debt in 2019 (measured as a share of the economy) if we continue current policies," the center noted on May 20. Or as Ezra Klein, the Washington Post economics blogger, wrote on May 23, "In other words, cut the financial crisis and the major initiatives from the Bush era out of the picture, and we’d be in pretty good shape. In fact, we’d be in great shape." We asked Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, what he thought of this analysis. He was blunt. "Basically, their analysis fails basic statistics," he said in an e-mail. Riedl referred us to his own blog, in which he wrote, "Imagine a basketball team that loses 100-98. It would make no sense to cherry pick one single basket by their opponent and blame it for 100 percent of the loss – letting all other baskets scored off the hook. Yet that is essentially what CBPP (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities) is doing." Riedl’s broader point is that "one could cherry pick" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire problem. "CBPP chose to pick the tax cuts, wars, stimulus/bailouts, and economic downturn to equal the sum of the deficit. One could have just as easily singled out Social Security and Medicaid (combined cost: $13 trillion), Medicare and net interest costs ($13 trillion), or discretionary spending ($15 trillion) for blame. There is no mathematical reason to single out the programs CBPP selected while ignoring the other costs." Where does this leave us? Each side is cherry picking the numbers. The liberal think tank puts nearly all the blame on the wars, the tax cuts and the recession and its associated costs. The conservative think tank says the blame base is larger and involves entitlements as well as discretionary spending. We also narrowed in on Sutton, talking with the NRCC; its counterpart, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; and Sutton’s office. DNCC spokeswoman Haley Morris cited a 2009 PolitiFact item that noted that when Bush took office, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left, it was $10.7 trillion. "Pretty hard for GOP to argue about maxing out (the) credit card," she said. Sutton’s office referred us to a statement she made in December when she voted to extend the Bush tax cuts. Those cuts were part of a compromise to also continue a form of federal unemployment insurance for jobless Americans running out of benefits. "I am extremely disappointed that the Republicans insisted on adding billions of dollars to the deficit so that they could provide a bonus tax cut to the super rich and an extremely costly estate tax cut to 3,800 multi-millionaire and billionaire estates," Sutton said at the time. Finally, NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola told us when was asked about Sutton, "You can start with the trillion-dollar stimulus bill." Then there was the health care reform bill in 2010. Those two alone "get you up to $2 trillion" that the nation did not have, and it had to be financed, Mazzola said. He followed up in an e-mail noting Sutton’s votes on two large spending bills, including one for $1.1 trillion, "which provided an 8 percent discretionary spending hike for the third consecutive year and contained approximately 5,224 earmarks." The latter bill passed in December 1999, and no House Republicans supported it. Sutton also voted for two previous debt-ceiling hikes, Mazzola said, and for a $26.1 billion bill that Mazzola called a "state bailout". Others described that last bill as a way to help state and local governments struggling with the economic downturn -- and that difference in terminology helps get us to a conclusion. To say that Sutton ran up the credit card is one way to interpret her record, but it ignores all the other spending and borrowing that factored into the debt. Were the war and the tax cuts the chief culprits? Democrats say so. Conservatives disagree, with Riedl saying that it amounts to cherry picking and ignores all the spending. Before ruling, we’re compelled to point out that since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the debt ceiling ten times, according to the Congressional Research Service. Seven of those hikes were under Bush, three under Obama. Sutton certainly voted for spending, so we won’t rate the NRCC’s claim False. But with trees chock full of cherries, we find the NRCC’s statement to be so selective as to render it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2011-05-31T18:00:00	2011-05-18	['None']
pomt-08768	On birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/25/harry-reid/reid-bashes-republicans-position-immigration-he-on/	Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has been critical of Republican efforts to revisit the question of birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants, but that seems to have backfired, with rivals saying he once supported the idea himself. The claim has popped up everywhere from the website of the Nevada Republican Party to the Washington Times to a twitter feed from Reid's GOP opponent, Sharon Angle, so we decided to look into it. Has Reid switched his position on "clarifying" the 14th amendment? To check, we looked back to August 4, 1993. That's when Reid introduced the Immigration Stabilization Act of 1993, a bill that would have, among other things, revoked birthright citizenship. Section 1001, entitled "Basis of Citizenship Clarified," said, in effect, that children born in United States to parents who are illegal immigrants would not become U.S. citizens. And just in case there was any confusion about the matter, a press release that Reid's office issued a day later states that the bill "clarifies that a person born in the United States to an alien mother who is not a lawful resident is not a U.S. citizen." This clarification would have eliminated the "incentive for pregnant alien women to enter the United States illegally, often at risk to mother and child, for the purpose of acquiring citizenship for the child and accompanying federal financial benefits," said Reid. Reid encouraged other lawmakers to consider and vote for the bill in a Senate floor speech on September 20, 1993. "While other legislation has been introduced in this session of Congress to address some of the most egregious abuses of our immigration laws, this legislation is the only one that institutes comprehensive reform to the entire process" Reid said. He reiterated his arguments for increased immigration controls in an August 10, 1994, op-ed piece published in the Los Angeles Times. Comparing the United States to a table that is "becoming overcrowded," Reid wrote that "unless changes are made, our dinner table eventually will collapse, and no one will have security and opportunity." The bill ultimately died in committee. But as they say, past is the past. What is Reid's position today? Reid was asked about the issue in a press conference on August 3, 2010. He did not answer the question directly but quoted extensively from Michael Gerson, a Washington Post columnist. Gerson wrote a column on July 30, 2010, in which he said that Sen. Lindsey Graham -- a South Carolina Republican who is considering a constitutional amendment to change the birthright citizenship process -- has "either taken leave of his senses or of his principles." So, in 1993, Reid was clearly for restricting birthright citizenship. He introduced a bill that would have "clarified" the 14th amendment to mean that children of illegal immigrants do not automatically become U.S. citizens at birth. Twenty years later, he seems to be agreeing with Gerson that Republicans have either lost their senses or abandoned their principles. However, Reid has openly acknowledged his changed position on at least two occasions. In a House floor speech on August 5, 2006, he admitted that the "low point" of his legislative career came when he introduced the "travesty that [he] called legislation" in 1993. The Las Vegas Review-Journal also reported on December 13, 1999, that Reid said that the legislation is "way up high" on his "list of mistakes" and that it was "short-sighted." He added, "I didn't understand the issue. I'm embarrassed that I made such a proposal." To sum up. Nobody -- not even Reid himself -- is denying that Reid switched his position on "clarifying" the 14th amendment. He wrote a bill in 1993 that would have denied birthright citizenship to children of illegal aliens. Six years later, he called that bill a mistake. Granted, he apparently regrets introducing the bill, but we wanted to know whether Reid has changed his position. We found that he did, so we rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-14279	"Last year (the U.S. women’s soccer team) generated $20 million more than the men’s team and were paid almost four times less."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/06/other-98/facebook-post-exaggerates-discrepancy-between-us-m/	Despite bringing in more money than their male counterparts, the U.S. women’s national soccer team is paid a lot less, according to a claim spreading around social media. "Five All-Star Women’s World Cup Champions just sued the U.S. Soccer Federation for pay equity," reads an image posted on Facebook by The Other 98 Percent, a liberal advocacy group. "Last year, they generated $20 (million) more than the men’s team and were paid almost four times less." Five members of the U.S. women’s national soccer team, the reigning world champions, have indeed filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that deals with employment discrimination, claiming the U.S. Soccer Federation pays them less than members on the male team. This comes amid a dispute between U.S. Soccer and the women’s team over their collective bargaining agreement. The Other 98 Percent’s claim — that the women’s soccer team made $20 million more for U.S. Soccer than the men yet were paid four times less — comes from news reports about the equal pay complaint, filed by players Carli Lloyd, Hope Solo, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Becky Sauerbrunn. The complaint itself does not claim either of these figures. Instead, it says more generally that the women’s team has generated significant revenue and that women’s national team members "have been paid and continue to be paid substantially less than (men’s national team) players." So we wanted to see if these numbers in The Other 98 Percent’s graphic add up. Revenue While the women’s team is projected to have brought in more revenue than the men’s team for the 2016 fiscal year, it’s not nearly as large a gap as The Other 98 Percent’s image claims. Last year, U.S. Soccer projected the men’s and women’s teams together would bring in about $24 million, and they ended up taking in about double that amount, according to financial documents released by the federation earlier this year. The women’s team brought in slightly more of that revenue: $26.8 million, including $3.2 million in World Cup revenue. The men brought in revenues totaling $21 million. But that’s a difference of about $5.8 million, nowhere close to the $20 million cited in the graphic. (It’s worth noting that expenses exceeded revenue for the women’s World Cup, so that particular event resulted in net losses rather than profit for U.S. Soccer.) In its report, the federation cited both teams’ successes in contributing to the budget-busting revenue, but it singled out the women’s team for its World Cup win and the nine-game victory tour that followed. For the upcoming year, the federation predicts the women’s team will bring in about $17.6 million in revenue, resulting in a net profit. The men’s team, on the other hand, is expected to bring in about half of that, $9 million, and end up with net losses. While the women’s team championship win was a leading factor in raising U.S. Soccer revenue beyond expectations, they brought in about $5.8 million more than the men’s team, not $20 million. Compensation The women’s team players’ complaint against U.S. Soccer highlights some perceived disparities in pay. But there’s no way to easily compare the women with the men because their compensation agreements are drastically different. For example, women earn a $72,000 base salary and benefits like health insurance, while men are paid on a per-game basis and do not receive a salary or benefits. But here are a few of the examples that the complaint raises: Both teams play 20 exhibition games each year. Female players earn $1,350 for winning an exhibition game, while male players win $5,000 if they lose and up to $17,625 if they win, depending on the opponent’s ranking. For making the World Cup roster, female players earned $15,000 each, while male players made $68,750 each in their World Cup year. For winning the World Cup, the women earned $2 million to split among the players. For losing in the round of 16, the men earned $9 million. (This bonus is determined by FIFA, the international soccer governing body, not U.S. Soccer.) When traveling, the men’s team receives approximately 25 percent more per diem cash than the women’s team. Players earn a bonus per ticket sold at their games. For women, that bonus is $1.20 per ticket, while it is $1.50 per ticket for the men. As to whether all of this amounts to women players earning one-fourth what male players do — that’s hard to say because compensation varies by player and year-to-year, depending on how many games they play and at what level of competition. Website FiveThirtyEight conducted its own analysis of the federation’s financial documents, comparing the compensation of two male players to two female players of similar seniority in their respective World Cup years. FiveThirtyEight found that given those conditions, the men made almost twice as much as the women. The FiveThirtyEight analysis concluded that women’s team players Lloyd and Solo likely made about $240,000 in 2015, the year they won the World Cup. But men’s team players Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard made $428,000 and $399,000, respectively, in 2014 when they competed — but did not go very far — in the men’s World Cup tournament. For what it’s worth, the lawyer representing the five women, Jeffrey Kessler, has said that depending on the match, the women might be paid 28 percent to 65 percent less than the men. A U.S. Soccer spokesman told us that when comparing compensation and revenue for the men’s team and the women’s team needs to be looked at over a course of four or eight years cumulatively instead of just one year, as a small window does not provide the entire picture — since men and women play the signature tournament, the World Cup, in different years. Our ruling An image shared by The Other 98 Percent said "Last year (the U.S. women’s soccer team) generated $20 million more than the men’s team and were paid almost four times less." The women’s soccer team had a much more successful season on the pitch than the men’s team last year, and as a result they brought in a lot more revenue. But that gap is closer to $5.8 million, not $20 million. And while there seem to be compensation disparities among the women and men, it’s hard to pin down exactly how big that disparity is because the way women and men are paid is so different, and it also varies by match and by player. We couldn't find a clear example of female players being paid one-fourth the amount their male counterparts earn. While there might be legitimate issues concerning the revenue and compensation ratio among the men’s and women’s soccer teams, this graphic uses numbers that are way off. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	The Other 98%	None	None	None	2016-04-06T16:07:30	2016-03-31	['United_States']

pomt-01563	Says Rick Scott "thinks employers should be able to deny women coverage for birth control."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/sep/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-supports-employers-d/	Charlie Crist’s most recent TV attack labels Republican Gov. Rick Scott as "extreme" on women’s issues. A few days after he snagged the endorsement of Planned Parenthood PAC, Crist issued an ad showing a series of women attacking Scott’s record on abortion, birth control and equal pay for women. One of the claims in the ad is that Scott "thinks employers should be able to deny women coverage for birth control." PolitiFact Florida has fact-checked multiple claims about Crist’s record on abortion and we gave him a Half Flip for holding various positions on it throughout his career -- even before he switched parties to become a Democrat. Several media reports have also covered bills signed by Scott that limit access to abortion. Here we decided to fact-check Scott’s record on birth control. (Technically the Florida Democratic Party paid for the ad, but the Crist campaign announced the ad and promoted it.) Legal decisions about birth control during Scott’s tenure We reached out to Scott’s office and campaign and Crist’s campaign and searched news archives and found very few statements Scott made related to employers and birth control. Scott, a former health care executive, campaigned for governor on his opposition to President Barack Obama’s health care law in 2010. The law includes access to birth control for women; however, that was not at the root of Scott’s opposition to the law, which was more broadly about the federal government’s role and the individual mandate. We only found a couple of statements Scott made related to whether employers should be forced to provide birth control. The 2010 health care law required that most plans include birth control coverage without out-of-pocket costs. The Obama administration carved out a religious exemption for most churches and some parochial schools, finalized on Jan. 20, 2012. Certain religious entities, including Ave Maria University in Florida, opposed Obama’s rules. On Feb. 10, 2012, the White House announced a compromise: If a religious employer objected to providing birth control in its health plan, the employer would not have to pay for it, but the insurance company would pay. The next day, Newsmax TV asked Scott his thoughts about that decision while he attended the Conservative Political Action Conference. Scott said: "This week what they did with regard to the Catholic Church and the contraceptives, it's an example [of] when government gets more involved in something they take away your rights. And this is, they are telling the Catholic Church what they have to buy. The government should not be telling us what type of insurance we should buy with our own money. The change they made makes no sense -- saying the insurance company is going to pay for it? That makes no sense. Money is going to be coming out of the Catholic institutions’ pocket to buy that insurance, so they are paying for it." About two weeks later, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi joined six other states in a lawsuit to challenge the birth control mandate arguing that it violated religious institutions' First Amendment rights. (Scott wasn’t a plaintiff.) In July 2012, a federal judge in Nebraska threw out the lawsuit arguing that the states failed to prove they would suffer immediate harm once that part of the law was enacted. The states appealed, but lost in 2013. On June 30, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that certain companies like Hobby Lobby that have religious objections can opt out of the birth control mandate. The companies opposed providing certain types of contraception that they believe is equivalent to inducing abortion, including morning-after pills and IUDs, while they didn’t oppose other methods of birth control. We asked a Scott campaign spokesman if Scott made any statements about Bondi’s lawsuit, the Hobby Lobby case, and in general if he thinks employers should be able to deny women birth control coverage. Spokesman Greg Blair pointed to one statement Scott made after the Hobby Lobby ruling, when a radio station reported that Scott said that the Supreme Court "upheld our freedom of religion again this week." "Gov. Scott believes that people should have access to the contraception and health care they want, and he also believes in religious freedom," Blair told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Crist’s ad states that Scott "thinks employers should be able to deny women coverage for birth control." We struggled to find statements Scott made about employers and birth control. His spokesman didn't give us a denial when asked. We found a couple of statements which show he is against the federal government dictating to companies that they must provide birth control -- something that certain religious institutions opposed. It’s also worth noting that Scott doesn’t appear to be flat out against birth control but it’s clear that overall, he doesn’t like telling employers what they have to cover.

pomt-13637	Says Gov. Rick Scott "cut nearly $1 million from mosquito control and closed down the state’s mosquito research lab a few years ago."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/aug/09/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-misleads-attack-rick-scot/	U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz pointed blame at Republicans -- namely Gov. Rick Scott -- for not doing more to dish out dollars to prevent the spread of the Zika virus. "While he seems to be saying out loud that he wants Congress and the president to provide more funding, he conveniently leaves out that he cut nearly $1 million dollars from mosquito control and closed down the state’s mosquito research lab a few years ago," Wasserman Schultz said at a town hall in Broward County on Aug. 8. Wasserman Schultz is running for re-election in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary against first-time candidate Tim Canova. Did Scott cut funding and close the state’s mosquito research lab? There’s a lot more nuance to this story than Wasserman Schultz lets on. Mosquito control budget The current Zika pandemic took off in May 2015, when Brazil reported cases in connection with more babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly. When Wasserman Schultz spoke, there had been a total of 422 Zika cases in South Florida, the majority acquired while traveling and 16 locally acquired. Wasserman Schultz told reporters that she was referring to Scott’s budget decisions in 2011. Her spokesman pointed to an article in Politico that explained cuts to state aid to local mosquito control programs. That was Scott’s first budget year after he ran on a platform to slash spending amid the recession. State budget records show that while Florida under Scott cut money to mosquito control his first two years, the state later raised it substantially: 2010-11: $2.2 million (Gov. Charlie Crist's last budget) 2011-12: $1.3 million (Scott’s first budget) 2012-13: $1 million 2013-14: $2.7 million 2014-15: $2.8 million 2015-16: $2.7 million 2016-17: $2.8 million Jackie Schutz, a spokeswoman for Scott, said that he has invested more than $13.2 million in funding for mosquito prevention and control. Separately, "Gov. Scott has allocated more than $26 million to combat Zika and will continue to allocate more if necessary," she said. Mosquito lab Wasserman Schultz’s claim about the closed lab relates to the Florida A&M University Public Health Entomology Research and Education Center in Panama City Beach. In 2011, Scott vetoed a one-time $500,000 appropriation for the center intended to keep it open after it had faced threats of closure. The center, first opened in 1964, was referred to as the "mosquito lab" or PHEREC, and came up with ways to combat mosquitoes. It was once a part of a state department, but in the 1990s it became part of Florida A&M while still receiving state health department dollars and other grants. In 2010 as Florida A&M was cutting millions of dollars from the university amid state cuts, it announced that PHEREC was on the chopping block. Provost Cynthia Hughes Harris said at the time that the university decided to eliminate non-teaching units such as the mosquito lab. In a last-ditch attempt to save the lab, researchers sought a one-time appropriation from the 2011 Legislature for $500,000 late in the budget process. Florida TaxWatch labeled it a "turkey," and Scott vetoed it as part of his $615 million in vetoes as the state was climbing out of the recession. The lab still had $1.4 million -- enough to keep it open -- but the university chose to shutter it anyway, wrote Dr. John Smith, the center’s former director, in a Florida Mosquito Control Association newsletter. "In fact, there were sufficient reserve funds to continue PHEREC for as much as two or three years without the legislative appropriation," Smith wrote. "Why FAMU did not allow this remains unclear." Walter J. Tabachnick, at the time director of the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory at the University of Florida’s site near Vero Beach, warned about the loss of dollars in a blog after the cuts. "How can one quantify the loss of future opportunities to make progress and improvements in Florida mosquito control?" he wrote. "There will be future problems for which we will not have solutions, there will be lost opportunities to make mosquito control more effective, efficient, and environmentally proper." However, Tabachnick who remains a professor at UF, told PolitiFact Florida that the decision to close the lab wasn’t by Scott. "The decision to close PHEREC, to withdraw all funding, was made by Florida A&M, not the governor," he said. Meanwhile, the state has funded research at a different university center. The Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory at UF has received $500,000 annually from the state since 2013-14. That money is for research to develop and test formulations, application techniques, and procedures of pesticides and biological control agents to control mosquitoes that can cause public health or a nuisance. Speaking to reporters after her town hall, Wasserman Schultz pointed the finger at Scott for the spread of Zika. "He bears some responsibility in this problem that we are facing now since we are not as fully prepared as we could be if those cuts had not come down," she said. But Tabachnick says it’s not so simple. "There are no promises in investment in research," he said. "I don’t know what information we may have had or not. It’s like saying if we had more money in cancer, we would find a cure. I can’t say that." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Scott "cut nearly $1 million dollars from mosquito control and closed down the state’s mosquito research lab a few years ago." In 2011, the Legislature under Scott did cut about $1 million for mosquito control dropping the total to about $1.3 million and cut it again by about $300,000 the following year. But the state then increased the budget to about $2.7 million the next year and it has remained in that ballpark for four years. Scott also vetoed a one-time appropriation of $500,000 in 2011 for a mosquito lab at FAMU, and the university then shut it down. But the center was already on the university’s chopping block, and the state has since funded another university’s lab.

pomt-13521	"The Clinton Foundation is a charity where President and Secretary Clinton and their daughter, they take no salary, they get no money from it, they take no personal benefit from it."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/sep/01/hilary-rosen/democrat-pundit-clintons-get-no-personal-benefit-f/	Some Republicans have presented the embattled Clinton Foundation as serving one purpose: "lining the pockets of Bill and Hillary Clinton," as GOP Chair Reince Priebus put it. Responding to such criticisms, Democratic pundit Hilary Rosen said the Clintons "take no personal benefit" from the foundation. She also pointed out the legitimate charitable work the foundation carries out, such as its programs addressing AIDS in Africa and storm recovery in Haiti. "The Clinton Foundation is a charity where President and Secretary Clinton and their daughter, they take no salary, they get no money from it, they take no personal benefit from it," Rosen said on NPR’s The Diane Rehm Show Aug. 24. That’s a pretty wide gulf between the assertion that the foundation is just a front for the Clintons to make oodles of money and claims that they don’t get any personal benefit. It made us wonder: What exactly do the Clintons get out of the foundation? Bill Clinton is currently a member of the foundation’s board of directors, while Chelsea Clinton is vice chair. Hillary Clinton was a board member between leaving the State Department in 2013 through the launch of her presidential campaign in 2015. In the most recent year for which tax forms are available, 2014, the foundation reported that Chelsea Clinton worked 35 hours per week for the foundation and other related organizations, Bill Clinton worked 25 hours per work, and Hillary Clinton worked 20 hours per week. The Clintons don’t take a salary from this work, and they don’t receive any other direct monetary benefit. Other Clinton Foundation leaders take home six-figure salaries, according to tax documents. The Clinton Foundation is a public charity that, as we have reported, allocates about 80-90 percent of its expenditures to charitable programs, while the rest goes to fundraising and overhead. (A quick aside: There’s some confusion over how much the Clinton Foundation spends on charitable programming primarily because the word "foundation" is in the name. Typically, a private foundation’s primary activity is grantmaking, giving money to charities who actually do the work. But the Clinton Foundation operates as a public charity in that they run many of their programs themselves. The Clintons also have a traditional private foundation, the Clinton Family Foundation.) So the Clintons don’t receive compensation from the foundation. However, you can make a case that they have received some indirect personal benefits. This is not to say that any of these benefits are unethical or improper. Experts on nonprofit ethics told us these are pretty standard, and they haven’t seen anything reported about the Clinton Foundation that proves corruption. Still, it’s worth reviewing the limited types of benefits that the Clintons do get. Public relations The most obvious, outward-facing benefit for the Clintons is notoriety and media attention. The organization got off the ground in 2001, the year Bill Clinton left the White House. During the periods when he or Hillary were not in or running for office, the foundation kept the family in the public eye — and more often for good reasons, rather than scandalous ones (at least up until the past year or so, when Clinton launched her 2016 campaign and the foundation faced more intense scrutiny). Throughout its existence, the Clinton Foundation has received attention for its work to make AIDS medication more accessible in Africa, efforts to combat climate change, establishing a business mentoring program, writing school food guidelines, and more. Every fall, Bill Clinton and his family receive a spate of press as the stars of the annual Clinton Global Initiative, a networking conference for wealthy philanthropic donors. Chelsea Clinton has embraced her role as a public face of the organization. "It does continue to draw attention to the work they do as family and individuals throughout the world," said Ann Skeet, director of leadership ethics at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. "At a minimum, it is good public relations." When the Internal Revenue Service evaluates charities applying for tax-exempt status, which the foundation has, it wants to ensure that the organization is set up to provide a public benefit rather than serve private financial desires, Skeet said. There’s nothing improper about the Clintons taking advantage of their public image in this role, as long as it goes toward that public benefit. Another big benefit: The Clintons’ role as high-dollar fundraisers for the foundation also enabled them to maintain relationships with wealthy and powerful individuals, including many who are also involved in the Democratic Party. There are some crossover big money donors, such as Fred Eychaner, Haim Saban and Daniel Abraham. (Republicans have been involved in the foundation, too; Mitt Romney spoke at the 2012 Clinton Global Initiative amid his run for the White House.) The Clintons have also received some indirect monetary benefits from their charitable work, though none of this money came from the foundation’s coffers. Bill Clinton wrote a book in 2007 called Giving, for which he received an advance of about $5 million, according to the New York Times. The book was about charitable work and so is, in part, based on his work with the Clinton Foundation. Similarly, he has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars delivering numerous speeches where he talks about his Clinton Foundation work. For example, Samsung Electronics paid Bill Clinton $450,000 to deliver the keynote address at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, during which he talked about how technology has affected his work in the developing world through the Clinton Foundation. Samsung has also donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to the foundation. Experts also pointed out that the Clintons have donated to their own charity, and those donations would be tax-deductible. Bill and Hillary Clinton have donated millions to their private philanthropy, the Clinton Family Foundation, which has in turn given between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation. Chelsea Clinton herself has donated between $25,000 and $50,000. And foundation tax documents stipulate that the Clintons, "due to extraordinary security and other requirements," often need to travel first class or via charter plane. A spokesperson said that in some cases, when the Clintons travel on foundation business, the foundation pays for their travel service directly. At least one campaign ad has been made lampooning Hillary Clinton’s travel on private jets. Chicken or the egg? This discussion raises a chicken-or-the-egg question: Do these benefits the Clintons receive really come from the foundation, or do they come from their already sizeable political capital? Before the Clintons started their foundation, they were famous for being the country’s first family. Absent the foundation, it’s quite possible they could command equally sizeable speaking fees and book advances. They would have access to the same members of the global elite. They would have the ability and finances to donate to charitable causes. Buildings would bear their names. Hillary Clinton would still receive hefty donations supporting her presidential campaign. In all likelihood, very little would change in the Clintons’ private lives if the foundation were to close, said Tony Proscio, a researcher at Duke University’s Center for Strategic Philanthropy and Civil Society and a consultant to foundations and large nonprofit organizations. "It’s fair to wonder how much of a ‘benefit’ these things would be to Bill and Hillary Clinton, who are already at home in high society, more famous than almost anyone, and probably welcome to associate themselves with whatever good deeds they please," Proscio said. "Are those ‘benefits’ as valuable to the Clintons as they would be to someone else? It’s debatable." On the flip side, he said the foundation likely would not be as successful nor as widely known if it didn’t have the Clintons’ name attached. He noted however, "There’s a glamour attached not only to the foundation but to the Clintons' participation in the foundation that seems a little self-serving." The reason people start charities in their name and donate significant amounts of money often boils down to a desire to feel like they’re contributing to a cause they care about or to increase their standing in the community, Skeet said. These are, however abstract, a form of personal benefit. "All donors to all organizations give for a reason you can tie back to personal benefit," she said. Our ruling Rosen said, "The Clinton Foundation is a charity where President and Secretary Clinton and their daughter, they take no salary, they get no money from it, they take no personal benefit from it." Rosen’s claim is correct on its face. The Clintons do not take any sort of paycheck, bonus or fees from the Clinton Foundation. It is possible the foundation has boosted the Clintons’ public image since Bill Clinton left office, and this has helped them command hefty speaker fees and book advances, and it’s also given them extra opportunities to mingle with the global elite. But they may have gotten these benefits even without the Clinton Foundation. Their celebrity primarily comes from their track record in politics. We rate her claim Mostly True.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, recently emerged from observing Central American children being held at Lackland Air Force Base and declared related border crossings were surging because of a protective offer from President Barack Obama. Children from Central American countries and others have established a record flow across the Rio Grande, we recently found. Accounts have varied on why more are coming than before. For instance, a June 16, 2014, National Journal news story quoted Leslie Velez, a senior protection officer at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, as saying its 2014 interviews of 404 children revealed many were fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. Cruz, addressing reporters a week before Obama asked Congress for more money and authority to make it easier to deport recent border crossers, said a survey showed that 95 percent of the immigrants were saying "we are coming because we've been promised amnesty." We rated this Half True; the statistic was right, but the use of the word "amnesty" wasn't. The survey and respondents used the word "permiso," which is a notice given to unaccompanied children enabling them to stay in the country until their cases get a review. That doesn't amount to amnesty. After mentioning such expectations of amnesty, Cruz went on to say: "That’s the message that’s being heard. And the reason these children are coming in staggering numbers is because the president has been promising amnesty." Wait: Has the Democratic president been promising amnesty? Defining amnesty Before we get to Cruz’s backup information, it’s worth remembering how "amnesty" has been defined per illegal immigrants. A legal dictionary defines amnesty as "a blanket abolition of an offense by the government, with the legal result that those charged or convicted have the charge or conviction wiped out. ... The basis for amnesty is generally because the war or other conditions that made the acts criminal no longer exist or have faded in importance. Over the past few decades, the benchmark for amnesty for immigrants has been the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That measure, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, permitted illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in the country by 1982 and met minimal other requirements. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. Its failure to stem the flow of illegal immigration is one reason "amnesty" became a politically poisonous term. In June 2013, the Democratic-majority Senate, with some Republican support, approved an immigration measure creating a pathway for some unauthorized residents to achieve legal status. It hasn’t advanced in the Republican-steered House. Before the Senate action, PolitiFact rated as Half True a claim the Senate plan didn’t give amnesty to unauthorized residents. The plan offers a multi-year pathway to legal status and eventually citizenship, yet applicants would face fines, background checks and waiting periods. Also, only individuals in the country by the end of 2011 would qualify. Cruz cites Obama action in 2012 By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Cruz was referring to a 2012 Obama administration decision not to deport certain youths living in the country illegally and to the president’s repeated praise of a stalled proposal (the DREAM act) that, if passed into law, would give children living here without legal authorization opportunities to seek legal residency and citizenship. On June 15, 2012, Obama followed up on an announcement by Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, by telling reporters: "Over the next few months, eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization." Napolitano had said the government would use "prosecutorial discretion" not to deport certain children living in the U.S. without authorization, specifying the policy would apply only to individuals who came to the United States before they turned 16 and before June 2007--plus there were other conditions. "This is not amnesty," Obama said. "This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It’s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary, stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people. It is the — it is the right thing to do." Regardless of Obama’s not-amnesty insistence, Frazier suggested his approval of the announcement sent an amnesty message far and wide. There "is nothing on paper that ends this policy," Frazier wrote. "It is indefinite until someone else comes in and decides to finally enforce the law. And he may say it's not amnesty, but we argue it is – his policies make it clear that people who have come here illegally are allowed to stay with no threat of deportation." Frazier later singled out a June 2011, memo from the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement urging agency officials to use discretion in deciding which apprehended violators of immigration law should be removed from the country, taking particular care with veterans, long-time legal permanent residents, minors, elderly individuals, pregnant or nursing women and individuals here since childhood, among particular people. Outside experts We asked outside experts if they were aware of Obama promising amnesty. By telephone, Marc Rosenblum of the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, said a longstanding U.S. policy has contributed to unaccompanied children fleeing the violence-afflicted countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for this country, but Cruz may have singled out the wrong president. Rosenblum told us the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008, affirmed an existing policy requiring officials to enable unaccompanied children entering from countries other than Canada and Mexico to stay here long enough to seek asylum. Notably, Rosenblum said, the law requires such children to be placed in the least restrictive setting, which typically ends up being a family member already here. "It’s not that kids are responding to misinformation" about Obama’s actions, Rosenblum said. "They’re responding to accurate information about what’s happening to people who have come… Almost all of the children from Central America who are arriving are still here." Cruz, Rosenblum said, is "correct U.S. policies are a contributing factor. He’s just identifying the wrong policy." By email, Frazier of Cruz’s office didn't dispute the significance of the 2008 act, but she suggested it alone doesn’t explain the spike in children coming from countries south of Mexico since Obama became president. By email, Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports reduced immigration, said: "Most of the kids are coming because their parents made arrangements because they understand that the kids will be released to them with no questions asked, no risk to the parents or kids of enforcement. The parents don't know about the legal issues, just the results, until the kid is provided with a lawyer to ask for asylum or special juvenile status. " Vaughan said she doesn’t view the notices given to children illegally entering the country freeing them to stay with relatives or others until a hearing as amnesty, because each child is offered only the opportunity to appear in court and argue why they should be allowed to stay legally. "They are not absolved, they are allowed argue for relief, which may or may not be granted," Vaughan wrote. She added, though, that whether "or not this mass issuance of" notices to appear at hearings "turns into a de facto amnesty remains to be seen and depends on how aggressively the Obama administration manages these cases." Our ruling Cruz said children are coming into the U.S. in "staggering numbers" because President Barack Obama "has been promising amnesty." We suppose the government’s 2012 declaration it wouldn’t deport certain young residents already here by 2007 might be misinterpreted as an everlasting amnesty signal by some. But Obama hasn’t offered amnesty to anyone. Other factors in children streaming north from Central America include home-country conditions and a policy reaffirmed by Congress before Obama became president enabling unaccompanied children from places other than Canada and Mexico to settle here with family members or others while waiting for immigration cases to be heard.

pomt-02116	Americans "bought into climate change" in 2004-06, but then most "began wandering away from this issue."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/13/joe-scarborough/scarborough-americans-cooled-climate-change/	As Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio edges closer to a 2016 presidential bid, he wants Republican primary voters to know where he stands on litmus test issues like climate change. "I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate," Rubio said on ABC's This Week. "I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy." Many Republican voters would nod in agreement, but the question is, how well does this view sit with the public at large? Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, said Rubio might be on relatively safe ground with the public. "From 2004, 2005, 2006, Americans were bought in to the concept of climate change and that we need to move aggressively on it," Scarborough said. But since then, the public shifted, he said. "Check the polling: Most Americans began wandering away from this issue," Scarborough said. From Scarborough’s lips to our ears. In this fact-check, we review the polls on climate change and global warming (terms that are used interchangeably) to see if Americans care less than they did half a dozen years ago. Pollsters get at this question in a few ways. We’ll look at each one. Is it happening? For nearly 15 years, the Gallup organization has been asking people if they think global warming is underway. In 2002, 71 percent of the public said it is happening or will happen in their lifetime. That percentage peaked at 75 percent in 2008 and then fell. It reached a low of 62 percent in 2011 and since then has risen slightly. As of March 2014, it stood at 65 percent. With a margin of error of 4 percent, the result is modestly less than what Gallup reported in 2002. We find similar but slightly larger swings of opinion in the Pew Research Center data, although the Pew survey only goes back to 2006. Pew asks if people see solid evidence that the earth is warming. In 2006, 77 percent said yes. That fell to 57 percent in 2009, then rose to 67 percent in 2013. The trends don't exactly match the pattern Scarborough described. He suggested a simple slide down. In reality, there’s more of an up-down-up. Still, the public seems a little less certain about climate change today than in the mid 2000s. Is it something you worry about? Even if you believe the climate is changing, it might not cause you great concern. A group of university researchers from Drexel, McGill and Ohio State blended the results from a number of surveys to derive what they called the Climate Change Threat Index. Basically, the index captures whether people take the issue seriously. Robert Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University, is part of the team. From 2002 to 2005, the value of the index fluctuated between 40 and 45. (These are abstract units and should not be confused with the percentage of people who care.) Then it gained about 10 points. "The big shift started in 2006 and coincided with the release of Al Gore’s movie An Inconvenient Truth," Brulle said. "It dropped off in the fall of 2008 after the big recession and the Wall Street meltdown." Today, the index is about where is was in 2004. Again, up-down-up. Interestingly, Brulle and his colleagues Jason Carmichael and J. Craig Jenkins found that two factors primarily drive public concern about climate change. First, people worry more about it so long as more pressing problems like the economy don’t loom larger. Second, Republicans effectively can dial concern up or down. The partisan split on this issue shows up in every survey. The more Republican the voter, the less likely they are to say climate change is real or that it will make a difference. When Republican leaders are more vocal in their rejection of climate change (such as voting against a particular bill), public concern falls, at least among Republican leaning voters. When those leaders treat it more seriously, concern rises. But do you worry about it a lot? Gallup gets at the level of concern by asking people if they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetime. In 2004, about 34 percent answered yes. That rose to 40 percent in 2008, then fell to a low of 32 percent in 2010. It then rose to 38 percent and slid a bit to 36 percent where it stands today. When you account for the margin of error, public opinion has yo-yoed a bit but hasn’t changed all that much. Gallup finds that few American list climate change as a top concern. It ranked near the bottom out of 15 issues polled. Asked how much they worry, 51 percent said little or not at all about climate change, compared to just 11 percent who said they were unconcerned about the economy. Are humans causing it? In 2006, Pew found that 41 percent of public thought the Earth was getting warmer mainly due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. In keeping with the pattern we saw for other questions, that number dropped to 34 percent in 2010, and then rose to 44 percent by the end of 2013. On this point, the partisan divide is pronounced. Just 24 percent of Republicans thought humans were driving climate change, compared to 43 percent of independents and 66 percent of Democrats. The Gallup polls show a similar pattern. In 2004, 61 percent thought humans were making the planet warmer. That fell to 50 percent in 2010, followed by a rise to 57 percent today. Again, the polling shows a slight decline in public buy-in on climate change since 2004, but it has risen from a low point a few years ago. Our ruling Scarborough said Americans have "have wandered away" from the issue of climate change since 2004. They certainly did, as polls consistently show dips through 2010. However, support has inched back in recent years. While the recent gains remain below the 2004 levels, the overall drop isn't as dramatic as Scarborough makes it sound. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06021	Gov. Bob McDonnell’s budget plan takes "money out of our classrooms to pave roads."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jan/15/donald-mceachin/mceachin-says-mcdonnell-plan-uses-education-money-/	Democrats say Gov. Bob McDonnell wants to take money away from public schools and spend it on roads. At issue is the Republican governor’s proposal to increase the share of the state’s sales tax that is earmarked for road maintenance from .5 percent of a purchase to .55 percent. McDonnell says it would generate an extra $110 million for highway upkeep over the two-year budget cycle that starts July 1. That would be the first step of an eight-year plan by the governor to gradually increase the road maintenance share of the sales tax to .75 percent. The General Assembly will vote on the measure this winter and Democrats -- who are a minority in the House and, arguably, in the Senate -- are vowing stiff opposition. The governor’s proposal amounts to "taking money out of our classrooms to pave roads," Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, said Jan. 11 in the Democratic response to McDonnell’s State of the Commonwealth address. Is McEachin right? Let’s start with a little background. The state has a 5 percent sales tax, or five cents on every $1 of purchase. As we’ve noted, a half-penny of that levy goes to highway maintenance. But the lion’s share -- the remaining 4.5 cents, helps support the state’s general fund, which pays for education, health programs and public safety. The general fund is expected to amass $34.6 billion over the two-year budget cycle starting July 1. McDonnell, in keeping with recent budget standards, has proposed that almost 30 percent of the fund -- $10.3 billion -- be spent in classrooms. Now, let’s return to McEachin. Our calls to him were referred to the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus. We spoke to two caucus officials: Steve Pazimino, the executive director, and Katie Mulhall, the press secretary. They justified McEachin’s claim with this contention: It is impossible to take an additional portion of the sales tax out of the general fund without impacting education. McDonnell, over the next two years, would divert $110 million traditionally earmarked for the general fund and spend it on transportation. Schools would lose about a 30 percent share of that money, or $33 million. That comes to about three-tenths of 1 percent of the money the state spends in classrooms. And remember, that would be the first step in McDonnell's eight-year plan. There would likely be at least a fivefold increase in the numbers as the portion of the sales tax dedicated to road repairs gradually increased from .5 percent to .75 percent. Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s chief of communications, told us there are many programs supported by the general fund. The inference is that Democrats are oversimplifying when they say moving money away from the general fund means moving it away from education. But McDonnell’s proposal does not identify any general fund programs that would be specifically cut to compensate for the loss of sales tax revenue. The governor’s plan does not protect schools -- or any other general fund service -- from the small fallout. Our Ruling: McEachin, speaking on behalf of Democrats in the General Assembly, said McDonnell’s proposed budget would take "money out of our classrooms to pave roads." He was referring to an eight-year plan by McDonnell plan to gradually increase the small portion of state sales revenues earmarked for road maintenance. The governor’s proposal would remove $110 million from the state’s general fund during the next two budget years. About 30 percent of the general fund goes to classroom education, so schools stand to lose $33 million. The biennial school loss would grow to at least $165 million when McDonnell’s plan was fully phased in. Put in context of the overall state education budget -- McDonnell wants to spend $10.3 billion in classrooms over the next two fiscal years -- the loss does not seem catastrophic. But there is no doubt McDonnell’s would narrow a guaranteed source of revenue to education without opening a new source. We rate McEachin’s statement True.

pomt-04341	Says U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson supports a plan for "privatizing Social Security."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/24/workers-voice/super-pac-says-tommy-thompson-supports-privatizing/	Campaign fliers mailed by a labor-backed super PAC go after U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson on his plans to try to rein in the cost of entitlement programs before they run out of funds. Under the headline, "Tommy Thompson Just Isn’t the Same," the AFL-CIO’s Workers’ Voice charges: "Thompson supports a radical plan ending Medicare and privatizing Social Security, raising out of pocket costs for seniors and risking their benefits in the stock market." The "end Medicare" claim has long been leveled against Thompson and other Republicans who endorsed the Medicare reforms in U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s "Path to Prosperity" budget in 2012. That claim was named the 2011 "Lie of the Year" by Politifact National. On Oct. 17, 2012, we rated an "end Medicare" claim by Ryan congressional opponent Rob Zerban as Pants on Fire. Medicare would still exist under various versions of Ryan’s entitlement plans, though it would move toward a voucher-style system giving beneficiaries a choice of receiving a fixed government subsidy toward a private insurance plan, or for a plan similar to traditional Medicare. But what about the claim that Thompson supports "privatizing Social Security"? A footnote in the ad pointed us to a March 21, 2012 Fox6 TV online story. The story quoted Thompson during the GOP Senate primary, reacting to Ryan’s budget proposal by saying the "next U.S. senator will have to take tough votes to reform programs." Thompson mentioned Medicare and its looming insolvency, but not Social Security. So that certainly does not support the claim by the group. When we asked for further backup, Workers’ Voice spokesman Eddie Vale said the evidence is that Thompson backs the Ryan budget plan. And he said that Ryan’s 2012 budget proposal included privatizing Social Security. Actually, it didn’t. We re-read Ryan’s "Path to Prosperity" budget documents. The plan listed there calls for action on keeping Social Security solvent, but it doesn’t endorse any particular approach, including "privatization." We went back to Vale, who this time said that he meant Ryan’s separate, earlier proposal, "A Roadmap for America’s Future." That was issued in 2010, well before Thompson launched his Senate bid and later endorsed Ryan’s Path to Prosperity budget proposal. That proposal did include provisions critics have termed "privatization," as did Ryan proposals in 2004, 2005 and 2007. This is the 2010 "Roadmap" proposal to make Social Security sustainable for the long term: Offers workers under 55 the option of investing over one-third of their current Social Security taxes into personal retirement accounts, similar to the Thrift Savings Plan available to federal employees. Includes a property right so they can pass on these assets to their heirs, and a guarantee that individuals will not lose a dollar they contribute to their accounts, even after inflation. Makes the program permanently solvent – according to the Congressional Budget Office – by combining a more realistic measure of growth in Social Security’s initial benefits, with an eventual modernization of the retirement age. Preserves the existing Social Security program for those 55 or older. Vale said those "personal retirement accounts" noted in Ryan’s 2010 plan are behind the campaign flier’s accusation of Thompson supporting "privatizing Social Security." But he offered no evidence that Thompson endorsed the Ryan plan from 2010 or his earlier versions with privatization concepts in them. We couldn’t find any either. The Ryan "Path to Prosperity" budget dropped all mentions of potential privatization, because as PolitiFact noted, he wanted to minimize the chance that Democrats would attack his plan and scotch a chance for a bipartisan deal reforming Social Security. Ryan, the GOP vice presidential nominee, still favors giving younger Americans a choice of investing on their own within Social Security, as he pointed out in the October 2012 debate with Vice President Joe Biden. But the claim we’re evaluating is about Thompson. Let’s dig deeper. Thompson has long said Social Security will need reforms to save it, though in the 2012 campaign as emphasized it will not start to "go broke" until 2038, long after Medicare is scheduled to run into trouble. His campaign website praises Ryan’s 2012 budget plan, which Thompson’s site says "makes Social Security solvent" -- though, as we noted, it does not explain how. The only Social Security-related proposal we could find by Thompson in the campaign was his repeal of federal taxation on Social Security benefits. Thompson’s website says, "he will make the repeal budget-neutral by adjusting benefit costs for high-income individuals … The result will be that most Social Security beneficiaries will see reduced income taxes on the money that was theirs in the first place." Thompson served under President George W. Bush as secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001 through 2004, a time when Bush was developing a proposal to carve out optional private accounts from Social Security. Our search of media accounts found that Thompson was occasionally mentioned in news accounts as involved in helping Bush promote the idea -- something that did not win approval. Nationally, Democrats cite an Oct. 30, 2004, Thompson speech on behalf of Bush’s re-election covered by the Dubuque Telegraph Herald as evidence Thompson backed such accounts. Here’s the newspaper’s account: As America's population gets older, there will have to be changes in Medicare and Social Security to keep the programs solvent, he said. In addition to living healthier lives, people should be setting up private retirement accounts and investing in long-term care policies. "Americans have to start taking responsibility for ourselves," Thompson said. So, Thompson used the term "private retirement accounts." But taken with "investing in long-term care policies" and "taking responsibility for ourselves," it’s far from clear he meant people should be allowed to divert their Social Security taxes into private accounts. Based on the wording alone, he may have meant people should set up IRAs and similar accounts with their own savings -- beyond any Social Security payments. We asked Thompson to discuss his views on Social Security private accounts, past and present. We did not hear back. (His opponent in the Senate race, Democrat Tammy Baldwin, opposes private accounts and says Social Security should be "off the table" in deficit-reduction talks.) One last point: the AFL-CIO flier flatly describes private accounts as "privatization," but it is partial privatization at the most. PolitiFact National gave President Barack Obama a Mostly False in 2010 when he said Republicans were pushing "privatizing Social Security," saying it was a scare tactic by Democrats. Our rating The AFL-CIO’s political arm, Workers’ Voice, distributed literature saying that Thompson supports a plan that includes "privatizing Social Security." The union cited two plans. But the 2012 plan included no mention of privatizing Social Security. And we could find no evidence Thompson backed the 2010 plan or the earlier ones. Thompson promoted Bush’s ideas on privatization as a member of his cabinet until 2004. But that circumstantial evidence, no matter how suggestive, doesn’t help prove this very specific claim that Thompson endorsed a Ryan plan that touted private accounts. Based on what we know now, we rate the claim False.	None	Workers' Voice	None	None	None	2012-10-24T20:27:19	2012-10-01	['Tommy_Thompson', 'United_States']

pomt-04207	Says "the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line is at its highest level since" 1964.	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/03/barbara-buono/sen-barbara-buono-says-nations-poverty-rate-its-hi/	Fail to raise New Jersey’s minimum wage, and state legislators would be surrendering in the "war on poverty" launched by President Lyndon Johnson nearly 50 years ago, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono. Urging her colleagues to support the wage hike, Buono (D-Middlesex) claimed on the Senate floor Thursday that poverty in America is at its highest level since 1964. With Buono’s support, the Senate passed a bill to raise the minimum wage to $8.50 per hour and implement annual cost-of-living increases. "Across our nation, the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line is at its highest level since President Johnson gave his State of the Union address in 1964, when he launched a war on poverty and he promised the nation that he would not rest until that war was won," Buono said. "Well today, in this very moment, if we fail to act, we must acknowledge that we surrendered." It’s accurate to say the latest official poverty rate represents one of the highest levels since 1964, but Buono is wrong to call it the "highest level." During the past five decades, there have been a few years when the rate was the same or higher than the most current estimate. The official poverty rate stands at 15 percent of the U.S. population in 2011, or about 46.2 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the official federal source of poverty statistics. The bureau released that estimate in September. Individuals and families are considered "in poverty" if their total income falls below certain thresholds. For example, a family of five, including two children under 18 years old, would be considered in poverty if its income was less than $27,517, according to the bureau. The 2011 rate marks a slight reduction from the official poverty rate in 2010, when 15.1 percent, or about 46.3 million people, were living in poverty, according to the bureau. But the 2011 figures were not statistically different from those in 2010, the bureau said. Those recent estimates were higher than in most other years since 1964 -- when the official poverty rate was 19 percent -- but not every year. The official poverty rates were 15.1 percent in 1993; 15.2 percent in 1983; 15 percent in 1982; and 17.3 percent in 1965. So, the official poverty rates recorded in those four years were the same or higher than the levels seen in 2010 and 2011. A spokeswoman for Buono did not respond to three e-mails outlining our findings. It’s also worth noting that, during the past few decades, concerns have been raised about the methodology behind the official poverty rate, leading government officials to create an alternative measurement called the Supplemental Poverty Measure, or SPM. Based on the SPM, 16.1 percent of the population, or nearly 49.7 million people, were living in poverty last year, according to the bureau. The SPM is not intended to replace the official estimate, but instead provide "further understanding of economic conditions and trends," the bureau said. Our ruling During a debate over raising the state’s minimum wage, Buono claimed "the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line is at its highest level since" 1964. The latest official poverty rate -- 15 percent in 2011 -- does represent one of the highest levels since 1964, but there have been a few years in the past five decades when the rate was the same or higher than the most current estimate. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Barbara Buono	None	None	None	2012-12-03T07:30:00	2012-11-29	['United_States']

Republican state lawmakers and law enforcement leaders renewed their attacks on the reforms after a Whittier police officer was shot and killed Feb. 20, 2017. In addition, a Los Angeles County sheriff’s official claimed the suspect in the killing had been released early from prison due to these reforms, though that assertion was refuted by a state prisons spokesman. State Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Riverside County, said in a press release the day after the shooting that he "will continue to stand up here in Sacramento against laws that allow dangerous criminals to be released on our streets." He went on to say: "Since the passage of Proposition 47 by voters in 2014 and the signing of AB 109 in 2011, violent crime has been on the rise in California, up 12 percent in 2015 statewide according to the FBI." In this fact-check, we won’t tackle in-depth the question of whether these reforms are really responsible for an uptick in crime. That might be a topic for another day. Researchers at UC Irvine recently found "very little evidence" of crime increasing as a result of AB 109. We will, however, sort through Stone’s claim that violent crime "has been on the rise" since 2011. And his additional statement that there was a 12 percent spike in crime in 2015. Before we examine those claims, here’s a quick primer on the reforms Stone referenced: AB 109: Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed this reform into law in April 2011 to ease state prison overcrowding. It shifted nonviolent offenders from state prisons to county jails or placed them on probation under county supervision rather than parole under state supervision. Proposition 47: California voters approved this measure in November 2014. It downgraded drug possession and some thefts from felonies to misdemeanors and allowed tens of thousands of former offenders to remove felonies from their records. Law enforcement officials claim it allows repeat offenders to break the law with little consequence. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Capital Public Radio file photo Our research We found there’s certainly truth to Stone’s statement about a recent increase in violent crime, but there are also some important details missing. Violent crimes include homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Overall from 2011 to 2015, California’s violent crime rate increased by 3.1 percent, according to a review of data from the California Department of Justice’s report "Crime in California 2015." "There’s been an increase there. It’s not huge," said Michael Rushford. president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a Sacramento-based nonprofit that tracks statewide crime statistics. Rushford believes the state’s early release laws have led to the uptick in crime. While the overall violent crime rate ticked up during this period, that increase was not consistent year-to-year. In 2012, it went up 2.7 percent from the previous year. In 2013, it dropped 6.5 percent. In 2014, there was a drop of less than one percent followed by an 8.4 percent increase in 2015. Violent crimes per 100,000 residents 2015 : 426.4 (8.4 percent increase from 2014) 2014 : 393.3 (0.90 percent decrease from 2013) 2013 : 396.9 (6.5 percent decrease from 2012) 2012 : 424.7 (2.7 percent increase from 2011) SOURCE: California Department of Justice "Crime has sort of gone up and down," during this period, said Brandon Martin, a research associate who studies crime trends at the Public Policy Institute of California. "Since 2011, only 2012 and 2015 are where we see crime increase for both property and violent crime." Martin added that despite recent increases, crime rates in California remain near historic lows. SOURCE: Public Policy Institute of Califoria, "Crime Trends in California." 12 percent increase? The state justice department’s figures show an 8.4 percent rise in violent crime in 2015. That’s considerably smaller than the 12 percent increase Stone cites for the same year. We asked Stone’s spokesman for any additional evidence to back up his claim -- particularly his statement that there was a 12 percent increase in crime in 2015. His spokesman pointed to a January 2016 news article by CBS13, a Sacramento television station. The article cites a 12 percent statewide increase in violent crime between 2014 and 2015, attributing that data to the FBI. That figure, however, comes from an FBI report that examined only the first six months of 2015 -- and only looks at cities with populations of 100,000 or greater. A statewide look at the full year of 2015, including cities large and small, shows violent crime increased 8.4 percent. Our ruling California State Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Riverside County, recently claimed that "Since the passage of Proposition 47 by voters in 2014 and the signing of AB 109 in 2011, violent crime has been on the rise in California, up 12 percent in 2015 statewide according to the FBI." Stone is correct when looking at the overall violent crime rate. From 2011 to 2015, there was a 3.1 percent increase statewide in the rate of violent crimes, a category that includes homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Stone’s claim might give some the impression there’s been a consistent rise in crime during these years, which is not the case. The violent crime rate ratcheted up in 2012 and 2015, but went down in the other years. Also, the lawmaker’s claim that violent crime spiked 12 percent in 2015 is not correct; that figure comes from an FBI report that studies only the first six months of the year and only large cities. A full year, statewide report showed the violent crime rate increased 8.4 percent that year. In the end, we determined Stone’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-03255	On average, college students "are taking six years to get a four-year degree."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/11/ron-johnson/average-college-degree-takes-six-years-us-sen-ron-/	It used to be that college students joked about being on "the five-year plan" in their quest to earn a four-year degree. Nowadays, according to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, you can add another year. In a July 17, 2013 interview with Politico, the Wisconsin Republican made a critique that could be summarized like this: Young people are made to think that the only path to success is a four-year degree. They have been "enticed’ to take on large debt because subsidies limit interest rates on student loans. The availability of loans and grants has led to increases in the cost of higher education. "And so we have, in all of our good intentions," Johnson said, "we’ve actually made college less accessible because we’ve made it so unaffordable and we’ve plunged our children into debt." Then he made this claim: "And also by giving them this easy debt, on average, kids are taking six years to get a four-year degree, while that debt meter is increasing." With the start of school right around the corner, we wondered whether it's really taking an average of six years to get from high school diploma to bachelor's degree. Getting our bearings Johnson’s staff didn’t follow through on a promise to send us evidence to back his claim. But let’s note a couple of things for we evaluate it. Johnson spoke of "kids." So, it’s fair to say his six-year claim applies to students who start college shortly after finishing high school, rather than adults who pursue a degree later in life, perhaps over many years. He also used the phrase "on average." That number, of course, is stretched by students who don’t take just four or six years, but much longer to finish their degree. That means there’s some value in also looking at how long it takes for a typical student to get a B.A. or B.S. Averages We examined the latest U.S. Department of Education statistics that include averages in measuring the time it takes to get a bachelor’s degree. We also discussed them with department statistician Aurora D’Amico. Those statistics, which cover students who earned their first four-year degree during the 2007-2008 school year, cast a pretty wide net. They include part-time as well as full-time students; students who started their college studies at a two-year or a four-year institution; and students who were not seeking a degree of any type when they initially entered college. For that relatively broad collection of students, the average time to get their bachelor’s degree was six years and four months -- even higher than what Johnson claimed. The time was shorter -- five years and 10 months -- for students who began college within a year of finishing high school; those are arguably the "kids" Johnson was referring to. And for students who started their college studies at a four-year institution, rather than a two-year school, the average was five years and eight months. So, those are the averages, all of which are in the ballpark of Johnson’s six-year claim. Other measures The Department of Education study also provided figures that aren’t averages, notably this one: 44 percent of the students who got their degrees in 2007-2008 did so within four years. That compares to 23 percent who needed five or six years (and 33 percent who took more than six years). So, it is more common to earn a four-year degree in four years than it is in five to six years. Another recent Department of Education study, reviewing a narrower group of students, found similar results. It covered first-time, full-time students who entered four-year institution in fall 2005 aiming to obtain a bachelor’s degree. In this group, 39 percent got their four-year degree within four years; 59 percent graduated within six years. Our rating Johnson said that on average, college students "are taking six years to get a four-year degree." It’s more common for students to take four years to graduate than it is for them to take six years. But overall, the average duration is about six years. Our definition of Mostly True is a statement that is accurate but needs additional information. That’s how we rate this one.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2013-08-11T05:00:00	2013-07-17	['None']
pomt-07821	"Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/16/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-sen-jim-webb-reliable-vote-barac/	Jamie Radtke did not join the list of politicians lauding U.S. Sen Jim Webb last week after the Democrat announced he would not seek reelection in 2012. Instead, she blistered him. Radtke, a Tea Party activist who is seeking next year’s GOP Senate nomination, called Webb’s retirement "a great opportunity to change the direction of our country." "Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid and their ruinous agenda," Radtke said in a written statement released on Feb. 11, the day Webb made announcement. Webb, a former Republican turned Democrat, has always had a reputation for charting his own course. We wondered how much he was in sync with Obama and Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is Senate majority leader. We turned to the voting records. According to data compiled by non-partisan OpenCongress, Webb and Reid have voted together 1,325 times since Jan. 2007, when Webb joined the Senate. They have a "voting similarity" of 85 percent, according to the web site. Democratic senators average an 89 percent voting similarity. The Washington Post also maintains an exhaustive congressional database. It shows Webb voted with a majority of Democratic senators 87 percent of the time during last Congress from 2009-11. Reid, during the same span, voted with his party 95 percent of the time. The Post’s review of the 111th Congress includes 689 votes. Many were not controversial and supported by both sides of the aisle. We looked at Webb’s record on President Barack Obama’s key initiatives. Webb and Reid were always in his corner. They voted for: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as health care reform. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or stimulus bill. The New START nuclear arms agreement with Russia. The repeal of "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell," a policy barring openly gay men and women from the military. The DREAM Act, which would grant citizenship to undocumented immigrants who serve in the military or attend college. The deal between Obama and Congressional Republicans that extended the Bush-era tax cuts and added some payroll tax reductions. The Supreme Court nominations of Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. It is worth noting that Webb, despite supporting the president and his party on a very consistent basis, has been scored as one of the more contrarian Democrats by Congressional Quarterly. In the 111th Congress only five other senators went against the party’s majority more often than Webb did. But voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us. But voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us. And on the highest-profile issues, Webb and Reid have backed the president. We rate Radtke’s statement True.

pomt-07953	On "repeal and replace" of federal health care reform.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/25/sean-duffy/us-rep-sean-duffy-ignores-replace-part-his-pledge-/	As a Republican running in a traditionally Democratic district, one held for decades by U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, Sean Duffy staked out a more moderate position on federal health reforms than many other GOP candidates. Duffy told voters he was for "reforming the reform" or "immediately repealing and replacing" the Democratic Party-backed changes signed into law by President Barack Obama. Unlike many Republicans, Duffy did not back a straight repeal. He said the bill overall was too costly and would fail at clamping down costs, but it contained "a lot of good things" -- guaranteed health insurance for millions with pre-existing conditions, for one. Here is how he laid out his "repeal and replace" approach at an Oct. 26, 2010 debate in Wausau: "So I would support either reforming the reform, or if we had a bill that was going to work, repeal and replace." Newspapers in the district took notice. The Marshfield News Herald wrote that Duffy said he "would not vote to repeal the legislation unless a better proposal was in place." The Wausau Daily Herald, in endorsing Duffy, said the former district attorney "hasn't beaten the drum for repeal of health care reform." That was on the campaign trail. Early in the new Congress, the GOP-led House scheduled a repeal vote on the federal health care reforms -- which many of its candidates had derisively dubbed "ObamaCare." Duffy was concerned. "I found it unacceptable we could have a repeal vote without having something to put on the table," Duffy told reporters the day of the vote, Jan. 19, 2011. National political writers said he faced a dilemma on the vote, given his campaign statements. But he ultimately voted with other Republicans to repeal the law, without any alternatives in place. The measure is not likely to clear the Democratic-controlled Senate. Did Duffy’s vote constitute a reversal of position? Given the importance of the legislation, and the prominence of the issue in Duffy’s campaign, we decided to put it to the Flip-O-Meter. Here’s our requisite reminder: We’re not evaluating whether the change was good (or bad) politics or policy, just whether it amounts to a change in position as Duffy’s critics claim. A key in evaluating how this played out is recalling Duffy’s comments that clearly stated he wanted an attractive alternative developed in conjunction with a repeal vote. He said he would vote yes on repeal "if we had a bill that was going to work." Wisconsin reporters had that comment and similar Duffy remarks in mind the day after the vote. Duffy found himself moving to head off the impression he broke a promise. The Daily Herald described it this way: "Duffy, who pledged during his campaign not to repeal the plan until Republicans presented an alternative, said his vote was the first step toward that goal." The "first step" Duffy described was a House vote the next day on a measure instructing committees to draft replacement legislation along certain Republican-favored general principles. Duffy joined in the majority vote on that. House leaders set no timetable for that process. In any case, it was not in place when Duffy voted for repeal. To be sure, the quick vote on repeal put Duffy in an awkward spot. Duffy posted a message on his congressional website noting that "some have criticized my vote as a contradiction of what I campaigned on because an alternative measure was not immediately in place." He argued waiting to build a replacement avoided a one-party solution that would have cut out Democrats. Duffy press secretary Daniel Son offered several other points: He said you need repeal before you can begin to replace, because Democrats would have little motivation to join in if the law was still on the books. Duffy, he noted, did not decide to schedule the vote now -- Republican House leaders did. While those may be good points, they do not get at the central position Duffy took during the campaign. When running, Duffy used very specific language to convey his position on federal health reforms, saying he would not vote for repeal unless "a better proposal was in place" or "we had a bill that was going to work." He voted for the repeal, without a new proposal in place. Indeed, no such bill exists yet. It’s unclear what will be in a Republican alternative, when it will be voted on, and whether it will satisfy Duffy’s interest in saving the "good things" in the legislation. We rate his vote a Full Flop.	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2011-01-25T09:00:00	2011-01-19	['None']
pomt-12551	"Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 Muslim refugee."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/17/blog-posting/fake-news-headline-blames-texas-deputys-real-death/	Several websites put a fake headline on a real news story about a Texas sheriff’s deputy being shot and killed, falsely reporting that a trio of Muslim refugees pulled the trigger. "Texas law enforcement officer fatally shot upon arriving for work by 3 Muslim refugee (sic)," read an April 4, 2017, post on SouthernConservativeExtra.com. "Do you support to deport them?" the headline added. The post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The news story said that Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clinton Greenwood was shot once outside a county courthouse building in Baytown near Houston. He was airlifted to a Houston hospital but died of his wound. The post actually says nothing about refugees, Muslim or otherwise. The only sentence describing a suspect read, "Investigators said late Monday they were looking for a suspect described as a white or Hispanic male, approximately 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 6-feet-3 inches tall, with short hair and a medium to stocky build." There isn’t much more detail on the killer than that. There is no mention of a trio of shooters. SouthernConservativeExtra.com describes itself as "conservative news on the cutting edge, from a southern perspective." It is registered to an address in Texas. We attempted to contact the site via email but did not receive a reply. The story appears to be a truncated version of the same article and headline posted April 3 on TrueTrumpers.com, a known fake news site. The story and the same headline also has appeared on several other suspect websites. It looks like all of them copied a real news article from April 3 by the Associated Press. The only difference is the clumsy addition of "by 3 Muslim refugee" and the question about deportation. This may have been done solely to inflame readers who don’t bother to get past the headline and read the details. In reality, the man who killed Greenwood turned out to be William Kenny, an area man who held a grudge against law enforcement. Authorities had conducted a manhunt for a week, but Kenny had killed himself the day after shooting Greenwood. While the post is a real news article posted without attribution, the headline is altered to stoke prejudiced sentiments toward Muslims. It’s a gross misrepresentation of the circumstances surrounding a law enforcement officer’s death. We rate the headline Pants On Fire!

pomt-05253	"More than 250 (voter registration) groups, ranging across the entire political spectrum, have filed with the state and are registering voters right now."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/may/31/lenny-curry/top-florida-republican-back-third-party-voter-regi/	As election season heats up, the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida is defending Florida's controversial 2011 overhaul of state elections law. State GOP lawmakers came up with the changes as a way to guard against voter fraud. But Democrats, the League of Women Voters and other groups say the law disenfranchises third-party organizations and makes it more difficult for Floridians to register to vote. The League of Women Voters has suspended its campaign to register people to vote and is suing the state over the law -- which requires third-party voter registration organizations to turn in voter registration forms within 48 hours or face fines, among other things. A federal judge barred enforcement of the 48-hour deadline in a May 31, 2012, ruling, saying the provision was "harsh and impractical." Before the judge ruled, Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry defended the changes aimed at third-party registration groups in an Orlando Sentinel column. His point: Groups are still actively registering people to vote. His evidence: "More than 250 groups, ranging across the entire political spectrum, have filed with the state and are registering voters right now." That’s worth a fact-check, we thought. Our first stop was the Florida Department of State, which keeps track of third-party voter registration organizations. The data show more than 250 organizations signed up to register voters, 293 to be exact. And the groups cross political (and life) spectrums, from the Pinellas Democratic Party, and the South Florida Tea Party to groups called the American Baptists, American Multi-millionaires, American Film Stars and the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws. But are all those groups active? Not exactly. To date, 136 of the 293 organizations have signed up one or more voters. The rest haven’t registered anyone to vote, and in most cases, haven’t even requested voter registration forms. The biggest groups registering voters are the Florida Democratic Party, the Republican Party of Florida, Miami-Dade County Public Schools and America First, an organization to protect the U.S. Constitution. Latino organizations such as the the National Council of La Raza/Democracia Mi Familia Vota Education Fund also registered thousands of voters. Those six groups made up almost 90 percent of the submitted applications. Chris Cate, spokesman for the Department of State, said all third-party groups registered with the state after the law took effect -- which implies they plan to sign up voters before the November general election. "Just because the groups haven’t registered voters yet doesn’t mean they couldn’t go out and register voters this weekend," Cate said. Curry didn’t return phone calls. But RPOF spokeswoman Kristen McDonald wrote in an email "whether or not each of the 250 groups is out registering voters every day is beside the point -- they all have the ability to do so at any time." Steve Tauber, a professor of American government at the University of South Florida, argues the number of registered organizations proves nothing about the possible chilling effect of the new law. Organizations will not know if they can process voting forms within 48 hours until they deal with a high volume of voters -- closer to the general election, Tauber said. Our ruling Lenny Curry argued that more than 250 groups are actively registering voters from across the political spectrum, and "are registering voters right now." Curry underestimated the number of groups that signed up with the state to register voters and continue to file monthly paperwork to stay active. But his statement is still misleading. Less than half of those groups have registered a single voter since the law took effect, and six groups have registered nearly 90 percent of all voters so far. Furthermore, the statement’s intent was to illustrate the ease of complying with the law, a measure that won’t be clear until election season is in full swing. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-03705	Says Texas ranks 49th nationally in "what we are doing to support our per-pupil investment in education in the state."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/18/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-ranks-49th-what-it-doing-pu/	A state senator opposed to a proposal intended to enable some children to attend private schools with government aid asserted that Texas already has a hard time keeping pace with other states. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, told Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, during an April 9, 2013, committee meeting that "we in the state of Texas are 49th in the country in what we are doing to support our per-pupil investment in education in the state." She added that she prefers to prioritize putting dollars into the public schools. A reader asked us to check that ranking. Senator cites newspaper report By email, Davis’ spokesman, Rick Svatora, told us she was referring to a report described in a Feb. 22, 2013, Dallas Morning News article stating that preliminary figures released by the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, indicate Texas schools are spending $8,400 per student this year. The national average is $11,455, the report said, putting Texas’ per-student expenditures below every state save Arizona and Nevada. So, compared to other states, Texas reportedly ranks 48th in per-student spending. Then again, the News’ story notes that the association’s analysis also considered spending in District of Columbia schools, a consideration leaving Texas 49th in per-student spending among 51 jurisdictions. The News’ story said the association’s comparisons, based on data furnished by state education agencies, are "among the most reliable in the nation and are frequently cited by officials in Texas and other states. The NEA has been issuing its annual reports on public school spending since the early 1960s." Education association report We turned to the association’s report, downloadable here, finding the figures cited by the newspaper in Summary Table K, "Estimated Expenditures for Public Schools, 2012-13," which indicates that Texas this year is spending less per student in average daily attendance (the aggregate attendance of a school during a reporting period divided by the number of days school is in session that period) than all states but Arizona and Nevada. Elsewhere, the report says these expenses include salaries for school personnel, student transportation, school books and materials and energy costs. A wrinkle: Part of the report says that in making useful comparisons among states, a different way of counting students, fall enrollment, is preferred to average daily attendance because of its standardized definition. Based on fall enrollment, the report says, Texas is spending an estimated $7,886 per pupil, less than every state except Utah and Arizona, according to Table K. So, it looks like two states trail Texas in per-pupil spending, either way you count students. For each state, Table K also lists current estimated expenditures for other programs, meaning such expenses as summer school and adult education, which are not part of regular public elementary and secondary day-school programs, the report says. The table also shows spending by each state’s schools on interest on debt and capital outlays, which conservative observers such as the Texas Public Policy Foundation have said should always be taken into account when making state-by-state comparisons. Considering all education-related expenditures When we checked a similar Davis claim about Texas’ spending on education in 2011, a foundation spokesman pointed out a March 2010 report by the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute that reviewed 2008-09 budgets for districts in the nation’s five largest cities, including Houston, concluding that average per-pupil spending was 44 percent higher than was otherwise reported by public schools. Separately at the time, Frank Johnson, a statistician with the National Center for Education Statistics, told us the center doesn’t take into account capital outlays in estimating per-pupil spending because such costs can create false assumptions about what’s spent on instructional programs, school supplies and teachers. In the latest education association report, Table K’s last column presents each state’s total school spending, rolling in all subcategories. We wondered, then, how Texas stacks up by all expenditures per pupil. The report does not present such a calculation, so we made our own run, dividing the total spending for each state by the state’s average daily attendance, as shown in the report’s Summary Table D. And by this approach, it appears that more than $50 billion in total Texas school spending breaks out to nearly $11,090 per pupil, placing Texas 38th nationally, ahead of states including California, Georgia, Oklahoma and Arizona. By phone, a spokesman for the education association’s Texas affiliate, the Texas State Teachers Association, suggested it doesn’t make sense to roll in all expenditures because school districts have varied commitments to capital outlays and debt, while spending reflected in the presented per-pupil tallies are driven by legislative decisions about spending and finance formulas. Clay Robison followed up by email, saying that "in many cases those expenditures pay to build football stadiums and other facilities, such as fine arts centers. I am not going to engage in the argument about football stadiums, but I don’t think it gives a fair comparison of how much states are spending on students. In other words, capital costs lump new classroom construction, which benefits all students, with expenditures that don’t apply to all students." Robison pointed out that according to the report’s Table H-14, Texas spent $9,462 per pupil in 2010-11, which was before legislators cut education aid in the 2011 legislative session. This year, the association’s report suggests, such spending is down by more than $1,000 per pupil from 2010-11. Our ruling Davis said Texas ranks 49th in "what we are doing to support our per-pupil investment in education in the state." A report drawing on states’ figures estimates Texas is spending $7,886 or $8,400 per student this year, depending on how students are counted. Both ways, Texas ranks third to last among the states. Then again, folding in capital outlays, other education expenditures and interest on debt, total estimated spending in Texas of nearly $11,090 per pupil lands the state 38th among the states. But the senator focused on state investment which, unlike locally determined debt and capital outlays, are driven by legislative actions. Our sense is that this is the appropriate comparison, though Davis failed to clarify that Texas is 49th by this yardstick in comparison to other states plus Washington, D.C., which is not a state. Absent this clarification, her claim rates as Mostly True.	None	Wendy Davis	None	None	None	2013-04-18T06:00:00	2013-04-09	['None']
pomt-06442	Says "Many people I’ve talked to are angry that because of City Hall inaction we may have to spend a needless $500 million to cover and treat our pure drinking water."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/21/eileen-brady/eileen-brady-says-because-portland-city-hall-inact/	In announcing her campaign for Portland mayor, Eileen Brady called out City Hall for its lack of leadership in fighting a controversial federal mandate to treat Portland’s drinking water. "Many people I’ve talked to are angry that because of City Hall inaction we may have to spend a needless $500 million to cover and treat our pure drinking water," she said in a kick-off speech posted on her campaign website. Longtime critics who love Portland’s drinking water just the way it is have complained for years about commissioners’ seeming inability to protect Bull Run water from the heavy bureaucratic hand of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Brady is one of those people. So we can see where she might be less than impressed with City Hall’s response to the EPA. But is it accurate to characterize what’s happened in Portland as "inaction"? Let’s recap: In 1993, scores of people in Wisconsin died from a cryptosporidium outbreak from their drinking water. In response, the federal government began drafting new regulations, releasing the rule in 2006. The rule required the city of Portland to cover its open-air water reservoirs and to treat its drinking water. The city filed a lawsuit in federal court. The court dismissed the challenge in 2007. In addition, the City Council passed a resolution promising to seek alternatives to the rule. They met with or contacted EPA officials seeking outs for the city. Commissioner Randy Leonard, who oversees the bureau, said he talked to Oregon’s federal delegation, only to be told that there was slim hope of legislative relief. So Portland wasn’t storming the gates in Washington, D.C., but that didn’t sound like "inaction" to us. We turned to Brady. She said that she didn’t mean inaction as in no action. She meant inaction as in not enough action to shield Portland’s "elegant" drinking water. "Our ratepayers are going to have to pick up the bill for a $400 million project that we probably could have worked more aggressively to find alternatives for," Brady said, referring to the amount of money needed to replace five open-air drinking water reservoirs at Mount Tabor and Washington parks with covered storage. (The other $100 million is to build a UV treatment plant.) Brady wants Portland to be like Rochester, N.Y., which spent a mere $9 million on compact treatment plants allowing the city to preserve two open reservoirs. New York City won a reprieve on a $1.6 billion cover until 2028. Portland’s Water Bureau says our system is too old and too different to compare with other cities. That’s beside the point for Brady. "Portland could have taken the same aggressive stance that New York did, which was to provide a significant case as to why this was unduly burdensome," she said. "They made the case that Portland could have made had we been proactive about it." This summer, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained about the rule’s one-size-fits-all nature and asked the agency to review. Surprisingly, EPA agreed. Leonard requested the Oregon’s delegation’s help in finding out how an EPA reconsideration could affect Portland. (Apparently we were Portland polite; they were New York loud.) We asked state Sen. Jackie Dingfelder, D-Ore., for her take on the issue. She represents the east Portland neighborhoods that have been the most vocal about leaving the water alone. Has the city been on the inactive side of the equation? "It’s not as black and white. I think there was a feeling initially that we’ve done everything we can, and now" after Schumer’s intervention, she said, "I think the city is pushing really hard." Portland has spent about $1.2 million on the legal challenge, and nearly $1.4 million to date to get a variance on the treatment portion. In December 2009, the EPA denied the city’s request for a variance for the reservoirs. We understand that Brady is running for office, and that she made a politically charged statement in a campaign speech. Had Brady said City Hall had done a lousy job fighting the federal government, we would not have troubled ourselves. Had she said that City Hall had been ineffective on this issue, we would have stayed away. But she called it "City Hall inaction" and to the average person, that is not accurate. The city sued. City officials met with and sought answers of federal bureaucrats, and they sought help from the congressional delegation. The statement is False.

pomt-03374	Says Texas has more than 80,000 abortions each year.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jul/10/jonathan-stickland/jonathan-stickland-says-Texas-80000-abortions/	CLARIFICATION, 11 a.m., July 11, 2013: We amended this story to clarify that the law requiring a sonogram and a 24-hour wait before an abortion was phased in starting Sept. 1, 2011, an indication that it would not have deterred abortions the whole year. As the Texas House renewed debate on proposed changes in abortion law July 9, 2013, state Rep. Jonathan Stickland said on Twitter, "Today is about the 80,000+ children" whose "life is stolen" per year in Texas. That’s a widely used number -- one we even reaffirmed as recently as a June 2013 tweet. But it’s also out of date and too high, according to the latest count finalized by a Texas state agency. The same 80,000 count was cited during the July 8, 2013, anti-abortion rally at the Texas Capitol, both by state Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, and in a written statement from U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that was read aloud. A July 1, 2013, Associated Press guide to the abortion-law fight used the figure as well. In February 2011, when state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, aired the 80,000 figure, we rated his statement as True based on information from Texas’ Department of State Health Services and the New York-based Guttmacher Institute. The number of Texas abortions reported in 2008 -- the year with the most recent data available at that time -- was 81,591, according to the state agency. The 2008 Texas tally was 84,610, according to Guttmacher, a research group focusing on reproductive health issues. Luke Macias, a Stickland consultant, told us by email that the Bedford Republican made his claim based on our 2011 article. Macias said, too, that Stickland depended on Guttmacher’s figure for Texas abortions in 2008 when he and fellow Tarrant County lawmakers sent 84,610 pieces of blue and pink paper to state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, on June 25, 2013, the day she famously filibustered to stall abortion legislation. The proposed restrictions were reintroduced in a second special session of 2013, which began the first week of July. The legislation would prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks of gestation, require any doctor performing abortions to have admission privileges at a nearby hospital and mandate that abortion clinics be certified as ambulatory surgical centers. But the number of abortions has decreased since Patrick’s statement, as we wrote in a Feb. 12, 2013, fact-check that drew on newer state information. Austin Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard claimed generally that abortions were decreasing, which was True, we found, on both the state and federal levels. The Texas tally had dropped for several consecutive years, while nationally the total hovered around 1.2 million from 2005 through 2008, by one analysis, and the number and rate decreased in 2009, according to information analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our story included a chart, emailed to us by agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams, showing reported abortions in Texas rose from 76,121 in 2000 to a peak of 82,056 in 2006, then declined again to a preliminary 2011 total of 72,470. The Texas total was greater than 80,000 in 2006, ‘07 and ‘08, but below 80,000 in the other nine years on the chart. The average from 2007 through 2011 was 78,116. On July 9, 2013, State Health Services spokeswoman Christine Mann told us by phone and email that the chart’s figures were still correct, and that the 2011 figure of 72,470 released in August 2012 had been finalized Feb. 26, 2013. She said a 2012 count was not yet compiled. Guttmacher spokeswoman Rebecca Wind told us by phone July 9, 2013, that their count of 84,610 Texas abortions in 2008, drawn from survey research, was still the most recent available from the institute. Mann told us the state figures came from mandatory reports that providers file each year with her agency; Wind told us Guttmacher sends a survey every four years or so to "all known abortion providers." Year Abortions reported in Texas 2000 76,121 2001 77,537 2002 79,929 2003 79,166 2004 75,053 2005 77,374 2006 82,056 2007 81,079 2008 81,591 2009 77,850 2010 77,592 2011 72,470 Source: State Health Services Department So, Texas had about 72,500 abortions in 2011 -- down from about 82,000 in 2006, according to the state, whose figures also indicate there have not been more than 80,000 abortions since 2008. Neither the Texas agency or Guttmacher had guidance for us on why the number of Texas abortions has declined. A July 10, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story cited Theodore Joyce, a professor at Baruch College in New York, as saying that after a 2003 change in Texas law, abortions at or beyond 16 weeks of pregnancy dropped by 88 percent. Joyce studied effects of the law, which required that such abortions be performed at ambulatory surgical centers rather than abortion clinics. In 2004, no abortion clinics in Texas qualified as ambulatory surgical centers, Joyce said, but by 2006 Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio had such centers. Changes made in 2011 to Texas law could also have decreased the number of abortions, according to a study from the University of Texas, the University of Alabama and Ibis Reproductive Health (a nonprofit group that advocates for access to abortions). The researchers concluded that new mandates for a sonogram followed by a 24-hour wait before abortions, requiring two clinic visits, caused fewer Texas women to seek abortions. That law was phased in starting Sept. 1, 2011. Regarding the latest state figures indicating about 72,000 abortions in the state in 2011, Macias said that with abortion totals ranging between "72,000-84,000 over the last decade," Stickland believes "both of those numbers and anywhere in between are too high." Our ruling Stickland said there are "80,000+" abortions each year in Texas. That was last true in 2006, 2007 and 2008, according to the state, but the number has declined since, with 72,470 Texas abortions reported in 2011. Still, Guttmacher, a respected source, hasn’t updated its data since its survey reporting 84,610 Texas abortions in 2008, arguably giving Stickland’s claim an element of truth. We rate this statement as Mostly False.	None	Jonathan Stickland	None	None	None	2013-07-10T16:57:03	2013-07-09	['None']

pomt-06845	Atlanta Public Schools’ 2011 CRCT tests were "given under the strictest security possible."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/05/beverly-hall/ex-aps-superintendent-hall-says-recent-tests-given/	Even as her reputation crumbled, former Atlanta Public Schools Superintendent Beverly Hall’s PR machine continued to churn. Hall’s smiling face appeared on the glossy cover of a promotional mailer commemorating her 12-year reign. The pages include detailed, year-by-year lists of her accomplishments and pictures of her smiling with students, teachers, and a giant check from district benefactor General Electric. The PR bonanza outraged critics because it was so brazen. Hall left under accusations that the rising CRCT scores that helped make her an education superstar were the result of massive, systematic cheating on state tests. A state investigative report made public in July implicated 178 educators and 44 schools. The pamphlet caught PolitiFact Georgia’s attention because Hall insisted that APS’ CRCT gains were real. If you compare results from 2000 through 2011, roughly the span of her term, they show significant increases, she wrote in a letter that accompanied the mailer. And in 2011, the tests were "given under the strictest security possible," Hall’s letter said. Were they really that secure? we wondered. We contacted Hall’s attorneys, who referred us to two APS documents describing changes the district made to security after test-tampering suspicions first arose. But before our analysis, here’s some background: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported more than two years ago that students statewide made statistically improbable gains on their CRCT exams. This prompted the Governor’s Office of Student Accountability to analyze answer sheets for erasures. They announced in February 2010 that they also found questionable gains. APS changed its CRCT security procedures. They are stored in a "vault," or a room inside a school. It’s accessible only by the principal and testing coordinator using a key card, said district spokesman Keith Bromery. Teachers rotate within their schools so that they don’t administer the test to their own students. This makes them less likely to cheat because they don’t know which students need the help, Bromery said. At the end of each testing day, answer sheets are reviewed by two employees for stray marks, sealed in a tamper-proof envelope, and stored in the vault. They remain there until the end of the testing period, which lasts seven school days. For its part, in 2010, the state posted at least one monitor at each school that met their definition of "severe concern," said Kathleen Mathers, executive director of the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement. At schools of severe concern, 25 percent or more of a school’s classrooms showed highly unlikely percentages of wrong-to-right erasures, according to the state’s erasure analysis. Schools of "moderate concern," where 11 to 24 percent of classrooms were flagged, received random checks that year. Monitors are state employees who are familiar with testing procedures. Since state officials found that test tampering and cheating risks are greatest before and after testing, monitors pay special attention to making sure the materials are properly stored. Afterward, they seal answer sheets in envelopes with tamper-proof security tape and return them to the vault. State monitors do not administer the tests, and are not posted in each classroom, Mathers said. In 2011, the state also posted monitors at schools of moderate concern. We interviewed major testing companies and test security experts to assess the methods used in Atlanta Public Schools. Our reporting found that APS does not use the following obvious or widely accepted measures to prevent tampering or cheating: * Tests should be administered by people who are not employed by the school district and have no stake in the outcome, experts said. * Teachers should be barred from entering the room where their own students are taking the CRCT. Educational Testing Service, makers of the SATs and AP exams, among others, will void the score of an AP English exam if students’ AP English teacher enters the testing room, said Ray Nicosia, director of ETS’ test security office. If a school has a testing coach, he or she is not allowed to administer the SATs. * Ideally, tests should be administered by computer in a lab set up so students can’t see each other’s screens, said Richard Phelps, author of the "Standardized Testing Primer" and other books about testing. Computer testing has several advantages: It eliminates the problem of corrupt teachers gaining access to answer sheets and test booklets; they can track every move a student makes; and they can also order questions randomly, further reducing students’ ability to cheat by peeking at a neighbor’s screen, he said. *Testing security is only as good as the people who enforce it, noted Walt Haney, a testing expert and Boston College professor. AJC reporting shows that many of the educators named in the investigative report released in July were still employed when the CRCT was administered in 2011. In light of this information, how do we rule? Certainly, the CRCT was not "given under the strictest security possible" in 2011, as Hall said. APS did tighten its procedures, but PolitiFact Georgia easily found additional ways to increase security. Since APS did boost security starting in 2010, Hall’s statement is not outrageous. But it is incorrect. She therefore earns a False.	None	Beverly Hall	None	None	None	2011-08-05T06:00:00	2011-06-24	['None']

pomt-13614	Says that since lawmakers acted, "we have 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts."	false	/texas/statements/2016/aug/12/sid-miller/sid-miller-incorrectly-says-law-he-authored-touche/	Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller keeps a toothsome mounted boar’s head on a wall outside his office. A toy helicopter looks like it's floating above. As a Texas House member, the Stephenville Republican carried into law a 2011 measure enabling hunters to shoot at feral hogs or coyotes from helicopters, provided the landowner or his agent has given permission. "It became law," Miller told Austin American-Statesman columnist Ken Herman during an office tour in June 2016, "and we have 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts. Took a liability and turned it into an asset. It’s been great. It’s been eradicating hogs ever since." "Eradicating" means killing, which is how hunters including trappers and ranchers attack some of the estimated 1.5 million-plus feral hogs in Texas whose sows typically produce an annual litter of four to six offspring, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says. "There seem to be very few inhibiting factors to curtail this population growth," the agency says on a feral hogs web page that lists various ways people can try to reduce the population. Among the options: "In some areas of Texas, aerial gunning from a helicopter is an efficient technique." But are there really 130 new businesses devoted to helicopter hog hunts? A couple of providers of the in-the-sky Texas hunts each told us that seems unlikely; more on that ahead. When we asked about Miller’s figure, an agriculture department spokesman, Mark Loeffler, advised by email that the commissioner’s "130," offered in passing, Loeffler stressed, was based on his recollection of a TPWD statistic "for the number of companies permitted to do these aerial takes." At the parks department, spokesman Tom Harvey told us there’s no way for the agency to pin down from the paperwork how many hog-hunting operations sprung up after the law came to be. But 140 Aerial Wildlife Management Permits were active/valid when we inquired in July 2016, including, Harvey said by email, 104 permits whose recipients had indicated a commercial purpose--which we took to include businesses offering helicopter hog hunts. Compared with 2010, the year before Miller won approval of his change in law, the count of 104 permit-holders indicating a commercial purpose was up from 86 applicants indicating a commercial purpose, according to the parks department. Generally, Harvey said, aerial hog hunts have helped control feral hogs, which he called a "rampant nuisance species." According to information provided by hunters, Harvey said, about 17,000 feral hogs were taken from the air in 2010. In contrast, 22,533 were removed in 2011 with more than that taken each year through 2015--on average 27,500 a year. Harvey added that hogs shot from the air account for a fairly small percentage of the estimated 750,000-plus feral hogs annually harvested statewide; the latter figure is a state estimate of the number of feral hogs harvested in 2010. The state application for the "permit to manage wildlife or exotic animals by aircraft" asks for the names of each applicant and the names of pilots plus Federal Aviation Administration license numbers and the make, model and color of aircraft. Harvey said permits may be issued for individuals, including rancher-landowners, to count or capture or kill native wildlife and exotic animals by aircraft. He said the permit is "often used for wildlife surveying (particularly white-tailed deer and feral hog counts), and even alligator nest counts." We asked the agency for its latest list of permit holders. From the 104 indicating commercial purposes, we identified less than 10 businesses clearly offering hunters a chance to shoot hogs from the air. We reached one of seven permit-holders whose applications didn’t show commercial or noncommercial intentions. Kenneth Kemp of Victoria told us he’s flown a helicopter to take out hogs for landowners for more than 30 years, killing more than 9,000 hogs from the air in 2015. Kemp said the Miller-authored law didn’t lead him to offer hog hunts to people looking for such adventure. Meantime, our web search for hog hunting services led us to Jay Decker, CEO of Texas-based Gunn&Hook, which was offering helicopter hog hunts starting at $775 as of mid-July 2016. To our inquiry, Decker sent an email listing 14 Texas firms, including Last Shadow, HeliBacon, Pork Choppers and Heli Gunner, that he said provide hog hunts by helicopter. After we shared the state’s 2016 list of permit holders with Decker, he marked seven as businesses that vend helicopter hunts, commenting: "I’m very confident in my number of 10-20 outfitters that fly part of or all of the year and take customers flying and shooting." Separately, John Dumont, the managing partner and chief pilot for Helibacon, which vends helicopter hog hunts using automatic machine guns, said by phone that it competes with five to 10 similar Texas businesses. In the end, we circled back to Loeffler with what we’d gleaned. By email, he specified that Miller was speaking to the number of AWM permits issued in 2012, the first full year of the law’s implementation. State data shows 126 permits were issued that year. "To be fair, the number was a four-year-old statistic made in passing while giving a tour of his office," Loeffler wrote, "and not in an official statement or press release. Good Lord, I don’t expect anyone reading this would want to held to a high standard for every half-remembered number used in casual conversation!" Our ruling Miller said that thanks to the law he authored authorizing hunters to shoot feral hogs from helicopters, "we have 130 new businesses across Texas doing helicopter hog hunts." That figure reflects about the number of state permits issued one recent year allowing Texans to observe or hunt animals from the air. Best we can tell, though, around 20 new helicopter hog hunting ventures took flight after Miller’s proposal became law. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-05356	Says since 2000, Austin’s "tax burden" rose more than 40 percent while family income rose more than 20 percent.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/may/11/dominic-chavez/dominic-chavez-says-austin-tax-burden-more-40-perc/	In his video posted on a city web page featuring videos from numerous candidates, Austin City Council hopeful Dominic "Dom" Chavez expresses concern about the city’s affordability. Chavez, who’s running for Place 5, says: "Since 2000, the median family income has increased more than 20 percent in Austin, but during that same time, the city sales and property tax burden on the typical family has increased by more than 40 percent." Are local taxes outpacing family incomes by so much? We wondered. Chavez told us by email that he used data from the Real Estate Council of Austin’s 2011 annual Combined Costs of Governments Index. That index indicates the estimated city "tax burden" per household increased 48 percent from 2000 to 2011, he said, and the "median family income" rose 27 percent. According to the index, Austin’s median family income went from $58,900 in 2000 to $74,900 in 2011. To calculate residents’ city tax "burden," the group used city sales tax, city property tax and the amount of money from utility fees that is returned to the city each year. They estimated that in those three categories, a typical Austin household paid $1,368.48 to the city in 2000 and $2,029.58 in 2011. The real estate council, which advocates for commercial real estate interests, has calculated the "Cost of Governments" index for each year starting with 1989. Susan Engelking of Engelking Communications updates the index annually, and spoke with us by phone about how it’s compiled. She said Chavez’s use of 20 percent and 40 percent "looks OK … (it’s) in the ballpark," and described for us the variables they use to calculate this "tax burden": City sales tax: The total amount Austin collects in sales taxes throughout the year, divided by the number of households. Utility transfers: Part of Austin-area residents’ utility fees goes to the city’s general fund. Engelking gets the total dollar amount that is transferred to the fund in a year, then divides by number of households. City property tax: The tax bill a homeowner would pay under that year’s city rate on a house that has Austin’s average taxable value for that year (taxable value is what’s left after homestead and other exemptions are subtracted). The real estate group selected those measures, Engelking said, because the group wanted to use annual numbers that would be reported consistently for years to come -- with no changes in methodology -- so that the results would continue to be directly comparable. For similar reasons, she said, the group opted not to adjust the data for inflation. "There were several compelling reasons to not do it," Engelking said. They wanted the index to be simple enough that anyone could quickly recreate the work just by making a few phonecalls, she said -- and simple enough so that it would be clear nobody was "fiddling" with the numbers. But most importantly, she said, adjusting for inflation would not change the big picture: how taxes and income affect Austinites through the years. "It isn’t necessary for the question we are asking," she said. Mark Robyn, an economist who studies local, state and federal taxes at the Washington-based, nonpartisan Tax Foundation, said he thinks the real estate council’s sales/utility/property tax definition of "tax burden" is a fair measure if it includes all the major taxes levied by the city. Citing median income for a family of four but calculating tax bills for an average household is not a perfect comparison, Robyn said, but he added, "I can’t think of a reason there’s anything wrong with it." Although medians and averages are calculated differently, neither one is "wrong"; there are just many ways to slice the data, he said. Like Engelking, Robyn noted that Chavez had used a conservative estimate. "He could make an even more shocking statement if he wanted to," Robyn said. Over a longer period, the real estate group’s numbers show even more disparity. Michael Wilt, the group’s director of government relations, told us by phone, "What our numbers indicate is that since 1989, the median family income has doubled but the combined tax burden has tripled." His group maintains the index to remind local government of of these aspects, he said. "The main statement is that the cost of government is outpacing the median income." Robyn said that such a conclusion would most likely hold even if the numbers were adjusted for inflation. With inflation factored in, he said, change in income over time might not be 27 percent, and the change in tax bill over time might not be 48 percent, but overall, tax bills should still be outpacing income. We tracked down the data independently from the sources Engelking used. From the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, we learned Austin’s median family incomes were $58,900 in 2000 and $74,900 in 2011, a 27 percent increase. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city (rather than the Austin metropolitan statistical area, which is larger) had 265,649 households in 2000 and 330,010 households in 2011. Austin’s demographer, Ryan Robinson, told us by phone that the city calculates its own numbers for non-census years, and said he probably supplied Engelking with an October 2011 quarterly estimate of 333,815 households. Austin’s budget office gave us the city’s total sales tax revenue for 2000 ($122.2 million) and 2011 ($151.2 million), as well as total utility dollars transferred to the city in 2000 ($78.4 million) and 2011 ($134.3 million). The Travis Central Appraisal District sent us average taxable home values and city property tax rates for those years. Next we ran the math, and found that one of Austin’s 265,649 households in 2000 would have paid an average of $461 in city sales taxes and seen $295 of its utility fees transferred back to the general fund. If that household owned a home worth the city’s average taxable value ($138,674, in 2000), its city property tax bill would have been $647, at the 2000 rate of 46.63 cents per $100. That yields a "tax burden" of $1,402 for an average Austin household, in a year when HUD gives Austin’s median family income as $58,900. In 2011, according to the same sources, one of Austin’s 333,815 households would have paid $453 in city sales tax, $407 in utility transfers and -- if the home’s taxable value was $254,328, the average for Austin in 2011 -- a city property tax bill of $1,224. That’s a total $2,084 "burden" in a year when HUD estimates Austin median family income was $74,900. The real estate group, by way of contrast, got a "tax burden" of $1,368 for 2000 and $2,030 for 2011. So our results were $34 higher for 2000 and $54 higher for 2011. In all cases, however, the percentage of change held up: That "tax burden" rose 48 percent from 2000 to 2011, whether calculated by us or by the real estate council. City budget officer Ed Van Eenoo told us by email that he had a few concerns with the index. Dividing sales tax revenue and utility transfers by the number of Austin households inflates the apparent "burden," he said, because it’s not just city residents paying into both of those pools. The utilities serve an area larger than the city, and business-to-business sales as well as out-of-town visitors contribute sales tax dollars. He also objected to calling the utility transfers a "tax." Engelking said sales tax, utility transfers and property tax are the three largest revenue streams going into the city’s general fund. She agreed that utility transfers aren’t a "tax," but said that the goal of the index is to track the "costs of government," as indicated by its name. If utility transfers were excluded, she said, "you’d be missing really important money that people do pay to fund city government." Our ruling Chavez drew on a calculation that checks out, though the city’s suggested caveats seem worthy of consideration. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05622	"The poorest in this country are women."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/26/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-says-poorest-america-are-women/	U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Toledo, appeared recently on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton in which the host took a swipe at Republicans for focusing on women’s reproductive issues rather than creating jobs. Kaptur shared Sharpton’s indignation and said voters in her district do, too. "They think the Republicans want to take us back a half century on reproductive health," she said. The subject then turned to economics and the pending transportation bill, with Kaptur lamenting the fact that Congress has not been able to approve a bill that would put a lot of Americans back to work. "The American people are clamoring for getting the roads paved, for improving our airports, for improving our mass transit, for improving our ports," she said. She then brought the conversation back to the subject of women and the economic challenges many of them face. "The poorest in this country are women," she said. PolitiFact Ohio decided to focus on this simple statement about the economic plight of women. Kaptur’s communications director Steve Fought provided PolitiFact Ohio with U.S. Census data and a National Women’s Law Center report to back up his boss’s statement. The numbers indeed show that the poverty rate for women in the United States was 14.5 percent in 2010, which was 3.3 percentage points higher than for men. Women also fared worse when comparisons were made within ethnic groups, such as white (non-Hispanic), black, Hispanic, Asian and native American. For instance, slightly more than 25 percent of all African-American women were in poverty in 2010, compared with 19.1 percent for African-American men. Greater numbers of women also tended to be poor when broken down by age groups. More than 25 percent of women 18-24 years of age are in poverty, compared with 18.8 percent for men in the same age group. And for women in that same age group who are also single mothers, the percentage of those in poverty jumps to 40.7 percent, compared to 24.2 for single men with children. We went one step further and found the percentage of women in extreme poverty was 6.3 percent, 1.4 percentage points higher than for men. People who are considered in extreme poverty have incomes that are more than halfway below the federal poverty line. In those cases, one is "really destitute," said Claudia Coulton, co-director of the Center for Urban Policy and Community Development at Case Western Reserve University. So, just about any way you slice it, women are more likely than men to be poor, or at least below the poverty line. We rate Kaptur’s statement True.

pomt-02059	Says opponent Mary Burke told reporters she would have "required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/29/brett-hulsey/brett-hulsey-says-mary-burke-would-have-required-s/	Democrat Brett Hulsey says that any union member who supports Mary Burke "is like a chicken who votes for Colonel Sanders." Them’s fightin’ words -- and they’re aimed at a fellow Democrat vying to take on Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the November election. Hulsey, a state representative from Madison and former vice president of a union local at a Sierra Club office, alleges outsourcing of jobs by Trek Bicycle when Burke was a Trek board member. Hulsey is also displeased with Burke’s support of a charter school in Madison, where she is on the school board. But what really miffs Hulsey is Burke saying it was "reasonable" and "fair" for public employees to pay more toward their state-funded pensions and health insurance in 2011. In his controversial move to sharply limit collective bargaining, Walker and fellow Republicans imposed those cost-sharing moves on state employees and cleared the way for local governments to do the same. It was part of the law known as Act 10. Hulsey is accusing Burke of Walker-like anti-union behavior regarding those benefits and other issues. She supports "taking" public servants’ healthcare and retirement benefits, Hulsey claimed in a May 21, 2014 news release. And in a letter to Burke in advance of the South Central Federation of Labor’s annual bean feed, a long-running celebration sponsored by the Madison-based labor union umbrella group, Hulsey wrote: "You told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that you would have required workers to give up bargained for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker." Is Hulsey right? Burke’s statements on Act 10 Burke, who entered the governor’s race in early October 2013, has been remarkably consistent in her comments on Act 10. As support for his claim, Hulsey cites an April 18, 2014 interview with the Journal Sentinel in which Burke said she would work to restore collective bargaining for public workers while still seeking efficient government. In the interview, Burke said: "If I had been governor I would have made sure I bargained for the changes that needed to be made to balance the state budget. I think it was only fair to ask for contributions to health care and pensions but I think those could have been negotiated, certainly firmly but fairly." Walker’s approach, she said, left the state divided and has caused teachers and prospective educators to question whether salaries and benefits will be sufficient to support their careers and pay off student loans. "Wisconsin walked away from the table and left it in a worse place," Burke said. So, Burke staked out a somewhat nuanced position. She defended getting public workers to pay more. She said she’d have negotiated over the pension and health changes, in contrast to Walker’s approach of removing those as subjects of bargaining. And she suggested she could have achieved a result similar to Walker’s by being firm in her "ask" for the benefits changes. Could she have? That’s debatable. In 2011, some union leaders at one point said they’d agree to the benefits givebacks. But that was under extreme pressure because Walker had the votes for the stringent limits on bargaining -- and a ban on employers from deducting union dues from employee paychecks. In any event, it’s clear from Burke’s comments that she wanted a similar result on pension and healthcare cost-sharing as Walker, but wouldn’t -- and couldn’t -- have "required" workers to pay more. That’s because, she said, she’d have negotiated to try to get that. But her comments also suggest she would have made a high priority of getting those "fair" givebacks in exchange for something else. Burke’s comments have been met with disappointment from some quarters on the left and among union leaders, but she’s received endorsements from the largest state employee union, major teachers unions and the state AFL-CIO. They said her support is clear for collective bargaining, which she described as "something that I believe in and think is right for our state," in an appearance on The Devil’s Advocates radio show. Meanwhile, Hulsey is making a full-throated pledge to try to repeal Act 10 as a whole, including the benefits cuts, saying the cuts were not necessary. He has pledged to provide back pay to workers whose wages declined because of the act. Hulsey told us that Burke’s comments -- that she would have negotiated the benefits changes she needed -- amount to an approach that would have "required" the cuts of workers, "just in a more humane way" than Walker. Our rating Hulsey claimed Burke told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors that she "would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker." There’s an element of truth here in that Burke did say she backed benefits cuts in the same areas as Walker got, and was confident she could have achieved them. But Hulsey’s phrasing makes it sound like Burke backs Walker’s approach. That’s a huge stretch given that she would have left collective bargaining intact and tried to negotiate the cost-cutting moves. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-10284	Barack Obama "rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/20/jerome-corsi/obama-does-not-reject-his-family-/	A new book — The Obama Nation by Jerome R. Corsi — attacks Barack Obama as a political extremist. Taken as a whole, the book's primary argument is that Obama is a likely communist sympathizer with ties to Islam who has skillfully hidden his true agenda as he ruthlessly pursues elected office. We found factual problems with Corsi's book and question its overall tone; read our extended story here. Some of the book is a recitation of established facts about Obama that are not particularly in dispute. Corsi quotes extensively and accurately from Obama's memoir Dreams from my Father, and then comments disparagingly. In other instances, he gets his facts wrong, as when he says Obama "rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents." The statement is in Chapter 3, where Corsi dissects what he describes as Obama's "black rage." As evidence for Obama's alleged rage, Corsi cites passages from Obama's memoir where Obama discusses reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X while he was a high school student. Malcolm X was a black separatist and a member of the Nation of Islam who rejected nonviolence associated with Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights movement. Corsi quotes Obama's book, in which Obama discusses Malcolm X's multiracial heritage and reflects on his own experience of having parents of different races. Obama's mother was white, his father was from Africa, and Obama was partly raised by his maternal grandparents. "I was left to wonder what else I would be severing if and when I left my mother and my grandparents at some uncharted border," Obama writes. Corsi then concludes, "At this point, Obama's story of race and inheritance appears complete. His race, he self-determines, is African-American. In making that determination, he rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents. "We do not have to speculate about this. Obama tells this to us outright; his words are direct, defying us to miss his meaning." But this is a significant misreading of Obama's memoir. Obama just a few pages earlier had written that he felt a disconnect talking about race with his black friends in high school. "Sometimes I would find myself talking to Ray about white folks this or white folks that, and I would suddenly remember my mother's smile, and the words that I spoke would seem awkward and false," Obama writes. In fact, Obama has positive relations with his mother and grandparents through much of the rest of the book. Obama's mother and grandmother both attended Obama's wedding to Michelle Robinson in 1992. (His grandfather was recently deceased.) The book's final scene is at Obama's wedding, where his half-brother from Kenya, called Abongo, meets Obama's mother and grandmother, who is called Toot. "Toward the end of the wedding, I watched him grinning widely for the video camera, his long arms draped over the shoulders of my mother and Toot, whose heads barely reached the height of his chest," Obama writes. "'Eh, brother,' he said to me as I walked up to the three of them. 'It looks like I have two new mothers now.' Toot patted him on the back. 'And we have a new son,' she said, although when she tried to say 'Abongo' her Kansas tongue mangled it hopelessly. My mother's chin started to tremble again, and Abongo lifted up his glass of fruit punch for a toast. ... I felt like the luckiest man alive." It's also worth noting that photographs document the Obama wedding and Obama's maternal grandparents visiting him at college. In August 2008, Obama took a weeklong break from the campaign to visit his maternal grandmother at her home in Hawaii. To conclude that Obama "rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents," Corsi has to significantly read against the memoir's stated meaning. We find factual evidence also contradicts this statement, indicating that Obama maintained lifelong relations with his white relatives. We rate Corsi's statement Pants on Fire!	None	Jerome R.

pomt-06661	Ben Bernanke has been the most "inflationary" chairman in the history of the Federal Reserve.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/12/newt-gingrich/gingrich-bernankes-policies-inflationary-extreme-l/	The Republican candidates for president aimed most of their rhetorical ammunition during Wednesday’s debate at President Obama, but there were a few shots at Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. One verbal attack by former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich at Bernanke caught our attention. "I think he's been the most inflationary, dangerous and power-centered chairman of the Fed in the history of the Fed," said Gingrich, a former U.S. House member from the Atlanta suburbs. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States and tries to make sure the nation’s monetary and credit conditions are stable. The Republican field for president have all been critical of the economic policies of Obama, a Democrat, focusing on issues like the nation’s high unemployment rate and his desire to end tax cuts for the wealthiest earners. Some of that criticism has befallen Bernanke, who was first nominated to the position by President George W. Bush, a Republican, during the latter part of his administration. The parts about Bernanke being "dangerous" and "power-centered" seemed grist for debate among political wonks. Inflationary sounded like something easier to check with data, a claim worthy of the Truth-O-Meter. Here’s what we found. Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond explained the basis of his comments, along with forwarding a speech the candidate made in June to the Atlanta Press Club. "Newt's comments were based on reports of unaccounted spending reaching into the billions the Fed has doled out over the past few years," Hammond told us in an e-mail. In that speech, Gingrich criticized Bernanke’s support for the 2008 bank bailout and says some Fed policies weaken the U.S. dollar by promoting inflation. "For example, the Fed might increase the money supply substantially in the belief that such monetary expansion will spark economic growth," Gingrich said. "But a Fed that floods the economy with new dollars in an attempt to stimulate economic growth and new jobs is a Fed that decreases the value of every dollar in every American’s pocket through higher inflation, making every American poorer. "Look at what has already happened," Gingrich continued. "Today, we have a dollar that is stunningly weaker than it used to be, and the price of everything from gasoline to groceries is steadily drifting upward." Bernanke is the 14th chairman of the Federal Reserve. The first was Charles S. Hamlin, an attorney and former assistant Treasury Department secretary who served from August 1914 to August 1916. The tenures varied, from two to three years in the case of Hamlin, Roy Young and Eugene Meyer, to nearly 19 years in the case of Alan Greenspan, who served from August 1987 through January 2006. Bernanke became Fed chairman in February 2006. We looked at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, which measures the prices nearly 90 percent of Americans pay for goods and services and is used by most economists to determine inflation rates. The bureau keeps annual data on the change to the index. Since some Fed chairmen did not serve an entire year, we only used full years to make a comparison. In 1958, the bureau decided to track the index in two ways, with and without including food and energy. Some economists don’t like to include food and energy because they fluctuate more than other costs. We didn’t find much of a difference in the annual change if you excluded food and energy. The highest average annual index was nearly 11 percent, which occurred under Chairman William P.G. Harding from 1917 to 1921. The second-highest rate was from 1971 to 1977, when Arthur Burns was chairman. The annual average index between 2007, the first full year of Bernanke’s term, to 2010 was just below 2 percent. Bernanke was in the middle of the pack in comparison to the other Fed chairmen. Barry Bosworth, an economics expert at the liberal/centrist-leaning Brookings Institution, said he would use a similar method to measure Bernanke. The percentage he found under Bernanke was nearly the same. "It is unusually low," said Bosworth. We also tried another method to see if Gingrich had a point. We used the bureau’s index inflation calculator. We looked at how much $100 was worth in the first year of each chairman’s term and the last year. Harding, again, had the highest average percentage change. Bernanke, again, was in the middle of the pack. Dan Mitchell, whose biography says he worked as an economist for former U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), believes the index is not the best way to measure inflation. "[I]nflation can then show up in various ways - a rising CPI, an asset bubble, excess reserves redeposited at the Fed, etc. I'm not saying Gingrich is necessarily right. But I am saying that CPI is not the right variable, (though that's how the average thinks of it)," Mitchell said. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, contends that "inflation is the creation of excess liquidity by the central bank." The definition is similar to Gingrich’s argument that Bernanke flooded the economy with too many dollars. J.D. Foster, an economist whose biography says he worked in the White House Office of Management and Budget, told us that inflation is accelerating, but still low. He said some of Bernanke’s policies could result in much higher rates. "There is a long and variable delay between monetary policy actions and inflationary effects. So looking at today's inflation really doesn't tell you much about future inflation. Therein can one defend with no trouble Gingrich's comments about inflation," said Foster, who worked at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation. Donald Ratajczak, a leading economist and former director of Georgia State University’s Economic Forecasting Center, said "(Bernanke) has been one of the least" inflationary Fed chairmen. Ratajczak said the only rationale he could consider is that Gingrich was referring to the expansion of assets of the Federal Reserve. "But that’s not the same thing," said Ratajczak, who still writes a weekly commentary on the economy for Morgan Keegan, an investment firm. Our ruling: Gingrich is making the point that Bernanke has created a huge pool of liquidity that is raising inflationary pressures to levels never seen under previous Fed chairmen. However, the current CPI rates are still low, and Gingrich’s concerns haven’t been seen in Consumer Price Index averages, which are widely used to monitor inflation. The index has been higher under other Fed chairmen, and Bernanke is in the middle under such a comparison. We rate Gingrich’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-03388	"In New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/08/gabrielle-giffords/gabrielle-giffords-says-nh-republicans-gun-owners-/	Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was shot in her home district in Arizona, contends expanded background checks continue to be popular — even among Republicans and gun owners. Her advocacy group is now targeting states with senators who voted against a compromise bill in April that would have mandated background checks for all private gun sales, with exceptions. Giffords kicked off a seven-state tour the week of Independence Day with a USA Today op-ed arguing, "there don't have to be winners and losers." There’s support for a "simple, fair solution: background checks for all potential gun buyers," she wrote in the piece, published July 1, 2013. "Expanded background checks continue to be popular with significant majorities, even in states with high percentages of gun owners and across all party affiliations. "For example, in New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks." The New Hampshire numbers caught our eye. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte saw her poll numbers drop after she voted against the Senate proposal, and a sympathetic PAC launched an ad in her defense. Do Ayotte’s constituents support expanded background checks? What the polls say Giffords’ op-ed relies on polling conducted on behalf of her advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions. The question: "Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks on all gun sales including those sold on the Internet and at gun shows?" Registered voters in New Hampshire who participated in the poll, done May 21-23, 2013, by progressive polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, answered the way Giffords described. Our general policy is to give some credence to polls paid for by an organization affiliated with the individual or group making the claim, but also to look for confirmation with polls taken independently of the organization. No recent New Hampshire poll we found broke out respondents in all of those categories: by party, gun ownership and "NRA households." (We’ll note, too, that the GQRR poll memo didn’t define the NRA group. In previous fact-checks we learned similar phrases may include current and former NRA members.) But a smattering of polls from this year generally back up pieces of her claim. Poll Date Question Support Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research May 21-23, 2013 "Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks on all gun sales including those sold on the Internet and at gun shows?" • 84% (N.H.) • 93% (N.H. Dems) • 79% (N.H. GOP) • 82% (N.H. gun owners) • 60% (N.H. NRA households) Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College April 22-25, 2013 Poll respondents were asked if they supported or opposed universal background checks for the purchase of firearms in New Hampshire. • 76% (N.H.) • 88% (N.H. Dems) • 63% (N.H. GOP) Public Policy Polling April 19-21, 2013 "Would you support or oppose requiring background checks on individuals who purchase guns at gun shows?" • 75% (N.H.) • 95% (N.H. Dems) • 56% (N.H. GOP) University of New Hampshire Survey Center Jan. 30-Feb. 5, 2013 "A background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony." • 94% (N.H.) • 99% (N.H. Dems) • 92% (N.H. GOP) • 91% (N.H. gun owners) New England College Jan. 21-22, 2-13 "There is a national proposal for universal gun background checks for gun sales through dealers, shows, and private individuals. Do you support the idea of universal background checks for gun purchases?" • 88% (N.H.) The findings for New Hampshire Democrats in the Giffords poll were generally in tune with the other polls we found. But the Republican numbers, while still a majority, were significantly lower in two New Hampshire polls than the 79 percent Giffords cited — 63 percent in a Dartmouth College poll and 56 percent in a Public Policy Polling survey. Meanwhile, we’re not aware of any recent independent polls of New Hampshire NRA members. Two polls we have reviewed in previous fact-checks have looked at this issue nationally. But both were conducted by groups associated to one degree or another with the pro-gun-control position — one was sponsored by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, and the other was conducted by the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, which is named for and supported financially by the founder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. However, at least one independent poll this year, by CBS News and the New York Times found that nationally, 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member supported universal background checks. Meanwhile, a May report from Pew Research Center shows it’s a mistake to assume support for expanded background checks is the same as support for background check legislation. Support among Republicans and gun owners for expanding background checks in that national survey — in the 80 percent range — fell to around 60 percent when they were asked about the Senate bill. And while 79 percent of Republican gun owners favored background checks, just 43 percent wanted the Senate’s background checks legislation to pass. Our ruling Giffords, seeking common ground for gun control legislation, said "in New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks." The numbers came from polling on behalf of her own advocacy group. We found some independent evidence that New Hampshire voters support expanded background checks, through the support is weaker among Republicans. It’s also important to note that support for background checks doesn’t translate directly to support for the Senate bill Giffords mentioned in her op-ed. Support for the bill itself commands smaller majorities, and a minority of gun-owning Republicans nationally. Giffords’ claim requires clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Gabrielle Giffords	None	None	None	2013-07-08T10:35:07	2013-07-01	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'National_Rifle_Association']
pomt-07275	Says Gov. Rick Perry has been "begging" for the federal government to send the Coast Guard to patrol two lakes on the U.S.-Mexico border.	false	/texas/statements/2011/may/24/louie-gohmert/louie-gohmert-says-gov-rick-perry-begging-coast-gu/	U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, sounded downbeat about President Barack Obama’s commitment to securing the U.S.-Mexico border May 10, the day the president spoke on immigration policy in El Paso. In an interview on the Georgia-based Martha Zoller Show, Gohmert pointed to two lakes that straddle the border, Falcon Lake and Lake Amistad. Gohmert went on to say he'd recently visited with Texas Gov. Rick Perry and "they've been begging for the federal government to give us some Coast Guard help" on the lakes because Texas is "having to do what the federal government will not and try to patrol the lakes but they, the drug cartels, have spotters, they watch where these guys are; we need Coast Guard down there protecting our border. You’ve got people being smuggled, drugs being smuggled and the president will not lift one finger here to see there is protection." Never mind the president’s fingers; has the state of Texas begged for Coast Guard help on the lakes? The lakes are man-made reservoirs about 200 miles apart on the Rio Grande; the international boundary runs down the center of the river channel. According to Alan Cox, superintendent of the Amistad National Recreation Area, Lake Amistad, 12 miles northwest of Del Rio, has had no cartel-tied deaths. But on Falcon Lake, about 40 miles east of Laredo, an American jet skiier was gunned down last fall. Stratfor, an Austin intelligence firm, subsequently speculated that the man, who had been viewing Mexican ruins with his wife, was murdered by low-level members of Los Zetas, a drug trafficking group, who were trying to protect the smuggling corridor. As reported by The Houston Chronicle in October, the ambush by three boatloads was the fifth reported confrontation with "pirates" on the border lake since the spring. It was the first involving a shooting death, followed by a gun chase extending to the U.S. side. More recently, the San Antonio Express-News reported that on May 8 Mexican marines patrolling the lake killed 12 presumed Zeta drug gang members in a battle that erupted after the military discovered an island drug encampment. When we sought backup for Gohmert’s statement, his office pointed us to Perry’s Aug. 9 letter to Obama urging additional federal resources to combat "increasing violence" on the border. His three-page letter termed insufficient the approved deployment of "just 286 National Guard personnel" on the 1,200-mile Texas-Mexico border and revisits Perry’s request for the federal government to send 1,000 National Guard troops to Texas and fly unmanned aircraft on the border. His letter does not mention the Coast Guard. Next, Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told us the state has not asked the federal government to send the Coast Guard to the lakes. But, she said, Perry has spoken to members of Congress "about getting Coast Guard (personnel)" on the lakes. "It’s pretty damn obvious the governor has been pretty adamant about getting additional (border) resources... however they send them down, that’s great," Cesinger said. In an email, Department of Homeland Security spokesman Adam Fetcher did not speak directly to Texas seeking Coast Guard help on the lakes. He said, though, that the Coast Guard works with the Border Patrol to "conduct periodic patrol operations in the (border) area and surge(s) as needed." Fetcher specified that the Coast Guard, drawing on personnel based in Corpus Christi and other South Texas locales, conducts periodic operations on Falcon Lake, but he did not mention security on Lake Amisted. Cox later told us the Coast Guard conducts joint lake patrols on Lake Amistad with the National Park Service about four times a year. Cox said one reason there have been no deaths on the lake linked to the illegal drug trade is the presence of many law enforcement officers: The Border Patrol has 20 agents assigned to the lake, the park service has 17 agents and the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department maintains eight game wardens out of nearby Del Rio, he said. Zapata County Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez, whose jurisdiction includes Falcon Lake, said by email he was unaware of any request by Gohmert for Coast Guard patrols on Falcon Lake, though he said they would "do good... and are needed." Gonzalez said the Coast Guard already comes to the lake "once in a while... not very often" because, he speculated, of budgetary limits. Our sense: It’s possible Perry has informally talked to some House members about putting the Coast Guard on the lakes--where that force already periodically ventures. But he’s made no formal direct request to the government. That’s far from "begging" for Coast Guard deployment. We rate Gohmert’s statement False.

pomt-03781	"In 2011 alone, 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/31/sheila-oliver/sheila-oliver-claims-gun-violence-killed-269-peopl/	More than 250 people in New Jersey died in 2011 because of a weapon, according to Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver. And it’s not just any weapon, either, she said in a Feb. 21 opinion piece that appeared in The Times Of Trenton. The column published the day the state Assembly voted on a 22-bill package of gun-control measures. "In 2011 alone, 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence," Oliver (D-Essex) wrote. Assembly Democrats spokeswoman Jennifer Scortino said Oliver’s statistic comes from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report for 2011. We verified its accuracy. New Jersey, however, didn’t have the highest number of deaths in 2011 resulting from gun violence. That title goes to California, at 1,220 murders. California was one of 12 states with a higher number of gun-related deaths in 2011 than New Jersey. Complete FBI data for 2012 is not yet available, but we also looked at the number of gun-violence deaths dating to 2005. The data shows that gun-violence deaths in New Jersey have fluctuated through the years. Prior to 2011, New Jersey had 246 gun-violence deaths in 2010; 220 in 2009; 236 in 2008; 260 in 2007; 289 in 2006; and 276 in 2005, according to annual UCR reports. Let’s review some background on how the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports works. More than 18,000 law enforcement agencies from across the country voluntarily report crime data to the FBI, which then compiles volume and rate of crime offenses for the nation, states and many cities and counties, according to FBI.gov. It also includes arrest, clearance and law enforcement employee data. But the FBI isn't the only agency that tracks data involving weapons. We also checked mortality data with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. For 2010, the latest data available, New Jersey had 456 deaths resulting from injuries caused by firearms, a spokesman said. Of that number, 246 incidents were assaults by unspecified firearms; 11 were assaults by rifles and larger firearms; 181 were suicides; and 18 were other categories involving firearms. Oliver noted in her column that the bills package was not a knee-jerk response to the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., but one that resulted after lengthy discussions about other mass shootings around the country as well as efforts to close loopholes in existing gun laws. "Our comprehensive package promotes common-sense measures without infringing on the Second Amendment rights enshrined in our Constitution," Oliver wrote. "By keeping dangerous weapons off of our streets, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and addressing mental health issues and school security, we can stop these tragedies from becoming all too common." Although the Assembly passed the bill, Republicans pointed to flaws in the bills package and accused Democrats of rushing the bills through to gain a political advantage with Gov. Chris Christie and the Legislature up for re-election this year. "This is simply a way for the Democrats to find a wedge issue in a year when they can’t find a wedge issue," Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said before the votes were taken. Our ruling Oliver said in a column that published the day the state Assembly voted on a package of gun-control bills that "in 2011 alone, 269 New Jerseyans were killed by gun violence." The FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report for 2011 – the most up-to-date year of complete crime data – verifies that number. It’s worth noting, however, that 12 other states had more deaths attributed to gun violence than New Jersey that year. We rate Oliver’s statement True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05057	Says "tenure still exists but it's been overhauled" for teachers in New Jersey.	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/09/stephen-sweeney/steve-sweeney-claims-new-legislation-doesnt-elimin/	Senate President Steve Sweeney said new legislation transforms tenure into a system fit for the 21st-century while maintaining the protections it gives teachers. Tenure has been modernized, not eliminated in a bill recently passed by the state Legislature but not yet signed by the governor, Sweeney told WNYC host Brian Lehrer in a July 2 interview. Lehrer asked Sweeney, "What does tenure mean if you can then remove the teachers who you don't think are doing a good job?" "Well what happens is … tenure is after three years in the state of New Jersey, tenure you have a lifetime job. So if you, seven years, 10 years into the job … it was almost impossible to get rid of a teacher. Now, with the evaluation processes that we're going to have going forward, teachers aren't performing as they should be and they get bad evaluations we can move to remove those teachers much more quickly," Sweeney (D-Gloucester) said. "So does that change tenure or does that end tenure?" Lehrer asked. "Should we say tenure is over in New Jersey?" "No, tenure still exists but it's been overhauled," Sweeney said. "I would say Brian it's been modernized." Saying that tenure provides teachers a "lifetime job" suggests there is no process for firing teachers. However, such a system existed prior to this legislation, though critics argue it was so costly and cumbersome that it was hardly used. But for this fact-check, we’re only examining Sweeney’s claim that tenure for teachers still exists in New Jersey. Last year, PolitiFact New Jersey gave Gov. Chris Christie a Half True for saying that when the New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, says he wants to "eliminate tenure, that’s not true." But Christie’s proposals and the new legislation differ in several ways. The legislation creates an annual evaluation system for educators, a plan backed by Christie. Under the system teachers can receive one of four ratings: ineffective, partially effective, effective and highly effective. New teachers must complete a one-year mentorship program and then receive positive evaluations in two of the next three years in order to receive tenure. Previously, teachers earned tenure after three years on the job. The legislation also requires the filing of an inefficiency charge against tenured teachers receiving negative evaluations for two consecutive years. But teachers can contest those charges with an arbitrator. Previously, administrative law judges handled such disputes. Under Christie’s plan and the legislation as it was first introduced teachers who received negative evaluations would lose their tenure rights and therefore could not contest their dismissal, except in narrow circumstances outlined in the original bill. NJEA spokesman Steve Baker said tenure still exists under the new legislation. "The fundamental issue is that a teacher, having earned tenure, retains the right to due process before she or he can be fired," Baker said. "Tenure, under statute, is simply the right to due process in the form of a chance to have a hearing before a neutral third party." Jeffrey Keefe, a professor at Rutgers University’s School of Management and Labor Relations, said there are two elements of teacher tenure: a just-cause requirement for dismissal after three years of probation and seniority in layoffs provided the teacher is certified for a potential vacancy possibly held by a less senior teacher. Christie wanted to eliminate seniority protections during layoffs. But the "last in, first out" system -- which means the newest teachers are laid off first -- remains intact in the new legislation. "I think tenure was overhauled in the bill, since schools could always dismiss a teacher for cause including poor performance (provided there were efforts to correct the unacceptable performance)," Keefe said. Our ruling Sweeney said "tenure still exists but it's been overhauled" in New Jersey. A bill approved by the Legislature makes it more difficult to earn tenure and requires inefficiency charges to be filed against teachers receiving negative evaluations for two consecutive years. But the bill does not eliminate a tenured teacher’s right to appeal those charges. The law also maintains seniority protections during layoffs. For those reasons, we rate Sweeney’s statement True.

pomt-11959	"Celine Dion’s 16-year-old Rene-Charles Angelil’s was among the 58 victims who were killed" in Las Vegas.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/04/houstonchronicle-tvcom/no-celine-dions-son-did-not-die-las-vegas-shooting/	René-Charles Angélil, Celine Dion’s son, was not one of the people killed in the Las Vegas shooting, despite a fake news article that says he was. HoustonChronicle-tv.com posted an article claiming that "Celine Dion’s 16-year-old Rene-Charles Angelil’s was among the 58 victims who were killed when a gunman opened fire late Sunday at a Las Vegas concert that left at least 58 people dead and 515 injured." There is no indication that Angélil was even at the country music concert, let alone murdered there. HoustonChronicle-tv.com attributed to Dion a statement that it said she made on Oct. 2 about her son’s death: "At this point, I'm in complete disbelief and despair. I don't know what to say. René-Charles was the most kind-hearted, loving son I have ever seen." However, Dion never said this. Instead, Heather Gulish Melton said it in a statement made to radio station WCYB about her husband, Sonny. Sonny and Heather Melton attended the Route 91 Harvest Festival together. There, Sonny was shot and killed as they were running away from the shooter at the concert. "At this point, I'm in complete disbelief and despair. I don't know what to say. Sonny was the most kind-hearted, loving man I have ever met. He saved my life and lost his," said Heather Gulish Melton. HoustonChronicle-tv.com changed the quote by switching the names from "Sonny" to "René," altering the last part of the quote from "loving man I have ever met," to "loving son I have ever seen," and eliminating all together "he saved my life and lost his." Often, fake news sites use site names that are close to the name of an existing news publication to trick people into thinking it is legitimate. For example, HoustonChronicle-tv.com is similar in name to the Houston Chronicle, which is the actual local newspaper for Houston, Texas. Dion had a concert in Las Vegas on Oct. 3 where she paid tribute to the victims, their families, first responders and anyone affected by the tragedy. "I never start the show like this but tonight is very different," she said, according to People. "On Sunday we lost too many beautiful, innocent souls, and so many are still suffering,. But tonight we’re going to let these families know that we are supporting them and that we will help them through their tragic loss." She made no mention of her son, because he was not a victim of this mass shooting. HoustonChronicle-tv.com has posted other fake news articles that we have rated before.

pomt-11853	Says Florida "workers are paid $8.10 an hour, and our current governor (Rick Scott) runs ads bragging about it."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/nov/06/philip-levine/levine-wrongly-says-scott-ad-bragged-about-states-/	Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine wasted no time attacking current Gov. Rick Scott as he jumped into the 2018 governor’s race. In a Nov. 1, 2017, speech announcing his run, Levine, a Democrat, criticized the governor for being so proud of the state’s minimum wage that he’s advertising it. "When workers are paid $8.10 an hour, and our current governor runs ads bragging about it — it’s callous and it’s wrong," Levine said. Florida’s minimum wage is $8.10 and will rise 15 cents in January 2018. Has Scott run ads bragging about it? Not directly. The radio ad in question comes from Enterprise Florida, the state’s public-private economic development arm chaired by Scott. The ad did boast about Florida’s lack of income tax and Scott’s efforts to cut regulations. But Levine went too far in saying Scott bragged about the state’s minimum wage. Ad doesn’t explicitly talk about Florida’s minimum wage Levine’s spokesman Christian Ulvert sent two columns by opinion writers and one article that discussed radio ads in California that coincided with a business recruitment trip by Scott in May 2016. The Enterprise Florida ad talked about lost jobs that would come if California approved a $15 minimum wage. When the ad brought up Florida, the focus was on lower taxes and less regulation, not Florida’s minimum wage explicitly. "Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage. Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them." We didn’t hear back from Scott by our deadline. When we last looked at the ad in 2016, a Scott spokeswoman said the ad wasn’t Scott bragging about low wages, but rather him pointing out differences between the states’ economies. "He has never said he is proud of how low our wages are," said Jackie Schutz Zeckman, now Scott’s chief of staff. Levine’s spokesman disagreed, arguing the the "intent and purpose" of the ad, as interpreted by newspaper editorial writers and columnists, was centered around wages. "The governor has bragged about Florida's low wages a number of times and allowed tax dollars to be used to highlight that fact in California," Ulvert said. "All facts." Ulvert also pointed to the state’s decision to join the lawsuit against Miami Beach’s minimum wage ordinance that aimed to increase the city starting wage to $13.31 by 2021. (The ordinance was struck down in Miami-Dade circuit court in March.) Ulvert has a point that multiple news outlets — mostly columnists — have accused Scott of plugging low wages in the context of the radio ad and trips to California, even though he’s never explicitly said it. Here’s an example editorial from the Palm Beach Post. "Gov. Rick Scott has spent the week on another job poaching expedition, this time in California. The prowling governor aimed to entice employers to move their companies to the Sunshine State. His pitch: Wages are low in Florida." This isn’t the first time we’ve looked at this argument. Scott has openly tried to steal jobs from other states for years. In 2016, then-U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham accused Scott of going "around the country" and bragging about Florida’s low wages to other states. Florida’s wages in 2016 were low by national standards, but it didn’t appear Scott boasted (at least publicly) about this fact while recruiting businesses from other states. When we reviewed Scott’s statements from these recruiting missions, we found he did focus quite a bit on the state’s low taxes for businesses. He never explicitly advertised it like Graham, and now Levine, said. "By raising the minimum wage in California, 700,000 people are going to lose their jobs, there are a lot of opportunities for companies to prosper in Florida and compete here, and that's what I'm going after," Scott said on his three-day tour. By the way, PolitiFact Florida previously researched whether California stood to lose 700,000 jobs because of the wage increase and rated the statement Mostly False. We learned the figure was a projection of how many jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn’t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Our ruling Levine said Scott has run ads bragging about Florida’s minimum wage, which is currently $8.10 an hour. The closest example is Enterprise Florida’s California radio ad, which is critical of California’s $15 minimum wage but never explicitly brags or talks about Florida’s minimum wage. Levine put words in Scott's mouth, when at most there is an implication. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-00889	"The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over." Hillary Clinton's "the only one who’s done it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/08/charles-schumer/fact-checking-chuck-schumers-defense-hillary-clint/	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton didn’t appear on the Sunday political talk shows to explain her use of a private email account to conduct State Department business. But Democrats were out in force to defend her as proxies. For example, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., appeared March 8 on CBS’ Face the Nation to throw cold water on accusations of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton. "The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and she’s the only one who’s done it," Schumer said. We decided to dig into Schumer’s claim. Spokesman Matt House said Schumer was referring to an October 2014 letter from the State Department to former secretaries of states. The letter has not been publicly published but its contents were outlined by State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf to the media last week. Harf said the letter was part of a routine effort to update record preservation and asked former secretaries to turn over emails containing state work conducted on personal accounts. A couple months after the request, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and documents from a personal email account created on a self-operated server, according to the New York Times and the State Department. Clinton has since requested (via Twitter) for those emails to be released. It’s not as though the letter went out to living secretaries of state dating back to Henry Kissinger. While it may be hard to remember a time before email, only four former secretaries have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. As it is, the State Department query was limited to just those four individuals. Two of those individuals haven’t provided personal emails for good reason: They didn’t use email much during their time at the State Department. According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she "did not use email while she was in office" from 1997 to 2001. Similarly, Rice, head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. As Harf noted in a State Department briefing, "Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email," and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC, "She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary." Essentially, two of the four former officials contacted didn’t turn any emails over because they didn’t have any to turn over. That’s pretty important context. And what about Powell, who served as Secretary of State during President George W. Bush’s first term? Powell appeared on ABC’s This Week to answers those questions. Apparently, Powell can’t turn over any documents. Why? Because he doesn’t have them anymore. "I retained none of those e-mails and we are working with the State Department to see if there's anything else they want to discuss with me about those emails," he said. "I did not keep a cache of them. I did not print them off," he added. "I do not have thousands of pages somewhere in my personal files." Harf acknowledged in a March 4 briefing that Powell's "account has been closed for a number of years," and said, "He’s looking to see if there’s anything responsive he still has." You can draw your own conclusions about Powell not saving official emails from a 10-year-old account, and the relevance of that revelation to the Clinton controversy. Powell said most of his important correspondence would have been archived already, since they were sent to staff who had State Department accounts. But it does shed light on why Powell didn’t provide emails to the State Department, and it also demonstrates that he has taken steps to comply with the request, even if only recently. So to recap: The State Department reached out to four former secretaries asking about personal email accounts. Two have said they rarely used email, the third used personal email but had no records to turn over and the fourth was Clinton. That makes Schumer’s defense fairly hollow when you think about it. Clinton may have been the "only" person to provide emails, but realistically, that’s from a potential pool of two people. We took all this back to Schumer’s spokesman House. He stood by the comment. "There is another person (Powell) who specifically said he had emailed in a way that would be relevant to their request, but did not keep records so wouldn't be able to comply," House said. "So she's the only one to do what State is asking." Our ruling Schumer said, "The State Department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over, and (Clinton is) the only one who’s done it." That statement is much more grandiose than the reality of the situation. The State Department asked four former secretaries of state for any official business conducted on personal emails. Two of those individuals, Albright and Rice, rarely used email at all while in office, let alone on a personal account. The other, Powell, has said his personal emails no longer exist, but said he is working with the State Department to recover them, if possible. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Correction: Clinton turned over 55,000 pages and documents from her private email account. A previous version of this fact-check described the number incorrectly.

pomt-06078	"I delivered a flat tax for my state. I took my state to No. 1 in job creation. With all due respect to what Rick Perry has said about Texas, we did a little bit better."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/jon-huntsman/huntsman-repeats-claim-he-signed-flat-tax-led-nati/	During the Jan. 7, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., Jon Huntsman touted his achievements on both tax policy and job creation during his tenure as governor of Utah. "I put bold proposals forward," he said. "I delivered a flat tax for my state. I took my state to No. 1 in job creation, with all due respect to what Rick Perry has said about Texas, we did a little bit better." We have rated both claims previously. We’ll recap those analyses here. The flat tax When we first reported this item, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports from spring of 2011 and from 2007 that explained how he began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005. "We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states," Huntsman said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005. Huntsman and the Legislature achieved that goal with two changes in tax law over two years. When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent. This created a much flatter tax, stripping away most deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bonds or deducting withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts. The research arm of the Utah Legislature says this was not a flat tax in the purest sense. "Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (In a progressive tax system, the tax rate on the last dollar of income earned rises as you go up the income scale, meaning that richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than do poorer people.) Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit on state taxes a portion of their federal tax deductions and exemptions. The credit phases out and goes away for those making very high incomes in the state. This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis. "There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study. Anti-tax groups have given Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax. The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some "minor blemishes"' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.) So the system he and the Legislature enacted in Utah wasn’t a pure flat tax, since taxpayers may still make adjustments for certain financial factors, but it is a flatter tax, and it includes one major defining factor of a flat tax, a single rate for all income groups. Job creation When we asked the Huntsman campaign in September for data to back up the claim, they directed us to a blog post at National Review Online, the website of the well-known conservative magazine. The item, posted June 20, 2011, compared employment statistics for several governors. At PolitiFact, we always double-check data in media reports against official statistics, so we did so here. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment statistics. We looked at the Current Employment Statistics database for each of the 50 states and subtracted the number of jobs in January 2005 from the number in August 2009. As it happens, this period was split between an expansion (2005 through 2007) and a deep recession (2008 and 2009), so a majority of states actually lost jobs over that period. Utah was not one of the job-losing states -- but it also wasn’t No. 1 in the nation, according to this set of statistics. The states with the fastest employment growth over the period when Huntsman was governor were Wyoming, with a 9.5 increase; North Dakota, with 7.5 percent; Texas, with 6.5 percent; and Utah, with 4.8 percent. This would suggest that Huntsman’s Utah actually trailed Perry’s Texas, earning it a False. But that’s not the whole story. When we showed our math to the Huntsman camp, they stood by their numbers. They sent us to a page for the state of Utah on the BLS website that backed up the claim Huntsman made during the debate -- the number of jobs in Utah rose by 5.9 percent over the period. Using the equivalent pages for the other three states, we found that Utah exceeded them all -- Texas grew by 4.9 percent, as Huntsman indicated, while Wyoming grew by 4 percent and North Dakota grew by 3 percent. Using these figures, Huntsman was correct. So what gives? When we checked with the BLS, a spokesman explained that the way we calculated the numbers and the way the Huntsman camp calculated the numbers are different because the numbers come from different data sets. The data we used come from the Current Employment Statistics, a monthly study of the payroll data at 400,000 businesses, whereas the Huntsman campaign was using data from the Current Population Survey, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households. Is one of these data set preferred in this context? The BLS’s answer is yes -- and the preferred method is not the one used by the Huntsman campaign. "BLS uses changes in the payroll survey to describe job gain or loss," said spokesman Gary Steinberg. We’ll note one additional factor. For claims like these, where elected officials suggest that they deserve credit for an achievement (or that their opponent deserves blame for a failure), PolitiFact attempts to determine whether the politician in question does in fact deserve credit or blame. In the case of job creation, Huntsman, as governor, played some role, but there were so many other factors at play -- from the state of the national economy to the particular climate for specific industrial sectors in the state to broader demographic trends -- that we think it’s a stretch for Huntsman to claim a significant share of the credit. That’s particularly because he credited just one portion of his efforts in office, the tax overhaul, with the job-creation numbers. Our ruling Huntsman didn’t create a pure flat tax in Utah, but he did create a flatter one. As for jobs, the Utah economy did well, but it did not outpace Texas in job creation using the yardstick most economists -- and the Bureau of Labor Statistics itself -- use. We also don’t think it’s valid for Huntsman to claim as much credit as he does for himself and his tax changes for the jobs numbers. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-13529	Both the Democratic and Republican candidates for president in 2016 are "quite unpopular."	true	/georgia/statements/2016/aug/31/jimmy-carter/carter-correct-popularity-clinton-and-trump/	Presidential elections are a sophisticated and very expensive form of the old popularity contest. And in the 2016 contest the two main candidates are not all that popular. That according to former Democratic President Jimmy Carter. The 91-year-old Carter told an Associated Press reporter in Memphis, where the Nobel Peace Prize winner was helping build a Habitat for Humanity house, that he will be voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton. "Everybody knows that I’m a Democrat and I’ll be voting Democratic," Carter said. But then he took a bit of a political shot. "It’s been an exciting and unprecedented kind of campaign this year, and unfortunately, the way it’s turned out, both choices in the major parties are quite unpopular," Carter said. "But I don’t have any doubt that one of the candidates is better qualified than the other." PolitiFact decided to take a deeper look at Carter’s "quite unpopular" comment with two months to go until the Nov. 8 election. As it turns out, there’s plenty of numbers out there on the subject. And most of them back up Carter. In political parlance, a candidate’s popularity is measured in what are known as "favorables" and "unfavorables." Negative ratings are know as unfavorables while their positive ratings are labeled favorables. Real Clear Politics, a nonpartisan online site that compiles and averages polls and surveys about the major candidates and major races, keeps tabs on Clinton’s and Trump’s favorable-unfavorable rating. The RCP’s most recent average of seven polls has Hillary Clinton at 53 percent unfavorable to 41 percent favorable and Trump at 62 percent unfavorable to 34 percent favorable. Those are striking numbers, say some political experts. "Since the advent of modern polling I don't think we've encountered a situation where both major party candidates had an unfavorable rating that exceeded 50 to 60 percent," said Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta. An August poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found Clinton’s and Trump’s unfavorable ratings tied at 58 percent in the Peach State. Clinton’s favorables in Georgia were a bit higher than Trump’s: 40 percent to 36 percent. Some of the polls drill down into what’s behind the low favorable ratings. An Aug. 8 poll by Bloomberg found that only 41 percent of respondents found Clinton trustworthy while 39 percent found Trump to be so. An Aug. 4 ABC/Washington Post poll put those numbers at 49 percent for Clinton and 40 percent for Trump When asked in the ABC poll: Do you think Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy?, 59 percent said "no" and 38 percent said "yes." When the same question was asked about Trump, 62 percent said "no" and 34 percent said "yes." University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said Carter’s comments are on target. "Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have low favorability ratings, and they are viewed by large majorities as being dishonest and untrustworthy," Sabato said. "It is notable that, just as many Republicans are declaring backing for ‘the nominee’ without mentioning Trump’s name, Carter is doing essentially the same thing for his party’s standard-bearer." Carter’s tepid endorsement of Clinton during his Memphis visit was followed up this week with a warmer embrace of his fellow Democrat. Clinton supporters across the country Tuesday were greeted by an email from the former Georgia governor asking them to pitch in to help elect Clinton in November. Our ruling Former President Jimmy Carter said both major candidates for president in 2016 are "quite unpopular." Carter’s view is backed up by poll after poll, including one in Georgia that reflected much the same disatisfaction as the national polls.

pomt-03536	"Ronald Reagan’s signature on the 1986 amnesty act" gave Barack Obama about 15 million additional Hispanic votes in 2012.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/29/steve-king/steve-king-says-ronald-reagans-1986-amnesty-act-le/	During a House floor speech, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, expressed frustration that one of his conservative heroes, President Ronald Reagan, had signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, a 1986 law that gave legal status to many illegal immigrants who were then residing in the United States. King is a leading congressional critic of efforts to legalize undocumented immigrants. "Ronald Reagan’s signature on the 1986 amnesty act brought about Barack Obama’s election," King said in the May 23, 2013, speech. King’s point was that a side effect of the 1986 law was to boost the numbers of Hispanic voters -- so many Hispanics were made legal by the law, he argues, that the number exceeded Obama’s margin of victory. In his speech, King didn’t say explicitly whether he meant Obama’s initial victory in 2008 or his 2012 re-election, but he did refer to the election in which Hispanics supported Obama by a 71 percent margin, which was the percentage in 2012. So we will look at the 2012 contest. In addition, we will look at Obama’s raw-vote margin, since King didn’t mention in his speech that he was referring to Obama’s margin in the Electoral College, and his office didn’t offer that as an argument when we conferred with them as we reported this story. King laid out a clear mathematical roadmap in his speech. King said that 3 million people "received amnesty" under the 1986 law. To that number, he added an additional five people for each newly legalized person, to reflect those legalized under family reunification policies. That means an additional 15 million people. If 71 percent of the combined 18 million Americans voted for Obama, King argued, then Obama benefited from nearly 13 million votes due to the act -- a number that’s a lot bigger than his margin over Mitt Romney of 4.7 million votes. The gap is large enough to cushion any decline due to deaths and departures among 1986 amnesty recipients, something King suggested was a reasonable adjustment to make. "Ronald Reagan’s signature on the 1986 amnesty act brought about Barack Obama’s election," King said. "If ... we take 15 million people out of the rolls and say they wouldn’t have been here without the 1986 amnesty act, or at least they wouldn’t be voting, and if 71 percent of them voted for Barack Obama, then it’s clear to anybody that can do any kind of statistical analysis that Barack Obama wouldn’t be President of the United States without Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty act." So, case closed? No. After sifting the data and checking with experts in immigration, demography and voting, we find King’s estimate too high. This is an oversimplification on several fronts. For starters, King didn’t account for the fact that many of the newly legal residents did not become citizens, and thus never earned the right to cast a vote. He also didn’t account for the low rates of voting participation among Hispanics who do have the right to vote. And most important, King’s estimate of five family members receiving legal status for every case of amnesty under the 1986 law is wildly high. Here’s our best attempt at a calculation: • The best estimates show that 2.7 million people received permanent residency in the United States as a result of the 1986 law. That’s slightly lower than the number King settled on, but not dramatically so. • It’s trickier to determine how many additional people these 2.7 million immigrants brought in through family provisions, but with expert assistance, we made some estimates. The best time span to look at is 1992 to 2012, since 1992 is when the immigrants legalized due to the 1986 law would have had their first opportunity to bring in relatives. According to Department of Homeland Security statistics, 12.2 million immigrants were given permanent legal status between 1992 and 2012 for family reasons. So right off the bat, King can’t possibly be right that the 1986 law led to 15 million family members being made legal. Moreover, it’s extremely unlikely that anything approaching 12.2 million family members were made legal as a result of the 1986 act, since legalizations from the 1986 act account for a small percentage of all legalizations since 1992. Specifically, the U.S. added 19 million new legal permanent residents between 1992 and 2012, of which 2.7 million -- or just 14 percent -- were made under the 1986 act. It’s hard to know whether 14 percent is the right number to use in our estimate, but it seems to be a reasonable starting point. And 14 percent of the 12.2 million family-related legalizations works out to 1.71 million stemming from the 1986 law. This means that every person who got amnesty from the 1986 law didn’t secure legal status for five more people, as King said. On average, each of them secured legal status for less than one additional person. A spokeswoman for King provided us with a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that opposes looser rules for immigration, that expresses skepticism about the design and consequences of the 1986 law. However, this group estimated that only 743,000 people became legal for family reasons after the 1986 law -- an amount substantially lower than our estimate. So, using our estimate, here’s the subtotal so far: If you add 2.7 million and 1.71 million, you get 4.41 million additional permanent residents due to the 1986 law. • About 90 percent of immigrants legalized by the 1986 law were Hispanic. Subtotal: About 4 million of the newly legalized immigrants were Hispanic. • Only about 45 percent of those legalized by the 1986 law had become U.S. citizens by 2009. It’s now a few years later, so we’ll assume that by 2012 that rate has grown to 50 percent: Subtotal: About 2 million of the newly legalized immigrants were Hispanic and eligible to vote. • Some of the immigrants legalized by the 1986 law died in the interim. There are no good estimates for this factor, but normal death rates over a 20-year period would suggest perhaps a 10 percent decline due to death since the first amnesties were granted. Subtotal: 1.8 million of the newly legalized immigrants were Hispanic, eligible to vote, alive and living in the United States. • Among Hispanic citizens at least 18 years of age, only about 48 percent voted in 2012. Subtotal: 864,000 newly legalized immigrants who were Hispanic and eligible to vote actually did vote. • Hispanics voted for Obama at a 71 percent rate in 2012. Total: Using these calculations, we estimate that 613,440 Hispanic immigrants legalized due to the 1986 law voted for Obama in 2012. That’s far less than Obama’s 4.7 million vote margin that year. In fact, this sliver of the electorate counted for just 13 percent of Obama’s margin of victory. Just to be certain, we also did an alternative calculation. This calculation shows an even lower number. According to the Census Bureau, 3.1 million Hispanic voters in 2012 were immigrants. Let’s assume, using our number from above, that 14 percent of them (or 434,000) were legalized by the 1986 act. If 71 percent voted for Obama, then he would have received about 308,000 votes as a result of the 1986 act. This is even further below King’s estimate. In a statement to PolitiFact, King's office said, "My point all along has been that Republicans should not be fooled into thinking that enacting another, much larger, amnesty will help advance the Republican Party. Open-borders Republicans can not disagree with my analysis of the 2012 election results because if they do they are refuting their own argument that the Hispanic vote is key." Our ruling King said that when Reagan signed the 1986 act, he prompted such a growth in the Hispanic electorate that it accounted for Obama’s margin of victory in 2012. It’s no secret that long-term growth in the Hispanic population -- stemming from overall immigration policies, higher birth rates and other factors -- has aided Obama’s electoral prospects. However, very little of this growth stems from the law Reagan signed, and King’s estimate of the number of family members indirectly legalized by the law is far too high. The actual impact from the 1986 act is far more modest, adding potentially between 300,000 and 600,000 votes for Obama, rather than 4.7 million. We rate King’s claim False.

pomt-12448	Says a federal program that collects reported side-effects of vaccinations doesn’t accept possible outcomes extending to road accidents, heart attacks or suicides.	false	/texas/statements/2017/may/11/bill-zedler/bill-zedler-insists-program-doesnt-collect-wide-ra/	Addressing a physician during testimony about Texas laws affecting vaccinations, state Rep. Bill Zedler said a federal program that gathers reports of vaccination side-effects doesn’t draw in all kinds of outcomes. The Houston physician disputed Zedler on that, leading us to roll out the Truth-O-Meter. We heard about the pair’s vigorous public back and forth from Jason Sabo, a lobbyist for the Immunization Partnership, a Katy-based nonprofit focused on eradicating vaccine-preventable diseases. Sabo emailed us a web link to a video excerpt from the April 25, 2017, hearing of the House Public Health Committee on House Bill 1124, which would make it easier for parents to opt children out of having immunizations required to attend public schools. The video initially shows Lindy McGee, a physician at Texas Children’s Hospital, opposing the measure on behalf of herself and the partnership. Zedler, R-Arlington, then pressed McGee about his conclusion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database that more people have died from the measles vaccination than from measles, a claim he repeated in our May 2017 follow-up interview with him (there’s a fact-check in the works). At the hearing, McGee replied that the database, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or VAERS, doesn’t "report causality. People report to that system what they’ve seen. So I can report if I get hit by a truck after I’ve gotten a vaccine and that would be reported as associated with a vaccine. It does not make any implication of causality. That’s just the way it is." McGee went on: "So that is just everyone reporting any time they’ve had an adverse event, any time within a certain amount of period from having a vaccine. It does not make any implications about causality. That’s the way it’s set up." The parry-and-thrust went on: Zedler: "So in other words, all you’ve got to do is just think it could be." McGee: "Yes. That’s exactly what it is. So I could break my arm the next day and I can report that to that reporting system. And I want the reporting system, it’s meant to be set up that way because that’s how we can figure out if vaccines cause injury." Zedler: "No, no, no, no, are you going to tell me that if somebody got a vaccine, and within hours to days had died, that it’s not due to the vaccine?" McGee: "It’s not necessarily due to the vaccine, no, absolutely not. I could have a vaccine and I could get hit by a truck tomorrow and die. I could have a vaccine and I could commit suicide tomorrow and die. I could have a vaccine and have a heart attack tomorrow." Zedler: "Whoa, stop, stop. Nobody puts that down." McGee: "Yes, they do." Zedler: "No, they don’t." McGee: "Yes, they do." Zedler: "Let me tell you, that is patently false and you know it." McGee: "It’s not. You can look at it. You can look at the reports." Zedler: "So they put on there and they say, oh, just any death, and we don’t have to prove causality?" McGee: "Yes. It’s not a system to prove causality. It’s a system to track data and then the physicians or researchers at the CDC go and determine causality after that. It is not a system that could determine causality, it’s not." Zedler said a moment later: "For you to get up and tell this committee that in essence they can put anything down there they want is quite a dishonest." McGee: "No, you can. You can report anything you want to." Zedler: "Well, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I don’t buy that. And you know what? For you to tell this committee that is dishonest." McGee: "I welcome committee members to look up the system." Zedler reaffirms statement We took McGee up on that, also reaching out to the CDC, also following up with Zedler, who said in an interview off the House floor that he was trying to say at the hearing that people don’t routinely report automobile accidents and the like as the result of vaccinations. "Now you might find one or two kind-of unusual ones," Zedler said of reports recorded in the VAERS (pronounced vairs). "That they were killed in an automobile accident--nonsense." Program open to reports of effects from anyone The VAERS, according to the CDC, is a national vaccine safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration that, since its launch in 1990, has collected hundreds of thousands of reports of "adverse events" that occurred after the administration of vaccines in the United States. "Anyone can file a VAERS report," CDC says, "including health care providers, manufacturers, and vaccine recipients. The majority of VAERS reports are sent in by vaccine manufacturers (37%) and health care providers (36%). The remaining reports are obtained from state immunization programs (10%), vaccine recipients (or their parent/guardians, 7%) and other sources (10%)." By email to our inquiry, CDC spokeswoman Martha Sharan stressed that the program accepts all reports without rendering judgment on clinical importance or whether a vaccine or vaccines might have caused the adverse event. Investigators focus, though, on "the reports that ‘signal’ a possible safety problem," Sharan wrote. On its website, the agency similarly says that every adverse effect recorded by the program isn’t confirmed to have resulted from a vaccine. "VAERS receives reports of many adverse events that occur after vaccination. Some occur coincidentally following vaccination, while others may be caused by vaccination," CDC says. "Studies help determine if a vaccine really caused an adverse event." Even the Hulk? Rehka Lakshmanan of the Immunization Partnership, responding to our inquiry, suggested we look up an anesthesiologist she described as having reported to the VAERS that after a vaccination, he felt like he was turning into the Hulk of Marvel Comics fame. In a July 2005 web post, Dr. James R. Laidler wrote: "The chief problem with the VAERS data is that reports can be entered by anyone and are not routinely verified. To demonstrate this, a few years ago I entered a report that an influenza vaccine had turned me into The Hulk. The report was accepted and entered into the database. "Because the reported adverse event was so… unusual," Laidler wrote, "a representative of VAERS contacted me. After a discussion of the VAERS database and its limitations, they asked for my permission to delete the record, which I granted. If I had not agreed, the record would be there still, showing that any claim can become part of the database, no matter how outrageous or improbable." We did not find primary documentation of Laidler’s described VAERS submission though he reaffirmed such actions in a phone interview. Laidler, of Portland, Ore., said he recalled submitting a report in the early 2000s stating that after a measles vaccination, his skin turned green, his muscles grew and he started having rage problems--all symptoms intended to show he was becoming the Hulk. Laidler said his greater point, in the face of others who were citing VAERS entries as an indication the measles vaccination causes autism, was that anyone may report any adverse effect of a vaccination to the program. By email, the CDC’s Sharan separately replied that the Hulk story "is true." Checking reported effects from Texas, U.S. Online, we queried the VAERS database for serious reported side-effects of vaccinations in Texas. Among 635 summarized results dating from 1990 into February 2017, we spotted one mention of suicide; after a person got a seasonal flu shot in 2013, he was diagnosed with Auto Immune Limbic Encephalitis, according to the entry, and had suicidal thoughts. We also looked for entries about car or truck accidents. According to one entry, a physician reported in 2008 that a woman who received a dose of Gardasil was subsequently "found dead in her truck from a blood clot that traveled from her legs to her lungs." Another entry says an 18-year-old woman vaccinated against meningitis "passed out while driving her car and crossed over the highway into oncoming traffic" before dying. A third entry says a woman who’d received a flu shot "passed out while driving. She required emergency abdominal exploration for bleeding" and internal injuries, the entry says. Our search yielded three reports of Texas heart attacks after vaccinations. In October 2007, an entry says, a 68-year-old man got a flu shot, then died from a heart attack by the next morning. In 2015, a person had a heart attack on the day he or she got vaccinated against pneumococcal pneumonia, subsequently spending five days in a hospital, the entry says. In May 2016, according to another entry, a 61-year-old man died after a heart attack and car accident that occurred 10 days after he got a shot. We ran a similar search for serious reported post-vaccination events nationally in the year up to March 2017. From 159 results, we identified a reported fatal heart attack reported in Indiana after a flu shot in 2016. Our ruling Zedler said a federal program that compiles reported side-effects of vaccinations doesn’t take in reports of extreme results such as road accidents, heart attacks and suicides. It looks to us, from our sampling, that some results such as suicides are rarely reported as related to vaccinations. Still, the CDC-run VAERS evidently accepts reports of all kinds of outcomes from all corners, though having a submission accepted doesn't equal federal confirmation that a vaccination caused any effects. Further investigation might. We rate Zedler's claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-02698	"Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem...can indeed renew their policies and keep their current doctors and hospitals" in 2014.	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/jan/03/carol-shea-porter/carol-shea-porter-says-people-nh-can-keep-their-cu/	It’s been four years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, but the right and left are still exchanging jabs over the perceived benefits or harm of the health care law. And there’s plenty of misinformation to go around. This time, it was a radio ad released Dec. 10 by the National Republican Congressional Committee that called out Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D-N.H) for her support of law. The ad introduces an unnamed family whose insurance plan was canceled, and the sick husband can’t go to his doctors because their new plan doesn’t offer access to the same doctors and hospitals. Shea-Porter swiftly called the ad false in a statement to media. "Washington Republicans should take down their misleading attack ads and stop frightening Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem, because they can indeed renew their policies and keep their current doctors and hospitals," she said. The statement went on to say that the congresswoman had already worked with Anthem representatives to extend the company’s renewal deadline for individual policyholders so they’d have access to same network in 2014. Shea-Porter also repeated the comment about individuals having access to the same doctors and hospitals next year in a press release a few days later. We’ve checked several versions of the "if you like your policy, you can keep it" statement from a variety of sources. But we wondered whether individual policyholders in New Hampshire would have access to the same doctors and hospitals next year, especially in light of an Anthem announcement in September that individuals on the state’s new marketplace would have access to only 16 of the state’s 26 hospitals. A Brief Background President Obama promised many times when promoting his new health care law that policyholders who liked their insurance plans wouldn’t have to change. Old plans were supposed to be protected through a system called grandfathering, basically allowing plans to continue as long as they met certain requirements. Those rules were so strict, though, that very few plans could meet them. And so Obama’s promise came back to bite him when an estimated 4 million cancellation letters went out earlier this fall. For damage control, in November the White House announced that insurance providers and state insurance commissioners could extend current plans, even if they didn’t meet the minimum requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The situation in New Hampshire In the following weeks, New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner Roger Sevigny was one of several state commissioners who said the state would allow renewal of non-compliant plans. But for Granite Staters with individually purchased insurance plans, renewal was already an option. Under New Hampshire law, policyholders are allowed to renew an existing policy earlier than its anniversary date. Anthem publicized this option in a release the day after Obama’s announcement, saying the company had sent notices to individual policyholders to remind them of this choice. "We wanted to underscore that our previously announced early renewal option, which has proven to be very popular among our members, already gives individual policyholders who wish to keep their existing policy a way to do so," Lisa Guertin, president of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield in New Hampshire, said in the release. Anthem is by far the predominant insurance company in New Hampshire. It’s the only company participating in the state’s marketplace in 2014 and holds about 30,000 individual policies in the state. Other companies hold around 1,000, according to the N.H. Insurance Department. The NRCC ad that Shea-Porter was responding to said that one-third of the state’s hospitals weren’t covered under the Affordable Care Act. That’s true in a sense -- Anthem’s individual plans for sale on the state’s new insurance marketplace offer a "narrow network" that excludes 10 of the state’s 26 hospitals. Yet a company spokesman confirmed that those who renewed their existing plans before the deadline would have access to the same network of providers, including those 10 hospitals, for 12 more months. At the end of November, the insurance company extended its deadline for the early renewal option for a second time, giving policyholders until Dec. 16 to renew their canceled plans. That would have given them a policy year of Dec. 1, 2013, to Nov. 30, 2014. Our Ruling Shea-Porter said in December that in 2014 "Granite Staters who hold individual policies from Anthem… can indeed renew their policies and keep their doctors and hospitals." New Hampshire policyholders were always able to extend their current policies 12 months, thanks to the state’s early renewal option. Anthem will not extend canceled policies after its Dec. 16 deadline, despite the White House allowing extensions until October 2014. That means that Shea-Porter’s statement was accurate when she said it, though it no longer applies today, since the renewal deadline has passed. But individual policyholders did have a chance to keep their same network of hospitals and doctors next year. Not everyone may have done so, which means some people may be forced to see other doctors at different hospitals. In New Hampshire, at least, people were given that opportunity.

pomt-01693	The Islamic State, or ISIS, was "cast off by al-Qaida because" it was "considered too extreme."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/13/david-gregory/david-gregory-al-qaida-cast-isis-too-extreme/	Multiple rounds of U.S. airstrikes rained down against militant jihadists calling themselves the Islamic State this weekend. The operation was described by President Barack Obama as humanitarian intervention against the Islamic State’s genocidal activities in Iraq -- activities that even al-Qaida consider extreme, according to MSNBC host David Gregory. On Aug. 10’s Meet the Press, Gregory discussed the airstrikes with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Gregory wondered whether the group’s rapid emergence and success could have been predicted and prevented. "This is a terror state trying to construct a caliphate, cast off by al-Qaida because this group is considered too extreme," he said. "This is a big, expansive terrorist threat that has amassed on (Obama’s) watch." We’ve heard before that the Islamic State -- which is also called ISIS -- is so extreme that even al-Qaida washed its hands of it, and we wondered if it was true. Who is the Islamic State? In February, al-Qaida’s central command formally severed ties with ISIS, as it was known then. Al-Qaida said in an Internet statement that ISIS "is not a branch of the al-Qaida group (and) does not have an organizational relationship with it and (al-Qaida) is not the group responsible for their actions," reported the Washington Post. So the Islamic State certainly was cast off by al-Qaida. But was the disownment due to the Islamic State’s extreme actions, as Gregory suggests? Experts told us not entirely. To really understand the break-up, they said, we have to go back to the beginning of the Islamic State. 2003: A militant group known as JTJ ("Group for Monotheism and Holy War" ) under the leadership of extremist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi bombs the United Nations Headquarters in Baghdad, killing 34. 2004: The JTJ pledges its allegiance to Osama bin Laden, and is now known as al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI). 2006: Zarqawi is killed in an airstrike. AQI is rebranded again as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). 2010: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is named leader of ISI, after his predecessor is killed in an American and Iraqi raid. 2013: Baghdadi claims that the active Syrian jihadist group, al-Nusra Front, is "an extension of the Islamic State in Iraq and part of it," and the two groups should be considered one, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). ISIS begins to rapidly advance in Syria and Iraq. 2014: Al-Qaida central command dissolves its relationship with ISIS in February. Four months later, ISIS announces the establishment of a caliphate and changes its name to the Islamic State. The evolution of names of the Islamic State shows an evolution in their ambitions, and an expansion of their brand from an al-Qaida terror arm to an established insurgent army with territorial holds fighting on two fronts, said Austin Long, a security policy professor at Columbia University. And the Islamic State has now positioned itself as a more appealing alternative to its former parent al-Qaida for would-be jihadists. "They’re not going to seek a reconciliation with al-Qaida, because why should they?" Long said. "They can say to their recruits, ‘You could be suicide bomber or you can join a legitimate army that’s establishing a caliphate.’ That’s a big selling point." Too extreme for al-Qaida? The differences between the Islamic State and al-Qaida are more deep-rooted than their current standing in the hierarchy of terror groups. But to categorize the Islamic State as "too extreme" isn’t quite accurate. In terms of fundamentalism, the Islamic State’s enforcement of Sharia law is certainly "the most traditional of the traditional" if not down-right draconian, said Colin Clarke, a terrorism expert at the think tank RAND. But, according to Long, al-Qaida just hasn’t had the opportunity to the do the same. As for brutality of actions, the extremism just manifests differently. Long and Clarke both pointed that al-Qaida certainly has not hesitated to kill civilians or fellow Muslims in certain contexts. The true difference between the two groups is ideological -- why and how to carry out a holy war, according to Long and William Braniff, executive director at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. The Islamic State Al-Qaida Goal Establish a caliphate Establish a caliphate through incremental steps (first, drive the West out of the Middle East) Purpose of violence To purify Islam, ignite a civil war To awaken the masses Method Mobilizing against "the near enemy" Mobilizing against the West Source: Interviews with Long and Braniff Al-Qaida certainly has objected to the Islamic State’s sometimes anti-Muslim tactics since at least 2006, but the concerns were less about ethics and more about strategy. Al-Qaida’s current leader Ayman al-Zawahiri reprimanded the Islamic State, then al-Qaida in Iraq, in a letter that warns AQI against focusing on the wrong enemy and losing Muslim support. "The Muslim populace who love and support you will never find palatable ... the scenes of slaughtering the hostages," Zawahiri wrote. "Is the opening of another front now in addition to the front against the Americans and the government a wise decision? Or does this conflict with Shia lift the burden from the Americans by diverting the mujahedeen to the Shia, while the Americans continue to control matters from afar?" Why was it disowned? The idea that the Islamic State was cast off by al-Qaida because of its brutality is "a bit of a misnomer," Clarke said. "Really the splintering emerged from a command and control problem." Though al-Qaida’s central command has limited control over its affiliates, the Islamic State has actively disobeyed orders from headquarters. And its activities threaten the legitimacy of al-Qaida’s presence in the Middle East, while its conflicts with other terrorist affiliates were seen as destabilizing, Braniff said. The biggest fallout was in 2013, when Baghdadi declared the establishment of ISIS, incorporating Syrian jihadist group Nusra Front without the consent of Nusra, experts agreed. Tensions metastasized when Nusra objected to this merge, and al-Qaida central had to step in. Al-Qaida’s Zawahiri scolded Baghdadi for declaring ISIS without asking or even talking to al-Qaida, and ruled that the two groups would be separate and confined to their respective countries-- Nusra in Syria, ISI in Iraq. Baghdadi said, no, ISIS would stay as ISIS. This feud with Nusra sowed the seeds for al-Qaida’s rejection of ISIS and siding with Nusra. By 2014, ISIS was continuing its violent tactics. What’s more, it was fighting with Nusra and other rebel groups actively. Al-Qaida had had enough. "It’s true that ISIS is more brutal than al-Qaida would like, and al-Qaida had told them repeatedly to cool it with the killing of the shiites. But the problem really was that al-Qaida had been saying, ‘Hey stop this,’ and (ISIS) was not listening," Clarke said. The ruling Gregory said, the Islamic State was "cast off by al-Qaida because this group is considered too extreme." The Islamic State certainly was cast-off by al-Qaida, but to say it was because the Islamic State is "considered too extreme" is a bit of an oversimplification. While it is true that al-Qaida considered some of the Islamic State’s actions unnecessarily brutal, there were a couple of other reasons for the fallout. The Islamic State’s ideological differences with the al-Qaida brand and its constant failure to obey orders from headquarters had been sawing away its ties to al-Qaida for quite some time. In-fighting with Nusra in Syria and continued killing of fellow Muslims were the final straws. In short, shorthanding the Islamic State as too extreme leaves out the nuances behind the split. We rate Gregory’s claim Mostly True.	None	David Gregory	None	None	None	2014-08-13T12:07:30	2014-08-10	['None']
pomt-03298	The minimum wage is "lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/31/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-minimum-wage-pays-less-now-when-/	President Barack Obama has been talking a lot recently about the need to raise the minimum wage, particularly during a series of speeches on the economy. And when he does so, Obama almost always invokes President Ronald Reagan, an icon for conservatives. Obama said, "We need to raise the minimum wage, because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office," Obama said in a speech at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., on July 24, 2013. Obama has used almost the same exact talking point on a number of other occasions, including a speech in Chattanooga, Tenn., and various position papers. We were curious about two things. Is Obama right on the statistics? And is Obama’s attempt to link Reagan to a policy of maintaining a generous minimum wage an accurate historical portrayal? We should start by noting that the minimum wage, as written into law, is higher now than it was when Reagan took office in 1981 -- since 2009, it’s been $7.25 an hour, compared to $3.35 in 1981. However, Obama was clearly referring to the inflation-adjusted minimum-wage rate. Here’s a summary of changes in the inflation-adjusted minimum wage during Reagan’s tenure. We calculated it using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator. Year Minimum wage Wage in 2013 dollars 1981 $3.35 $8.61 1982 $3.35 $8.11 1983 $3.35 $7.85 1984 $3.35 $7.53 1985 $3.35 $7.27 1986 $3.35 $7.14 1987 $3.35 $6.89 1988 $3.35 $6.61 1989 $3.35 $6.31 2013 $7.25 $7.25 So, Obama has a point when he says the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was higher when Reagan entered office than it is now. But that’s not the whole story. Over Reagan’s entire tenure, the minimum wage slowly eroded. In Reagan’s fifth year in office, it was almost identical to what it is today in terms of purchasing power. By Reagan’s sixth year as president, it dropped below today’s rate when adjusted for inflation. And by the time he left office, the minimum wage had fallen a full 13 percent below its level today. There’s a reason for this: Reagan never presided over a minimum wage increase during his term in office. In fact, he was the only president never to oversee a boost the minimum wage since it was signed into law in 1938 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Democratic presidents weren’t the only ones to back minimum-wage increases. The minimum wage went up three times during the brief presidency of Gerald Ford, and each of Reagan’s fellow Republicans presided over at least one increase, including George W. Bush in 2007 and 2008. Reagan was the only exception. Our ruling When Obama said the minimum wage is "lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office," he offered a carefully worded statement that is accurate when considering inflation. However, his invocation of Reagan rings hollow, since the late president was hardly a model for Obama’s approach to the minimum wage. Reagan was the only president not to preside over an increase in the minimum wage, and by the end of his term, the wage was 13 percent lower than it is now. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-07-31T17:00:40	2013-07-24	['None']
pomt-00475	Says Rick Scott "cut $700 million from water management."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/aug/14/florida-democratic-party/yes-rick-scott-did-cut-700-million-floridas-water-/	Did Florida Gov. Rick Scott slash funding for the state’s water management oversight? That’s what a recent tweet by the Florida Democratic Party claimed. "Rolled back safeguards and septic-tank inspections. Cut $700 million from water management. Appointed cronies who act on behalf of polluters. Banned the term ‘climate change.’" "This water crisis has a name, and it’s Rick Scott," it concludes. Scott, who is term-limited as governor, is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We’ve taken a look at some claims regarding Scott’s record on the environment before. With fears about algae blooms and red tide recently hitting the headlines, we were especially curious if Scott had actually "cut $700 million from water management." Scott did cut $700 million in funding from water management in 2011. He also implemented changes to how water management districts are funded that affect their finances in the long-term. Counting up the cuts We began by reaching out to the Florida Democratic Party about its evidence for the claim. A party spokesperson sent us a 2018 Miami Herald column by Fabiola Santiago blaming Scott for dirty beaches, as well as a Palm Beach Post news article from 2011, near the end of Scott’s first year in office. That Palm Beach Post story begins with the line, "The state's five water management districts have slashed their budgets by more than $700 million -- about 40 percent -- but Gov. Rick Scott, who initiated the cuts, wants a little more." The state’s five districts have a variety of responsibilities, from water supply and quality management to flood and natural systems management. All five districts release their budgets on their websites annually. The districts release data for each financial year, which runs from Oct. 1 of the previous year to Sept. 30 of the named year. The first budgets that Scott had a say in came in the 2012 fiscal year, from Oct. 1, 2011, to Sept. 30, 2012. From the 2011 to 2012 fiscal years, the budgets of all five districts were cut across the board. The South Florida district suffered the most in cuts. Its FY 2011 budget was $1.07 billion while its FY 2012 budget was $576.1 million. That’s a reduction of $493.9 million, or 49 percent. Meanwhile, the Southwest Florida district’s budget was slashed by $124.3 million in FY 2012. Combined with the $13.9 million, $35 million, and $14 million cuts to the budgets of the Suwannee River district, St. Johns River district, and Northwest Florida district, respectively, those numbers add up to just over the $700 million. However, since 2012, the overall budget of the five districts has risen by almost $300 million. So the difference between pre-Scott cut budgets and the current budgets is now not $700 million, but rather closer to $400 million. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Whose responsibility is it, anyway? We reached out to Scott’s press secretary for comment. Lauren Schenone told PolitiFact, "Water management districts independently create their own budgets. Their budgetary decisions, including tax and revenue collection, are ultimately made by the board of each water management district — not the governor, so they are completely wrong on this." Districts do begin the budget process themselves by creating a preliminary budget independently of the governor. But their budgets pass through a complex adoption process. They need to eventually be approved by many groups, including the Florida Senate president, the Florida House speaker, and each water management district’s governing board, whose members are appointed by the governor. According to section 373.536(5)(a) of the Florida Statutes, the governor has the final say "to approve or disapprove water management district budgets in whole or in part." So if the governor doesn’t like a specific item in a district’s budget, he or she can veto it. Scott has claimed responsibility for the water management district budget cuts in the past, such as in this radio address from August 2011. "I took action on the proposed budgets of Florida’s five water management districts," Scott said. "All together, these budgets reflect a reduction of more than $700 million over last year." Scott also restricted how much revenue districts could collect. A large part of district budgets comes from revenue collected through property taxes. In 2011, Scott signed a bill into law that placed a limit on the maximum amount of property tax the districts could levy. That bill lowered district property tax revenues by 30 percent, or $210 million. "Those (property tax) revenues have not been restored to their pre-Gov. Scott levels," said Aliki Moncrief, executive director of Florida Conservation Voters. "Assuming the taxable value of Florida property stayed the same from 2011-2019, we are talking about at least $1.7 billion in lost revenue for water management districts (over the course of eight years)." Scott took responsibility for those revenue cuts, too. In a June 2011 press release, he said, "This property tax cut allows families and businesses to use more of their hard-earned money in the way they see best, rather than having to send it to a government agency." Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party tweeted that Scott "cut $700 million from water management." The budgets of Florida’s five water management districts were collectively cut by over $700 million about a year into Scott’s first term. Since the governor has the final say over the water management districts’ budgets, the tweet is largely accurate. However, in the years since 2012, the districts’ budgets have started to rise again. The overall budget of the five districts is no longer $700 million less than the pre-Scott budget. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-08216	The radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners is "equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/18/john-pistole/tsa-administrator-claims-new-body-scanners-emit-mu/	New airport security measures are coming under fire from pilots and passengers, who fear the latest post-9/11 protocols are too invasive and potentially harmful. You've probably seen the stories. The Transportation Security Administration's new full-body scanners, which are in use at 68 airports nationwide, transfer a potentially harmful amount of radiation and produce what amounts to a naked image, critics say. And the alternative to the scan, an embarrassing pat down, may be even worse. Pilots' unions oppose the measures, as do an increasing number of passengers -- who feel the federal government has taken things too far. PolitiFact can't weigh in on that. But we can explore the safety concerns about the full-body scan. Particularly, we found worth analyzing the defense mounted by John Pistole, head of the TSA. During a Nov. 16, 2010, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Pistole said the "radiation coming from those machines are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet." The TSA, on its website, says the radiation emitted from the body scan is equivalent to just two minutes of a plane flight. Are those claims credible? Yes. Though there is some disagreement. Let us explain. In preparing to deploy the scanners to airports across the country, the TSA studied the amount of radiation a person would be exposed to per scan to determine if the machines were safe. Scientists at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory found that the effective dose per screening was 1.58 microrems of radiation, while a researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said an adult would be exposed to 2.4 microrems of radiation per scan. We understand those figures mean nothing to most people. So let's put it into perspective. A single chest X-ray exposes a person to between 8,000 and 10,000 microrems (or 8 to 10 millirems), according to experts at Princeton University and the Department of Energy. A pack-a-day smoker exposes himself to 15,000 to 20,000 microrems of radiation a year (tobacco leaves used in making cigarettes contain radioactive lead and polonium). Put simply, it would take at least 3,300 body scans to reach the equivalent of one chest X-ray. What's also important to note -- and a bit scary -- is that you're being exposed to radiation right now. Radiation is naturally occurring in our environment no matter where you are. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission estimates that each year, the average adult is exposed to 300 millirems of naturally occurring radiation (300,000 microrems) and 60 millirems (60,000 microrems) of man-made radiation. Pistole, in his claim, is talking about naturally occurring cosmic radiation you're exposed to during airplane travel. The amount of cosmic radiation a person is exposed to varies based on a number of factors, but to oversimplify, a key component is how high you are above sea level. People living in Denver, which is 1 mile above sea level, are exposed to more cosmic radiation than someone living in Florida. And people flying 30,000 feet in the air are exposed to more radiation than people on the ground. The amount of radiation varies depending upon the specific flight plan, but the Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organization and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission all say that a person on a six- to eight-hour flight will be exposed to somewhere around 2,000 to 5,000 microrems of radiation. For our analysis, however, we are relying on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which calculates the radiation exposure per hour based on the altitude of the flight. According to NOAA, a person flying at 30,000 feet will be exposed to between 285 and 406 microrems of radiation an hour, or between 4.75 and 6.77 microrems per minute of flight. All the numbers and science back up Pistole's claim -- as little as three minutes of air travel produces the equivalent amount of radiation as one TSA body scan. By most estimates, Pistole's claim actually is conservative. However, all scientists aren't sold on the comparison. Nor are they sold on the safety of the scanners. We think it's important for you hear their side, too. Four faculty members at the University of California, San Francisco, authored a letter in April expressing their concerns about the body scanning devices. Primarily, the professors worried that the radiation was being concentrated in the skin and underlying tissue, and that it was not being dispersed throughout the entire body. That concentration of radiation to the skin could be "dangerously high," wrote the faculty members -- John Sedat, Marc Shuman, Robert Stroud and David Agard, who said a comparison to cosmic radiation spread over the entire body is misleading. The FDA, in a detailed response, said the concerns were unfounded, and health risks associated with the full body scanners were "minuscule." To be clear, this fact check isn't declaring TSA's new full-body scanners safe. We're simply looking at the comparative exposure to radiation as suggested by Pistole, who said that the radiation coming from the new TSA body scanners "are equivalent to about three minutes' worth of air travel by anybody, say, at 30,000 feet." It may sound strange, but it's right. We rate this statement True.	None	John Pistole	None	None	None	2010-11-18T14:46:55	2010-11-16	['None']

pomt-04411	Says Patrick Murphy is trying to "hide his drunken assault of a police officer."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/16/allen-west/allen-west-attacks-patrick-murphy-drunken-assault-/	Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West of South Florida says his opponent, Democrat Patrick Murphy, has criticized West’s military career to cover-up his own brawl with the law -- literally, a brawl with a police officer. In the ad, called "Ashamed," the narrator says: "First, Patrick Murphy called a man who has fought to defend our country a coward. Then Murphy hid behind his father in attacks that were called racist and disgusting." The ad then airs TV media quotes stating that the attacks on West were a ‘low blow,’ ‘disgusting’ and displayed ‘racial stereotypes.’ The ad then shows photos of West in his Army fatigues with fellow soldiers. "Now Murphy is questioning the actions of a soldier in combat fighting to protect his men. Why? To hide his drunken assault of a police officer." The ad shows a copy of a 2003 police report and a dour mug shot of Murphy. Here we will fact-check whether Murphy engaged in a "drunken assault of a police officer." We will also explain if he tried to "hide" that incident and briefly touch on some of the other claims in the ad. Murphy’s 2003 arrest West’s campaign sent us a copy of the police report of the Feb. 16, 2003, incident. At the time, Murphy was a 19-year-old college freshman at the University of Miami. The narrative in the hand-written police report is somewhat difficult to decipher, but it says that Murphy and a friend were fighting and disrupting others at a Miami Beach bar, Club Crobar, and escorted out by security. The two men had been drinking, were "soaking wet" from alcohol and had "eyes bloodshot, slurring speech." An officer asked Murphy for his I.D., but Murphy refused to turn over the fake New Jersey driver’s license. The report noted that "defendant continued to act disorderly" and wasn’t listening to the officer’s directions to step away and calm down. "Defendant refused shouting ‘(expletive) you,’’’ and was arrested, the report stated. Murphy then made "false allegations" that he was mistreated, the officer wrote. To be clear, we saw no evidence in the officer’s narrative or court records that Murphy physically assaulted a police officer. Court case dropped The criminal case was filed on Feb. 17, 2003 -- one day after the incident, online Miami-Dade court records show. Murphy was charged with felony possession of a stolen driver’s license. He entered a plea of "not guilty" Feb. 26, and the criminal case was closed March 10 with a charge transferred to traffic court. Court records also list "misdemeanor disorderly intoxication" based on the arrest report, but court records show "no action" on this count and he wasn’t charged for that by prosecutors. The charge transferred to traffic court for altering a driver’s license was dismissed by the state attorney’s office in June 2003. The online record doesn’t explain the reason for the dismissal. Did Murphy ‘hide’ his assault Murphy was clearly arrested but not convicted of the driver’s license charge. And prosecutors never charged him with assault. But did he try to "hide" it? Murphy campaign consultant Eric Johnson said Murphy didn’t try to get the record expunged and has discussed it with reporters for several months. The Palm Beach Post wrote in June that it found the arrest in state records and asked Murphy about it. "I was a teenager and I got in trouble with a fake I.D.,and I was under-age drinking and, look, biggest learning experience of my life, never had a run-in with the police since. I'm sorry it ever happened. ... It's nothing I can hide from," Murphy told the Post. We asked West campaign manager Tim Edson if West had any proof that the assault was physical or that Murphy tried to hide it. "Our campaign never said there was a physical assault. Call it what you will, but Patrick Murphy’s campaign was trying to distract from, hide or obscure his drunken verbal assault on a police officer with a false attack ad on Allen West’s military record...," Edson responded in an email. "It is clear that Murphy verbally assaulted a police officer." The other claims in the ad There are some other interesting claims in the ad that we are not going to factor into our ruling but we will provide a little background: • West said that Murphy "called a man who has fought to defend our country a coward." Murphy called West a "coward" for switching districts after redistricting made his current district more liberal. "Allen West went from talking tough this weekend and telling progressives to ‘get the hell out of this country’ to abandoning the people who elected him. There is no other way to interpret this: Allen West is a coward," a Murphy press release stated in January 2012. • "Murphy hid behind his father in attacks that were called racist and disgusting." Murphy’s dad formed a political action committee,which aired an ad depicting a caricature of West, a black congressman, in boxing gloves punching an old white woman, a younger white woman and grabbing money from a black family. The ad was intended to depict West socking it to constituents over Medicare, health care and tax cuts. West and his supporters argued the ad was racist, but the NAACP disagreed. (A Palm Beach Post editorial said the ad wasn’t racist but criticized Murphy for saying he had nothing to do with an ad created by his father.) Our ruling West’s ad says that opponent Murphy is trying to hide his "drunken assault of a police officer." Murphy was arrested for disorderly intoxication and possession of a stolen driver’s license. But West omits several facts about the incident. Most importantly, we saw no evidence in the officer’s narrative or court records that Murphy physically assaulted a police officer. A viewer hearing that phrase could easily misinterpret it to mean a physical assault. Murphy wasn’t convicted -- a charge was quickly transferred to traffic court and dismissed within months. It’s also worth noting that this was almost a decade ago,when Murphy was 19. We found no proof that Murphy has tried to "hide" his arrest. Sure, he’s not highlighting it, but he has answered reporters’ questions about it for months. There is some truth here: Murphy was arrested while drunk and disrespected a police officer. But saying that he was hiding a drunken assault of a police officer is significantly overstating it. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11236	"President Trump is still supported by almost 85 percent of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio, and that's from recent polling, and still has a 58 percent approval rating in Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/may/04/jim-renacci/following-trump-endorsement-jim-renacci-cites-poll/	Following an endorsement for Senate from President Donald Trump, U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci said Trump continues to have strong support in Ohio, particularly among Republicans. "President Trump is still supported by almost 85 percent of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio and -- and that's from recent polling -- and still has a 58 percent approval rating in Ohio," Renacci said in a radio interview with Bob Frantz April 25. Renacci’s chief rival in the May 8 primary is businessman Mike Gibbons. The winner will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in November. How Ohio voters feel about Trump heading into the midterms is of national interest following Trump’s 8-percentage point win over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Former President Barack Obama had won the state twice. While polling has come under suspicion since the election, Renacci is citing valid polls. However, he used a national poll to draw conclusions about Ohio GOP voters, something pollsters say isn’t a great practice. Multiple polls show Trump continues to have strong GOP support, but he has much less support among voters in general. Renacci’s claim that Trump has 58 percent overall support is probably too high. Polls in Ohio For Renacci’s claim that Trump had 85 percent approval among Republicans in Ohio, his campaign spokesman referred to a national CNN-SSRS poll. A December poll of 1,000 adults showed that 85 percent of Republicans had a favorable opinion of Trump. The poll showed that when both major parties as well as independents are included, 36 percent had a favorable opinion of Trump. The margin of sampling error was 3.6 percent. A couple of polling experts we interviewed took issue with Renacci using a national poll to express support by Ohio Republicans, although they noted polls show Trump has strong support among Ohio Republicans. When Renacci referred to Trump’s 58 percent approval rating, that came from a poll specifically of Ohio registered voters. Renacci’s campaign spokesman cited an online poll of registered voters by Axios/SurveyMonkey done in February and March. The poll of 1,995 registered voters in Ohio showed overall, 54 percent of Ohio registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling his job as president. Among Republicans and independents who lean Republican, 93 percent approved. The survey’s modeled error estimate is 4.5 percent -- so that’s why Renacci cited 58 percent. We looked at two additional polls of Ohio Republicans this year -- Fallon Research on behalf of a GOP advocacy group, and SurveyUSA on behalf of a TV station -- that showed 75 percent approval for Trump. But polls consistently show far less approval when taking into account voters of both major parties and independents. Gallup’s daily tracking found in 2017 that overall in Ohio, Trump had 45 percent approval. SurveyUSA found 41 percent overall approval. A pro-Renacci group, the Ohio First PAC, found Trump’s approval among likely voters was 58 percent in April. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said it’s best to look at averages. "I think the Renacci team is on solid ground suggesting an approval rating for Trump in the 80s for Republicans in Ohio, but I think 58 percent overall is probably unrealistically high," he said. Trump performed better in Ohio (51 percent) than he did nationally (46 percent), so it stands to reason that his approval in Ohio would be higher than it is nationally, Kondik said. "If the national average is around 41 or 42 percent, I’d think that probably means Trump is in the mid-to-high 40s in Ohio," Kondik said. "That’s about where I think it probably is." University of Cincinnati associate professor of political science professor Steve Mockabee said that the 58 percent struck him as a little high. Jennifer Duffy, who covers Senate rates for the Cook Political Report, said Trump's support among Republicans in Ohio is pretty solid and that 85 percent is in the ballpark. "It is not something that should concern Republicans," she said. The polling showing 58 percent among all registered voters is largely based on a turnout model and could be entirely correct for that model and not overstated, she said. "The larger question is whether that model bears any resemblance to actual 2018 turnout," she said. Ohio State University political science professor Vladimir Kogan said that whether someone identifies as a Republican can change over time, partly in response to Trump approval. He pointed to a 2017 working paper by the Emory University political scientists B. Pablo Montagnes, Zachary Peskowitz and Joshua McCrain, who argued that Republicans who disapprove of Trump stop identifying as Republicans. While Renacci made this claim in the context of a GOP primary, the bigger question is how the battleground state will vote in November. While Clinton was unpopular in Ohio, Brown has a long track record of winning statewide races. "I’m not convinced yet that just following a Trump playbook is going to result in a win," Mockabee said. Our ruling Renacci said, "President Trump is still supported by almost 85 percent of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio -- and that's from recent polling -- and still has a 58 percent approval rating in Ohio." While Renacci referred to 85 percent of Ohio Republicans, the CNN/SSRS poll his campaign cited from December 2017 was of national Republicans. However, Trump fared better in Ohio than the nation in 2016, so it’s not surprising that his support would be high in the state. A couple of other polls we found had Ohio GOP support slightly less at 75 percent. The part of his statement about the 58 percent approval overall refers to an Axios/SurveyMonkey poll. It showed 54 percent of Ohio registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling his job as president. By using the survey’s modeled error estimate of 4.5 percent Renacci gets to the 58 percent. A couple of polling experts said this sounds high. Overall support for Trump in Ohio is likely less than Renacci said. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06602	Toledo Mayor "Mike Bell (once) lost his job as a firefighter because his city ran out of money."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/23/building-better-ohio/building-better-ohio-says-toledo-once-laid-now-may/	Toledo Mayor Mike Bell appears in a TV commercial endorsing Issue 2, the November voter referendum on Senate Bill 5. The ad was made and paid for by Building a Better Ohio, the largely business and Republican-backed political action committee supporting SB 5, the law passed earlier this year that restricts the collective bargaining power of Ohio's public unions. Bell, who was elected as an independent in 2009, talks in the ad about his support for Issue 2 because it will give communities tools to help control spending and balance budgets without laying off workers or raising taxes. He starts the discussion saying: "Years ago, I lost my job as a firefighter because my city ran out of money." Building a Better Ohio adopts Bell’s statement as its own on its website. PolitiFact Ohio took notice. Bell's record and experience make him worth listening to. A firefighter and certified paramedic who went on the job in 1980, he became Toledo's youngest-ever and first African American fire chief in 1990, and held the post for more than 16 years. After he retired, then-Gov. Ted Strickland appointed him State Fire Marshal. The commercial also stirred our curiosity. Did Bell really lose his job in a budget crunch and was it at all related to labor issues? So PolitiFact Ohio looked deeper into the record. Bell was one of 61 Toledo firefighters and 240 total city workers laid off in a budget crisis in 1980, not long after he went on the job. Three fire stations were closed. But that happened more than three years before the state's current collective bargaining law took effect, so PolitiFact Ohio wondered what relevance SB 5 would have -- a question also raised by unions in Toledo. According to accounts in The Toledo Blade, the 1980 layoffs followed a 1979 impasse in negotiations between the city and unions (after the final offer of a three-year contract including 2, 1.5 and 1 percent pay raises) that led to a strike by municipal employees, including police and firefighters -- even though the Ferguson Act prohibited strikes by public employees in Ohio and provided for dismissal of strikers. "What ensued," The Blade reported, "was a 48-hour gap in public safety that allowed mayhem to rule the streets." Residents armed themselves, and "countless" fires were set. The budget crisis was not resolved until voters in 1982 approved a "temporary" increase in the income tax, which has been renewed ever since. Retired Ohio Supreme Court Justice Andy Douglas was a Toledo councilman helping a bipartisan campaign to pass the tax increase in 1982, and he helped negotiate new safety contracts about two years ago. He told The Blade that Toledo's current budget problems, struggling to afford labor contracts with safety forces, mirror those of 1982. "The only difference is the magnitude of the number in present-day dollars," he said. "We had exactly the same problems two or three times during my tenure in council." In the ad, Bell says he knows Issue 2 "will give communities the tools they need to get spending under control and balance their budgets without raising taxes on you or laying off good employees." PolitiFact Ohio isn’t rating that part of Bell’s statement today. Whether SB 5 is the answer remains hotly debated and we are not examining its merits or flaws. But the claim that Bell was once laid off as a firefighter is accurate. And it is true that his layoff followed an impasse in labor talks with city workers and a strike. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim about Bell in Building a Better Ohio’s rates True.	None	Building a Better Ohio	None	None	None	2011-09-23T06:00:00	2011-09-06	['None']
pomt-06566	"President Obama has declared disasters in 48 of 50 states this year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/30/harry-reid/president-obama-has-declared-disasters-how-many-st/	To hear Harry Reid talk about the Federal Emergency Management Agency, you'd think the entire nation is one big disaster area. The Senate Democratic leader spoke on the Senate floor on Sept. 26, 2011, arguing for House Republicans to break a deadlock and approve a bill funding the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The standoff was part of another fight that threatened, briefly, to shut down the federal government. That has been averted for now with an emergency spending bill. In arguing for passage of the FEMA funding, though, Reid insisted the money was necessary, given how many disasters have plagued the country this year: "The legislation also includes $3.65 billion in funding for FEMA, which will give American communities ravaged by floods, wildfires and tornadoes the help they need. We know House Republicans support that funding level as well, since they voted for it last week. Democrats would have given FEMA more, since President Obama has declared disasters in 48 of 50 states this year." Forty-eight of 50 is, well, a heck of a lot of disasters. Has the nation suffered that much? FEMA’s website tracks all disaster declarations, listing them by state, by year and even by type of disaster. The federal declaration is a formal process, usually on the heels of a state's own emergency declaration, that triggers federal money to repair things such as hospitals, schools and city halls. It also pays for small business loans and provides assistance to individual households in the form of crisis counseling, legal services and even rent money for people who have been displaced. According to FEMA’s website, 42 states had federally declared disasters in 2011. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Irene alone accounted for disaster declarations in 11 states in August and September. Oregon saw mudslides and landslides in February and a tsunami wave surge in March. Tornadoes struck Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia in April. Wildfires first triggered federal help in Texas in July. Another four states -- Florida, Arizona, Colorado and Reid’s home state of Nevada -- received a Fire Assistance Management declaration to deal with wildfires, and Delaware had one emergency declaration for Hurricane Irene. The emergency declaration also takes a president’s pen, but it doesn’t give federal money directly to individuals. FEMA lists three states -- Michigan, South Carolina and West Virginia -- with no declarations of any type. Our ruling Reid said, "President Obama has declared disasters in 48 of 50 states this year." He's right that a large majority of states have had those declarations, but he overstates the number. We counted 42 states with presidential federal disaster declarations, plus one with the lesser emergency declaration and four that received only help for fires. But the fire aid isn’t a presidential declaration and Delaware was an emergency, not a disaster, so they shouldn’t count in Reid's tally. That means the number is 42 -- not 48 as Reid said. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2011-09-30T15:33:42	2011-09-26	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-00678	On reauthorization of Export-Import Bank.	full flop	/texas/statements/2015/may/07/rick-perry/rick-perry-flip-flops-support-export-import-bank/	In 2014, Rick Perry urged Congress to keep afloat the federal Export-Import Bank. In May 2015, he said let it die. Cue the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter. Perry in 2014 As noted in a June 27, 2014, Dallas Morning News blog post, Perry sent a letter to congressional leaders that month urging them to continue the bank, which was then set to lose its authorization unless members embraced President Barack Obama’s request to extend it. The News’ story pointed out that Republicans were divided on reauthorization: Some seeking to limit the government’s role in the economy on ideological grounds were pitted against those who sought to preserve programs they said help grow the economy. The story quoted Barney Keller of the conservative Club for Growth group saying that like the Small Business Administration and its loans to small businesses, the bank inserts the government into the economy in ways it shouldn’t. "The Ex-Im Bank is corporate welfare, simple as that," he said. "It should be eliminated." In contrast, the story said, supporters of reauthorization maintained that ending the bank would put large U.S. exporters, especially, at a disadvantage with their foreign counterparts. The bank says its mission is to "ensure that U.S. companies — large and small — have access to the financing they need to turn export opportunities into sales. Ex-Im Bank does not compete with private institutions," the bank says, going on: "We fill gaps in the trade finance market by working with lenders and brokers to ensure that U.S. businesses get what they need to sell abroad and be competitive in international markets." Perry said in his June 25, 2014, letter to Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate that as governor of "America’s leading exporting state I encourage you to reauthorize" the bank. "I understand some are concerned about this bank, but if there are ways to improve the program by making it more transparent, I would encourage you to do so as part of the reauthorization," Perry wrote. "To unilaterally disarm by not reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank puts American companies at a disadvantage in their ability to compete in the global marketplace, will cost jobs and will drive up prices for American-made goods," Perry said. Perry in 2015 Nearly a year later, Perry swiveled. In an op-ed column published by the Wall Street Journal, which came to our attention in a May 5, 2015, Texas Tribune news story, Perry said he "can't get on board" with reauthorizing the charter for the 80-year-old bank. The bank was set to shutter if Congress didn’t reauthorize it by July 2015. Perry's piece--headlined: "Why I’m Changing My Mind and Opposing the Ex-Im Bank"--credited the bank with playing a role in igniting the Texas economy in his time as governor. Since 2007, he wrote, more than 1,200 Texas companies had obtained help from Ex-Im in financing more than $24 billion in exports. Perry also recalled his gubernatorial concern about unilateral disarmament, economically speaking, but then went on to say he could no longer back the bank out of concern for "revelations of corruption and bribery at the institution" involving an official pleading guilty to accepting bribes, among factors. He also questioned the bank subsidizing exports by big corporations. "We won’t have the moral credibility to reduce corporate taxes if we continue to subsidize corporate exports for corporations that already enjoy low effective tax rates, like General Electric and Boeing," Perry wrote. "We won’t have the moral credibility to reform government programs that benefit future retirees if we don’t first reform government programs that benefit big businesses like Caterpillar. We won’t be able to give businesses more regulatory latitude if we continue to operate a government bank with an emerging record of corporate corruption." Perry closed: "We could pair Ex-Im’s retirement with corporate tax reform—a more effective way to improve the competitiveness of U.S. companies. We should work with our partners in the World Trade Organization to roll back the use of export-import banks by other countries, so that American exporters don’t face an unfair playing field." We emailed aides to Perry about his shift and didn't hear back. Our ruling Full change in position? On the Flip-O-Meter, that’s a FULL FLOP!

Andrew M. Cuomo called public housing in New York City "disgusting" when he visited a unit earlier this month. He blamed the New York City Housing Authority for neglecting maintenance on the aging system, which houses one of every 14 city residents. The state has done its part by footing part of the bill, Cuomo said. "The only housing authority in the state that we have actually given money to is NYCHA," Cuomo said. There are about 160 housing authorities in the state. New York City’s authority provides housing to more than 147,000 families, more than any other authority. Most authorities receive almost all of their funding from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Is Cuomo right that the state doesn’t give any money to housing authorities outside New York City? In the budget A state Division of Budget spokesperson, on behalf of the Cuomo administration, defended the governor's statement, saying the New York City Housing Authority is the only housing authority in the state to have a direct funding line in the state budget. State lawmakers approved $100 million for the authority in 2015 to replace roofs across the public housing system over a three-year period. Also, $200 million was approved in last year’s state budget for more roof maintenance and other repairs, like new boilers. Cuomo has recently proposed an additional $250 million for NYCHA in this year’s budget. Other housing authorities have access to state funds, but they have to either apply for funding from a statewide program or compete for grants. "The governor is correct that the only housing authority that got direct grants to their housing authority was NYCHA," said William Simmons, president of the New York State Public Housing Authority Directors Association, which represents the majority of housing authorities in the state. "Any dollars that go toward housing authorities in upstate New York, these are dollars that they compete for or apply for. It’s not a direct allocation," Simmons continued. Other funds Authorities can compete for funds from the Public Housing Preservation Program. The program awards funds to improve the long-term sustainability of existing public housing units. Authorities compete for the money through a bidding process with New York State Homes and Community Renewal, the state housing agency. Six authorities have received a total of $125 million from this program in the past two state budgets. Authorities can also apply for funding from the Public Housing Modernization Program. The money is used by housing developments where rental income and other funding isn’t enough to pay for regular maintenance. About $6.4 million goes to 13 state-supervised public housing authorities in New York state each year through this program, according to the Division of Budget. State tax credits are also available for authorities that develop public housing for low-income residents. Our ruling "The only housing authority in the state that we have actually given money to is NYCHA," Cuomo said. The New York City Housing Authority is the only public housing agency that has a line item in the budget. But other housing authorities have received money from the state through competitive grant programs. So the New York City Housing Authority is not the only housing authority to receive money from the state. We rate Cuomo's statement False.

pomt-01006	"Every year in the United States between 3,000 and 4,500 severe vaccine reactions are reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Not mild reactions. Severe reactions that land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/03/bob-sears/what-cdc-statistics-say-about-vaccine-illnesses-in/	In a debate on CNN, a pediatrician who lends a sympathetic ear to the anti-vaccine movement described what he said was one of the risks of vaccinating children. "Every year in the United States between 3,000 and 4,500 severe vaccine reactions are reported to the Centers for Disease Control," Dr. Bob Sears told CNN’s Don Lemon. "Not mild reactions. Severe reactions that land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death." We decided to fact-check Sears’ claim that between 3,000 and 4,500 people report severe vaccine reactions that "land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death." What the CDC says, and doesn’t say The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does maintain a database of reported cases of adverse reactions to vaccines. It’s called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS for short. The system allows almost anyone -- from a doctor to a nurse to a pharmacist to a patient or parent -- to enter in any information about illnesses or medical issues that follow someone receiving a vaccine. The information is collected so that officials can spot possible trends or side effects related to particular vaccines. Before we show you the numbers for 2014, we’ll give you the same warning the CDC provides any user. It’s a warning Sears failed to present CNN viewers. "When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event." We’ll say that again in our own words. There’s no proof that a vaccine caused any of the medical conditions reported in the database. That colors Sears’ statement significantly. "There’s absolutely no linkage between cause and effect," Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, told us. "If I received the flu vaccine yesterday and got hit by a bus today, I could enter that into VAERS. But I doubt anyone would say the vaccine caused the accident. VAERS is a great reporting system to look for trends that would trigger further studies – but it does not pretend to prove that the conditions entered are related to vaccination." Now back to the numbers. Sears specifically mentioned three outcomes that he described as "severe vaccine reactions" -- hospitalization, permanent disability, or death. (There is no category to report someone being sent to an "intensive care unit," nor is there a searchable category for "severe vaccine reactions.") We looked at 2014 VEARS data, which covers reports processed as of Dec. 14, 2014. VAERS data shows (as of Feb. 3, 2015): 1,244 cases of people reported hospitalized 416 cases of people reporting a disability 122 reported deaths 388 reported life-threatening cases That’s a total of 2,170 events, but once you factor out double and sometimes triple counting -- meaning a reported death could also could include a reported disability or hospitalization -- you drop to a total of 1,737 cases. (The numbers change slightly depending on how you run the search. We searched when cases were reported. Since the database is a living document, the numbers may also shift if you choose to run this calculation yourself.) On the flip side, the 2014 count is only through Dec. 14, meaning that additional cases likely will be reported before the CDC closes out the year. Sears’ defense We presented our findings to Sears, who said he approached his calculation in a more generic way. He said he looked at VAERS in December 2009. "At that time, the site reported the number of severe reactions each year going back many years. It averaged out at about 30,000 total reactions reported yearly, and the site stated that between 10 percent and 15 percent of these were serious. That's how I get the number 3,000 to 4,500," Sears said. "Now, that fluctuates every year. Some years are lower, some higher," Sears said. "You looked at 2014 data, which looks to be about 1,750. That's a low year." Here, Sears has a point. In fact, the CDC website does still include a general description that matches what Sears told us. "Approximately 30,000 VAERS reports are filed annually, with 10-15% classified as serious (resulting in permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illnesses or death)," the CDC says. But that didn’t amount to 3,500-4,000 cases in 2014, nor any year we searched as far back as 2006. Sears is correct that 2014 appears to be a low year. Year Cases of reported hospitalization, disability, deaths or life-threatening illness 2014 1,737 2013 1,837 2012 1,934 2011 2,045 2010 2,570 2009 2,701 2008 2,465 2007 2,289 2006 1,477 Other data on vaccine injuries As we’ve written, the major flaw in the VAERS data is that it does not prove a link between the vaccine and an illness. One area where we get closer to finding a causal link is through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The program, created on Oct. 1, 1988, was set up to help compensate victims found to be injured by certain vaccines. The program is funded by a $0.75 excise tax on vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for routine administration to children, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. According to Health and Human Services, 3,887 compensation awards have been paid since the first claims were filed in 1989. Another 9,860 claims were dismissed. A total of 633 petitions were filed seeking payment in fiscal year 2014. Petitions peaked in fiscal year 2003 when 2,592 claims were filed. This data is far from perfect. But what it shows is that in the last 25 years, the fund has paid out claims to 3,887 people -- which translates to an average of 155 paid claims per year. Health and Human Services cautions that settlements do not indicate safety concerns about the vaccine alleged to cause the injury. "Settlements are not an admission by the United States or the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the vaccine caused the petitioner’s alleged injuries," officials write. "The vaccine compensation program ... provides a bit more linkage between cause and effect, but the rulings are decided in a court of law, and science may or may not play a big role in the finding," Troisi told us. "It’s also very hard to prove cause and effect on an individual case, which is what is happening with these findings." Our ruling Sears said, "Every year in the United States between 3,000 and 4,500 severe vaccine reactions are reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Not mild reactions. Severe reactions that land somebody in the hospital, the intensive care unit or cause a permanent disability or death." Sears reached this conclusion by doing some math based on data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But, at the least, he would have been better off sticking with the CDC’s general claim that 10 percent to 15 percent of reported reactions are deemed serious. The fact is, the CDC’s database includes a clear warning that the there is no evidence the reported cases are related to vaccines. Nor do the specific years we looked at -- going back to 2006 -- back up Sears’ specific range. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, which is our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-11760	"Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/05/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-hillary-clinton-lied-f/	President Donald Trump claimed former rival Hillary Clinton and former top adviser Michael Flynn suffered vastly different consequences even though both "lied" to the FBI. "Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they've destroyed his life. I think it's a shame," Trump said Dec. 4 before boarding Marine One for a trip to Utah. Trump recalled the summer of the 2016 presidential campaign, when the FBI probed Clinton’s use of private email while secretary of state. "Hillary Clinton, on the Fourth of July weekend, went to the FBI, not under oath. It was the most incredible thing anyone's ever seen. She lied many times, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and it's like they ruined his life. It’s very unfair." In an earlier tweet on the topic, he posed a question: "Rigged system, or just a double standard?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Flynn, Trump’s former National Security Adviser, pleaded guilty on Dec. 1 to misleading the FBI about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn also said he’s cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential campaign and Trump campaign contacts with Russians. Did Clinton lie many times to the FBI, as Trump claimed? The head of the FBI at the time — James Comey — told Congress there was "no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI." The White House did not provide material to support Trump’s claim. Let's revisit the recent history books. Clinton exclusively used personal email when she was secretary of state between 2009 and 2013, the New York Times revealed, choosing to rely on two email servers in the basement of her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Clinton repeatedly claimed she did not have any classified emails on her server from time at the State Department, but an FBI investigation found some classified information ended up on her private server, which was an unclassified system. Comey said in July 2016 that there was not enough evidence to charge her with a crime, and he urged the Justice Department not to prosecute Clinton because there was not enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information with her "extremely careless" email setup. (We covered the Clinton email scandal and related claims.) Trump referred to her communication with the FBI "on the Fourth of July weekend" during the campaign. There is no transcript of the interview that FBI agents had with with Clinton on July 2, 2016, about her email usage in what her campaign described as a "voluntary interview." Comey was not present for the discussion. But he spoke for the agency five days later when House members quizzed him about what happened in a hearing. Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., explicitly asked Comey if Clinton lied to the FBI in that interview. Comey’s response: "I have no basis for concluding that she was untruthful with us." During a line of questioning with then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., Comey reiterated, "We do not have a basis for concluding she lied to the FBI." Here’s another exchange with then-Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in which Comey repeatedly said he was not aware of any FBI case in which Clinton lied. Chaffetz: "So Hillary Clinton did come to possess documents and materials that contained classified information via e-mail on these unsecured servers is that correct?" Comey: "That is correct." Chaffetz: "Did Hillary Clinton lie?" Comey: "To the FBI? We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI." Chaffetz: "Did she lie to the public?" Comey: "That's a question I'm not qualified to answer. I can speak about what she said to the FBI." Chaffetz: "Did she -- did Hillary Clinton lie under oath?" Comey: "Not to the FBI. Not in a case we're working." The distinction between what Clinton told the FBI and what she told the public is important. Clinton earned a Pants on Fire for claiming that, regarding the presence of classified information in her email, "Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people." That was a rosy review of reality. Comey had specifically sidestepped whether she provided accurate information to the public. In particular, Clinton said there wasn’t any classified information in her email in media interviews, and Comey said there was. However, Trump’s charge said Clinton lied to the FBI, and the agency has made no such claim. Our ruling Trump said, "Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI." We at PolitiFact don't know exactly what Clinton told FBI investigators. We also know, however, that Trump failed to back up his allegation. Former FBI director Comey in congressional testimony said there was no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-02898	With a bill bringing $100 million in property tax relief, "the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680 over four years."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/07/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-typical-wisconsin-homeowner-/	After Republican Gov. Scott Walker proposed a $100 million measure that state officials said would shrink property tax bills by $33 over two years, top Democrats said it was too little bang for the buck. Walker painted a much different picture when communicating with Wisconsin residents Oct. 25, 2013 through his regular email newsletter. "This week, I signed a bill bringing $100 million in property tax relief to Wisconsin’s families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses," Walker’s e-update said. "With this bill, the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680 over four years." A recipient of the governor’s email wrote us saying he had tried in vain to find fiscal estimates that back up Walker’s claim and asking us to investigate. So we did. This turns on a commonly used benchmark: The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau’s annual estimates of the size of the property tax bill for the owner of a property at the median value statewide. For example, under the policies in the 2013-’15 state budget, that tax bill was estimated at $2,974 on a $151,000 home. We wondered: Since the fiscal bureau’s official savings forecast is the aforementioned $33 over two years, where does the governor’s claim of $680 come from? Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster told us it’s from a hypothetical scenario. The governor compared the median tax bill expected during each of his four years to what they would have looked like if one assumes the trend line from 2006 to 2010 under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle had continued into Walker’s term. (The median bill went up 8 percent in Doyle’s last term.) So, the $680 is not actual money this median taxpayer "will save" on his or her property tax bill during the Walker years. It’s based on the assumption that another governor, faced with the same deficit Walker inherited, would have continued to allow local governments to raise property taxes at that 8 percent clip over an additional four years. Maybe, but maybe not. Problems in analysis One problem with this is that Walker strongly links the $680 "savings" not to some hypothetical thing -- but to something very concrete: the $100 million relief legislation. It’s an even more bodacious claim, given that the $100 million in relief does not mean that the median tax bills will be lower in 2014 than in 2012, the period covered by the bill. That’s because the budget approved back in June resulted in a net increase (1 percent) in the projected median property tax bill over two years. The subsequent $100 million in relief trimmed the size of that increase -- but the median bill still goes up slightly. We’ve been down Hypothetical Road before with the governor. In July 2011 we rated a very similar claim False. Walker said then that under his first two-year budget, "the average property taxpayer will save $700." Not only was he comparing real results to hypothetical results, we found, there was an obvious flaw in the hypothetical scenario that puffed up things in Walker’s favor. In the current case, another problem is that Walker’s email to residents doesn’t disclose that the $680 figure is a hypothetical one. When we asked Webster about this, she expressed frustration, saying that Walker and his office had disclosed in several other venues that the $680 number is based on a hypothetical scenario and made it clear that the savings is not due just to this 2013 legislation, but also to prior actions. True, Walker did point out the hypothetical scenario at the Capitol news conference announcing the $100 million bill and displayed a large chart explaining it. Same for two news releases the office sent out presenting the $680 figure in a broader context, linking it to "property tax controls" earlier in his term. But even the governor’s press events and announcements of the $100 million relief law have reflected confusion over his message. The evidence is in the wildly divergent media coverage. A Green Bay TV station said: "Depending on the value of your home, the average homeowner will save between $13 and $20 in December and $680 over the next 4 years." A La Crosse TV station reported that Walker’s $100 million cut "will save homeowners about $680 over four years." A Milwaukee TV station said the legislation is expected to save $680 million over four years. None of those descriptions hit the mark. Four-year bottom line Walker did give one small clue in the e-update that his analysis wasn’t just on the two years covered by the $100 million legislation. Walker refers to "$680 over four years." According to Webster, the "four years" was used because the savings reference is not just to the recent legislation, but to four years of reforms and belt-tightening that included freezing or greatly restricting how much school districts and local governments could collect from local taxpayers. With that in mind, we compared the four-year change in the median property tax bill under Walker vs. Doyle. Hard numbers, not a hypothetical. The median bill was $2,963 when Walker came in, and is projected to be $2,954 in year four of his term, based on decisions already made. That’s a drop of $9, the result of three years of annual declines followed by an increase in 2014 that is projected to eat up most of the earlier cuts. By contrast, the four straight annual increases in Doyle’s last four years resulted in a net increase of $230 in the median tax bill. Our rating Walker said that with a bill bringing $100 million in property tax relief, "the typical Wisconsin homeowner will save approximately $680 over four years." The claim in an e-newsletter strongly suggests $680 in hard savings from that tax relief bill, or at the very least during Walker’s four years, but we found nothing to back up that number or anything close to it. You can only get to it using a rough hypothetical scenario based on some big assumptions, and can make a case for $239 in four-year savings compared to the four years prior to his term. But Walker’s newsletter doesn’t disclose that his number is hypothetical, misleading the reader into thinking that the median tax bill actually has dropped by $680. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06695	"I became a Republican sooner in my life than" Ronald Reagan did in his.	true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/06/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-switched-gop-younger-age-reagan/	On his Aug. 30 radio program, conservative commentator Sean Hannity noted that Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation’s 40th president. "You’re sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?" Hannity asked. Perry replied that he’d had a conversation with Reagan’s son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. "I told Michael Reagan the other day … ‘You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,’ but I said, ‘I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.’ " Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point? We’ll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that "Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican." Historian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan’s Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, "was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21." Yager said that he hadn’t seen copies of Reagan’s voter registration cards but that "virtually all the sources that refer to" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan "has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948. Later, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan’s presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 — at ages 41 and 45, respectively — and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 "while remaining a Democrat." Perry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7. The library’s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon’s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. "When he said, ‘Well, no, I haven’t yet, but I intend to,’ down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, ‘I’m a registrar,’ and placed a registration card in front of him," the site says. "In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party." In her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.'' Other studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yager’s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan "was an active Democrat" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, "and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade." In 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he "didn’t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans" and would re-register as a Republican. "He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown," Cannon writes. So, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier. How old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move? We’ve looked at Perry’s political past in previous fact-checks, reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 — a race that Perry won in an upset. The biography on Perry’s presidential campaign website agrees with that account. A July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House, Perry was far from liberal. "Perry, a young rancher and cotton farmer, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative," the story says. "He was one of a handful of freshman ‘pit bulls,’ so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low." The Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29, 1989, during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol. "I intend to vote the same convictions," Perry said then, according to the Tribune. "The only difference is there will be an ‘R’ beside my name." On the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old. We rate his statement as True.

pomt-08420	Says Tom Hughes supports paving over thousands of acres with over-development and sprawl.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/20/bob-stacey/race-metro-bob-stacey-says-tom-hughes-wants-turn-p/	Tom Hughes and Bob Stacey are both Democrats in their 60s running for president of Metro, the regional tri-county government best known for deciding what’s inside of the urban growth boundary and for running the Oregon Zoo. Hughes served as Hillsboro’s mayor from 2001 to January 2009. Stacey served as executive director of conservation group 1000 Friends of Oregon from 2002 to September 2009. Stacey’s latest TV ad flashes a picture of Tom Hughes (in a crooked collar) with this voice-over: "Bob’s opponent? Lobbyist Tom Hughes is backed by developers, because he supports paving over thousands of acres of farmland with over-development and sprawl." Then it lists a number of donations to Hughes: Metropolitan Land Group, $7,500; Maletis Brothers and Langdon Farms, $5,500; Stimson Lumber, $5,000. Woah. Parking lots instead of precious farmland? That’s bad. A lobbyist? Even worse. But wait. 1000 Friends of Oregon -- isn’t that a lobbying group? Clearly, PolitiFact Oregon needs to ferret out the truth. Hughes is in fact a business lobbyist. He works part time at the law firm Tonkon Torp LLP. "He assists the group in government relations, the development of public policy and lobbying," according to the company’s website. Guilty as charged. Before he joined Tonkon Torp early last year, he was Hillsboro’s mayor. Hughes also taught at Aloha High School for nearly 30 years. He was elected to the Hillsboro City Council in 1976, a seat he held until 2000 before segueing into the mayor’s office. Calling him a lobbyist is like identifying Bristol Palin as a ballroom dance contestant. In PolitiFact Oregon’s view, the label of professional lobbyist in this race belongs to Stacey. He has devoted a good chunk of his career at 1000 Friends of Oregon, first as a longtime staff attorney and then as executive director. In 2007 the advocacy group fought to shore up looser land-use laws approved by voters in 2004. In 2009, he was able to squelch some legislative votes for a major transportation and jobs package because 1000 Friends didn’t think the plan friendly enough to public transit and the climate. But what about the broader charge, that Hughes is determined to turn thousands of acres of beatific farmland into strip malls, new subdivisions and other supposed horrors? Stacey’s campaign points to Hughes’ contribution list, to one of his lobbying clients and to statements he has made to the press to conclude that the former mayor is indeed in bed with developers. (Developers generally want to expand the boundary so they can build more, and environmentalists want to keep it tight.) Let’s dissect. It’s true Hughes has endorsements and cash contributions from assorted groups interested in work and growth: labor unions, Realtors, business lobbies, garbage haulers and oil companies. But he also has the backing of small city mayors, Gov. Ted Kulongoski, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian and state House Speaker Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone. And Stacey’s the one with deep pockets in this race: having raised $639,000 this year compared with $408,000 for Hughes. Yamhill County vintner Eric Lemelson has given Stacey’s campaign at least $70,000. It’s true that Tonkon Torp, Hughes’ firm, represented brothers Chris and Tom Maletis in their attempt to turn farmland south of Wilsonville into urban land fit for a golf club. The effort failed. It’s true that Hughes, as mayor, signed on to a proposal to ask Metro to add 34,300 acres of new land for future houses, stores and factories in Washington County -- which is way more than the 28,000 acres eventually added for all three counties. But it’s not true that he pushed for 47,000 acres as the Stacey camp alleges -- and that’s because the county committee set to recommend a figure dropped the number from 47,000 acres to 34,300 acres in September 2009. (See nifty timeline here.) Both Hughes and Stacey support the current long-range Metro plan approved in February 2010, which adds 28,000 acres into urban reserves over the next 40 to 50 years in the three counties. That includes more than 13,000 acres for Washington County, and preserves 272,000 acres for farms and natural areas. 1000 Friends of Oregon has protested the designation as too much for industry. Hughes has stated repeatedly that he wants to keep the boundary tight. He would, however, consider a run at adding industrial land if the possible payoff was lots of jobs for people. Stacey, on the other hand, wants to focus primarily on developing urban infill that developers say isn’t easy to build on -- like brown sites. Stacey’s campaign director Brian Rae pointed to a story in The Hillsboro Argus to highlight Hughes’ pro-development stance: Still, he thinks the urban reserves designations earlier this year were too conservative — not in terms of land for jobs, but in terms of the jobs projected. "I kind of hope we don't (have enough land in urban reserves) because that projects a job growth that is not very robust," he said. Hughes is clearly talking about jobs -- not land -- as the reporter notes. PolitiFact Oregon offers another quote from Hughes, from a 2002 story by The Oregonian, in which Metro proposes adding nearly 200 acres in Hillsboro for high-tech industry. Hillsboro risks harming the regional economy if it can't provide new industrial sites, Mayor Tom Hughes said. "It has to be done carefully, it has to be done thoughtfully, and it doesn't have to be a lot of it," he said. "But it's clear from the case we've made that it has to happen." Does that sound like a man hooked on suburban sprawl? The claim that Hughes would pave over thousands of farmland with over-development and sprawl is False. Comment on this item.

pomt-12834	"Smart! 'Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-say-kuwait-followed-his-lead-vi/	President Donald Trump's favorite social media tool is Twitter. But Trump turned to Facebook recently to defend his executive order on visas and travel from seven countries. Trump’s Facebook post seemed to rally supporters around the wisdom of his executive order, which suspended entry for most foreign travelers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days. He commented, "Smart! 'Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.’ " The post linked to an article published on the English-language version of the Arabic-language website Al Bawaba on Feb. 1 that featured the headline Trump quoted in his post: But the government of Kuwait -- a small, Arab monarchy wedged between Iraq and Saudi Arabia on the Persian Gulf -- publicly rejected the notion that it had followed Trump’s lead by banning travel by Muslims. Kuwait "categorically denied media reports that it planned to stop issuing entry visas for some nationalities," read a statement from Sami Al-Hamad, Kuwait’s assistant foreign minister for consular affairs. He added that "citizens of those countries mentioned by social media visited Kuwait regularly through direct commercial flights." Other diplomats, including the Pakistani envoy in Kuwait and Kuwait’s charge d’affaires in Iran, backed up Kuwait’s statement. Kuwait’s denial was picked up by such mainstream media outlets as Reuters. But as of the afternoon of Feb. 7, Trump’s post remained up and uncorrected, as did the Al Bawaba article he had linked to. So what’s going on here? The short answer is that Trump’s Facebook post was wrong. The longer answer, however, needs to fill in some important background. (The White House did not provide PolitiFact with any backup material. Attempts to reach the Kuwaiti embassy in Washington were unsuccessful.) Travel restrictions for Kuwait happened years ago We found several news accounts from years ago that generally said Kuwait had banned visas for several Muslim countries in 2011 before easing the rules a bit in 2013. A Gulf News article dated May 22, 2011, said that "Kuwait has banned nationals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan from entering the country, local media reported. The ban includes suspending all tourism, visit and trade visas as well as visas sponsored by spouses, immigration sources said, quoted by Kuwaiti media yesterday." The article cited unnamed sources saying that the "visa ban," which was described as "temporary," stemmed from the "difficult security conditions in the five countries" and to "the remarkably increasing tendency of nationals from the five countries to apply for visas to bring in relatives who faced or could face arrest by the local authorities to Kuwait." Another Gulf News article dated July 8, 2013, noted that Yemen was later added to the visa-ban list. The 2013 article noted that in January of that year, Kuwait "eased" the ban from those six countries by allowing public-sector workers to bring their wives and children with them, and by allowing private-sector workers to bring their sons if they were under 15 years old and their daughters if they were under 18. Finally, in 2014, Kuwait eased its visa rules -- but excluded Iran, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, or Afghanistan from those expanded rules. So, while Trump was wrong to say in his Facebook post that Kuwait had followed his lead, Kuwait did have restrictions in previous years. "Historically, Kuwait has issued travel bans on certain nationalities due to specific events," said Edward W. Gnehm Jr., who studies the Gulf region at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs. He noted that Kuwait banned entry by Palestinians, Yemenis and Iraqis after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 since it considered those countries or their people to have been supportive of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. That said, Kuwait has some practical restrictions on how firmly it can crack down on travel from these countries, said Kristin Smith Diwan, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. "There are lots of Syrians living in Kuwait, and they certainly haven’t been evicted," Diwan said. "It also would have been very unpopular with Kuwaitis who had enormous sympathy for Syrians and the uprising, especially in the early part of the war." Diwan added that Kuwait "has lots of business with both Iraq and Iran," making a total ban difficult. In fact, she said, the Kuwaiti Emir recently visited Iran to explore the potential for de-escalation on behalf of Kuwait and its neighbors. Another key point is that the immigration systems of the United States and Kuwait are akin to "apples and oranges," said David Andrew Weinberg, a Gulf specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "Kuwait, unlike the United States, is not a multiethnic democracy," Weinberg said. "It is a family-ruled monarchy and ethnically-based nation that does not offer a route to citizenship to immigrants. In fact, Kuwait doesn’t even grant citizenship to enormous numbers of ‘bedoon’ individuals who have been there for generations but aren’t recognized as ‘Kuwaiti’ by the state." Estimates put the number of expatriates in Kuwait at more than 2 million, accounting for about two-thirds of the country’s population and much of its workforce. In other words, Weinberg said, Kuwait, unlike the United States, doesn’t have an immigration system for people to come and stay and become citizens. So any movement toward a stricter immigration policy would have much bigger consequences in the United States than in Kuwait. If you click through the Al Bawaba story that Trump linked to, that article sources its information to another article, from a London-based website called The New Arab. That article now includes a note at the bottom stating in part, "This article has been updated to reflect the fact that the ban came into force, unofficially, in 2011, and was not a reaction to Donald Trump's recent executive order." So the original media source that Trump’s post is based on doesn’t even stand by the message of its original headline. Our ruling On Facebook, Trump said, "Smart! 'Kuwait issues its own Trump-esque visa ban for five Muslim-majority countries.' " That’s wrong -- news coverage suggests that Kuwait implemented a visa ban on a half-dozen predominantly Muslim nations in 2011, six years before Trump took office. Meanwhile, any argument that Kuwait’s past actions indicate a like-minded approach between Trump and Kuwait sidesteps the reality that pursuing such a policy in the United States inevitably has a much bigger impact because the U.S., unlike Kuwait, allows a path to citizenship for legal immigrants.

pomt-06931	"Every president has raised the debt ceiling."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/21/richard-codey/new-jersey-sen-richard-codey-claims-every-presiden/	As President Barack Obama and Congressional Republicans wrestle over raising the nation’s debt ceiling, New Jersey Sen. Richard Codey (D-Essex) added his voice to the debate during a recent panel discussion on Fox News’ Hannity. Sitting between a conservative writer and a former Miss America, Codey joined the "The Great American Panel" on July 13 and soon found himself sparring with host Sean Hannity. Hannity began the conversation by criticizing President Barack Obama for using "seniors as a pawn in this...political chess game of his." But Codey, a former governor, told Hannity that Obama isn’t the first president to increase the federal debt limit. "But Sean, every president has raised the debt ceiling," Codey said. "George Bush did it seven times." PolitiFact New Jersey took a look at the nation’s history of borrowing money and discovered that Codey was mostly right. Since an overall limit on most federal debt was first set up in 1939, the debt ceiling went up during every presidency with the sole exception of former President Harry S. Truman’s. Codey acknowledged the minor oversight in a phone interview and said his overall message was to show that previous presidents have contributed to the debt ceiling increases. Now, let’s take a look at how we reached the current federal debt limit of nearly $14.3 trillion. A statutory limit on federal borrowing was first established with the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917, which helped finance the nation’s entry into World War I, according to the Congressional Research Service. That act allowed separate limits for different forms of debt. In 1939, Congress eliminated those separate limits and set up the first aggregate limit covering nearly all public debt. During the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the debt ceiling was raised annually between 1941 and 1945 to pay for the costs associated with World War II. The limit was increased to $65 billion in 1941. Soon after the debt limit was increased to $300 billion in April 1945, Truman became president. The debt ceiling was reduced to $275 billion in June 1946, and the Korean War was primarily financed by higher taxes, not increased debt. The debt ceiling would not increase until 1954, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president. "It just went down and stayed down," said Bill Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, referring to Truman’s presidency. But from Eisenhower to former President George W. Bush, the debt ceiling was raised during every presidency for a total of 68 times*, according to data from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Obama has raised the debt limit three times. Here’s a breakdown of debt ceiling increases before Obama by presidency: ￭ Dwight D. Eisenhower (R): 4 ￭ John F. Kennedy (D): 5 ￭ Lyndon B. Johnson (D): 7 ￭ Richard M. Nixon (R): 7 ￭ Gerald R. Ford (R): 6 ￭ Jimmy Carter (D): 6 ￭ Ronald Reagan (R): 17 ￭ George H. W. Bush (R): 5 ￭ Bill Clinton (D): 4 ￭ George W. Bush (R): 7 When Eisenhower left office, the debt limit was $293 billion. After Bush left office -- following seven increases to the debt ceiling, as Codey had said -- the limit was about $11.3 trillion. Barring significant changes to federal regulations, the amount of debt is projected to rise in the coming decade, according to the Congressional Research Service. "Unless federal policies change, Congress would repeatedly face demands to raise the debt limit to accommodate the growing federal debt in order to provide the government with the means to meet its financial obligations," according to a July 1 report from the Congressional Research Service. Asked why the debt limit has continued to increase over the past several decades, D. Andrew Austin, one of the authors of that report, said in an email: "Over time (the) federal government has spent more than it received in revenues. Unlike (the European Union’s) Stability and Growth Pact, the debt limit is a fixed number, rather than a restriction tied to the size of the national economy." Back to Codey’s statement: The former governor said during a panel discussion that "every president has raised the debt ceiling." Federal records show that since the overall limit was set up in 1939, Truman is the only president who didn’t have an increase in the debt ceiling on his watch. We rate Codey’s statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. *Editor's Note: The total of 68 times failed to include all cases where the debt limit was temporarily increased or the expiration dates for temporary increases were extended. Factoring in those other instances, the debt ceiling was increased 86 times between the presidencies of Eisenhower and George W. Bush. Here is the revised breakdown: Eisenhower, 7; Kennedy, 8; Johnson, 8; Nixon, 9; Ford, 7; Carter, 9; Reagan, 18; George H.W. Bush, 9; Clinton, 4; and George W. Bush, 7.

pomt-12407	"Last year was one of the deadliest years ever for law enforcement officers."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/23/thom-tillis/was-2016-one-deadliest-years-ever-police-officers-/	Announcing his support for a national pro-police bill, North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis cited an eye-catching statistic. Only a few years in U.S. history, he said, were more deadly for police than 2016. "Last year was one of the deadliest years ever for law enforcement officers, a stark reminder that these men and women go to work every day not knowing whether they’ll return home safely to their families," Tillis said Friday, when he co-sponsored the bill. "Our law enforcement officers risk their lives to protect ours, and the Back the Blue Act will enact new laws that offer them much-needed support and will make criminals think twice before targeting them," he continued, in an official press release. The Back The Blue Act proposes several notable changes. It would create stricter penalties for people who assault police officers, making it a federal crime subject to mandatory minimum sentences and, in some cases, the death penalty – which would fulfill a campaign promise President Donald made about cop-killers. It would also limit people’s ability to sue police officers for abuse. And for those who could still sue, the bill cuts down on how much money they could receive if the police are found guilty. However, the crux of the claim Tillis made to support the bill – that "last year was one of the deadliest years ever for law enforcement officers" – is not accurate. Whether you look at total deaths, or violent deaths only, or the percentage of officers killed, the numbers show 2016 was actually one of the least deadly years in modern history. "It's still more dangerous to be a cop than it is not to be a cop," said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who now researches anti-police violence and teaches at the University of South Carolina’s law school. "But … to say that this is the most dangerous time for officers is just woefully uninformed." After we asked what numbers Tillis was citing, his office didn't defend the claim but did question why we would fact-check him. "Losing one police officer is one too many," Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin said. "... Senator Tillis will continue to do everything in his power to support North Carolina’s law enforcement community and recognize the daily sacrifices they make." In the past, Tillis has advocated for criminal justice reforms like less harsh sentencing laws – in North Carolina and nationwide. Total deaths One way to measure how deadly a year has been for police is to look at the total number of deaths. Another is felonious killings, which is the term for the killing of a police officer by a criminal while in the line of duty. Felonious killings are what people tend to think of when they hear about a deadly time for law enforcement. They make the national news – ambushes, traffic stops gone bad, a suspect getting the upper hand in a fight. Those are included in the number of total deaths, which also includes on-duty accidental deaths like car crashes, heart attacks or falls, and off-duty deaths from causes like illness or suicide. In a previous fact-check, we looked into a comparison of Prohibition and the War on Drugs, which claimed they’ve been equally deadly for police. We ruled that Mostly False. Here’s an graph, from that previous fact-check, of total annual police deaths from 1900 to now: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It shows that fewer officers died in 2016 than most other years in the 20th and 21st centuries. More police officers died in 1916 (164) than in 2016 (143). So by that metric, Tillis is way off. But what about violent deaths? Felonious killings Data specifying the number of police officers killed by criminals started in the 1970s, which is also when the War on Drugs began. And again, Tillis is wrong. 2016 saw 66 officers shot, stabbed or otherwise killed by a criminal – which is less than half the number of killings in several other years. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "Senator Tillis is way off," Stoughton said. "It is an unmitigated tragedy that 66 officers were feloniously killed in 2016, but that number is nowhere near the historic high." In fact – and this is good news for current officers – 2016’s violent death toll was about 10 deaths below the average for the last half-century. Even though more police were killed in 2016 than in much of the 2000s, there were fewer officers killed last year than in nearly every year in the 1970s, ‘80s and ‘90s. Rate of killings When we consider the percentage of officers killed, the decline in anti-police violence is even more striking – from more than 30 deaths per 100,000 officers in the late 1970s, to around 17 in the 1980s, to about 6 or 7 now. "We have close to twice as many officers and half as many deaths," Stoughton said. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com There’s no authoritative count yet on the number of police officers in the United States in 2016, so it’s impossible to calculate an exact rate. But it’s safe to say Tillis is almost certainly wrong by this measure, too. We know 66 officers were killed in 2016, and we know there were at least 635,000 officers in the U.S. in 2015. So unless half of the nation’s cops (or more) were laid off last year, there’s no way the rate of officers killed in 2016 would even be at the low end of the violence in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Instead, if the number of police officers rose by a few thousand in 2016, as happened in the few years prior, the rate for 2016 would be about 10 officer deaths per 100,000. If that happens, then 2016 will have been more deadly for police than other recent years, yet still safer than any year between 1975 and 1995. Our ruling Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said a new pro-police law is needed because 2016 "was one of the deadliest years ever for law enforcement officers." That’s wrong. In fact, 2016 saw a below-average number and rate of officer deaths compared to the last half-century. The 66 officers killed in 2016 pales in comparison to the 1970s and 1980s, and wasn’t much different from the typical year in the 1990s, either. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00905	"The average person only pays about $1,800 in state taxes — which is the lowest of all 50 states."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-average-floridian-pays-1800-state-taxes/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott rattled off a laundry list of first-term accomplishments during his State of the State speech March 3, 2015. Chief among them were his efforts to cut taxes in the Sunshine State the past four years. "We are home to over 250 languages. We are at a 43-year-low in our crime rate. We are absolutely the best melting pot in the world. Housing prices are up. And taxes are down," Scott said. "We have cut taxes more than 40 times in the last four years. We have no personal income tax and the average person only pays about $1,800 in state taxes — which is the lowest of all 50 states." As we said in another fact-check, the bit about cutting taxes more than 40 times rates Half True. Here, we decided to look at Scott’s claim that the average person pays $1,800 a year in state taxes, the lowest of all 50 states. We crunched the numbers ourselves and compared that to multiple other tax watchdogs that use U.S. Census data to calculate taxes collected per capita. According to the Florida Department of Revenue, the state collected about $33.6 billion in taxes in fiscal year 2014. In 2013, Florida’s population, according to the U.S. Census, was about 19.6 million. Do the math, and that’s $1,711 taxes collected per capita. Scott’s office pointed us to the Federation of Tax Administrators, a nonpartisan group that serves the principal tax collection agencies in all 50 states. A 2013 analysis based on data from the U.S. Census, which surveys every state government each year to ask how much they collected in taxes, found the taxes Florida collected per capita were $1,769. That number was also cited by the Kaiser Family Foundation, another nonpartisan organization. Both those figures are close to the number Scott cited. But there’s a notable difference between taxes collected per capita and how much "the average person pays," as Scott put it. To arrive at the per capita figure, you’re including millions of people, namely children, who either pay no taxes or some nominal amount (the sales tax on a toy purchased with allowance money, for example). With this caveat in mind, looking at taxes collected per capita is still a useful tool for comparing tax burdens across state lines. It’s not a perfect comparison — some states may have larger proportions of their residents who pay taxes — but it is used by several national tax policy groups. The most recent estimates say Florida's state tax burden is among the lowest in the country. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Federation of Tax Administrators, at $1,769, Florida’s tax burden in 2013 was the lowest in the country, beating out Georgia ($1,781), New Hampshire ($1,791), South Dakota ($1,815) and South Carolina ($1,827). At $7,325 per person, North Dakota’s state tax burden is the highest. Our own calculation, achieved by comparing the U.S. Census 2013 Annual Survey of State Government Tax Collections to 2013 population data, put Florida third, behind New Hampshire and Georgia. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture from the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, ranked Florida fourth in its most recent analysis from 2012. Lastly, if you think per capita is a silly way of comparing tax liabilities, know that Florida has a low tax burden by another measure: percent of total income paid to taxes. According to the Federation of Tax Administrators, 4.4 percent of all income earned by Floridians goes to state taxes. That percentage is the third-lowest in the country behind New Hampshire (3.7 percent) and South Dakota (4.1 percent). Our ruling Scott said, "The average person only pays about $1,800 in state taxes — which is the lowest of all 50 states." That’s not exactly what the average person pays in taxes; it’s actually the state taxes collected per capita, which factors in children and other residents who pay little to nothing in taxes. That’s not necessarily the impression you would get from Scott’s statement. Still, according to two credible analyses, that number was the lowest in the country in 2013, the last year of available data. Other breakdowns put Florida among four states with the lowest tax burden per capita. We rate Scott’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2015-03-03T18:20:32	2015-03-03	['None']
pomt-09499	"One of the most recent polls said 75 percent of the American people have said either don't do anything or start over (on health care reform)."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/23/jon-kyl/polls-show-public-dubious-current-health-care-prop/	With a big meeting at the White House scheduled for health care reform, Republicans have been marshaling their best arguments against the Democratic proposals. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., discussed the meeting, set for Feb. 25, 2010, on Fox News. "President Obama seems intent on the other hand of ramming his agenda through, no matter what," Kyl told Greta Van Susteren. "One of the problems with that is that the American people have said that isn't what they want in health care reform." "I think you have to listen to the American people," Kyl added. "One of the most recent polls said 75 percent of the American people have said either don't do anything or start over." We've been fascinated with health care polls since Democrats started moving forward with legislation in 2009. Several reputable polls indicate people aren't sure what's actually in the bills, which regulate private insurers more heavily, require people to have health insurance and offer tax credits to small businesses and people with low incomes. Our favorite poll question involved a proposal put forward by the more liberal members of the Democratic caucus: the public option. A Vanity Fair/60 Minutes poll asked, "In the health care debate, there's been much back-and-forth over the so-called public option. Could you confidently explain what exactly the public option is to someone who didn’t know?" Two-thirds said they couldn't. In reviewing the more recent polls on health care, most show that a narrow majority of the public opposes the current plans, though a few polls show a roughly even split. Still, we were interested in Kyl's statement that 75 percent of respondents said do nothing or start over. We asked Kyl's staff about the number but didn't hear back, so we started looking around on our own. We soon found a CNN poll conducted at the end of January that asked the question, "What do you think Congress should do on health care -- pass a health care bill similar to the legislation that Congress has been working on for the past year, start work on an entirely new bill, or stop working on any bills that would change the country's health care system?" The poll found that 48 percent said "start a new bill," while 21 percent said "stop working on health care." Add those together and you get 69 percent, which is not far from 75 percent. (And 30 percent said Congress should pass one of the current proposals.) The CNN poll also showed that 58 percent oppose the current proposals, while 38 percent favor them. (This leads to the odd conclusion that some people, about 8 percent, favor the current proposals but also want Congress to start over.) Democratic analysts have claimed that some of the opposition to health care found in the poll numbers comes from Democrats who believe the current proposals don't go far enough. That may be so, but we're not ruling on that here. For our rating, Kyl was careful in how he phrased his statement. He said, "One of the most recent polls said 75 percent of the American people have said either don't do anything or start over." We found a recent poll that put those two categories at 69 percent. That's a little short, but pretty close. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Jon Kyl	None	None	None	2010-02-23T18:58:01	2010-02-20	['United_States']
pomt-03209	"New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city’s."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/26/michael-bloomberg/michael-bloomberg-says-new-york-safest-big-city-us/	Following a federal court decision rebuking New York City’s "stop-and-frisk" policy as racially discriminatory, Mayor Michael Bloomberg penned a Washington Post op-ed titled, "‘Stop and frisk’ is not racial profiling." He began the op-ed with a strong defense of the policy -- namely, that it works. "New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city’s," Bloomberg wrote. He said the improvements are due in large part to the policy, in which police officers stop and search people they suspect might be involved in criminal activity. We won’t address the wisdom of the policy, which is the focus of intense debate. Instead, we’ll look at the question of whether "New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city’s." The numbers: Is New York the safest big city? We turned to the most recent full-year data from the FBI, which used 2011 figures. Since a previous NYPD news release had compared New York City to both the 10 biggest cities and the 25 biggest cities, we will use those parameters here as well. In the charts below, violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter; forcible rape; robbery; and aggravated assault. Property crimes include burglary, larceny-theft and motor vehicle theft. The following chart lists the 25 largest cities in America, in descending order by population. The last two columns show where the city ranks by crime rate, with 1 being the lowest crime rate. City Population, 2011 Violent crimes, 2011 Property crimes, 2011 Total crimes Total crime rate per 100,000 pop.

The numbers: A steeper crime reduction than any other big city? The FBI website has comparable crime data going back to 1995, so we looked at the change in each of these cities between 1995 and 2011. Once again, we list the 25 largest cities in America, in descending order by population. The last two columns show where the city ranks by reduction in the total crime rate between 1995 and 2011, with 1 being the biggest reduction in the crime rate. City Total crime rate per 100,000 pop., 1995 Total crime rate per 100,000 pop., 2011 Percent increase or decrease, 1995-2011 Rank by biggest crime decrease among 10 biggest cities Rank by biggest crime decrease among 25 biggest cities New York 6,076 2,324 - 62 percent 2 2 Los Angeles 7,680 2,785 - 64 percent 1 1 Chicago NA NA NA -- -- Houston 7,588 6,024 - 21 percent 9 22 Philadelphia 7,078 5,069 - 28 percent 8 19 Phoenix 10,880 4,937 - 55 percent 3 5 San Antonio 7,994 6,465 - 19 percent 10 23 San Diego 5,548 2,625 - 53 percent 4 8 Dallas 9,464 5,738 - 39 percent 7 14 San Jose 4,387 2,602 - 41 percent 6 13 Jacksonville 9,001 4,987 - 45 percent 5 11 Indianapolis 4,460 6,783 + 52 percent -- 24 Austin 8,132 5,572 - 31 percent -- 17 San Fran. 8,190 4,707 - 43 percent -- 12 Columbus 9,192 6,800 - 26 percent -- 20 Fort Worth 8,617 5,231 - 39 percent -- 14 Charlotte 9,576 4,899 - 49 percent -- 9 Detroit 1,1939 8,359 - 30 percent -- 18 El Paso 7,063 2,880 - 59 percent -- 3 Memphis 10,514 8,081 - 23 percent -- 21 Boston 9,493 3,951 - 58 percent -- 4 Seattle 10,482 5,712 - 46 percent -- 10 Denver 6,873 4,227 - 38 percent -- 15 Baltimore 13,323 6,248 - 53 percent -- 6 Washington 12,166 5,712 - 53 percent -- 6 By this measure, New York ranks second, by a narrow margin, to Los Angeles. Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for Bloomberg, said that New York does rank first if you go back to 1993, when the city introduced its data-based policing approach, and he cited a 2011 book by University of California-Berkeley law professor Franklin E. Zimring, The City that Became Safe: New York's Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control. We checked with Zimring, who agreed that Bloomberg is on safe ground with his claim. Zimring said the steepest declines occurred in the early 1990s and would not have been captured entirely in our data. New York City’s drop "is the steepest ever for a major U.S. city with a credible statistics program," Zimring said. Are such comparisons valid? So, judging by the numbers, Bloomberg is on target. But is he justified in making a multi-city comparison, or is that just comparing apples to oranges? While everyone does it, experts say it can be a blunt measurement. The FBI -- the source of the statistics Bloomberg used -- is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Here are a few of the factors that the FBI and other experts cite: • No two cities are alike. Bloomberg’s preferred ranking consists of cities (which would not include separately incorporated suburbs) rather than metropolitan areas (which would include suburbs). In addition, New York includes the primarily suburban borough of Staten Island. • Crime reporting rates can vary by city. Whether due to police habits or citizens' actions, different cities may not have the same level of diligence in reporting crimes, especially for the most numerous type of violent crime (aggravated assault) and the most numerous type of property crime (larceny-theft). • Using total crime as the measurement mixes both violent and property crime. The method Bloomberg used counts every violent crime and property crime equally, so every murder is statistically equivalent to every car theft. Changing the category being calculated can make a big difference. In 2011, New York City had a better overall crime rate than Los Angeles, but New York had a higher violent crime rate -- 621 violent crimes per 100,000 population, compared to 524 for Los Angeles. Still, despite some concerns about Bloomberg’s use of the statistics in this way, the criminologists we checked with agreed that the mayor has something to crow about. "One thing that is quite obvious is that almost every neighborhood in the five boroughs can be said to be on the way up, whereas cities like Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis have quite a few neighborhoods that can be termed dead or dying," said Eugene O’Donnell, criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, agreed. "New York has done a great job," he said. "But urban one-upmanship does no one any good. Whether they’re first, second or third in the nation is splitting hairs." Our ruling Bloomberg said, "New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city’s." Both the FBI and criminologists express concern about making this type of multi-city comparison, and other measures, such as violent crime, don’t put New York at the No. 1 slot. Still, the numbers do broadly back up his claim. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2013-08-26T16:21:02	2013-08-18	['None']
pomt-06651	"Gov. Kasich and the Republican-dominated legislature have foregone the popular option of closing tax loopholes that amount to $7 billion annually in this state."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/13/dan-ramos/state-rep-dan-ramos-says-loopholes-gop-left-ohios-/	In a newspaper opinion piece published last month, Ohio Rep. Dan Ramos said Gov. John Kasich and the General Assembly needlessly neglected the state's needs through their approach to balancing the budget. "Gov. Kasich and the Republican-dominated legislature have foregone the popular option of closing tax loopholes that amount to $7 billion annually in this state, choosing instead to balance the budget entirely by selling public assets, cutting local funds and eliminating thousands of jobs," the Lorain Democrat wrote. That drew the attention of PolitiFact Ohio. Loopholes and tax breaks are usually mentioned in relation to federal taxes, not those at the state level. And $7 billion almost equals the deficit that was projected as lawmakers worked on the state budget for 2012-13. We asked how Ramos came up with that figure. His office referred us to two sources: a report by Policy Matters Ohio, a liberal think tank, and the Tax Expenditure Report prepared by the Ohio Department of Taxation. The Tax Expenditure Report is issued as a companion to the governor's executive budget. It looks at the impact of tax expenditures, which are the credits, deductions and exemptions in the tax code that reduce the amount of revenue the state would otherwise receive. "Tax expenditures result in a loss of tax revenue to state government, thereby reducing the funds available for other government programs," the report says. "In essence, a tax expenditure has the same fiscal impact as a direct government expenditure." But "unlike direct budgetary expenditures, unless there is a pre-existing termination date, tax expenditures may remain in effect indefinitely with little or no scrutiny by policy makers." This year’s report estimated that the credits and exemptions will amount to more than $7 billion in foregone revenue in both fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The report counts 128 tax expenditures -- an increase from 122 in the previous two-year budget. While estimating their dollar value, the report offers no conclusions about the worth and validity of the tax expenditures. That's the responsibility of the General Assembly and the governor, although -- as the report noted -- no continuing or periodic review is required. Lawmakers supporting the tax credits and exemptions say they are most often intended to spur economic development. Policy Matters Ohio proposed in its report that the General Assembly set a target of reducing tax expenditures by 10 percent. "We're not saying that you can just get rid of them all," the group's research director, Zach Schiller, told us. Some, he noted, are exemptions valued by the public, such as one that exempts purchases of prescription drugs from sales tax. "But you can cut sizable amounts," he said. For example, he noted, a cap on the sales tax paid by buyers of shares in jet aircraft is estimated to be worth $1 million. And retailers who collect the state sales tax get a discount on what they collect, if they send in the tax by the due date of the tax return, a windfall for big retailers. "But the $7 billion doesn't cover everything by a long shot," Schiller said, because the Tax Expenditure Report counts only items that would have been taxable if not specifically exempted. While the sales tax covers the sale of all goods that haven't been exempted, it covers only services that are specifically named. "Hiring a lobbyist, for example, does not involve paying sales tax because it wasn't written into the law," Schiller said. "To me, that's a tax break," even though it does not count as foregone revenue. Three years ago, Policy Matters Ohio listed "a dozen tax breaks Ohio can do without." noting that payday lenders and mortgage brokers were given a lower state tax rate than banks; that debt collectors, like lobbyists, don't have to bill clients for sales tax, and that a measure approved by the General Assembly made it easier for high-income individuals who spend part of the year out of state to avoid Ohio income tax. Just those tax breaks cost the state more than $65 million a year, the group said. Let's get back to the statement we questioned: "Gov. Kasich and the Republican-dominated legislature have foregone the popular option of closing tax loopholes that amount to $7 billion annually in this state." Ramos was accurate in writing that tax exemptions and credits amount to $7 billion a year in Ohio -- though referring to them as "loopholes" adds a negative connotation that is not uniformly justified. We found that this year's budget process increased the number of tax expenditures, rather than limiting them. But we think it is important to note that even critics of the tax breaks don't recommend cutting all of them -- a point that helps provide clarification. Limiting tax breaks, in other words, is not an either-or option to increasing revenues or cutting spending in balancing the budget. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but needs clarification rates Mostly True.	None	Dan Ramos	None	None	None	2011-09-13T06:00:00	2011-08-13	['John_Kasich']
pomt-05637	"When we passed (the stand your ground law), we said it portends horrific events when people's lives were put into these situations."	true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/22/arthenia-joyner/democratic-senator-says-there-warnings-stand-your-/	The possibility that Florida’s "stand your ground" law could protect a neighborhood watchman who shot and killed an unarmed teen last month has lawmakers who opposed the measure saying told you so. "When we passed the law, we said it portends horrific events when people’s lives were put into these situations, and my worst fears came to fruition," Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, said March 20, 2012. "A young life was snuffed out." Joyner was in the state House when "stand your ground" passed in 2005 and fears the law — which allows people to use deadly force in cases of self-defense when they believe their life is at risk — could save 28-year-old shooter George Zimmerman from prosecution. Zimmerman killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in the Orlando suburb of Sanford on Feb. 26, police say. As the investigation unfolds, it’s worthwhile to look back to the origins of the "stand your ground" law and the concerns legislators like Joyner had at the time. The measure passed the Senate 39-0 and the House 94-20. It was signed into law by Gov. Jeb Bush. Joyner and 19 other House Democrats voted against the bill. To check her claim, we went to the video archives to see what was said during House debate on April 5, 2005. "For a House that talks about the culture of life, it’s ironic that we would be devaluing life in this bill, which is exactly what we’re doing," said Rep. Dan Gelber, a former federal prosecutor from Miami Beach who later was elected to the Senate. Gelber said Floridians already had the right to defend themselves in their homes and offered an amendment that would restore a person’s duty to retreat from a confrontation in public places. Rep. Eleanor Sobel, a South Florida Democrat who now serves in the Senate, said Gelber’s amendment would reduce "chaos on the street." Republicans defeated Gelber’s amendment on a voice vote. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, called an obligation to retreat "a good way to get shot in the back." Members debated another unsuccessful amendment from Rep. Jack Seiler, a Democrat who is now mayor of Fort Lauderdale. Seiler’s proposal would have allowed for rebuttal to a person’s claim of self-defense. "We are going to give blanket immunity to criminals when they commit crime," Seiler said. Other voices from the hour-long debate: • "I believe that we’re going to have open season in our communities, as it relates to confrontations throughout this state," said former Rep. Frank Peterman. D-St. Petersburg. • "What would happen if I presumed that there was a threat when actually there was not a threat? I would hate to think that I would react and take someone’s life, or do bodily harm to someone, who actually only looked a little different than I looked," said Rep. Priscilla Taylor, D-West Palm Beach. • "When you give a person the right to use deadly force anywhere they’re lawfully supposed to be, then we open Pandora’s Box, and inside the box will be death for some persons," Joyner said. • "In a few years, you will be back trying to fix this bill," said Rep. Ken Gottlieb, D-Hollywood. The House debate stands in contrast to the Senate. Sen. Steve Geller, D-Hallandale Beach, tried changing the bill before the vote so that it would not apply to public places. The Senate voted down his amendment in minutes. The vote to pass the bill was then unanimous, with Democrats, including Sen. Rod Smith, currently chair of the Florida Democratic Party, voting yes. "We’d be seen as Democrats soft on crime," Geller explained, according to an account from the Associated Press. Overall, the warnings comprised a slim opposition to a very popular law. But they were there. We rate Joyner’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/28892e04-afd5-4193-9541-ca75b6570413	None	Arthenia Joyner	None	None	None	2012-03-22T18:36:44	2012-03-21	['None']
pomt-06489	"Romneycare has … killed 18,000 Massachusetts jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/14/rick-perry/rick-perry-ad-says-romneycare-cost-18000-jobs/	Rick Perry’s campaign released a new ad that attacks Mitt Romney on multiple fronts -- his health care plan for Massachusetts, his record on job creation and whether he’s been inconsistent on important issues. It also throws in a Halloween-like reference: It shows President Barack Obama looking into a mirror, then there's a crash of thunder … it’s Mitt Romney! The ad focuses on the health care plan Romney signed when he was governor of Massachusetts, claiming that it’s the same as the health plan supported by Obama. Here, we’re checking the ad’s claim that "Romneycare … killed 18,000 Massachusetts jobs." To review, what the ad calls "Romneycare" is a health care plan Romney signed into law in 2006. Though it only applies to the state of Massachusetts, it is similar in its broad outline to the national health care plan approved by the Democratic Congress and signed by Obama. Both leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They seek to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering subsidies to help moderate income people buy insurance. People are required to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." And companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. For the claim about job losses, the ad cites as its source a report from the Beacon Hill Institute, a Boston-based economics research group that supports "limited government, fiscal responsibility, and free markets," and is affiliated with Suffolk University. The ad says that the Massachusetts health law "killed 18,000 jobs," which makes it sound like 18,000 actual jobs were eliminated. In fact, the report makes the more modest assertion that the law prevented 18,000 jobs from being created. The report’s basis for the claim is that the Massachusetts health care law increased costs for businesses by requiring them to offer insurance to their workers or pay fines. It also increased state spending on health care, money that otherwise would have been spent elsewhere. The report claims that these additional costs reduced job growth by an average of 18,313 jobs. To put that in perspective, the Massachusetts workforce was 3,471,487 in July 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployed numbered 263,059. We should note here that reports like this one largely depend on the underlying economic assumptions behind the economic model. Right-leaning and left-leaning groups often come up with different numbers when looking at the same policies. In this case, we were unable to find any other studies that looked at the effects of the Massachusetts health care law on employment. Our friends at Factcheck.org checked out the 18,000 number a few weeks ago when Perry, the governor of Texas, started making the claim on the campaign trail. They found mixed opinions in Massachusetts on whether the law hurt actual job growth. Health care costs have gone up in the state, but some argue they would have gone up anyway. (For the record, the authors of the Beacon Hill study told us they accounted for the effects of health care inflation not caused by the law.) Factcheck.org concluded that the 18,000 number was an estimate that could neither be proved nor disproved. Finally, this claim also made us think of a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which conducted an economic analysis of how many jobs might be lost or gained nationwide under the new federal health care law. They found that the law would reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by about 800,000 jobs. Some of that would be due to businesses facing higher costs and deciding not to hire. But most of it would be because people working jobs simply to retain group health insurance would be able to leave those jobs and buy insurance on their own. Our ruling In rating this statement, it’s certainly plausible that increased costs to business could cause them to create fewer jobs. But we’re reluctant to accept a specific number based on one study by a right-leaning economic group. We would be interested in numbers reached by other groups, particularly independent, nonpartisan groups. But we don’t have those to draw on in this analysis. More significantly, the Perry ad says that the health care plan "killed" 18,000 jobs. That certainly makes it sound as if existing jobs were destroyed. Instead, a hypothetical 18,000 jobs were never created in the first place. Given that Perry’s ad bases its claim on one study and also exaggerates the study’s findings, we rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-08643	"Deepwater's own testimony . . . is they said they'll create six jobs."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/17/patrick-lynch/patrick-lynch-says-deepwater-winds-block-island-pr/	Deepwater Wind's proposed eight-turbine wind farm off Block Island has been both praised and lambasted on economic grounds. Attorney General Patrick Lynch has been one of the project's staunchest foes, citing a number of reasons. One of them: the promise of new jobs has been overblown. "Deepwater's own testimony, at the PUC, after a seven-month hearing, publicly held at the forum that the governor chose, is they said they'll create six jobs," Lynch said during a June appearance on the "Newsmakers" television program when he was running for governor. Lynch dropped out of the race July 15. We filed his statement while we focused on candidates who were still running in the primary. But we decided it was still interesting enough to examine now. In general, PolitiFact doesn't check predictions. But we can check whether Deepwater itself said that only six jobs would be created. When we asked for the source for that claim, the attorney general's office directed us to written answers to questions posed a year ago to Deepwater by the state Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which carries out the policies of the PUC and is responsible for representing consumers during PUC hearings. The key answer about jobs came from William Moore, CEO of Deepwater Wind. Here's a portion of the response: " . . . we anticipate that the Block Island Wind Farm will generate between 35 and 50 direct local construction period jobs, and possibly more if assembly operations are performed at Quonset, an option Deepwater Wind is currently investigating. Further, we estimate that post-construction, operation and maintenance of eight turbines making up the facility will require approximately 6 permanent full time equivalent jobs." So Deepwater is saying there will be six full-time positions to maintain the eight wind turbines. Lynch was correct. But Lynch was also being too selective. A state's economic health relies on temporary jobs as well, and it's misleading to ignore the benefits of temporary construction jobs. Deepwater -- which Lynch himself cites as a credible source when it comes to the "6 jobs" number -- is also promising at least 35 short-term construction jobs. And that's only for the Block Island Wind Farm portion of the project, planned as the first phase. If the much larger project of 100 wind turbines is ultimately built, it would mean even more jobs, both long-term and construction jobs. Deepwater is predicting at least 600 jobs associated with building those turbines at Quonset Point and many more indirect jobs. Our Truth-O-Meter can't predict the future, so we don't know if the jobs estimates being projected by either Lynch or Deepwater are correct, whether the wind farm will -- as some experts have predicted -- actually cost the state jobs by driving up the cost of electricity, or whether fossil fuel prices will someday make Rhode Islanders glad they invested in the small- or large-scale offshore wind farms.

pomt-07377	"The federal government borrows $4 billion every day."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/04/national-republican-congressional-committee/gop-congressional-committee-says-us-borrows-4-bill/	Hundreds of Rhode Islanders got phone calls last week from the National Republican Congressional Committee, with a recorded message attacking U.S. Rep. David Cicilline. Specifically, the GOP was criticizing Cicilline’s support of a Democratic budget proposal for fiscal 2012, which the Republican-controlled House defeated 166 to 259 on April 15. Similar calls were made in 22 other Congressional districts where the GOP perceives an incumbent Democrat to be vulnerable. "Thanks to Washington’s addiction to spending, the federal government now borrows $4 billion a day," the recorded voice said. "That’s given us $14 trillion in debt. And David Cicilline is making it worse. He voted for another Pelosi budget that would strangle our economy with more spending, more debt and more borrowing from China." Setting aside the freshman congressman’s vote on the Democrats’ proposed budget --which is a matter of public record --we wondered about that $4-billion figure, which Republicans around the country are citing in their budget battles with Democrats. If Rhode Island were to borrow that much, in just two days it would pay for the entire proposed state budget of $7.7 billion for next year. Or it could pay for the I-Way, the new Sakonnet River bridge and the replacement of the Route 95 viaduct in Pawtucket -- with $3 billion in pocket change. Does the United States really borrow that much every day? When we asked for proof of the claim, the NRCC referred us to a report by our friends at PolitiFact Florida. Turns out PolitiFact Georgia also looked into a similar claim. First, a primer, courtesy of PolitiFact Florida. Let’s start with the difference between the "national deficit" and the "national debt." The deficit is the result of the government spending more in a single budget year than it takes in as revenue from taxes and other sources. The deficit in 2010 was $1.3 trillion, according to the website of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. We've had a deficit every year since 2002. Before that, from 1998 to 2001, for a brief period at the end of President Bill Clinton's term and the start of President George W. Bush's administration, the federal government was actually operating with a surplus, according to a Congressional Research Service report. The national debt, meanwhile, is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money. That stood at $14.25 trillion on April 6, according to PolitiFact Georgia. Its research determined that the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion a day since 2009. In 2010, the average was $4.7 billion a day. It has dropped, however, to about $2.45 billion a day so far this year. But between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day. Those numbers were enough to convince PolitiFact Georgia that the claim of borrowing $4 billion a day was Mostly True. PolitiFact Florida, delving into a similar matter, questioned the notion of the federal government borrowing billions every day to stay afloat. "The actual borrowing doesn’t occur every day," Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, told PolitiFact Florida. "The periodic auction of bonds, that’s when the money is raised." Still, PolitiFact Florida found the $4-billion figure reasonable and also went with a Mostly True ruling. Makes sense to us. That’s why we’re going to do some borrowing ourselves, and go with our PolitiFact colleagues. We rate this one Mostly True too.

pomt-06554	"When it comes to being effective at creating jobs … (Chris Christie has not had) a record of governing for effectiveness. ... Last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/03/martin-omalley/did-chris-christies-new-jersey-create-no-net-new-j/	On the Oct. 2, 2011, edition of CBS’s Face the Nation, two governors -- Democrat Martin O’Malley of Maryland and Republican Haley Barbour of Mississippi -- faced off over a variety of political and policy issues. Host Bob Schieffer brought up one of the hottest political stories of the day -- the potential presidential candidacy of another governor, Republican Chris Christie of New Jersey. After months of denying the possibility of a run, Christie had recently indicated that he’s reconsidering his stance on a GOP primary bid. O’Malley tried to throw cold water on Christie’s record since he took office in January 2010. "When it comes to being effective at creating jobs, improving schools, and expanding opportunity, (Christie’s) record in New Jersey has not been a record of governing for effectiveness," O’Malley said. "His bond rating has been downgraded by two of the bond rating agencies. His unemployment in New Jersey is one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent. Last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs. And his schools, because of the choices he's made to cut education funding, have actually been declining in their national ranking. So that's not a record of leadership and governance and effectiveness." We decided to focus on the two jobs-related claims -- that "New Jersey (has) one of the higher unemployment rates in the country at 9.4 percent," and that "last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs." We’ll rate them in separate Truth-O-Meter items, taking up the second claim in this item. We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. We concluded that the most obvious interpretation of "last year" was 2010, so we looked at the jobs data in New Jersey over the course of 2010. There are actually two ways to measure this -- measuring net job creation in the state from January 2010 to December 2010, or from January 2010 to January 2011. Using the first time frame, total jobs in the state fell from 3,852,600 to 3,844,700 -- a drop of 7,900, or about two-tenths of 1 percent. Using the second time frame, the total number of non-farm, seasonally adjusted jobs fell from 3,852,600 to 3,828,900 -- a decline of 23,700 jobs, or six-tenths of 1 percent. So the declines over that period were modest on a percentage basis, but they were indeed declines, not increases. So on this score, O’Malley is right. However, this approach amounts to cherry-picking. Why stop the clock at the end of Christie’s first year when an additional eight months of data are available? In fact, if you continue counting through August 2011, the job picture during Christie’s tenure looks more robust. From January 2010 to August 2011, the number of jobs rose from 3,852,600 to 3,866,600 -- an increase of 14,000 jobs, or four-tenths of 1 percent. In the meantime, to get a sense of context, we looked at the national job statistics over the same period. For both measurements of job growth in 2010 alone, the number of jobs nationally grew by eight-tenths of 1 percent. For the period January 2010 to August 2011, the number of jobs grew by 1.4 percent. We’ll also note an underlying flaw in claims like these. O’Malley tries to pin the blame for New Jersey’s relatively weak job market on Christie, when in fact the jobs picture in any given state is influenced by a host of factors, from national and international trends to state policies inherited from a governor’s predecessor. It’s especially dicey to pin blame on Christie, who has only been in office for a little over a year and a half. Elisabeth Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, which O’Malley chairs, noted that he actually understated the job pattern for 2010. New Jersey didn’t just create zero net jobs, as O’Malley indicated, but actually lost jobs over that period. Looking at the data, she said, "Gov. Christie has been ineffective at creating jobs in New Jersey." Our ruling In discussing job creation, O'Malley said, "When it comes to being effective at creating jobs … (Chris Christie has not had) a record of governing for effectiveness" and went on to say that last year New Jersey created "no net new jobs." Using the year 2010 as the yardstick, O’Malley is correct that "last year, New Jersey created no net new jobs." And it’s true that for every period we studied since Christie took office, New Jersey underperformed job-creation numbers for the nation as a whole. However, we think it’s cherry-picking for O’Malley to use the data for 2010 only when the data for 2010 and 2011 are available -- and when the expanded data contradicts the point that was accurate for just 2010. At least as important, Christie’s responsibility for his state’s difficult jobs picture is unclear. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

abbc-00264	The Government has proposed a 10-year program of business tax cuts, beginning with a cut to a 27.5 per cent rate for companies with an annual turnover of less than $2 million.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-29/fact-check-labor-on-corporate-tax-cuts/7549754	Mr Turnbull's claim is close to the mark. The Labor Party cut company tax when it was in government between 1983 and 1996. At the 2010 election, the Gillard Labor government promised to cut company tax if re-elected. When in government, senior members of the Labor Party including Bill Shorten made the same sorts of arguments that the current Government is making about company tax cuts: that they boost investment and job creation and make Australia competitive with other nations. Mr Shorten himself criticised a proposal from the Greens that would have seen the money for "big business" tax cuts diverted to health and welfare spending. Today's Labor Opposition does not merely argue that company tax cuts are unaffordable. It now ridicules the whole concept as "wasteful", "flawed", "trickle down economics" and a "giveaway" that will have a "negligible effect on job creation". The Gillard government argued that its tax cuts were affordable over the forward estimates, paid for by proceeds from the Minerals Resource Rent Tax in the context of a budget that was to return to surplus by 2013. Similarly, the current Coalition Government says that its tax cuts are affordable over the forward estimates. It bases its calculations on assumptions and projections that may ultimately prove as inaccurate as those relied on by the Gillard government.

pomt-08286	When Obama took office "the economy of the United States was actually shrinking for the first time in about 70 years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-economy-shrank-first-time/	Editor's note: After we first published this item on Oct. 25, 2010, readers pointed out that our original item considered only current dollar, or nominal, GDP instead of real GDP. We spoke with some experts who agreed that we should have used real GDP. So we have corrected the story and changed the ruling on this item from Mostly True to Barely True. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine appeared on This Week with Christiane Amanpour to defend his party amidst expectations that Republicans will likely make significant gains in the elections set for Nov. 2, 2010. Amanpour asked Kaine about the terrible economy and about remarks President Barack Obama made that it was important for Democrats to have a sense of humility about what they could accomplish without Republican cooperation. "What does he mean by humility?" Amanpour asked. "I think it's trying to find the balance between telling a story of accomplishment and change and improvement, while acknowledging that we still have a long way to go," Kaine said. "So when the president came in, as you know, Christiane, the economy of the United States was actually shrinking for the first time in about 70 years. We had come through a decade where we lost jobs, income declined, poverty gaps widened. Now the economy is growing again. ... We've got to keep climbing and not go backward, but you have to have that humility because a lot of people are still suffering, and we've got more work to do." We were interested in fact-checking Kaine's comments that when Obama took office, "the economy of the United States was actually shrinking for the first time in about 70 years." Had the downturn been that historic? We know from some of our previous fact-checks that experts like to measure the economy by gross domestic product, or GDP, the total market value of goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period. The inflation-adjusted GDP growth rate is widely considered a primary indicator of the status of the economy. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis compiles GDP estimates on both a quarterly and annual basis. The White House and Congress use the bureau's projections to prepare budget estimates, and the Federal Reserve uses it to set monetary policy, according to the bureau. It describes its GDP estimates as "one of the most closely watched of all economic statistics." We looked into statistics on changes in GDP. If it goes up, that means the economy is growing. If it goes down, that means the economy is contracting. We used the GDP as calculated in constant dollars, to rule out the effects of inflation. Obama took office at the beginning of 2009. In 2008, the economy showed 0 percent change, and in 2009, it showed a decline of 2.6 percent using inflation-adjusted figures. We started looking back through the years, and we soon found small declines sooner than Kaine said when we adjusted for inflation. In 1991, the economy declined 0.2 percent. In 1982, it declined 1.9 percent and in 1980, 0.3 percent. In 1975 and 1974, there were small declines of 0.2 and 0.6. In 1958, there was a decline of 0.9 percent. There were several years of declines in the 1940s, with the steepest of 10.9 percent in 1946. Kaine does better when you consider GDP in nominal dollars -- that is, not adjusted for inflation. According to this metric, in 2008 the economy dropped 1.7 percent compared with the year before. There are no declines until 1949, of 0.7 percent. There was also a small decline in 1946, down 0.4. In 1938, there was a significant decline of 6.3, and then more declines in 1933, 1932, 1931 and 1930. No statistics are available before 1930. So Kaine is pretty close if you don't adjust for inflation. But when you do, there are several more recent years when there were declines. So we find his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05548	"On most things except witch trials, Virginia will always have been first."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/apr/09/morgan-griffith/rep-morgan-griffith-says-virginia-did-not-hold-fir/	U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-9th, was among a handful of Virginia congressmen who voted against a resolution earlier this month that proclaimed Salem, Mass., as the birthplace of the National Guard. Griffith insisted Virginia organized a militia in 1624 -- five years before Massachusetts. He noted Virginia was the first English settlement in North America and, in an interview with The Washington Times, good-naturedly accused Massachusetts of having "first colony envy." Then, in a TV interview, he rekindled a deadly flame in the history of Salem, Mass. "On most things except witch trials, Virginia will always have been first," Griffith, told WSLS-TV10 in Roanoke on April 3. We’re sorry to say that we can’t resolve which state is the birthplace of the National Guard. Florida also lays claim to that title, saying an organized militia was created a few years after St. Augustine was settled in 1565. Some argue that settlers came as armed bands and could all be considered part of militias. Jamestown was established in 1607 and pilgrims landed in Plymouth, Mass. in 1620. But we were able to get to the bottom of Griffith’s other claim -- that Virginia was not the first colony to hold a witchcraft trial. Griffith’s press secretary, Maggie Seidel, said the congressman’s statement was "tongue-in-cheek." When asked if there is proof of Griffith’s witch trial claim, she sent us a news story containing some of her boss’s comments. So we turned to Marc Carlson, Librarian of Special Collections and University Archives at the University of Tulsa, who has extensively chronicled witchcraft trials in Europe and North America. His research shows the first person legally accused of witchery in the colonies was Joan Wright of Surry County, Va., in either 1622 or 1626. Witnesses accused Wright, a left-handed midwife, of correctly predicting the death of four people, threatening to make a neighbor’s maid "dance naked and stand before the Tree," and possibly casting a spell that led to the death of a sickly child born to a mother who had declined Wright’s nursing services. Although Wright was arraigned, Carlson said she did not stand trial. The first known accusation of witching in Massachusetts targeted Grace Dutch in 1628 or 1629, but there’s no evidence that she went to trial, either. Records show she died in 1694. The first known witchcraft trial in the colonies occurred in Virginia in 1641, resulting in the acquittal of the wife of George Barker. The exact charges are not known. But her accuser -- Jane Rookens of Lower Norfolk -- was sorry for what she said, according to Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia. The accuser’s husband, George Rookens, was ordered to pay the Barkers’ expenses and court charges. The next known trials occurred in Connecticut in 1647. Mary Johnson, a servant, confessed to "uncleanness with men and Devils." There are varying tales, but no documents, on how she was punished. Also that year, Alse Young of Connecticut became the first American to be hanged for witchcraft. Massachusetts’ first trial came the next year and resulted the hanging of Margaret Jones, a medical practitioner who the court said had "such a malignant touch, as many persons, men, women, and children, whom she stroked or touched with any affection or displeasure, or etc. were taken with deafness, or vomiting, or other violent pains or sickness." Although Virginia held the first known witchcraft trial in colonies, it was not a hotbed of suspicion and water tests. Carlson lists 11 accusations of witchcraft and sorcery in the Old Dominion and the only execution appears to have been on a ship heading to Jamestown in 1654 when Kath Grady was hanged as a "witch at sea." Massachusetts, on the other hand, embraced a puritanical understanding of evil and had 19 accusations excluding Salem’s inquisition in 1692. The witch hunts in that village swept up about 200 people, 19 of whom were hanged and one of whom was crushed by rocks in torture. Our ruling Massachusetts is well known for its attempts to root out sorcery, but evidence shows Virginia held the first witchcraft trial in the colonies. Griffith deserves no toil or trouble for his jest. But his witticism, as much as we enjoyed it, is False.	None	Morgan Griffith	None	None	None	2012-04-09T06:00:00	2012-04-03	['None']
pomt-02490	As a result of climate change, ice fishermen in Wisconsin "are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/17/mark-pocan/rep-mark-pocan-says-ice-fishing-season-shorter-bec/	Severe cold snaps followed by snowstorms and then another blast of cold. For many, this Wisconsin winter can’t end soon enough. So when U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, took to the floor of the House of Representatives on Jan. 16, 2014, a speech about global warming was the last thing many folks wanted to hear. Pocan, a member of the House’s Safe Climate Caucus, spent his one-minute speech ticking off what he said were clear signs of climate change. This claim caught our attention: "Ice fishermen are already noticing fewer days they can be out on our ice covered lakes." It feels like Wisconsin has been frozen solid for months, and many folks wouldn’t be surprised to see ice fishermen tromping around on Memorial Day. But Pocan’s claim is about more than this winter. His statement is about long-term trends and what is driving them. Is he right about climate change and fewer days on ice-covered lakes? When we asked Pocan for backup for the claim, his staff pointed us to Climatewisconsin.org, a web site that highlights research and reports prepared by environmental groups. The site includes interactive features that focus on the two largest lakes in Madison -- Mendota and Monona. It includes the amount of time they have been covered by ice in past years. "The records show significant year-to-year variability in the length of the ice-cover season, but there is a clear trend of fewer ice-cover days over time," the site says. "Overall, the average number of days of ice cover on the Madison lakes has decreased by around 29-35 days over the past 150 years. Significantly, the longest ice seasons on record are all clustered in the first few years of the record, while most of the shortest seasons fall towards the end of the record." The site also includes this statement, which is pretty similar to that made by Pocan: "With climate change models predicting warmer temperatures, we can expect to see a trend towards fewer days of ice-covered lakes as each year passes. In fact, with the aid of a remarkable dataset from Madison’s lakes, scientists infer that a change in ice duration has already taken place." Information posted on the site comes, at least in part, from the work of John J. Magnuson, Emeritus Professor of Zoology and Limnology, who has been at UW since the late 1960s and helped found the UW-Madison Center for Limnology in the early 1980s. Limnology is the study of freshwater lakes, and the UW center says it’s the birthplace of the field of study, dating back to the 1870s. Magnuson is an expert on the effects of climate change on freshwater lakes, and has published numerous academic papers on the effect of climate change on lakes and fish. In an interview, Magnuson said researchers around the world, including Canada, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Japan and Madison, have studied lake ice for years. Researchers note the day lakes freeze and the day the ice goes out. It’s a more official version of what is waged in a less academic way by lakefront bars that stage ice-out guessing contests. Madison researchers have records for Mendota and Monona that go back to 1855. The long term trend for Lake Mendota is that, on average since 1855, there are 29 fewer days that the lake is covered with ice, according to Magnuson. Six of the shortest seasons for Mendota have been in the years since 1980. Five have been since 1995, including the two shortest seasons ever -- 21 days in the winter of 2001-02 and 47 days in 1997-98. Lake Monona has seen on average of 35 fewer ice-covered days, and also has seen a cluster of shorter seasons in recent years. "The breakup of the ice is occurring, on average, two weeks earlier. And the freezing of the lakes have come two weeks later, on average," Magnuson said. "The result is that four months of ice is reduced to about three months." To be sure, Wisconsin has some 15,000 lakes, and we cannot check each one. "This is highly variable with every water body having different characteristics, and is obviously very weather dependent as well," said Thomas Van Haren, of the state Department of Natural Resources Bureau of Law Enforcement. But it seems reasonable to focus on Lake Monona and Mendota given their size and because they are in Pocan’s district. So what about this throwback winter? Magnuson said it’s a statistical blip. Some years the ice stays around longer than others, but over time the trend has been toward shorter ice seasons. "The variability is very high" in terms of the length of the seasons, he said. "Not only does lake ice respond to the warming climate, it also responds to local weather." Lake Mendota iced over Dec. 16, 2013 -- about a month earlier than the previous year and four days earlier than the median date. Lake Monona froze Dec. 10, 2013, compared with Dec. 31 the previous year and a median date of Dec. 15. National Weather Service records from the weather office in Sullivan indicate this was the 9th coldest winter on record, so far, in Madison, and the coldest in 35 years. The average temperature was 15.8 degrees below normal. "This is the sort of winter that’s typical of 50 or 100 years ago," Magnuson said. Going global So what about the connection Pocan made between shorter ice fishing seasons and climate change? Magnuson said the shorter seasons are a symptom of global warming -- one consistent with many others, such as changed bird and butterfly migration patterns, plants that bloom earlier, and disappearing glaciers. "We can’t take this ice data and say ‘therefore we say greenhouse gas is causing this,’" he said. "That’s a question for the atmospheric physicists. Our data is consistent with what other people are finding, with the kind of things that atmospheric scientists are seeing from C02." He added: "There’s abundant evidence that it’s getting warmer and that spring is coming sooner." Unfortunately, he’s talking about long-term trends. Not what is going to happen this year. Our rating It’s been a longer and colder winter than in recent years. But that doesn’t erase a trend that’s been well-established. The number of days that the lakes have ice on them -- making them safe for ice fishing -- has declined. We rate Pocan’s statement True.

pomt-07599	"Due to a flaw in the 1995 Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act numerous oil companies are now drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in federal lands and paying no royalties to the federal government."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/24/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-faulty-law-blame-oil-comp/	With the price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline selling for around $3.50 at the pump, and expected to hit $4 by summer, attention is focused on what factors influence retail fuel prices. That U.S. oil companies reported profits of $485 billion from 2005 to 2009 only heightens that scrutiny. Particularly when despite those profits, they have received subsidies since the mid ’90s. At the time, the average cost of a barrel of oil had plunged to as low as $11, compared to more than $100 a barrel now, and oil companies demanded incentives to explore and drill for new sources of oil. Some of that exploration involves federal areas, but the federal government hasn’t reaped rewards from that exploration. Legislation approved in 1995 relieved oil companies from paying royalties to the federal government on drilling leases until they had recouped their investment. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee focused on that legislation as part of a hearing March 3. At that hearing, Rep. Dennis Kucinich stated: "Due to a flaw in the 1995 Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act, numerous oil companies are now drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in federal lands and paying no royalties to the federal government." Kucinich’s statement made us wonder: Is it possible that an industry swimming in profits has managed to avoid paying a simple cost of doing business like drilling royalties? PolitiFact Ohio put the statement to the Truth-O-Meter. Kucinich’s staff pointed us to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office titled "Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue" and a section titled "Ensuring the Federal Government Receives Fair Market Value for Its Oil and Gas Resources Could Enhance Federal Revenues." The report addresses the issue of royalty relief, stating: "Special lower royalty rates granted on leases issued in the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico from 1996-2000 could result in $21 billion to $53 billion in lost revenue to the federal government." Next, we compared those finding to what was said at the hearing. Kucinich made his remark while questioning Ryan Alexander, president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense, a non-profit organization that bills itself as a non-partisan budget watchdog. The organization is one of nearly 30 in a coalition that followed up the hearing with a letter to Congress urging an end to energy subsidies. Alexander confirmed the basic premise of Kucinich’s claim. "There are companies paying no royalties right now as a result of an error," she said. So does that mean the law is flawed? In a followup answer, Alexander explained that the leases are flawed, not the law. "My understanding is that there is a set of leases that were issued between 1996 and 2000 that are flawed; there was an error in the drafting," she said. "And so all of those leases are exempt from royalties right now." Kucinich, during his questioning, cited claims by John Hofmeister, a former CEO of Shell Oil who now is head of the group Citizens for Affordable Energy, in which he said large oil companies don’t need subsidies such as royalty relief when oil prices are as high as they are now. "The fear of low oil prices drives some companies to say that subsidies should be sustained," Hofmeister said in an interview with the National Journal. "And my point of view is that with high oil prices such subsidies are not necessary." Alexander, too, called for changes to the subsies. "There are subsidies for oil and gas companies riddled throughout the tax code and through different spending programs, so we think this is a big opportunity for there to be bipartisan action for reform that will help close the deficit," she said. "We think that these handouts are enriching very profitable companies." Congressional Republicans generally support continuing subsidies for oil companies, and oppose legislation introduced in February to eliminate $5 billion in subsidies. But there appears to be support for repairing the royalty issue from both sides of the aisle. "I do think there’s bipartisan support to still try to fix that," said Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the committee. So how does Kucinich’s statement rate on the Truth-O-Meter? Testimony at the hearing from the head of a watchdog group advocating action suggests it is the drilling leases for the Gulf of Mexico that are at fault rather than the law that established the royalty relief. But the congressman was correct that some oil companies pay no royalties, and the GAO report his staff cited suggests that is an issue worth billions of dollars to the federal government. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich’s claim as Half True.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-03-24T06:00:00	2011-03-03	['Gulf_of_Mexico']

pomt-02703	Republican state lawmakers "are refusing to give the people of their own states their own tax dollars back in the form of (expanded) Medicaid."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/31/thom-hartmann/hartmann-not-expanding-medicaid-shortchanges-state/	Pundits extend well beyond the recognizable cable platforms of CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. We recently found progressive pundit Thom Hartmann talking about the health care law on RT, an English-language cable network funded by the government of Russia. Hartmann, who hosts a show called The Big Picture, was discussing the decision of state lawmakers in 25 states not to expand Medicaid coverage as envisioned by the Affordable Care Act. He said the decision was motivated by politics (most of the states that opted out of the expansion are run by Republicans), and that it hurts state taxpayers. "When Rick Perry says to the people of Texas that he’s not going to accept money from the federal government to pay for the expansion of Medicaid, what he’s really saying, to his own people, the people of Texas, ‘Naw, you can’t have your own tax dollars back’," Hartmann said. "He’s saying, ‘No, you can't have your money back’ because sabotaging the president is more important than letting you have affordable health care. And what’s worse is, the people who live in states that aren’t accepting the Medicaid expansion will still have the pay the taxes to foot the bill for the expansion in other states." We wanted to explore Hartmann’s argument that Republican state lawmakers have refused "to give the people of their own states their own tax dollars back in the form of (expanded) Medicaid." (If you’re interested in learning more about RT, formerly Russia Today, we suggest you start with this article from the Columbia Journalism Review.) Terms of Medicaid expansion Medicaid is a federal-state partnership to provide health care primarily to poorer Americans. The program is managed by states but funded through a combination of federal and state dollars. Who pays what varies, but generally the federal government contributes more than the states. While the health care law does not change the funding structure for people already enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid, it does offer states a deal in exchange for adding new people to the system. For new enrollees, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs for three years. (States would have to pay for some administrative costs.) After that, states would be asked to pay some costs, but never more than 10 percent. If every state expanded its Medicaid program, the federal government would spend about $800 billion between 2013 and 2022, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. States would be on the hook for about $8 billion. Looking at the first three years Analysts are more confident about how the deal between the participating states and Washington will play out during the first three years than they are beyond that. So we’ll consider Hartmann’s claim in two pieces. We spoke to three experts who have looked closely at precisely the question of whether Medicaid expansion is a good move for the states. Their conclusions differ on the benefits overall, but during the first three years, they all agree. States come out ahead. Joe Antos, a health economist with the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think-tank that generally criticizes the Affordable Care Act, does not believe expansion is a good idea in the long run. But simply in terms of dollars in and dollars out, the first three years are different for the participating states. "They get money they wouldn't have gotten otherwise," Antos said. "Some from their own citizens, some from citizens in other states." Sherry Glied, dean of the Graduate School of Public Service at New York University agreed. "States that are not participating are sending their taxpayers' money to leave the state without getting anything back in return," Glied said. Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, an academic research center in Washington, amplified Glied’s point. The health care law is paid for by taxes and fees affecting wealthier households and players in the health care industry such as makers of medical devices and insurance companies. It also limits payments to doctors and hospitals. "The pain of the Affordable Care Act is locked in," Dorn said. "The only thing you can change is the gain. If you implement the expansion, you get the full benefit." Our experts said Hartmann’s claim would look differently if every state agreed to expand its Medicaid program, because some states would be "winners" and others would be "losers" based on how many people signed up. But as things stand today, non-participating states are underwriting the cost of care in participating states. "I suspect the people of Texas don’t know that their tax dollars are going to places like Vermont or New York," Dorn said. Beyond the first three years So experts agree that in the first three years, Hartmann is right: People in states that refuse to expand Medicaid will lose their share of tax dollars. But what about in year four and beyond? Most states that have turned down the federal government’s offer to expand Medicaid say they are worried about the out years when states must share some of the costs. By saying no, some states might save their taxpayers some money. That savings, however, is likely not enough in most cases to offset the contributions state taxpayers are sending to the federal government, two of our experts told us. Expanding Medicaid, for instance, will likely reduce other areas of state spending, particularly other health care programs the state operate. And in certain cases, the federal government plans on paying a larger share for the care of current Medicaid recipients. In Virginia, analysts concluded that Medicaid expansion by itself would cost the state but the economic boost from the influx of federal dollars would more than offset those costs. Antos, who does not favor expansion, said the final tally whether the Medicaid expansion is a net benefit or cost will vary from state to state. "It depends on the number and incomes of taxpayers in the state, the number of people who become eligible with the expansion who actually sign up, and the cost of services they use," he said. Glied led a group that focused on Medicaid expansion in a study for the Commonwealth Fund, a Massachusetts foundation that funds health policy research. Their conclusions suggested states would do well to participate. "The state economy as a whole is always better off with the expanded program because state tax payments are never close to the federal Medicaid payment," Glied said. Dorn worked on a report that looked at how 10 states assessed whether they should participate. "In every state that did a detailed analysis, and there were six that did, they gained," Dorn said."But does that necessarily mean that every state would? No. It’s a very state specific question." Our ruling Hartmann said that by rejecting an expansion to Medicaid, Republican state lawmakers are not allowing their residents to get their own tax dollars back. That is most accurate for the first three years of the program when the federal government pays 100 percent of the cost of care for newly enrolled people. Beyond that point, the results could vary. While it is always true that wealthier taxpayers in all states pay into the program and that the only way to get some of that back is through participating in the expansion, that doesn’t mean that in every state, the total tax burden due to Medicaid wouldn’t rise over the long haul. There is a body of studies that point to gains for the states, but a range of outcomes is possible. Hartmann did not address the longer term uncertainties. PunditFact uses predictions about the future very cautiously. We put more weight on what is known in the short term than what is projected many years out. In this case, the first three years clearly support Hartmann’s claim and the period beyond that is subject to debate. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-05292	Hartsfield-Jackson’s new international terminal is opening "within budget."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/may/23/john-kennedy/airport-spokesman-says-new-international-terminal/	The Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport finally opened its doors after more than a decade of delays, lawsuits and changes of plans. Local leaders are celebrating the hard-fought victory by patting each other -- and themselves -- on the back. Atlanta Department of Aviation spokesman John Kennedy touted the city’s accomplishment during an interview with radio host Scott Slade on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB "John, a lot of people have been waiting a long time to get the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal open. Are we on time to get it open on Wednesday?" Slade asked. "Yes indeed. It will open on time and within budget on Wednesday, May 16, and we are excited, too," Kennedy said. Sure it opened Wednesday. But on budget? Even with all the delays? Other officials have made similar claims. We asked Kennedy for proof. PolitiFact Georgia also burrowed deep into The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s archives, where we uncovered a tale of dreams deferred and plans gone awry. Planning for the international terminal began in earnest more than a decade ago. Leaders envisioned a crescent-shaped terminal that would double the size of the international complex to 3 million square feet. The goal was to keep Hartsfield-Jackson competitive and improve its design. International passengers complained that they had to claim their baggage, carry it through U.S. Customs, recheck it and pick it up again. The trek covered more than a mile. Stories printed in November 2000 pegged the cost at $719 million, including additional parking, a taxiway and road upgrades. Leaders said it could be finished as early as 2004. Then things got complicated. Construction prices rose, and after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, so did the cost of security measures. Delta Air Lines went into bankruptcy, and leaders wondered whether the airport needed a new international terminal at all. The airport’s original design team was fired because the then-general manager of the airport, Ben DeCosta, said its plans would break the proposed $700 million budget. The team sued the city for $60 million. A yearlong audit that ended in May 2006 concluded that at an estimated cost of $1 billion, the international terminal was over budget. That number was low. In June 2007, the AJC obtained a copy of an internal briefing that showed that delays, design changes and rising construction costs could push the price tag as high as $1.5 billion. It would also be 400,000 square feet smaller than originally planned. At the time, airport officials also downplayed the $1.5 billion as a "preliminary" figure and said no final budget figure had been approved. But five months later, DeCosta confirmed to the Atlanta City Council that the number was well-researched and accurate. "The number has a lot of information behind it," DeCosta said, according to an AJC story Nov. 2007. "There are things that could push it higher, but this is close." DeCosta also downplayed significance of the earlier $700 million budget figure. Its purpose was to establish what share of construction costs the airlines would pay, he said. "They weren’t original cost estimates," DeCosta said. "There was no design at that point. They were just budget numbers." Regardless, the airport’s biggest airline, Delta, grew concerned. It is helping to pay for the new terminal, and by 2009, it worried that the ballooning price might double the airline's costs to board passengers at its main hub. The airline wanted the terminal’s costs trimmed by $400 million, the AJC reported. The latest tally: About $1.4 billion, just about what the 2007 internal briefing foretold. Final numbers will be available later in the year. This is nearly twice the $700 million floated 10 years ago. How does this count as "within budget"? Kennedy said he was talking about the formal budget, not the numbers from a decade ago. He sent us a budget document from May 13 of this year that placed the formal budget at $1.413 billion. The latest projected cost was $1.403 billion, which would mean that the terminal was about $10 million under budget. He noted that other city officials have used this number before. So what was that $700 million about? It wasn't a budget, Kennedy told PolitiFact Georgia in an email. It was a "preliminary concept estimate." "The $700 million ... was never a budgeted number -- it was merely a preliminary concept estimate made in the late 1990s for a proposed, future east side international terminal which, together with several other major airport projects, eventually became part the Airport's Master Plan of 2000," he wrote. "There were never any detailed planning or design documents produced for this concept." The Atlanta City Council and airlines did not formally approve a budget for the international terminal until March 2008, Kennedy said. By then, the design and other planning were complete. Kennedy added that the original $700 million figure was not up for discussion during the radio interview, and to take that figure into account in this story would be to take his comment out of context. This explanation made us groan. The distinction between a "preliminary concept estimate" and a "budgeted number" is important to technocrats. But when top leaders say in public that they expect an airport terminal to cost $700 million, taxpayers expect it to cost $700 million. Furthermore, the $700 million figure was crucial to the very people who planned the terminal. Former airport head DeCosta fired the airport's first design team, and Delta balked at backing the project when costs threatened to rise above this mark. Kennedy's claim that the airport terminal is "within budget" goes down in flames. Pants on Fire.	None	John Kennedy	None	None	None	2012-05-23T06:00:00	2012-05-13	['None']

pomt-10976	Says Leah Vukmir "wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/18/club-growth/did-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-seek-leniency-fel/	The national anti-tax group Club for Growth, whose political action committee is backing conservatives in seven U.S. Senate and House races around the country, released a TV ad through one of its affiliates that attacks Leah Vukmir. The ad, produced by CFG Action Wisconsin and released July 12, 2018, makes a series of claims against the Wisconsin Republican, starting with this one: "Vukmir wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault." As we’ll see, Vukmir did write a letter that was clearly in support of the lawmaker. The case Vukmir, a suburban Milwaukee state senator, and political newcomer Kevin Nicholson, who is endorsed by Club for Growth, are running in the GOP primary on Aug. 14, 2018. The winner will face Democrat Tammy Baldwin on Nov. 6, 2018. See all of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. The TV ad footnotes a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article that revealed the existence of Vukmir’s letter. The letter was sent on behalf of then-Rep. Bill Kramer of the Town of Waukesha, the onetime Republican leader of the state Assembly. According to the December 2017 article, which cited court records as a source: Vukmir wrote a brief character reference letter for Kramer in 2014, a month after Kramer pleaded no contest to two counts of fourth-degree sexual assault, both misdemeanors, in a plea bargain. He originally was charged with two felonies. The letter was sent to the judge in Waukesha County, in suburban Milwaukee, just before the judge sentenced Kramer to three years of probation that included five months in jail with work-release privileges. The conviction stemmed from a 2011 incident outside a Republican Party event at a tavern. The victim told the court she feared Kramer might rape her after she resisted his advances, which included shoving her against a car, forcibly kissing her, putting his hands up her shirt and grabbing her groin. The victim did not report it at the time, but came forward after Kramer allegedly groped a legislative aide’s breasts and bragged about his sexual prowess to a female lobbyist at a 2014 fundraiser in Washington, D.C. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The letter Here’s what Vukmir’s letter said: I have known Bill Kramer for over 12 years and consider him a friend. I have known Bill when he was drinking and I have known Bill when he was not drinking. By the time of his sentencing, Bill will have been sober for 270 days. Being sober has had a profound impact on Bill for the better. I also think it is important to recognize that Bill became sober under his own volition. Bill became sober to improve his life, not because he was sent to a court-mandated program. I believe this change has improved Bill’s life considerably. Analysis Club for Growth spokesman Bob Pipkin defended the group’s claim by referring us to an article about the disclosure of Vukmir’s letter in the Wisconsin Gazette, which describes itself as a progressive, alternative newspaper. "We took the interpretation of a liberal Wisconsin newspaper; they interpreted it as leniency," he told us. A caption to a photo with the article says Vukmir sought leniency, although the headline and the first sentence of the article merely said Vukmir sent a letter supporting Kramer. Mattias Gugel, a Vukmir campaign spokesman, told us: "The accusation that Leah wrote a letter asking for leniency is a blatant lie. She simply spoke about a colleague seeking help for addiction issues." But it’s not as though Vukmir’s letter would have been seen by the judge as urging a harsher sentence for Kramer rather than a lighter one. We also sought views from two lawyers based in Waukesha County, where Kramer is from and where the crime occurred. Criminal defense lawyer Jerome Buting, known for his work on the case made famous by the film "Making a Murderer," said Vukmir’s letter does seek leniency: If you write a letter on behalf of a defendant at sentencing, most of the time I think it’s reasonable to assume that’s seeking leniency, whether it’s expressed that way or not. You're trying to convey to the judge that this one incident doesn’t necessarily portray everything about his (the defendant’s) character, and that is one of the big factors the court has to consider in sentencing. Paul Bucher, who does criminal defense work and is the former district attorney in Waukesha County, disagreed, saying some letters explicitly ask for leniency or no jail time and Vukmir’s doesn't: We do character letters all the time because all the court really knows about the client is what is in the criminal complaint. So, the job of a defense lawyer is to give the judge a broader picture of who is standing in front of him. (Vukmir’s letter is) a pretty standard, boilerplate, character letter. But even if it doesn’t go far as some, Vukmir’s letter clearly was written to help Kramer. Our rating Club for Growth says Vukmir "wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault." It’s fair to say that letters written on behalf of criminal defendants facing sentencing cover a range. Vukmir’s letter to the judge in Kramer’s case is limited to Kramer’s character. It doesn’t go as far as some letters in such cases that explicitly ask for leniency or lighter treatment, such as probation rather than jail. But while the word leniency might mean different things to different people, it’s clear that Vukmir’s letter was written to benefit Kramer — in other words, seeking a lighter sentence, rather than a harsher one. We rate Club for Growth’s statement Mostly True. Editor's note: This item was corrected on July 18, 2018, after it was first published, to clarify the Club for Growth entities.

pomt-00680	"There are more poor people today as a percentage of our population than the 1970s."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/may/07/jeb-bush/poverty-rate-higher-now-1970s/	When asked about the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died following an April 12 arrest in Baltimore, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush turned the subject to poverty. "We need as a nation to have a conversation about why is it we are creating these big pockets of poverty where people are completely dependent, they can’t live a life of independence," Bush told reporters at the North Carolina GOP headquarters May 1. "And have a meaningful discussion about it -- not saying we need more money. We've had a war on poverty since the 1960s where we've spent trillions of dollars, and there are more poor people today as a percentage of our population than the 1970s." Are there more poor people today as a percentage of our population than the 1970s? By the official measure, yes, but experts also rely on a different calculation that changes the results. Poverty rates The U.S. Census Bureau determines national poverty rates using income and the cost of food. Specifically, it compares pre-tax cash income against a threshold set at three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, updated annually for inflation and adjusted for family size. In 2014 for a family of four, for example, the poverty level was about $24,000. The poverty rate is whatever percentage of the population falls below the poverty level. Census figures show that the official poverty rate was 14.5 percent in 2013, while during the 1970s the range was between 11.7 and 12.6 percent. So Bush’s claim about the numbers is correct by the official poverty measure. Ron Haskins, who helped write the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, cited several favors for the increasing poverty rate in his testimony to a U.S. Senate committee in 2012. "Declining work rates, stagnant wages, the rise of female-headed families, inferior education, and the arrival of millions of immigrants with poor education and low skills are little engines pushing up the poverty rate," he said. "Conditions in the U.S. virtually ensure high poverty rates because the underlying factors that cause poverty have remained very strong." Bush’s statement referred to the overall official poverty rate, but it’s worth noting that poverty rates for the elderly have fallen since the 1970s while the poverty rate for children has increased. The declining rates for the elderly are related to increases in Social Security, but higher poverty rates for children are more vexing. "The standard explanation for that is the family breakdown, mothers living alone, a weak job market, globalization, everything that keeps wages down for people who have children," said University of Maryland public policy professor Douglas Besharov, who was previously with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "If you are conservative, you talk about poverty by unwed births. If you are more liberal, you talk about poverty as a result of weak job demand. It’s both, and they interact." Finally, while it’s fair game for Bush to cite the official poverty measure, we also found that some experts think that it doesn’t tell the full story. In the past few years, the Census started testing an alternative measurement of poverty called the Supplemental Poverty Measure. That measure takes into account cash earned as well as government benefits such as as food assistance and tax credit programs. Under this alternative measure, the rate was 15.5 percent in 2013. Columbia University researchers took the 2012 supplemental poverty measure and adjusted it back to 1967. Under that measure, the poverty rate was between 22.1 percent and 17.7 percent in the 1970s, compared with 15.5 percent in 2013. So if we used this adjusted rate, Bush’s statement would be wrong. Our ruling Bush said, "There are more poor people today as a percentage of our population than the 1970s." Bush’s figures are correct based on the official poverty rate, which showed the rate was 14.5 percent in 2013, while during the 1970s the range was between 11.7 and 12.6 percent. Some poverty researchers say the official poverty rate between the 1970s and now doesn’t take into account certain benefits that help poor people, such as food assistance and tax credits. However, despite those caveats, it is fair for Bush to point to the official poverty rate. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-05-07T14:59:31	2015-05-01	['None']
pomt-00730	"Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/23/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-americans-will-spend-more-taxes-/	On April 14, 2015, Scott Walker asked followers of his personal Twitter account if they’ve been taxed enough already. "Did you know, Americans will spend more on taxes in 2015 than on food, clothing and housing combined?" Walker’s campaign team tweeted. (We know Walker didn’t personally pen it because it’s signed "TW," for Team Walker). The tweet highlighted a chart showing Americans collectively paid $4.8 trillion in taxes in 2014, more than the total of the three life essentials. It’s a claim PolitiFact National checked in 2014 and 2011 after identical statements by the Tax Foundation and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, respectively. Both those were rated Half True. Let’s see what the latest figures show. Digging into the numbers Walker’s campaign told us he relied on the Tax Foundation’s annual "tax freedom" day report. Among other things, that report examines taxing and spending figures based on U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Both the Tax Foundation and Walker make clear they are using collective taxing and spending figures -- by using a chart, in Walker’s case, and words and charts in the Tax Foundation’s case. One cautionary note: Full data is not yet available for 2015, since we are not even at the midpoint of the year. The Tax Foundation based its claim about 2015 on 2014 figures that it adjusts for economic growth predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the group. We checked the BEA’s data for 2014, the latest available, and found a significant edge for total taxes paid over the aggregate amount spend on food, housing and clothing. Total spending on groceries, restaurant meals, clothing, footwear, housing and utilities came to $4.2 trillion. Meanwhile, taxes -- local, state and federal -- rang up to $4.9 trillion. For perspective, total personal consumer expenditures, which includes additional things like vehicles, recreation and health care, were $11.9 trillion in 2014. In recent years, the federal figures show, taxes have consistently topped food, shelter and clothing. Another perspective But PolitiFact National’s earlier work points out there is another way to look at the comparison: by examining what individual Americans pay. That’s a complex task, but one way to do it is to examine what people at different income levels spend and pay in taxes as a share of their total income. Through that lens, many poorer Americans likely pay a higher share of their income on food, shelter and clothing, in part because they pay little in taxes. Conversely, richer Americans may well pay a higher fraction of their income in taxes and a smaller share for those essentials. So by this other method, for many people, Walker’s claim does not hold up. The 2014 item concluded that a majority of Americans probably pay more for the three essentials than for taxes. Our rating Walker claimed, based on what happened in 2014, that Americans in 2015 collectively will spend more on taxes than they do on food, housing and clothing combined. The statement is partially accurate -- on target based on past experience by the method Walker uses, but inaccurate by another method that examines the claim in a fuller context. That’s a Half True on our meter.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-04-23T13:13:38	2015-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-12849	"This is longest that the nation has gone without a secretary of the Treasury, at least in modern times. If it's not the longest, it's darn close to it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/02/kellyanne-conway/longest-united-states-has-gone-without-secretary-t/	White House counselor Kellyanne Conway blasted Senate Democrats for holding up Cabinet nominee appointments and said their delay has unprecedented consequences. "I was told yesterday, that this is longest that the nation has gone without a secretary of the Treasury, at least in modern times," Conway said Feb. 2 on Fox and Friends. "If it's not the longest, it's darn close to it." This piqued our interest. Is this really the longest the United States has gone without a secretary of the Treasury? Well, no. In fact, you don’t have to look that far back to find a longer period of time when the United States was without a president-appointed, Senate-confirmed Treasury secretary. Donald Trump nominated longtime banker and former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin to fill the Treasury secretary position in late November. The Department of the Treasury oversees financial and monetary matters, and its secretary is fifth in the presidential line of succession. Since Jan. 20, 2017, Adam Jacob Szubin has served as acting Treasury secretary — taking over the job from former President Barack Obama’s appointment, Jack Lew. So over the past two weeks, there has actually been someone in place overseeing the agency’s business, unlike what Conway intimated. An incoming administration also has the power to designate acting heads of the various departments until the confirmation process is over. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee delayed a vote on Mnuchin Jan. 30 by refusing to attend the meeting, denying Republicans the number of Democrats they need to go forward with a vote. (The Democrats did the same thing for other Trump appointment Rep. Tom Price, the health and human services nominee.) The issue they had with Mnuchin, they said, was that he made misleading statements during his nomination hearing about whether his former bank, OneWest, used automated "robo-signings" of foreclosure documents. But Republicans fought back, changed procedural rules and advanced the nominee through the committee Feb. 1. His nomination will now move on to the full Senate. Conway said that this is the longest that the nation has gone without a secretary of the Treasury, but there have been longer periods with an acting secretary. When former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner left the post in 2013, Obama nominated Jack Lew to replace him on Jan. 10, 2013. Geithner left office on Jan. 25, and Lew was not confirmed until Feb. 27, 2013. From Jan. 25, 2013, to Feb. 27, 2013, Neal Wolin served as acting secretary. Adding up the days in that gap show the United States did not have an officially appointed Treasury secretary for 34 days, obviously longer than the 14-day window Conway mentioned Feb. 2. Going back a little further to the transition of power from former President George W. Bush to Obama in 2009, there was a only a seven-day gap between when acting Treasury Secretary Stuart Levy served and Geithner took office. Bush nominated three Treasury secretaries during his tenure, all with varying times before taking office. The first nomination was Paul O’Neill in 2001. He only served until Dec. 31, 2002, so Bush nominated John Snow on Jan. 13, 2003, to fill his spot. Snow wasn’t appointed until Feb. 3, 2003, so Kenneth Dam served as acting secretary from Dec. 31, 2002, to Feb. 3, 2003. That’s 35 days. After Snow, Bush nominated Henry M. Paulson in 2006. Before he was confirmed, Robert Kimmitt was acting Treasury secretary for 11 days. Conway’s slight walkback that if Mnuchin’s wait is the longest ever — if not "darn close" — doesn’t hold up. Our ruling Conway said, "This is longest that the nation has gone without a secretary of the Treasury, at least in modern times. If it's not the longest, it's darn close to it." Conway is wrong. The United States didn’t have a president-appointed, Senate-confirmed secretary of Treasury for 34 days in 2013. Mnuchin’s confirmation could drag out longer, but Conway made this claim on Feb. 2, 14 days after inauguration. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8712097e-8b51-4f6b-be28-cc14fda204de	None	Kellyanne Conway	None	None	None	2017-02-02T17:21:42	2017-02-02	['None']
pomt-10090	"We are within the margin of error."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/30/john-mccain/updated-mccain-is-right-about-5-of-11-polls/	UPDATED NOV. 1: Sen. John McCain sounded upbeat in a Halloween morning interview on CNBC. But was the enthusiasm just a mask? We can't be sure. But we can check some data McCain cited to justify his optimism. "I'm very optimistic, and we're coming from behind," McCain told anchor Larry Kudlow in the Oct. 31, 2008, interview. "I'm the underdog. There's where we always like to be. But we are within the margin of error, my friends. And I'm very happy where we are." McCain was clearly talking about national polls, which are not necessarily indicative of Electoral College results. Nevertheless, only four presidents have won the election without winning the national popular vote — John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, Benjamin Harrison in 1888 and George W. Bush in 2000. So we looked at every national poll we could find from the day McCain spoke and the day before to see if he really was within the margin of error. Five polls were released the same morning McCain was speaking. Rasmussen's daily tracking poll showed Obama up 51 to 47 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. That means if one gives McCain the full benefit of the margin of error, his score could be as high as 49 percent (his 47 plus the 2-point margin of error) and Obama's could be as low as 49 percent (his 51 minus the margin of error). There's a very low probability of that outcome, but still, it's within the margin of error. The method we employed above of factoring in the margin of error is the one most commonly used by pollsters and political scientists. Some statisticians quibble with it and use a more complicated calculation, but we think it's fair to judge McCain's claim by the most common measure. (We can say for certain that another method the media commonly use — saying a race is within the margin of error only if the gap between the candidates is smaller than the margin of error — is wrong. You have to apply the margin to both candidates' scores.) Let's look at more polls from Oct. 31. The Diageo/Hotline tracking poll had Obama up 48 to 41 with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, a lead that was outside the margin of error. The Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll showed Obama up 50 to 43 with a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points, also outside the margin of error. Research 2000/Daily Kos had Obama up 51-45 with a 3-point margin of error, just within the margin of error. And an Associated Press-Yahoo News poll showed Obama up 51 to 43 with a margin of error of 3 percentage points, back outside the margin of error. Let's look at the polls released the previous day, Oct. 30. A Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Obama leading 52 to 44 with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points — no dice for McCain on that one. The New York Times/CBS News poll showed Obama leading 51 to 40 with a margin of error of three percentage points — even worse news for McCain. The Investor's Business Daily/ TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy poll showed Obama leading 47.7 to 43.6, a lead well within the margin of error of 3.5 points. The GWU/Battleground poll showed Obama up 49 to 45, also within the 3.5 percent margin of error. The Gallup daily tracking poll had Obama up 50 to 45 with a traditional model of turnout, and 51 to 44 with an expanded turnout; both outside the 2-point margin of error. A FOX News/Opinion Dynamics poll had Obama leading 47 to 44, easily within the 3-point margin of error. So McCain was within the "margin of error" in five of the 11 polls we checked. We find his statement Half True. UPDATE: Our original item mistakenly calculated the margin of error without using its impact on the number for both candidates. We have changed the calculations, which changed our ruling from Barely True to Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-30T00:00:00	2008-10-31	['None']
pomt-06005	"[Mitt] Romney and [Brendan] Doherty certainly have a lot in common, like flip-flopping on abortion -- in Doherty's case, in a little over a week."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/19/stephanie-desilva/rhode-island-democratic-party-says-republican-bren/	Opponents of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have gained some traction by criticizing the former Massachusetts governor for flip-flopping on the abortion issue. So it shouldn't have been surprising that the Rhode Island Democratic Party would try to use the same tactic against Brendan Doherty, the Republican running for Congress in the 1st District against Democratic Rep. David Cicilline. In a Jan. 11, 2012, news release about Doherty stumping for Romney in New Hampshire, the Democratic party's executive director, Stephanie DeSilva, contends, "Romney and Doherty certainly have a lot in common, like flip-flopping on abortion -- in Doherty's case, in a little over a week." PolitiFact has already addressed the issue of whether Romney flip-flopped on abortion and found that it was True. For this item, we will look at Doherty's stance. The news release from DeSilva doesn't say how Doherty's opinion has changed, only that it has. So we e-mailed DeSilva. She responded that the information came from a June 1, 2011, web page on GoLocalProv.com headlined, "Doherty Shifts Abortion Stance." "Just weeks after announcing his run for Congress, former State Police Supt. Brendan Doherty is already apparently changing his position on a key issue -- abortion," the story said. GoLocalProv found that a May 31 position statement on DohertyForCongress.com was different from what had appeared eight days earlier. And what was the change? GoLocalProv says that the website said on May 23: "Abortion - As always, I support the decision of the United States Supreme Court who [sic] has determined that abortions are a legal right. I am, however, personally pro-life." On May 31, GoLocalProv said, the statement had been changed to: "Abortion - I am pro-life." That's also what we saw when we checked Doherty's site on Jan. 12, 2012. How significant is the rewording? We realize that the terms "pro-life" or "pro-choice" mean different things to different people. Some who call themselves pro-life reluctantly support abortion in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother's life. Some who call themselves pro-choice would never choose to have an abortion themselves or are opposed to partial birth abortion. But few people who are staunch opponents of abortion rights would express any degree of support for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that abortions are a legal right. To them, the original language on Doherty's website would sound like double-speak. When we contacted the Doherty campaign to talk to the candidate about the nuances -- if any -- about his abortion stand, we were told he was not available. "The original language was found to be confusing to some people and was adjusted to clarify Brendan's position," said his political director, Robert Coupe. "The website has stated consistently and accurately Brendan's position that he is pro-life." So why did he express support for the Supreme Court's ruling legalizing abortion? "The original statement expressed Brendan's intent to abide by Supreme Court decisions on the issue," Coupe said. "Throughout his career in law enforcement, Brendan [a former head of the Rhode Island State Police] had pledged to uphold the Constitution, which meant abiding by various Supreme Court rulings and I believe that perspective accounts for the 'as always' introductory phrase." To get a better idea where Doherty stands, we e-mailed the campaign to ask, if elected to Congress, would Doherty work to have the Supreme Court overturn Roe vs. Wade. Coupe's response: "Brendan will remain consistent in his pro-life position." So where Doherty falls on the abortion spectrum -- whether he supports filing attempted murder charges against women who seek an abortion, whether he would endorse abortion in some cases, or whether he thinks the question has been settled -- remains a mystery because his campaign won't discuss specifics. Our ruling Stephanie DeSilva, executive director of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, said Doherty changed his position on abortion in a little over a week. It is true that a change was made to the phrasing on his website. His campaign removed an ambiguous statement that could be read as supporting the Supreme Court’s decision legalizing abortion. His spokesman said that wasn’t the statement’s intent -- but then refused to answer whether Doherty would work to overturn Roe vs. Wade. On the other hand, Doherty clearly said he was "pro-life," in both versions, even if the Supreme Court reference would make staunch abortion opponents wary. Because her statement "is partially accurate but leaves out important details," we rule it Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-09518	"There have been three people tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts. Two are walking the street right now."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/16/joe-biden/two-three-convicted-military-commissions-released/	The current and former vice presidents -- Joe Biden and Dick Cheney -- battled it out on separate Sunday morning talk shows on Feb. 14, 2010, debating the Obama administration's policies on bringing accused terrorists to justice. At times, their debate seemed more like a philosophical argument: Should terrorists be treated like vanquished military opponents or common criminals? If you believe the former, you would support trying the accused in front of military commissions at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. If you believe the latter, you would favor trying them in U.S. courts. Biden offered a full-throated defense of Obama administration plans to try Khalid Sheik Mohammed in U.S. courts, even though the administration supports commissions for some cases. One of Biden's arguments was that U.S. courts work better and result in tougher sentences. "Let me put this in perspective," Biden said on Face the Nation. "There have been three people tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts. Two are walking the street right now. There have been over 300 tried in federal courts by the last administration and by us. They're all in jail now. None of them are out seeing the light of day." We're looking into Biden's assertion that more than 300 people have been tried in federal courts and will post our findings soon. Here, we are examining Biden's assertion that three people were tried and convicted by the last administration in military commissions, and that two of three have been released. After consulting news reports and military documents, we discovered that Biden was correct. We also checked with experts who both support and oppose military commissions for various reasons, and no one disputed Biden's numbers. Before we summarize the three cases, we should point out a few things about military commissions, which Congress authorized in laws passed in 2006 and 2009. The commissions operate under rules that are more favorable to the government than the rules typically found in federal courts, and the jurors are all members of the military. But that doesn't mean prosecutors always get what they want. In some cases, juries refuse to convict, and a military judge can allow or exclude evidence. Here are the details on the three cases: • David Hicks of Australia was the first person convicted by a military commission under the Military Commissions Act of 2006, according to the Department of Defense. A native Australian, Hicks was a convert to Islam who was in Afghanistan before Sept. 11, 2001, and was picked up by U.S. forces in December of that year. The government said he had trained in al-Qaida camps. Hicks' case gained prominence in Australia, with members of the public urging his release. In a plea deal, Hicks pleaded guilty in March 2007 to one charge of providing material support to terrorism, an offense with a maximum sentence of life in prison. The commission sentenced Hicks to seven years, though most of that was suspended in an agreement that sent Hicks back to Australia to serve out his sentence. Hicks left an Australian prison and returned home in December 2007. On his release, Hicks issued a statement saying he intended to honor a plea deal not to talk to the media for one year, though he did add, "I would like to recognize the huge debt of gratitude that I owe the Australian public for getting me home." Hicks married in 2009 and is reportedly writing a book. • Salim Hamdan was Osama bin Laden's driver. Prosecutors argued he was a dangerous terrorist, while his defense attorneys said he was a low-level aide. The military commission's jury found him guilty of providing material support for terrorism in August 2008, but sentenced him to little more than time served. The Bush administration sent him back to Yemen in November 2008. Reuters reported that the Yemeni government released him from jail in January 2009. (Hamdan was the petitioner in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, the U.S. Supreme Court case that overturned initial Bush administration efforts at setting up military commissions.) In August, he was living with his wife and two daughters in Sana'a, Yemen. • Ali Hamza al Bahlul made propaganda videos at the direction of Osama bin Laden. In November 2009, a military commission jury convicted him of 35 counts of conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and providing material support for terrorism. Not only did Bahlul not allow his attorneys to put on a defense, but he also told the jury he volunteered for the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that bin Laden turned him down, according to press reports. The jury sentenced him to life in prison, and Bahlul remains in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. To be fair, we asked a supporter of military commissions about Biden's point, that there haven't been many convictions through military tribunals. Andrew McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney and a national security commentator for the conservative National Review, said that the commissions have been constantly challenged by liberal attorneys, which has hampered their progress. "It is more than a little rich for the very people who moved heaven and earth to prevent the commissions from being completed now complain that we didn't complete very many commissions," McCarthy said. In the interview on Face the Nation, Biden said he believed traditional federal courts would provide the longest sentences to terrorists, based on their track record of convictions. Of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, Biden said, "Looking at the evidence that's been made available to me as part of, in a generic sense, the executive branch and the prosecuting team, I am absolutely convinced he will be put away for a long, long time." The debate on military commissions versus federal courts will no doubt continue. Here, we're checking Biden's statement that three people had been tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts, and that two are "walking the street right now." The facts support that, and we rate his statement True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2010-02-16T18:56:19	2010-02-16	['None']
pomt-13624	Says Hillary Clinton "doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/aug/11/national-rifle-association/nra-ad-falsely-says-clinton-doesnt-believe-your-ri/	In a new multi-million-dollar ad buy, the NRA attacks Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s stance on guns. Clinton, the ad says, doesn’t want gun owners to be able to protect themselves. The National Rifle Association said it’s spending $3 million on the ad in North Carolina plus other "key battleground states" of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada. "She’s one of the wealthiest women in politics," the ad begins. "Combined income: $30 million. Tours the world on private jets. Protected by armed guards for 30 years. But she doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense." Not even counting its TV exposure, the ad had been watched more than 100,000 times online within a day of being uploaded. We’re interested in the crux of the ad, which claims Clinton "doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense." Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, has made similar claims before. He got a False for saying Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment in May and again in July. PolitiFact has also given a Pants on Fire ruling to a viral image that spread online during the primary, saying Clinton said she wants to shut down the NRA and ban handguns. Now the NRA has also entered the fray, launching its ad campaign the day after Trump said that "Second Amendment people" might be able to somehow stop Clinton. Clinton’s communications manager for North Carolina, Andrew Bates, said the ad contains "lies" about Clinton because she supports gun control measures the NRA doesn’t like. Clinton’s past statements Clinton has had a fairly consistent view on gun rights: She says she respects the Second Amendment but thinks more regulations are OK to try to curb gun violence. Her website has details of her specific proposals, and she has also made a number of public statements. In August 2015, after a news crew in Virginia was murdered on-camera, Clinton said, "We've got to do something. It's a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures." When Clinton was running for president in 2008, she said virtually the same thing in a debate and argued for reinstating a ban on assault weapons that expired under George W. Bush. Her husband, Bill Clinton, signed the ban into law with support from former presidents Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. "You know, I believe in the Second Amendment," Clinton said in the debate. "People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this." Clinton has also made gun rights supporters nervous at times. She once suggested a voluntary gun buyback program, although she compared it to one in Australia – not realizing the Australian program was a mandatory confiscation, not a buyback. And in an interview with ABC News anchor (and former Bill Clinton advisor) George Stephanopoulos, she declined to say for certain that she agrees the right to bear arms applies to individuals, which the Supreme Court decided in the landmark 2008 Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller. "If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation," she said. Criticisms Jennifer Baker, the public affairs director for the NRA’s lobbying arm, said the ad is accurate because of Clinton’s stance on the Heller case. If Clinton becomes president, Baker said, she will be tasked with picking a judge to replace the late Antonin Scalia, who sided with the 5-4 majority on Heller. Baker said the NRA doesn't want the court to take another shot at the Second Amendment and reverse its decision on gun rights. "If she were elected one of the first things she would be able to do is appoint a Scalia replacement who could overturn Heller," Baker said. That’s possible. Of course, there’s no guarantee the currently Republican-led Senate would agree to nominate someone with real or perceived anti-gun views. Nor is there a guarantee another similar case will come up anytime soon. Heller was the first time the Supreme Court had interpreted the Second Amendment since 1939, according to the Library of Congress. So what other proof does the NRA have? The backbone of its argument is a secretly taken audio recording from a private meeting last year in which Clinton criticized the Heller decision. The court ruled that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to own weapons for self-defense, even though no such language appears in the Second Amendment. However, the case was not only about that single issue — more on that in a second — and in the audio Clinton never mentions anything about self-defense or individual rights. Instead, she is criticizing another aspect of the ruling, regarding the government’s ability to regulate guns. "The idea that you could have an open carry permit with an AK-47 over your shoulder walking up and down the aisles of a supermarket is just despicable," Clinton is heard saying. "So I’m going to speak out. … The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment, and I am going to make my case on that every chance I get." Similarities to George W. Bush Clinton’s invocation of a machine gun and public carry might have sounded oddly familiar to George W. Bush. Those were two issues his administration was also concerned about during the Heller case. Conservatives and liberals alike might not like to hear this, but it’s true: Clinton’s stance is similar to Bush’s. They would likely disagree on specifics. Yet both have argued that the right to bear arms needs to be upheld, but that it’s not an absolute right and can be regulated, just like the right to free speech. Bush’s solicitor general, Paul Clement, wrote a brief on behalf of the government. He said the decision by the appeals court was too broad and asked the Supreme Court not to uphold it (the court ultimately did, leading to Clinton’s criticisms years later). The Bush administration wasn’t arguing that people have no individual right to own guns for self-defense. Instead, it was worried a favorable ruling could weaken the government’s ability in to restrict public access to machine guns or the carrying of weapons in public. Clement argued the decision "could cast doubt on the constitutionality of existing federal legislation prohibiting the possession of certain firearms, including machineguns," and that the Second Amendment "is not infringed by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons." We doubt many people will accuse Clement — who represented the NRA at the Supreme Court a couple years after leaving the White House — or Bush of being anti-gun. And their concerns over machine guns and unrestricted carry were the same that Clinton was recorded talking about, which the NRA cited for its ad. Our ruling The NRA said Clinton "doesn’t believe in your right to keep a gun at home for self-defense." Clinton has never said that, nor could she do anything about it on her own even if she wanted to. She would need to rely on a new Supreme Court justice, who would first have to be approved by the currently Republican-led Senate. Clinton did say she disagreed with the Heller ruling, as the NRA points out. But she was talking about specifics and cited the same worries raised by the Bush administration, about looser restrictions on automatic weapons or carrying in public. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6645d7e7-d467-4db6-8d8f-35b88b37dd55	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2016-08-11T18:36:50	2016-08-10	['None']
pomt-05712	"Tonight in Ohio, more people came out to vote for Barack Obama in an unopposed race than voted for (Mitt) Romney and (Rick) Santorum combined."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/07/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-barack-obama-won-more-ohio-vote/	During election night coverage of the Super Tuesday contests on March 6, 2012, NBC’s Brian Williams interviewed David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign. In that interview, Axelrod tried to shift the focus from that night’s GOP primary fight in Ohio -- in which Mitt Romney edged out Rick Santorum statewide -- to the president’s reelection bid. "Tonight in Ohio, more people came out to vote for Barack Obama in an unopposed race than voted for Romney and Santorum combined," Axelrod told Williams. A reader asked us to check this claim, so we did. We looked at the Ohio Secretary of State’s election results page and found the following statewide totals as of the morning after the primary, at which point 100 percent of precincts had been counted. Here are the totals: Obama: 547,588 votes (100 percent of the Democratic primary vote) Romney: 456,205 votes (37.95 percent of the Republican primary vote) Santorum: 445,697 votes (37.07 percent of the Republican primary vote) Total of Romney and Santorum: 901,902 votes Clearly, Obama didn’t outpoll the combination of Romney and Santorum. He did outpoll them each individually, so Axelrod would have been correct if he’d said that Obama won more votes than "either Romney or Santorum." We do have an educated guess about where Axelrod may have gotten the idea, though. At 8:17 p.m., BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith, a prominent national political journalist, tweeted, "Huh: So far more votes for Obama in OH tonight than for all Republicans (who have actual campaigns) combined." However, 14 minutes later, Smith walked back that comment: "Ah: The early pile of votes for Obama seems to be because Cuyahoga among the first reporting." Smith was referring to Cuyahoga County, which is home to Cleveland. Not only is Cuyahoga County a populous jurisdiction that votes heavily Democratic, but voters in a portion of it were especially likely to vote that day because of another race on the ballot -- the hotly contested face-off, forced by redistricting, between incumbent Democratic House members Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich. All told, 39 percent of the new congressional district is in Cuyahoga. Having a large number of ballots counted early in the evening from Cuyahoga would boost Obama's turnout numbers compared to the Republican candidates. Axelrod’s interview was at 10:30 p.m., which was well after Smith’s correction tweet. Our ruling Axelrod’s claim turned out to be off by a wide margin by the time all votes were counted and was almost certainly wrong at the time he said it. We rate the claim False. UPDATE: Shortly after we posted the item, Axelrod tweeted to take responsibility for his error: "Guilty as charged! I misspoke during an interview last night and PolitiFact rightly called me on it.."

pomt-06828	Says Adam Hasner’s record includes "requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/08/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-attacks-adam-hasners-over-922-milli/	Adam Hasner, fake conservative? That's the contention being made by George LeMieux, as the two Republicans vie for the GOP nomination to take on incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. LeMieux, a former U.S. senator, is challenging Hasner, a former Florida House majority leader, on two core issues: taxes and spending. LeMieux campaign e-mails and Web posts on Aug. 1, 2011, show a cartoon Hasner wearing a joker hat and holding a mask in his hand. He is attending his own "masquerade ball" — one where he’s only pretending to be conservative. "The Masquerade Ball gown Hasner has chosen on the key issues of taxes and spending is a prime example. Hasner’s rhetoric simply does not match his record. Hasner’s record includes: • Increasing Spending – A 40% increase during his time in the legislature. • Requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks. • Billions in new taxes and fees. • Voting to accept Obama stimulus money." The earmark claim caught our eye. Hasner, elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2002, served as majority leader from 2008-10 before term limits ended his run. That means plenty of time to rack up requests for pet projects. But did he request "over $92.2 million in earmarks"? And if he did, how did that compare with requests by other lawmakers? A more detailed look at Hasner’s record at GeorgeForFlorida.com clarifies the LeMieux campaign was talking about Florida’s twist on the earmark, the "Community Budget Issue Request." As we’ve written in other "earmark" fact-checks, it’s a way state legislators use to request funding for local projects. Lawmakers had to file requests — for a local park, say, or a new community wastewater system — and attach their names to each one. The Legislature stopped the practice in 2009 as budgets got tighter. But the Florida House keeps an archive of such requests, funded and unfunded, at FloridaHouse.gov. A PolitiFact Florida analysis of lawmakers’ requests from 2003-08 shows Hasner indeed made use of CBIRs to ask for state funding for everything from a community child care center in Delray Beach ($25,000) to support for a medical cluster and research institute in the Miami area ($20 million). He requested $1 million for "manatee avoidance technology," made regular requests on behalf of brain injury prevention efforts among seniors ($199,450) and asked for taxpayer aid for drainage improvements, boardwalk replacements and reclaimed water systems. Over six years, his requests total just over $92.2 million. We’ll mention that the archive doesn’t make it clear which projects ultimately won funding, and indeed some requests may have been made year after year precisely because they failed to attract lawmaker support. We wondered how Hasner’s requests ranked among the 120 House members. When we listed lawmakers from most to least requested per year, here's where Hasner fell: Rep. Adam Hasner’s Community Budget Issue Requests 2003-08 Year Amount requested Rank among lawmakers 2003 $8.2 million 64th 2004 $1.6 million 95th 2005 $5.9 million 76th 2006 $20.9 million 48th 2007 $55.4 million 17th 2008 $385,000 109th That means the amount of local funding Hasner requested for his district was in the bottom half of lawmakers in four out of six years, though it jumped to the 60th percentile in 2006, the year before he served as deputy majority leader, and the 86th percentile in 2007, the year before he took the top seat. But even in 2007, the amount Hasner requested was eclipsed by top CBIR filers, such as Rep. Marti Coley, R-Marianna, who wanted $202.3 million for projects in her district — nearly four times Hasner’s total. A couple of other notes. First, we feel we should at least mention that LeMieux has a record of voting for earmarks while he was in the U.S. Senate. LeMieux, who hadn’t held elected office before he was appointed to U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez’s seat in 2009 by his former boss, Gov. Charlie Crist, has claimed he never requested a single earmark. But he didn’t have to: Earmarks bound for Florida were already packed into appropriations bills before LeMieux took over for Martinez. LeMieux voted for several such bills. He also actively lobbied for local stimulus projects. Later, he voted for a moratorium to ban federal earmarks through 2013 — but so did Sen. Bill Nelson. Meanwhile, as the Florida economy faltered, Hasner cut his own local funding requests in 2008 to a single item — $385,000. That put him last among more than 100 lawmakers who made local funding requests. And he was in the leadership when the decision was made to stop such requests altogether. Hasner’s campaign, for the record, thinks it’s unfair to call Community Budget Issue Requests "earmarks," which campaign spokesman Douglass Mayer said evokes last-minute congressional handshake deals. "The difference here is transparency," Mayer said. "CBIRs are submitted with full accountability and voted on in the light of day. Earmarks are snuck in the backdoor of the federal budget process to avoid accountability." But CBIRs are often referred to as Florida’s version of the earmark, and documentation from the LeMieux campaign makes the reference clear. Where does this leave us? LeMieux’s campaign says that "(Adam) Hasner’s record includes … requesting over $92.2 million in earmarks." On the numbers, LeMieux is right -- from 2003-08 Hasner requested $92.2 million for projects through a process called Community Budget Issue Requests. But we think there are a couple of caveats worth noting. First is the CBIR process itself -- which was open and transparent. Legislators made requests for dollars in writing and were forced to explain what the money would be used for. Second, it's important to note that Hasner wasn't particularly aggressive in requesting money through CBIRs and more than 100 House members asked for more than he did in 2008. Lastly, it strikes us as hypocritical for LeMieux to attack competitors over earmarks when his own record — where it exists — shows votes and personal lobbying for local spending.

pomt-09902	"Now, there was a time when someone like Scalia and Ginsburg got 95-plus votes."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/13/lindsey-graham/supreme-court-nominees-got-senate-votes-big-margin/	Sen. Lindsey Graham got a few chuckles during the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Judge Sonia Sotomayor. "Now, unless you have a complete meltdown, you're going to get confirmed," he said, adding that he didn't expect such a meltdown. Graham, R-S.C., then went on to more philosophical ruminations about how senators decide to vote for or against nominees, citing then-Sen. Barack Obama's reasoning for voting against nominee John Roberts in 2005. "He said something about the 5 percent of the cases that we're all driven by," Graham said. "He said something to the effect, in those difficult cases, the critical ingredient is applied by what is in the judge's heart. Well, I have no way of knowing what is in your heart any more than you have knowing what's in my heart. So that to me is an absurd, dangerous standard." (Read Obama's full 2005 statement on John Roberts .) Graham added that it used to be that nominees would be confirmed by large margins, even nominees who had established views on controversial issues. "Now, there was a time when someone like (Antonin) Scalia and (Ruth) Ginsburg got 95-plus votes," Graham said. "If you were confused about where Scalia was coming down as a judge, you shouldn't be voting, any more than if (it was) a mystery about what Justice Ginsburg was going to do in these 5 percent of the cases. That is no mystery." To be clear, we're not ruling on Graham's philosophy for confirming Supreme Court nominees. But we wondered if the margins were as large as Graham said for the confirmation votes of Justices Scalia and Ginsburg, who represent the conservative and liberal extremes of the court, respectively. It turns out Graham is right. Scalia, who was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, was confirmed by a vote of 98-0 on Sept. 17, 1986. Ginsburg, nominated by President Bill Clinton, was confirmed by a vote of 96-3 on Aug. 3, 1993. (You can browse the votes for all Supreme Court nominees on the U.S. Senate Web site.) Graham said he didn't know how he would vote on Sotomayor, and that he would respect senators who didn't feel that they could vote in favor of her. But he also seemed to urge a return to deference for a president's nominee. "President Obama won the election and I will respect that," Graham said. "But when he was here (as a senator), he set in motion a standard, I thought, that was more about seeking the presidency than being fair to the nominee when he said, 'The critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart.' Translated, that means, 'I'm not going to vote against my base, because I'm running for president.' We've got a chance to start over. I hope we'll take that chance." Graham may be giving Obama too much credit (or blame) by saying Obama "set in motion" a standard of voting against nominees based on political leanings. Reagan appointee Robert Bork, for example, lost a 42-58 Senate confirmation vote amid much partisan rancor in 1987. Obama was then a community organizer in Chicago. Here, though, we're checking if Graham was right that Scalia and Ginsburg were confirmed by such large margins. They were. We rate Graham's statement True.

pomt-00274	Under Phil Bredesen, in sexual harassment cases, his administration chose "to shred some of the documents so that women’s voices would never be heard."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/02/marsha-blackburn/blackburn-miscasts-bredesen-role-harassment-cases/	Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn brought the #MeToo movement into the first U.S. Senate debate with Democrat Phil Bredesen. Blackburn took a question about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and turned it into a jab at Bredesen’s handling of sexual harassment cases as Tennessee governor. "When Phil was governor there was an issue where sexual harassment claims doubled one year," Blackburn said. "And what they chose to do was to shred some of the documents so that women’s voices would never be heard. They died in that shredder and their voices were not heard." The claim contains some serious charges. Upon review, we found that Blackburn embellished on some of the details. Key takeaways • An Associated Press review found that at end of 2005, the number of harassment claims was on track to double from the year before. • We identified about 30 sexual harassment investigations that occurred in state government from 2003 to 2011, while Bredesen served as governor. In two of those cases, a state investigator destroyed interview notes. • Bredesen proposed changing the state open records law to try and shield the identify of accusers who came forward with claims of harassment. He also issued a policy to stop the shredding of any documents related to a sexual harassment investigation. • The Nashville Women’s Political Caucus praised Bredesen at the time for "his open concern for protecting complainants' rights." A dishonored policy adviser Midway though Bredesen’s first term in 2005, top adviser Mack Cooper was accused of harassing a young woman in the governor’s office. Bredesen removed him from his staff and assigned him to a state job that paid about $10,000 less. Officials released no details on what Cooper had done. When reporters dug further, they found that the state’s investigator had shredded the handwritten notes she took when interviewing the woman who made the allegation. Less than two months later, the State Corrections commissioner Quenton White resigned. The prison chief faced multiple problems, including driving a state car while his license was suspended and failing to punish guards who smuggled contraband goods into prisons. Reporters quickly learned that he had faced harassment allegations a year earlier, but those notes had also been destroyed. The governor’s office said the harassment claim lacked proof, and he was dismissed for other reasons. Bredesen’s sexual harassment policies Bredesen took office in 2003. In 2004, he instituted workplace harassment training across all state offices. Right after demoting Cooper in May 2005, Bredesen proposed changing the state’s open records law to protect the identities of people who file sexual harassment complaints. "We have got a problem with sexual harassment in state government," Bredesen told the Associated Press May 22, 2005. "People are not going to come forward if it's going to be on the front page of the newspaper." The Nashville Women’s Political Caucus immediately praised Bredesen. In a letter published in the Tennessean, caucus head Holly Span said her group supported Bredesen’s "swift actions in the workplace harassment case involving one of his legislative lobbyists and his open concern for protecting complainants' rights." (Supporters of transparency in government opposed the move. In 2006, Bredesen backed down when news organizations agreed to keep accusers’ names private.) On July 17, 2005, Bredesen issued a policy to stop all shredding by the Personnel Department. He said he didn’t know about the problem until the episode with his top adviser. In August 2005, Bredesen released a new policy on sexual harassment investigations. It required that all documents be preserved. During this period, investigations by the Tennessean newspaper and the Associated Press found a lack of consistency across state government in how claims were handled. Tennessean reporters identified 30 cases on Bredesen’s watch. They noted that claims made by or about higher ranked officials were "investigated more thoroughly and more privately than those involving lower-level civil service employees." The more high-profile the official, the thinner the file left behind, reporters found. Bredesen said the difference was because the rules for civil servant employees were more stringent than for executive staff. Civil service workers enjoy more legal protections, which produces a more detailed paper trail. In 2005, Frank Gibson was executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government and an editor at the Tennessean. Gibson told us he opposed Bredesen’s plan to shield records from the press. But that issue was separate from any concerns about whether allegations were taken seriously. "I knew of no rule that would have prevented any woman from being heard," Gibson said. "As for a policy that sex harassment complaints were to be shredded, I never heard of such a thing." Our ruling Blackburn said that documents in sexual harassment cases were shredded "so that women’s voices would never be heard." The attack stretches the facts of the case and ignores Bredesen’s remarks at the time. Out of 30 cases, investigation notes were shredded in two prominent cases. In both, the implicated officials were either demoted or resigned. When the issue came to light, Bredesen ordered that files be preserved going forward. The Nashville Women’s Political Caucus praised Bredesen for "his open concern for protecting complainants' rights." We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09642	"We've created or saved up to 1.6 million jobs, according to the CBO -- the Congressional Budget Office -- through the Recovery Act."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/14/barack-obama/obama-says-congressional-budget-office-found-econo/	The number of jobs created by the massive and controversial economic stimulus package championed by President Barack Obama has been the subject of intense partisan debate for months. Obama and other administration officials have repeatedly cited numbers from the stimulus Web site, recovery.org, suggesting the stimulus has saved or created hundreds of thousands of jobs and has slowed rising unemployment rates. Many Republicans counter that rising unemployment rates suggest the stimulus hasn't worked, and that Democrats' statistics on job creation have been greatly exaggerated. So it was with some anticipation that both sides awaited a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which at the end of November weighed in with its analysis on the number of jobs the stimulus has saved or created. The agency calculates how much bills in Congress will cost the government, and political leaders on both sides of the aisle regularly turn to the CBO as the definitive source for budget projections. Obama apparently liked what he saw in the CBO report on the effect of the stimulus, as he has cited it frequently since. In a Dec. 4 speech on the economy in Allentown, Pa., Obama referenced the CBO figures when he said, "And we passed the Recovery Act, which created or saved up to 1.6 million jobs, stopped our freefall, lifted our economy to the point where it’s growing for the first time in more than a year." Obama was more clear in his reference in a speech on job creation at the Brookings Institution on Dec. 8: "Finally, we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were. In fact, we learned on Friday that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month. This is welcome news, and news made possible in part by the up to 1.6 million jobs that the Recovery Act has already created and saved according to the Congressional Budget Office." The next day at the White House, the president cited the CBO report again, saying, "We've created or saved up to 1.6 million jobs, according to the CBO -- the Congressional Budget Office -- through the Recovery Act. Our economy is growing again. " So without further ado ... the CBO report. "CBO estimates that in the third quarter of calendar year 2009, an additional 600,000 to 1.6 million people were employed in the United States ... than would have been the case in the absence of (the economic stimulus)," the report states. That's quite a large range, and the report acknowledges as much. "Those ranges are intended to reflect the uncertainty of such estimates and to encompass most economists’ views on the effects of fiscal stimulus," the report states. The White House's stimulus Web site, recovery.org, reported a total of 640,000 jobs saved or created through September. But the CBO report says that tally has a number of shortcomings, some of which could greatly shift the total up or down. First, "It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package." Second, the reports on the recovery Web site measure only the jobs created by the employers who received stimulus funds directly or by their immediate subcontractor. They do not include the jobs to lower-level subcontractors. And it doesn't measure the effects of all of the stimulus spending, including tax cuts. The CBO report also notes some inconsistencies in the way some people tabulated jobs data. Obama is technically accurate when he says the CBO found the economic stimulus has saved or created up to 1.6 million jobs. But he fails to report the bottom end of the CBO's projection -- 600,000. Had the CBO report concluded the jobs saved or created were somewhere between, say, 1.4 million and 1.6 million, we might have been more inclined to rate Obama's statement better. But the CBO's projected range is huge. The high end -- 1.6 million -- is nearly triple the low end. And so in this case, we think it's misleading to only cite the top end.

pomt-03354	"This is the same (farm) bill we voted on a few weeks ago, with the exception of one or two sentences."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/17/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-says-rushed-farm-bill-w/	House Republicans rushed a new farm bill to a vote last week. But it wasn’t really all that new, Speaker John Boehner argued. Sure, it had been stripped of more than $700 billion in nutrition spending that Republicans wanted to consider separately. But the $200 billion package of farm measures that was left essentially matched what lawmakers had already considered, Boehner said at his weekly news conference July 11. It passed that day 216-208. Some unlikely bedfellows cried foul. A policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation called it a "game of bait and switch" with "sneaky changes." Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said at a Rules Committee hearing, "There’s been no hearing on it. There’s been no debate on it." Ferd Hoefner, a policy advocate for sustainable agriculture who’s followed every omnibus farm bill since 1977, told us the bill contained "incredibly significant changes — historically unprecedented changes." Even without expensive supplemental nutrition programs — what most of us call food stamps — the farm bill is a lengthy, complex set of programs that covers everything from subsidies for commodities such as dairy, wheat, corn and sugar to grants for weather radio transmitters to farm loan programs to watershed protection. Here’s what Boehner told reporters about the new, sleeker bill the day it reached the House: QUESTION: Mr. Speaker, why did you use an emergency rule to get the farm bill down on the floor? And doesn't this violate what you were just saying, that members should have time to read these bills? This is a 600-page bill that's now on the floor of the House of Representatives. BOEHNER: It is an unusual situation, not something I would prefer to do. But the bill that we've got on the floor is the same bill that was on the floor about three weeks ago, with the exception of one or two sentences. And so we're in a situation where our members know what the bill is, and I don't believe that it violates either the rule or the spirit of the rule. Was that bill really "the same bill" with the exception of a few sentences? Permanent law The "one or two sentences" that Boehner talked about were really a handful of key provisions, according to a taxpayer advocacy group. An odd quirk of farm legislation is that the "permanent law" underlying commodities programs — just one section of the bill — dates from 1938 and 1949. Lawmakers merely suspend that law, usually five years at a time, and replace it with language that works in the current decade. But the old permanent law lurks in the background, motivating lawmakers to pass new farm bills lest the nation face antiquated rules that could double the prices of milk or bread. In January, for example, before lawmakers approved a nine-month extension of the most recent law, there was talk of a "dairy cliff." Folks disagree about the value of such a motivational tool — and even whether any administration would actually enforce Depression-era laws if Congress failed to pass new ones. Some lawmakers and policy advocates want to get rid of the risk altogether. So here’s the major difference — other than nutrition programs — between the farm bill that House lawmakers rejected in June and the one they passed on July 11: The new bill repeals the 1938 and 1949 laws and removes five-year expiration dates on commodity programs such as crop subsidies. The new permanent law, then, would be from 2013. Did the bill do that in just "one or two sentences"? No. In the new bill, Section 1602, rather than suspend old law for five years, repeals it. That’s different language that replaces 16 lines in the bill with 11 lines. Other sections also got tweaks to eliminate expiration dates, including at least four sentences in provisions about sugar subsidies. "Making these new programs permanent, instead of having them sunset in five years, is a meaningful (and lamentable) difference between the two bills," said Sallie James, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. "It will make reform of these programs more difficult, for sure." Hoefner, of the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, also noted the significance of the shift: "And all just dropped into the bill by Rules Committee at instruction of leadership, with no hearings and no action by the Agriculture Committee. In fact, it is hard to imagine the Agriculture Committee ever being able to get agreement to pass such changes." Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck described them to us as "a handful of widely known changes." But it’s not clear that’s the case. Agriculture Committee chairman Frank Lucas, R-Okla., did refer to a "change in the status of permanent law" as he explained the new bill to first to the Rules Committee, then House lawmakers. He told the Rules Committee, which agreed after 10 p.m. on July 10 to rush the bill to the House floor under emergency rules, that he requested language "to replace the '49 law in the draft, which is permanent, by making the 2013 law permanent." Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., protested on the spot. "This is not the same bill. … This repeals, basically, the 1949 act, and you know, I don't think anybody has any idea what that means. There's been no hearing on it. There's been no debate on it. We're just trying to wing it as we go along here." The next day, on the House floor, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., stood to say, "The Rules Committee met last night and is sending us a rule today that has attached to it a bill that we have not seen and have not been able to read." Joshua Sewell, a senior policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending, told PolitiFact it was clear enough that the new bill repealed the old laws. What wasn’t so clear was that it also got rid of expiration dates on some new programs — which, whether the 1930s and '40s law stayed in place or not, could have been up for renewal every five years. Those expiration dates gave lawmakers — and critics of farm bill spending — opportunities to adapt and rein in pricey subsidy programs. "Leadership just focused on the repeal part. They didn't talk about replace," Sewell said. And that shift went far beyond "one or two sentences," other critics argued. "The tone of the bill is changed remarkably by the exclusion of those end dates, and so substantively it is quite a different animal," James of the Cato Institute said. Our ruling Boehner said, "This is the same bill we voted on a few weeks ago, with the exception of one or two sentences." He’s off on the numbers: interest groups identified several changes to the bill, including an entire section. But more to the point, he downplayed the substance of those changes, which not only repealed old law but made new programs permanent — which some Democratic lawmakers and a range of policy groups argued was a serious difference that called for open debate. It’s true changes didn’t affect many sentences in the 600-page bill. But that obscures a different reality, in which those sentences had a significant impact on the legislation.

pomt-10110	"If Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/17/chain-email/the-truth-fades-into-the-background/	A chain e-mail has been burning up the Internet with the allegation that Sen. Barack Obama is not eligible for FBI or Secret Service jobs because of his acquaintance with former antiwar radical William Ayers. The implication is that anyone who wouldn't qualify for a federal law enforcement job has no business as commander in chief of the U.S. armed forces. One version of the e-mail we received on Oct. 10, 2008, had the subject heading, "FW: unbelievable food for thought." "Just passing along info that came to me," it began. "This is something to think about no matter what other concerns may be on your plate. If Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist. If elected President, he would not qualify to be his own body guard!" It's worth noting that the president, no matter who he or she may be, automatically gets access to any classified information, and in fact has the authority to decide who else in the government gets access to it. Just by virtue of having been elected to the U.S. Senate, Obama already has access to a great deal of secret intelligence information. Still, that says little about how Obama would fare in a background check, since none is required for either job. An FBI spokesman said the bureau would not comment on whether any individual would pass a background check, and the Secret Service did not return numerous calls on the matter. So we asked outside experts whether Ayers would pose a problem for Obama. Ayers was a founder in 1969 of the violent antiwar group the Weathermen, which took responsibility for at least 12 bombings between 1970 and 1974. A pipe bomb attributed to the group killed a police officer and severely injured another in 1970, and three of the group's own members were killed in a 1970 explosion in a Greenwich Village townhouse in which they were making bombs. Ayers was investigated in connection with the group's activities, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He emerged from hiding, earned a doctorate in education from Columbia University, and is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Like Obama, he lives on the South Side of Chicago. Obama and Ayers are both active in politics and civic life in the city. They both volunteered at two different charities, the Woods Foundation and the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, and Ayers hosted a small gathering for Obama and then-state Sen. Alice Palmer in 1995 as Obama planned to run for the seat Palmer was vacating. Were Obama to apply to the FBI, he would have to fill out Standard Form 86, a background-investigation form used by the entire U.S. intelligence community. The more detailed iterations of the Internet rumor allege Obama would have to disclose his past connections to Ayers on the form, particularly in a section titled "Association Record." It asks seven questions along the lines of these two: "Have you EVER been an officer or a member of, or made a contribution to, an organization dedicated to the use of violence or force to overthrow the U.S. Government...?" The Secret Service did not return our calls for comment about the agency's application procedures, but its Web site indicates that applicants must fill out a modified version of the form called the SF-86A, which asks: "Are you now or have you ever been a member of any foreign or domestic organization, association, movement, group, or combination of persons which is totalitarian, fascist, communist, or subversive; or which has adopted or shows a policy advocating or approving the commission of force or violence to deny other persons their rights under the Constitution of the United States, or which seems [sic] to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitutional means?" Note that the agencies ask whether the applicant himself has engaged in this behavior – not whether the applicant knows anyone who has. Ayers' militant activity occurred in the '60s and '70s, when Obama was a child. Even Obama's harshest critics do not allege he had anything to do with them. So there is no reason to believe Obama would have to disclose his relationship to Ayers, experts said. "There is nowhere on the form that Obama's relationship to Ayers as it exists or existed would even come up," said Mark Zaid, a Washington attorney who specializes in security-clearance work. "It would never come up unless somebody mentioned it during a background investigation." Moreover, even if it did come up, there's no reason to believe it would impede Obama's hiring, Zaid said. "Given what has been said publicly about their relationship, I can't fathom that it would ever get more than a moment's attention," he said. A second lawyer specializing in security clearances, Elizabeth Newman of the Washington, D.C., firm Kalijarvi, Chuzi & Newman, concurred that the Ayers connection would pose no problem for Obama, even if it did come to the attention of the investigators. "They would care if there was a recent relationship with someone who is currently on trial or currently considered to be advocating violent overthrow of the government," she said. "But not something that was 20 or 30 years ago." A third security-clearance lawyer, Mark Riley of Odenton, Md., who is also a retired Army intelligence officer, was slightly less dismissive of the Ayers issue, saying it was "something they would investigate." But Riley leaned toward the conclusion that the Ayers connection would not cost Obama a security clearance. "The issue is what is Obama's relationship with him in his adult life," Riley said. "If he didn't have one, other than they sat on a board and maybe had the same political causes, that's not enough to deny a fellow a clearance." So all three of the attorneys we contacted agreed unequivocally that Obama's relationship with Ayers would not be an automatic disqualifier, as the claim suggests. In fact, Zaid said someone with Obama's record – a law degree from Harvard, teaching experience at the University of Chicago Law School – would be an excellent candidate. "The agencies would be fighting over him," Zaid said. "As an outright claim, this statement is false." We agree. It's False.

pomt-10026	"The average CEO makes $10,000 more every day ... than what the average worker makes every year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/06/joe-biden/biden-points-out-disparities-between-ceo-and-avera/	Vice President Joe Biden gave a shout-out to the common man at the annual conference of the AFL-CIO Executive Council on March 5. "I want to point out that economic injustice and inequity are bad for everyone," Biden said. "It's just not right, it's just not right, and everybody knows it — it's just not right when the average CEO makes $10,000 more every day — $10,000 more every day than what the average worker makes every year — $10,000 per day. And by the way, before I said it, I did the math, I did the math, and it's literally true." Truth be told, when Biden said he did the math himself, it set off our alarms. And nothing personal, but when politicians say something is "literally true," we often find it literally isn't. Biden seemed to be daring us to check this one. We took the bait. Asked where he got the numbers, Biden's press office referred us to a report called "The State of Working America" prepared by the Economic Policy Institute. The authors found that top CEO pay in 2007 was 275 times that of a typical worker. "In other words," the report states, "in 2007 a CEO earned more in one workday (there are 260 in a year) than the typical worker earned all year." There are a couple qualifiers. One, the report looks at compensation for "top U.S. executives," who they said made over $12 million a year. That includes salary as well as stock options, bonuses and other compensation. In that scenario, Biden would be correct. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, production workers (the group the Economic Policy Institute used for the comparison) currently earn about $31,900 a year. Add $10,000 to that, multiple it by 260 (working days) in a year, and you get to nearly $11 million. CEOs at the country's biggest corporations made more than that. Two things: First, Biden didn’t qualify his comment by saying work days. He said "every day." But the bigger problem is that Biden said "average CEOs." The Economic Policy Institute report talks about "top" CEOs, the ones from the biggest U.S. firms. Average CEOs make much less. According to a Mercer CEO compensation study based on proxies issued in 2008, CEOs at the 50 largest U.S. corporations pulled in just under $14 million a year. But CEOs at medium-sized companies brought in $9.4 million; and CEOs at small companies got $4.7 million. On average, at the 350 companies surveyed by Mercer, CEOs got $7.3 million. That comes to $28,000 per working day — a little less than the average worker makes in a year. The Corporate Library, an independent research firm, found in its survey that average CEO compensation in 2007 came to $5.3 million. That comes to $20,400 per working day, again lower than the average worker's annual salary. Biden's underlying point is solid: The gap between CEO compensation and a typical worker's pay has widened exponentially over the last few decades. According to the Economic Policy Institute report, in 1965, U.S. CEOs in major companies earned 24 times more than a typical worker; by 2007, they made 275 times more. U.S. CEOs also make far more than CEOs in other advanced countries, the report said. "The major CEOs pay is otherworldly," said Larry Mishel, one of the authors of the Economic Policy Institute report. Biden's comments would have been "literally true," as he said, if he used the term "top" CEOs, or some other qualifier to note that he was talking about average pay for CEOs at the nation's biggest corporations. Mishel thinks that's what people have in mind when you say average CEOs. But Biden "literally" said "average" CEOs, and for average CEOs, that's not correct. Average CEOs make a little less per day than the average worker makes in a year. We rate Biden's statement Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2009-03-06T16:28:14	2009-03-05	['None']

pomt-08240	John Kasich says he won, despite "12 visits by a president, somewhere between $45 (million) and $50 million (spent against him,) 500 paid volunteers in here calling me every name in the book, former presidents, first ladies and God-knows-who-else."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/15/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-democrats-targeted-his-gop-gubern/	Republican John Kasich, who narrowly defeated embattled Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland on Nov. 2, is still angry about the negative campaign the governor and his supporters employed trying to secure a second term. In nearly every interview and speech following his victory, Kasich has raised the issue, complaining that he had to beat back an unprecedented effort to destroy his good name. During one event with reporters, he even called on teacher unions that backed Strickland to place full-page newspaper ads in Ohio papers apologizing to him. Such statements raise an obvious question: Is Kasich the victim of politics gone wild — or is he just nursing thin-skin wounds? To get at the answer, Politicfact decided to check Kasich’s statement on the matter. Addressing a group of lobbyists Nov. 4 in Columbus, Kasich offered the following evidence that his enemies were stalking him while he tried to run a simple positive campaign. "I had 12 visits by a president, somewhere between $45 (million) and $50 million (spent against him,) 500 paid volunteers in here calling me every name in the book, former presidents, first ladies and God-knows-who-else, and we beat all of them. And if you think you’re going to stop us, you’re crazy. You will not stop us. We will beat you. And that’s not arrogance." He made similar remarks a day earlier to Fox News, claiming the president campaigned against him 12 times and that he and other politicians and Democratic workers "threw the kitchen sink at me." Because it’s tough to quantify what constitutes the political kitchen sink these days, we’ll examine his statement to lobbyists and the specific figures he cites within it. In the first part of the statement, Kasich clearly suggests that President Barack Obama visited Ohio a dozen times to campaign against him. Obama has indeed visited Ohio 12 times since taking office in January 2009. But a review of Obama’s travel schedule and the text of all the speeches he made here offers a different picture. Obama, for instance, visited Ohio on March 3, 2009, a full two months before Kasich even announced his candidacy. And of Obama’s 12 trips, nine were made under the guise of official White House business during which he pushed specific policies – mainly health care reform and the economic stimulus bill. Two trips this year, Oct. 17 and Oct. 31, were made specifically to campaign for Strickland and the Democratic ticket. And on a trip made Aug. 18, Obama hosted a fund-raiser for Strickland and in a separate event pushed his economic polices. Transcripts from Obama’s non-campaign visits show he referred to Republicans in Washington many times in arguing that his policies are better than GOP plans. But Obama never mentioned the governor’s race or Kasich. Obama never mentioned Kasich at the Oct. 17 campaign rally before 35,000 people in Columbus, either. He named Kasich twice at his Oct. 31 rally in Cleveland, including in this passage: "Kasich and (U.S. Senate candidate) Rob Portman, they want to do what they’ve always done. They’re not bad guys, they just have a whole different view of how real folks live. Ladies and gentlemen, these guys want to continue to give tax breaks to companies who send their jobs to China." As for Kasich’s claim that his enemies spent between $45 and $50 million against him: The final accounting by the campaigns has not been made public yet. And the total expenditures of the Democratic campaign can vary widely depending on what groups are included and what parameters – campaign activities television ads vs. radio buys vs. mailers vs. voter mobilization – are applied. Kasich says his figure includes Strickland, the Ohio Democratic Party, several union-sponsored political action committees and a union funded independent groups and that they spent $30 million on television and radio advertising alone, based on data from its media buyer. He estimates that these groups and others spent at least another $15 million on direct mail, phone banking and voter mobilization, which is harder to track. "I have no idea how much the teachers unions spent in direct mail, but I'm looking at a 4-inch tall stack of mailers, each of them different," Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said in defense of estimates. Though exact campaign totals are not yet available, Kasich’s figure is likely in the ballpark in terms of what was spent by these group. What is fact at the moment is that Strickland’s campaign raised nearly $18.5 million through Oct. 13, according to its most recent campaign report. The Ohio Democratic Party raised nearly $9.5 million through the same date. And unions have spent millions on ads in Ohio based on earlier media reports. Stepping back briefly, Strickland aired many television ads painting Kasich as untrustworthy because of his ties to the failed Wall Street investment firm Lehman Brothers, where Kasich worked as a managing director. Other groups, including unions, used similar themes. But advertising by Strickland and allied groups also included plenty run of the mill attacks about trade and tax issues Kasich supported or opposed when he was a member of Congress. And these ads mirrored the theme and tone of Democratic ads airing in other tight races in Ohio and around the country. Though Kasich may be close on his spending figures, he leaves out important context: Not every dollar spent by the Ohio Democratic Party and others was used specifically for Strickland and against Kasich. Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman points out that the party’s expenditures were made for voter mobilization for the entire ticket. "The purpose of those resources was not to attack John Kasich," he said, pointing out that party didn’t air a single ad about Kasich or anyone else. Kasich’s statement also leaves out the fact that his Democratic enemies didn’t spend their money in a vacuum. Kasich, the Ohio Republican Party and independent groups spent tens of millions on Kasich’s behalf. Kasich himself raised more money than any gubernatorial candidate in history, except Strickland. He banked $16 million through Oct. 13 and also received large cover from the Republican Governors Association, which acknowledged it spent $11 million on Kasich's behalf. The bulk of Kasich’s and the RGA’s ads described Strickland as a failure and blamed him for Ohio’s 400,000 job losses. Former President Bill Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden each made several stops in Ohio on Strickland’s behalf. First Lady Michele Obama joined her husband during the Oct. 17 visit. And the Ohio Democratic Party had the largest paid field staff of any state party in the country. But it employed 300 workers, not 500. So where does this leave Kasich on the Truth-O-Meter? On the first part – that Obama campaigned against him 12 times – Kasich is taking too much credit for Obama’s visits, especially the nine White House trips during which Obama pushed health care and other policies. While Kasich deserves some slack on the statement given that any presidential visit provides cover to office holders of the same party -- it’s a stretch to imply that the president used his bully pulpit to join other critics in calling Kasich "every name in the book." On the second part – that Democrats spent at least $45 million or more against him – Kasich offers a realistic estimate of spending, but not all of that money was spent to tear him down. On the third part, Kasich is basically right that he faced a massive Ohio Democratic Party operation designed to protect a key firewall in presidential politics, though he’s off the mark on the actual number of workers employed. On the final part, "former presidents, first ladies and God-knows-who-else," campaigned against him, Kasich is off the mark, too. One former president, Bill Clinton, and one first lady, Michelle Obama, made trips to Ohio, as did Vice President Joe Biden. Taken together, Kasich’s claims in his colorful speech to lobbyists offer the same dramatic flair as the campaign ads he so detests. But he overstates some key facts and presents some other details out of context. So while Politifact Ohio can’t tell Kasich to take a deep breath and savor his victory, we can evaluate the accuracy of his statement. We rate Kasich’s claims Half True.

pomt-08019	"Our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/10/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-has-right-count-magnitu/	Republicans like to say the government is spending like a drunken sailor. Democrats say the government needs to keep spending, albeit strategically, to jolt job creation. It’s all relative to political persuasion and the economic theories that partisans follow. But congressman John Boehner, a southwestern Ohio Republican who just became speaker of the House of Representatives, provides a perspective that Americans outside of Washington might not think about. "Our spending has caught up with us, and our debt soon will eclipse the entire size of our national economy," Boehner said in his inaugural remarks upon accepting the speaker’s gavel. "Hard work and tough decisions will be required of the 112th Congress." There are certain assumptions built into this claim about the extent of the government’s debt, although they are widely held and agreed to by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and President Barack Obama’s commission on reducing the deficit and debt. But before going there, we thought we’d look at Boehner’s statement in its most simplistic interpretation. The United States government’s total debt on the day Boehner took over as speaker was $14 trillion, according to the Treasury Department’s interactive "Debt to the Penny" website. The size of the United States economy, measured by the gross domestic product, or the value of all goods and services, was $14.745 trillion in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent quarter for which data is available. This number comes from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis databases. Using only these numbers, it would appear that the eclipse is about to start. But since GDP estimates are not as current as the debt numbers, we wanted to see how big the debt was at the end of the third quarter of 2010. Going back to Treasury’s calculator, we got a debt figure of $13.668 trillion by putting the date at Oct. 31, 2010. Boehner said "soon," so he was correct: $13.6 trillion in debt against a $14.7 trillion economy signals the onset of an eclipse. Economists and analysts who are reading this by now are shouting, "Wait!" We understand. Some government debt is considered way more troubling than other, and many analysts say that only part of it should be used when measuring its size against the total economy. A mercifully short primer: Federal debt has two major components, namely, debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings. Public debt is money the government owes to the public, including foreigners who buy government T bills and retirees who want safe government bonds. The government sells them these bills and bonds and uses the money to operate. But like a loan, the money must be paid back in real cash. Intragovernmental holdings involve such things as Social Security Trust Fund IOU’s and other transfers between divisions of the government. These borrowings must be repaid, too, but they don’t put an immediate crimp on the government, and they often are handled by shuffling paper back and forth between departments, despite the future perils that may hold (the piper must be paid eventually, and all that). In other words, the public debt will require real money to repay the lenders, and that has a faster ripple effect in the private sector. So we go back to that Treasury calculator to see how much money this might involve. It shows that the public debt on the day that Boehner took control of the House was nearly $9.4 trillion. It was $9.069 trillion as of the end of last October, when the GDP was $14.745 trillion, or nearly 62 percent of the GDP. That’s a high debt-to-GDP ratio by historic standards, although it was much higher at the end of World War II, when the debt did in fact exceed the nation’s GDP. But what worries Boehner and many others is the projection that the public debt could reach World War II proportions again. If current practices aren’t changed, debt will reach 90 percent of GDP in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, whose figures were cited by President Barack Obama’s national Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in December. Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, told us the public debt could reach 100 percent of GDP by then, "and if you add in state and local debt, it could be as early as 2016, 2017 or 2018." And if this trend were to continue? Unless Congress made some big changes, "the federal debt would balloon to 185 percent of GDP by 2035," said the CBO. The president’s commission used the same warning. Would this automatically be catastrophic? That depends on the government’s choices. For a parallel, consider the mortgage on a house, which often exceeds the owner’s income by 200 percent or 300 percent. The problem is that if there are other debts and the car breaks down and Junior suddenly needs braces, the homeowner is likely to have a problem that limits his financial and lifestyle options. For the government, this would likely drive up interest rates as the government competed with the private sector to borrow money, and crimp economic growth. It could result in tax hikes, spending cuts and stingier government entitlements, analysts say.. It needs to be noted that these projections are based on the most dire projections that use a set of what-ifs, and rosier estimates show up, in fact, in current budget documents. But the what-ifs come from realistic expectations about the way Washington operates. For example, the CBO noted that Congress passed tax cuts a decade ago and projected they would only last a decade. Yet Congress just renewed them. Similarly, Congress keeps passing temporary, one-year payment hikes for Medicare doctors who otherwise would see steep cuts -- and might stop caring for seniors. While well-intentioned, this keeps the long-term costs from looking too bad when projecting future budgets, despite the fact that renewal is a near certainty every single year. The CBO doesn’t say this is nefarious; it just says that continuation of these kinds of practices has consequences. So what of Boehner’s claim that the debt will "soon" eclipse the size of the economy? Using the broadest measure, that’s true. But even if the total eclipse is a decade away, "to me, that counts as soon," says Riedl, of Heritage. That’s because it can take five to 10 years for congressional decisions "to turn the budget ship around." We are not endorsing or rejecting Boehner’s proposed solutions or his analysis of the policies that led to the problem. Democrats blame the war in Iraq and the tax cuts of former President George W. Bush, while Republicans blame spending by Democrats and President Barack Obama’s White House. Some economists suggest that with sensible policy changes and an economy that eventually turns robust, these fears will never come to pass. But when the nonpartisan CBO and the Democratic president’s fiscal commission agree with the Republican leader on the scope of the problem, both citing the prospect public debt at 185 percent of GDP, the Truth-O-Meter must concur that his prediction is reasonable. So we rate Boehner’s statement True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2011-01-10T06:00:00	2011-01-05	['None']
pomt-00650	The Fair Tax proposal encourages innovation and investment "level the playing field" for American companies to compete globally.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/18/david-perdue/fair-tax-claim-ignores-contradictory-economic-mode/	Georgia’s freshman Senator David Perdue is a big advocate of the Fair Tax – a proposal long linked to the Peach State that calls for replacing federal income taxes with a national sales tax on all goods and services. Perdue talked up the plan in the GOP primary and general election, and included it in his first speech from the Senate floor last month. The former Fortune 500 CEO said the Fair Tax would boost the national economy. "Our archaic tax system is choking growth, holding back innovation, and discouraging investment," Perdue said, in calling for a transition to the Fair Tax to "level the playing field with the rest of the world." PolitiFact Georgia wondered if evidence exists that the plan would boost investment and innovation, thereby improving the economy, and decided to check it out. So what is the Fair Tax? Broadly, it is a plan to abolish all federal personal and corporate income taxes (including the inheritance and gift taxes) and set up a federal retail sales tax. Not surprisingly, the wholesale upheaval of the current tax system has been controversial. Advocates claim that since taxes apply only to what you buy, individuals or businesses will have more money on hand to invest. Critics, including many sympathetic to the idea of tax reform, claim the plan places too much of the overall burden on the middle class. The two sides can’t even settle on just what the sales tax rate would be. Perdue is among 74 co-sponsors of the current proposal, which specifies "the tax rate of 23 percent of the gross payments for the taxable property or services." That means the plan calls for a 23 percent tax-inclusive rate. But when translated to a sales tax, which is typically expressed in tax-exclusive terms, the rate is 30 percent. So the current plan assumes $30 in taxes on every $100 spent, with no tax cheats on sales for everything from mortgages to groceries to doctor visits. (More on that calculation is available from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and an essay by Bruce Bartlett, a supply-side economics expert who served under former presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush.) A bipartisan panel convened by former President George W. Bush reported that the plan would require a sales tax of at least 34 percent, a rate that would grow if exemptions were added back for popular items such as mortgages. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated the sales tax would need to be 45 percent to be revenue neutral, as the proposal pledges, and also account for tax cheats. The rate matters when deciding if the proposal will do as Perdue suggests and boost economic activity. Americans for Fair Taxation, the non-profit arm of Fair Tax advocates, reported to the House Ways and Means Committee that investment would be 75 percent higher the first year of the new system and 76 percent higher over a decade. That’s because without corporate taxes, businesses will be more inclined to use foreign and domestic profits to grow operations. That jump in investment will naturally lead to greater innovation, the report concludes. Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University economist hired by Fair Tax advocates, said that conclusion builds on a long line of research that shows the path to increased investment is more saving. A standard life cycle model shows that the people who are most likely to spend, not save, are older people, he said. That puts the tax burden on younger people. The Fair Tax reverses that, shifting the burden from "young savers to old and rich spenders," Kotlikoff said. "You redistribute from the old to the young, and the bread and butter models say you have less consumption," he said. "Less consumption means more savings and more saving means more investment." But the tax shift is what critics point out make the plan most unworkable. The Fair Tax is a regressive sales tax, because it applies to all expenses (after a prebate), and spending on essentials such as food and shelter tends to make up more of a lower-income person’s budget. Put another way, regressive taxes come more from the poor and middle class than the rich. Allen Buckley, an Atlanta attorney and CPA who has run for statewide office as a Libertarian, said the fastest way to summarize that shift is to say the Fair Tax shifts the tax burden from the upper-middle class and rich to the middle class and elderly. Moreover, Buckley said, a history of major innovations do not show any relation at all to the tax system. For instance, the highest marginal tax rate in the U.S. peaked at 94 percent in 1944 and remained as high as 70 percent through the 1970s. Yet in that same period, public-private partnerships and businesses invented and developed commercial computers, heart-lung machines and various vaccines that saved millions of lives. "The only positive I see, if it’s truly revenue neutral, is there will be some increase in economic activity," Buckley said. "But that will be because the rich have more money to invest in the stock market, while a lot of retirees and ordinary Joes will see their savings and investments in real estate reduced in the shift." Some economic models back up the idea that businesses will invest that money in research and development as part of their growth, said Bruce Seaman, a professor of economics at the Andrew Young School of Public Policy at Georgia State University. But those models can be overstated, considering some don’t control for very human factors such as greed and simple bad decisions, Seaman said. For instance, businesses have been reporting record profits during the economic recovery – yet that has not translated into raises for workers or enough new jobs to significantly cut the unemployment rate. Instead, economists find that investment is lagging because consumption is lagging. Businesses need customers for profit, so encouraging consumption actually puts less money in the economy, Seaman said. "Economists do have a concern about the corporate income tax as a double taxation, but even if you are broadly sympathetic to the idea here, the Fair Tax is a grotesque exaggeration," he said. "If a business person took it seriously, and didn’t want you to buy anything, imagine what would happen to his business if suddenly no one wanted to spend money," he added. Our ruling David Perdue claimed the Fair Tax will boost the economy by increasing investment and innovation, making American companies more competitive on a world stage. There are some models that reinforce the idea that the way to encourage investment is to free up more money in private sector – something the Fair Tax pledges to do. But the claim ignores contrary economic models that show the additional money stays as profit for companies – or investments for the wealthy – while lower-income taxpayers spend most of their income. What exactly would happen can’t be known unless the change is fully implemented.

pomt-13977	Says Donald Trump mocked "someone with a disability."	true	/colorado/statements/2016/jun/13/priorities-usa-action/pro-clinton-super-pac-ad-trump-mocked-disabled-r/	A super PAC backing Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton has launched a $20 million campaign that accuses her Republican opponent Donald Trump of "mocking" a disabled news reporter. The emotionally charged ad focuses on an Ohio couple, Chris and Lauren Glaros, talking about raising their daughter, Grace, who was born with a spinal defect. "When I saw Donald Trump mock a disabled person, I was just shocked," Lauren Glaros says in the ad, produced by Priorities USA Action. Last fall, Trump was broadly criticized for appearing to physically mimic New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24. Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints. The ad shows a photo of the reporter, whose right hand is sharply angled at the wrist. The ad cuts to a video clip of Trump at the rally. "You gotta see this guy," says Trump, wildly flailing his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouts in a weird, agitated voice: "Ahh, I don’t know what I said! Ahh, I don’t remember!" "When I saw Donald Trump mock somebody with a disability, it showed me his soul, it showed me his heart. And I didn’t like what I saw," the father, Chris Glaros, adds. The TV ad (which you can watch in full at the bottom of this fact-check) is airing in seven crucial swing states -- Colorado, Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire and Iowa. PolitiFact is fact-checking the obvious question: Did Trump mock the man’s disability? But first, we want to separate Trump’s parody of the reporter from the reality. Kovaleski is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms around. (Watch a video of Kovaleski talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.) Trump tweeted about the ad on Sunday: "Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!" The Trump campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. PolitiFact also contacted Kovaleski, who declined comment. Here’s why Trump singled out this reporter. At the time of the November rally, Trump was taking heat for his widely debunked claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as "thousands and thousands of people were cheering" the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. To defend this account, Trump seized on a Sept. 18, 2001, story by Kovaleski -- who then worked for the Washington Post -- and another reporter. Near the bottom of the story, they wrote that "law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river." But the reporters couldn’t verify the celebrations actually occurred. "I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember," Kovaleski later told the Washington Post Fact Checker. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that "a number of people" -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating. This why Trump, believing that Kovaleski was backing off the 2001 story, wailed in his impersonation, "Ahh, I don’t remember!" Trump’s behavior sparked public outrage. The New York Times rebuked Trump in a statement: "We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters." Colleagues and friends defended Kovaleski. "@sergenyt is one of the best reporters — and best people — I know. This is despicable," ESPN reporter and author Don Van Natta Jr. wrote on Twitter. People who share Kovaleski’s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag "AMCStrong." Trump denied making fun off the reporter’s disability. "I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago," he said in a statement at the time. "I don't buy that. (Trump) clearly was mocking his disability," said Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, when we asked her about it. "That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn't use that voice or wave his arms like that." Reiskin stressed that she was just giving her view of how Trump acted, because her nonprofit group can't endorse or oppose any candidate. Reiskin said Trump’s rally display "portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not competent, which is very destructive" to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added. U.S. Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, recently withdrew his support for Trump after Trump said an Indiana-born federal judge of Mexican descent was incapable of fairly presiding over a class-action lawsuit against Trump and his defunct Trump University. But Kirk also referred to Trump’s comments. Kirk suffered a serious stroke in 2012 and uses a wheelchair after years of rehabilitation. "Donald Trump’s latest statements, in context with past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that I cannot and will not support my party’s nominee for president," Kirk said. During the rally backlash, Trump insisted in a statement he couldn’t have known the man was disabled because "I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. … Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him." Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the Washington Post he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition. "Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years," Kovaleski told the New York Times. In fact, Kovelski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the "inaugural voyage" of the Trump Shuttle airline. "Flying out of La Guardia, we spent a big chunk of the day flying up and down the east coast with Trump chatting with me and the others on the plane," Kovaleski told the Daily News. He added that a furious Trump called the next day and screamed at him" because Kovaleski had reported that the Trump Shuttle took off late on its debut flight after Trump had run many ads saying it would be the most on-time airline in the industry. The Daily News story looking back at Kovaleski’s history with Trump included an archived image of his bylined Trump Shuttle story ("Wings of Don") with a photograph of Trump cutting a ceremonial ribbon. In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovelski at the rally, calling him a "nice reporter." He also described him as "the poor guy" and indicated he knew Kovaleski’s appearance ("you gotta see this guy") before launching into his imitation. Still, the candidate repeatedly denied knowing the reporter. "Serge Kovaleski must think a lot of himself if he thinks I remember him from decades ago -- if I ever met him at all, which I doubt. He should stop using his disability to grandstand and get back to reporting for a paper that is rapidly going down the tubes," Trump said, getting in a shot at the New York Times, in a statement. Our ruling In an ad from Priorities USA Action, parents of a disabled child said Trump "mocked" a disabled reporter at a campaign rally. Trump did mimic the man’s oddly angled right hand while flailing his arms and shouting in a strange voice. Disabled people and advocates said the candidate clearly was mocking him. Trump’s excuses for his comments are at odds with the evidence. Trump said he didn’t remember the man so he couldn’t know he was handicapped. But Kovaleski said he and Trump knew each other well because the reporter regularly covered the New York businessman for years. Archived reports support that. Trump also talked about the reporter with familiarity as a "nice reporter" and a "poor guy" who "you gotta see." Trump’s denials that he did not mock -- or even know -- the disabled reporter don’t add up.

pomt-10543	"As has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/22/barack-obama/experts-rate-dem-plans-about-the-same/	Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton hashed out more details on their health care plans at a debate in Austin, Texas, on Feb. 21, 2008, arguing about coverage and costs. We've looked at coverage claims before. You can check out our evaluations of Clinton's charge that Obama's plan will leave out 15 million people here , or Barack Obama's claim that his plan is universal here . In Austin, Obama brought up the issue of costs, saying, "As has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs." Both Obama and Hillary Clinton seek to reduce costs by emphasizing preventative care for chronic illnesses; better use of information technology for records and billing; and new research on cost and clinical effectiveness. Each campaign estimates savings for their plan starting at approximately $120 billion per year. Bill Clinton's former labor secretary is Robert Reich, who has defended Obama's health plan publicly several times, in particular against criticism from The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who has written that Hillary Clinton has the superior plan because of its individual mandate. We reviewed Reich's public comments, though, and couldn't find any instances of him saying that Obama's plan cuts costs more than anyone else's. If anything, Reich has emphasized that all the Democratic plans will cover more people, and the candidates shouldn't squabble over which plan is better. "The major Democratic plans would spend nearly an identical amount of money helping low- and middle-income families because they rely on the same source of general revenue, derived from allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire," Reich wrote on his blog. "Given the myriad ways universal health insurance might otherwise be organized -- single payer, employer mandate, health-insurance vouchers, tax credits -- this Democratic consensus is striking. It also highlights the abject failure of Republicans to come up with any coherent plan." We started looking for other examples of independent experts who said Obama's plan would contain costs more and found no clear-cut consensus. Our friends at Factcheck.org checked Obama's health care claims, including what Robert Reich said; see their analysis here . Even Obama's own experts say putting a cost-savings number on proposed health care reforms can be difficult. Obama asked three Harvard researchers to evaluate how much money his plan would save. They said his measures could conservatively save $120 billion and probably as much as $200 billion. But their findings also stated: "In sum, each of the measures in the Obama plan has proponents who believe that those reforms will save substantial amounts of money. However, there is no consensus in the research community about how much each element will save, or how much could be saved if these elements were effectively implemented in combination." Obama clearly believes his plan will reduce costs significantly, and we see no reason to disagree with that. But will it save even more than Hillary Clinton's plan? We find little conclusive evidence of that, nor do we find independent experts willing to argue that case decisively. So we find his claim False.

pomt-12923	Says "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is resigning from the post of associate justice of the Supreme Court."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/13/blog-posting/supreme-courts-ginsburg-not-retiring-despite-what-/	Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made it no secret last summer that she is not a fan of President-elect Donald Trump. But contrary to what a popular fake news story says, she has not announced she’s retiring. Bloggers on multiple websites have posted an article with the headline, "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is resigning from the post of associate justice of the Supreme Court." The most recent one we saw was on Jan. 2, 2017, but recently there are plenty of other examples going back to December 2016. The posts draw on speculation that Trump will have the opportunity to nominate replacements for several Supreme Court justices as they retire over the next four years. Trump already is preparing to nominate a successor for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, after Republicans in Congress for months refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland. At 83, Ginsburg is considered to be one of the justices Trump might replace, should Ginsburg retire or die while he is in office. Fueling that talk is Ginsburg’s outspoken opposition to Trump. All the fake posts read essentially the same, allegedly quoting Ginsburg in an interview about what would happen if Trump started choosing replacement Supreme Court justices. "I don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs," Ginsburg told the Associated Press, according to the posts. Ginsburg really did say those words, but in a different context: She told the AP she couldn’t imagine Trump becoming president in an interview on July 7, 2016, and didn’t want to consider the prospect. It was one of several comments over the span of a week in which Ginsburg expressed a low opinion of Trump, calling him a "faker" and that she "can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president." That netted Ginsburg plenty of criticism before she said a week later she regretted making the "ill-advised" and "incautious" remarks. While Ginsburg did express distaste for Trump publicly, everything else in the fake news posts appear to be completely contrived. The posts all include lengthy faux quotes in which Ginsburg says she could not tolerate Trump as a president and would resign should he become commander in chief. Tellingly, even the posts after the Nov. 8 election refer to Trump as a candidate instead of the president-elect. That’s because the posts draw from a fake story posted July 8 on a website called TheRightists.com. The site says on its "about us" description page that "This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true!" In the fake story, Ginsburg announces she will resign if Trump becomes president. In real life, she said five weeks before Trump was elected that she had no intention of retiring. TheRightists.com, which is registered to an address in Israel, is part of a family of websites that take a kernel of real news and then construct a fake story around it. Related sites like Politicono.com and Newslo.com include a button so that readers can identify what is fabricated, but TheRightists.com does not. That makes it very difficult to tell that most of the quoted material is completely made up. We attempted to contact some of the sites that reposted the article to see if they knew it was fake, but did not receive any responses. Clearly many readers in the comments sections of these websites are unaware the story is fabricated. Adding a real, out-of-context quote from Ginsburg with no disclaimer that the story is fake only confuses matters more.

pomt-03132	"Minnesota is kicking butt relative to Wisconsin on everything from employment and job creation to school test scores, educated work force and a host of other factors and rankings"	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/15/joe-atkins/rebuffing-scott-walker-minnesota-lawmaker-says-his/	Minnesota state Rep. Joe Atkins got perturbed by what he said were Gov. Scott Walker’s attempts to lure companies across the border by portraying Wisconsin as the better place to do business. So Atkins, chairman of the Minnesota House of Representatives’ commerce committee, called a meeting of the panel on Aug. 29, 2013. The purpose was to hear testimony on whether the Badger State is really in a stronger position to attract businesses than the Gopher State. Afterward, Atkins, a Democratic­-Farmer­-Labor Party member from the Twin Cities area, declared: "The objective data shows that, frankly, Minnesota is kicking butt relative to Wisconsin on everything from employment and job creation to school test scores, educated workforce and a host of other factors and rankings," he said, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. "I understand the desire to promote one's state, but (Walker’s) full of baloney when it comes to saying that Wisconsin is a better place to put your business than Minnesota." Baloney, we can’t (and don’t want) to test. "Kicking butt," we can. We know, for example, that Wisconsin has kicked Minnesota’s butt in college football for more than a decade, including winning the last nine games in a row. So, let’s check the thrust of Atkins' claim -- that Minnesota’s business climate is clearly superior to Wisconsin’s based in particular on four measures Atkins singled out, but on other measures, as well. Employment To back the first part of his claim, Atkins cited the unemployment rate. The latest monthly figures, for July 2013, show Minnesota at 5.2 percent, nearly one-quarter lower than Wisconsin’s 6.8 percent. BLS data also show that Minnesota’s rate was at least 1.5 percentage points lower than Wisconsin’s in each month from January through June of 2013. In response, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson cited figures showing Wisconsin’s labor force participation exceeded Minnesota’s. But labor force participation measures not only people who are employed, but also people who are unemployed but actively looking for work. So, it’s not a strict measure of employment, per se. Job creation Atkins cited the latest month-to-month U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, which show the number of people employed in July 2013 vs. July 2012. They show that in Minnesota, an additional 55,000 people became employed, compared with 25,800 more in Wisconsin. We calculated that to be an increase of 2 percent for Minnesota, more than double Wisconsin’s growth of just under 1 percent. Atkins also cited reports by Congress’ Joint Economic Committee; Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar is the committee’s co-chair. The latest report, released in July 2013, shows that since the recession, Minnesota job growth was 0.1 percent while Wisconsin lost 1.5 percent of its jobs. We also found June 2013 rankings by The Business Journal for private-sector employment growth. Both Walker and Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, took office in January 2011. Dayton was ranked 15th among governors, with a 2.01 percent growth rate during his tenure; Walker was ranked 40th at 1.07 percent. School test scores Both Atkins and Evenson cited results of the ACT college entrance exam. We found that for the class of 2013, among states where more than half the students took the ACT, Minnesota ranked first and Wisconsin tied with Iowa for second. Minnesota’s average score of 23 and Wisconsin’s was 22.1. That's a pretty significant gap, given that the range of scores was small, from 18.7 to 23. Educated workforce To back this part of his claim, Atkins cited the percentage of residents age 25 and over who had a bachelor’s degree. His figures were dated, so we found the most recent figures, for 2011, which show Minnesota’s education attainment about one-fifth higher than Wisconsin’s. In Minnesota, 31.9 percent of residents had a four-year degree or higher. In Wisconsin, the rate was 26.2. OK. So, how did Atkins’ four measures score out? Minnesota kicked butt in the sense that it outperformed Wisconsin on all four measures, and by comfortable margins. Other measures The rest of Atkins' claim was that Minnesota also beats Wisconsin on a host of other business climate-related measures. He and Evenson cited some, and we found some, as well. Compared to the measures Atkins cited, the results are more of a mixed bag. On some measures, Minnesota ranked better than Wisconsin. -- Business climate: The latest Forbes ranking of states for business, released in December 2012, listed Minnesota 20th and Wisconsin 44th overall. In terms of economic climate, Minnesota ranked 20th and Wisconsin 29th. The magazine considered costs, labor supply, regulatory environment, current economic climate, growth prospects and quality of life. And CNBC's "top states for doing business" ratings for 2013 ranked Minnesota 15th and Wisconsin 22nd. The business news TV network's index uses 51 measures of competitiveness. -- Competitiveness: The Beacon Hill Institute, a free-market think tank at Suffolk University in Boston, released its annual competitiveness index in April 2013. The index, which assesses government and fiscal policy, infrastructure, business incubation and other factors, ranked Minnesota third and Wisconsin 18th. -- Economic growth: A U.S. Commerce Department report released in June 2013 showed Minnesota’s gross domestic product increased 3.5 percent in 2012. That was more than double Wisconsin’s 1.5 percent. Wisconsin did better on other measures. -- Business climate: In November 2012, Site Selection magazine ranked Wisconsin 13th on its list of top 25 states for business climate. Minnesota didn’t make the list. The study was based in part on surveys of corporate site selectors. -- CEO survey: A national survey of 736 chief executive officers by Chief Executive magazine, published in March 2013, ranked Wisconsin the 17th best state for doing business, with Walker’s election cited as a key reason. Minnesota ranked 30th, with Gov. Dayton’s support of tax increases cited. -- Private investment: A July 2013 report by the Private Equity Growth Capital Council rated the top 20 states by "investment value and the number of investments." Wisconsin ranked 14th at $9.1 billion; Minnesota didn’t make the list. On still other measures, the two states were about even. -- Business taxes: The Tax Foundation’s "2013 state business tax climate index," which is based on how 100 tax variables affect competitiveness, rated both states as among the worst, with Wisconsin at 43rd and Minnesota at 45th. -- Entrepreneurial activity: Measuring entrepreneurial activity as being high, medium or low for 2012, the Kauffman Foundation put both states in the low category. -- Business climate: In an April 2013 report on small business (companies with fewer than 500 employees), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranked Wisconsin 39th in business climate and Minnesota 40th. Taxes, government regulation and other measures went into assessing business climate. For "overall performance," the chamber put Minnesota 15th, with high ratings for "talent" and infrastructure; and Wisconsin 44th, with low ranks for short- and long-term job growth. We could go on, but we think the picture is pretty clear. Our rating Comparing the two states for business, Atkins said: "Minnesota is kicking butt relative to Wisconsin on everything from employment and job creation to school test scores, educated workforce and a host of other factors and rankings." Minnesota outperformed Wisconsin by comfortable margins on four measures Atkins singled out, and on several other rankings that used various economic indices. On other measures, Wisconsin led or was about even with Minnesota. For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Atkins a Half True.

pomt-02219	"Typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle class families."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/20/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-commerce-says-typical-mini/	After Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke endorsed President Barack Obama’s call for a $10.10 minimum wage, Wisconsin’s largest business lobby got on her case. In an April 4, 2014 opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce called raising the wage a job-killing move that would economically devastate workers -- doing the most harm to young, lower-skilled employees. "According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 1.1% of workers over age 25 earn the minimum wage," WMC chief lobbyist Scott Manley wrote in the piece. He added: "That's because typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. They are not living in poverty nor are they earning a wage that is responsible for sustaining a family." That part of the statement caught our attention. Are typical minimum wage earners "teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families"? Manley told us he relied on statistics published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and research by various think tanks on the living situations of young workers. We examined those and other information sources, and interviewed three economics researchers. The age question It’s clear that teenagers make up a significant chunk of those whose wage tops out at the current federal minimum wage of $7.25. Teens (defined as those 16 to 19) made up 31 percent of the 1.5 million workers who were right at that wage in 2013. Researchers often include in their calculations workers whose hourly wage is less than the minimum. Examples are tipped employees such as restaurant workers, and salespeople under certain circumstances. Under this approach, there are another 1.8 million minimum wage workers, bringing the total to 3.3 million, of which teenagers make up 24.1 percent. We heard pros and cons about both methods. The official scorekeeper, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, presents both numbers and the total of 3.3 million. Under the broader approach, teenagers are the second-largest category next to 20 to 24 year olds (26.2 percent). But in the narrower method, teenagers are the largest category of the 12 age groupings the federal government uses to report the data for 16 and up (there are 111,000 minimum-wage workers 65 and older). Manley says the plurality figure under the narrower approach backs up the group’s claim that teenagers are the "typical" minimum-wage worker. He even cited a definition (we found it in Dictionary.com) of "typical" that includes the phrase "representative" of a group. In other dictionaries we consulted, "typical" is defined as a characteristic that is "normal and expected" (YourDictionary.com) or captures "the overall sense of a thing" (AllWords.com). So, can "typical" be accurate if about 7 in 10 minimum-wage workers are not teenagers? Manley cited research by James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics who researches minimum wage issues for the conservative Heritage Foundation. But Sherk comes at it from a still different perspective -- a wider group of teenagers and young adults under 25. Sherk told us it would be accurate if the WMC had said that "teenagers or college students" are typical. The combination of teenagers and college students and other young adults under 25, Sherk notes in his research, accounts for just over 50 percent of minimum wage workers. Many work part-time. Sherk defines minimum wage workers as those at or below the minimum. We also sought the view of Keith Hall, a former top White House economics adviser named by President George W. Bush as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Like Sherk, Hall has warned against an increase in the minimum wage. "Typical to my mind means over half," said Hall, now a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. "But that’s just me," he added, saying the term might strike others differently. Finally, we asked David Cooper, an economic analyst at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which is funded primarily by labor unions and foundations. Cooper said the "typical" teenage claim struck him as false because the median age of workers right at the minimum wage is 23, and the average age is 29.8, according to his review of census data. In the context of the current debate over $10.10, the average age of workers who would benefit from that increase is 35, according to research by Cooper. Only 12 percent who would benefit are teenagers, that study showed. Bottom line, there’s some room to argue that teenagers are "typical" minimum wage workers, in that the group is by one measure the most-common category in reports breaking down the age of these employees. But even researchers who are sympathetic with WMC’s overall argument thought "typical" overshot the mark. Life with the parents The WMC claim, of course, went further, saying that teenagers "living with their parents in middle class families" are the typical minimum wage earners. We don’t need research to know that there are teenage workers in such settings. But quantifying how many of those teens living with parents are in "middle class families" proved elusive. On this, WMC’s Manley pointed us to the research by the Heritage Foundation. Heritage reported that "minimum-wage workers under 25 are typically not their family’s sole breadwinners. Rather, they tend to live in middle-class households that do not rely on their earnings." Just over 50 percent are not their family’s sole earner, Sherk told us. As for the how many are in middle-class families, Sherk referred us to another organization’s research, but it focused on minimum-wage workers aged 33 to 50, so it seems off point. And, as noted, the Heritage analysis itself is broader than just teenagers. Other voices say many live in less financially secure settings. Cooper, at the Economic Policy Institute, did not have data on living arrangements, but said that 54 percent of all workers at the minimum wage live in households with total family incomes less than $40,000. "It’s going to depend on how you want to define "middle class" families, but clearly the majority of these workers are in relatively low-income families," Cooper told us. We didn’t find data directly on point to "living with parents." But another research organization, the Employment Policies Institute, crunched census data in 2009 and found that 39 percent of workers helped by the move to $7.25 were living with parents or other relatives. How many were teenagers? "Unfortunately, I don’t have great data on the how many of the "living with parents/other family" category are teenagers," Employment Policies Institute research director Michael Saltsman told us. "We know there’s considerable overlap..." The institute, which has a website advocating against a wage increase, receives support from foundations, individuals and businesses including restaurants, Saltsman said. The New York Times reported that the nonprofit institute is run by a public relations firm that also represents the restaurant industry. Our rating Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce stated that "the typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle class families." By one definition of minimum-wage workers, teenagers make up the largest sub-group compared with other age groupings. But teenagers are less than a third of minimum wage workers by any measure, and hard data is scarce on how many live in middle-class families. Three experts -- two sympathetic to stopping a wage increase -- thought the statistical reality fell short of making the teenage cohort "typical" of the minimum wage pool.

pomt-12375	"State economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China."	false	/new-york/statements/2017/jun/02/anthony-brindisi/state-money-was-not-used-buy-beer-tanks-genesee-br/	A dozen massive fermentation tanks slowly traveled on barges along a 225-mile stretch of the Erie Canal before reaching Rochester last week. It was an eye-catching site for the thousands who flocked to the canal to watch the tanks float by. The 2,000-barrel tanks were hauled from Saratoga County to Rochester as part of Genesee Brewery’s $49 million upgrade. But their arrival also drew criticism from Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat from Utica, because the state offered economic incentives to the brewery even though the tanks were made in China. "It disgusts me to know that state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China, when we have companies like Feldmeier Equipment that produce products like this right in the Mohawk Valley," Brindisi said in a statement. "New York should put its money where its mouth is and support our state workers and state companies first, before they ship taxpayers' money right out the door to China." Is Brindisi right? Were tax dollars used to pay a manufacturer in China for the new fermentation tanks at Genesee Brewery? State money In September 2016, New York state officials announced a $9.5 million investment to support the expansion at Genesee Brewery. The state promised help from two programs: $4.5 million in tax credits from the Excelsior Jobs Program and up to $5 million from the governor’s Upstate Revitalization Initiative. But Genesee Brewery has not yet received any of that money from the state. The company must first meet criteria from the Empire State Development. The brewery must create 128 full-time positions by 2020 to qualify for the $4.5 million in tax credits. Half of those jobs have to go to local residents in poverty based on criteria from the Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative. The tax credits are spread out over ten years. The $5 million from the Upstate Revitalization Initiative has strings attached, too. The brewery must invest $34 million in private money and create 13 full-time positions to receive the first $2 million of the grant. The other $3 million would be paid in four installments if the brewery maintains its hiring goals and consistently pays its property taxes. Private money The tanks are part of a three-phase upgrade at Genesee Brewery. The state incentives could reach $9.5 million. Genesee Brewery’s corporate parent, North American Breweries, is spending $40 million. The approximate cost of the tanks accounts for about 5 percent of the company's $40 million investment, the company said. The brewery says its parent company paid for the tanks. The state also confirmed no state money was used. "The bottom line is that while Feldmeier bid on a larger equipment package, the company declined (twice) to bid on the tanks in question and not one penny of State funds were spent on the equipment purchased by NAB, from China or elsewhere," Jason Conwall, an Empire State Development spokesman, said in a statement. A request for bids on the tanks went out in December 2015, the same month the Finger Lakes region was awarded $500 million in economic development money from the governor’s Upstate Revitalization Initiative competition. The brewery’s expansion was included in the region’s pitch for the award but no dollar amount was announced until September 2016. Genesee Brewery signed a contract with Chinese manufacturer Lehui in June 2016 to begin the first phase of the project, a modernization of the brewery’s equipment. Genesee Brewery has worked with Feldmeier Equipment since at least 2006 to manufacture equipment for the plant, including seven tanks in the last three years. When the bid for new fermentation tanks went out, Feldmeier put in a bid for a large part of the project instead of the whole project. "Based on the timing for the project at the time, we placed a bid on the majority of it but not the entire project, just because of the timing," said Dave Pollock, vice president of sales for Feldmeier Equipment. North American Breweries said in its funding application to Empire State Development that no state money would be used to fund the first phase. The plan called for public funding in the second and third phases of the project, which include the construction of a business incubator, event space, solar panels and a learning center for tourists and brewers. The brewery is still in the first phase of the project. Our ruling Brindisi said "state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China." That may eventually be true. But it's not true now. The company has not received any state money yet. Brindisi also said New York state should support "our state workers and state companies first, before they ship taxpayers' money right out the door to China." No state money was used or will be used to buy twelve fermentation tanks from a Chinese manufacturer for Genesee Brewery. The brewery stands to eventually receive state money for other phases of the upgrade, but it must first meet investment and job creation targets. We rate the claim False.

pomt-13223	Says Donald Trump "used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correctly-claims-trump-tower-was-p/	Seeking to portray Donald Trump as a hypocrite on immigration, Hillary Clinton claimed during the third presidential debate that the billionaire candidate used undocumented workers to build his New York City skyscraper. In a jab at Trump, Clinton said her immigration plan would bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows and protect them from employers like Trump taking advantage of them. "And Donald knows a lot about this," she said. "He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ‘You complain, I'll get you deported.’ " This line of attack is similar to one used by one of Trump’s primary rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who in February accused him of hiring "illegal" Polish workers on a construction project decades ago. We rated Rubio’s claim Half True because he attributed more blame to Trump and mentioned a separate issue of a legal settlement. There’s also more evidence now to support Clinton’s simpler statement. Between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish a Manhattan building to make way for the eventual Trump Tower. That contractor in turn hired local union workers as well as 200 undocumented Polish workers to meet the tight deadlines. Media reports indicated that the Polish employees were paid off the books, working 12-hour shifts every day for only $4 to $5 an hour without overtime pay. Time magazine reported that Trump allegedly sought out the workers after seeing them on another construction job, and then threatened through his lawyer to contact immigration services during a dispute over unpaid wages. In 1983, union members hired to work on the project sued Trump, a union boss and the contractor for using the undocumented Polish workers to undercut their pensions and welfare funds. The future Republican presidential candidate appeared in court in 1990 and denied knowing that the workers weren’t in the country legally, but a Manhattan judge ended up ruling against Trump and ordered him to pay the workers more than $325,000. Trump appealed the case, which dragged on for another decade, before quietly settling out of court in 1999. The Republican candidate’s alleged use of undocumented workers has continued even into the current presidential campaign. Several construction workers interviewed by the Washington Post in July 2015 said they were hired to help renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington despite residing in the country illegally. A Trump spokeswoman at the time said his business and contractors followed all applicable immigration laws. Our ruling Clinton claimed that Trump "used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower." There’s no question that undocumented workers were hired to do demolition work on the future site of Trump Tower. Questions remain as to how involved Trump was in the construction process and hiring of the 200 Polish laborers, but Clinton is factually correct to say that undocumented labor helped construct Trump’s New York skyscraper. We rate this statement as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/53308da5-515b-4693-b9b8-f3728465b962	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-10-20T00:57:52	2016-10-20	['None']
pomt-06017	"Republicans are attempting to remove Barack Obama from Georgia’s Presidential Ballot in 2012."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/17/georgia-democrats/georgia-democrats-say-republicans-trying-knock-oba/	Georgia Democrats are telling their party faithful that Republicans are already trying to play election-year political tricks on President Barack Obama. And if GOP efforts work, state Democrats won’t even get to vote for Obama for president, Democrats warn. "Republicans are attempting to remove Barack Obama from Georgia’s Presidential Ballot in 2012," read a Dec. 21 post on the state party’s website. Then the post asked for money to pay for legal bills. A reader asked us to put the Democrats’ statement to the test, and we were happy to help. With a little reporting, we found that four Georgia residents are challenging Obama’s eligibility for the state presidential preference primary and general election ballots. They’re saying Obama isn’t a natural-born citizen, which would mean that under the Constitution, he’s not eligible to be president. Critics of this line of thought call some of these people "birthers," a term these challengers by and large reject. David Farrar of Cedartown in west Georgia thinks Obama’s biggest problem is that there needs to be proof in addition to the president’s birth certificate confirming he was born in the U.S. Kevin Powell of Duluth, Carl Swensson of Morrow and David Welden of Powder Springs think that Obama does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen. Powell and Swensson say they can cite U.S. Supreme Court precedent to prove it. A fifth challenger rescinded his complaint, said Kim Beal, a staff attorney with the Office of State Administrative Hearings, which is handling the challenges. A hearing is set for Jan. 26. "Man up," Swensson’s challenge told Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Kemp‘s office administers the state’s elections. PolitiFact Georgia has addressed such arguments before, and they didn’t do well on the Truth-O-Meter. The claims about Obama’s birth certificate range from False to Pants on Fire. PolitiFact Georgia also found problems with an argument that Obama does not meet the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen. But these theories aren’t the focus of this inquiry. We’re trying to figure out whether Democrats are right that Republicans are trying to knock Obama off the ballot. Obviously, these concerned citizens all want him gone. But are they Republicans? And is this a GOP-sanctioned effort? We looked into the challengers’ Republican bona fides. They emphasized that the Republican Party is not coordinating their efforts. Swensson told PolitiFact Georgia that he reached out to the party for its support and got none. "Basically, what I get from them is crickets," Swensson said. "Lots and lots of crickets." Georgia Republican Party Chairwoman Sue Everhart distanced the state party from the challenges. "The Georgia Republican Party is not a party to any of those challenges, and had no knowledge of them before they were filed," Everhart said in a statement released by a party spokesman. The challengers all said their efforts have nothing to do with their party affiliations. "It’s an entirely nonpartisan effort. It has nothing to do with politics, only to do with the Constitution," said Welden, who said he has voted Republican but leans independent. That said, challenges do have significant GOP ties. State Rep. Mark Hatfield, a Republican attorney from Waycross, represents Powell and Swensson in their challenge. He is vice chairman of the state House’s Judiciary Non-Civil Committee and is listed as the Republicans’ deputy majority whip. Last year, Hatfield sponsored legislation that would make presidential and vice presidential candidates prove their citizenship to make the state’s ballot. Swensson is chairman of the Clayton County Republican Party. Tennessee lawyer Van Irion represents Welden. He ran for Congress in 2010 and won the backing of 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. Irion lost in the Republican primary. Orly Taitz, a California lawyer, represents Farrar. She ran unsuccessfully in 2010 to be the Republican nominee for California secretary of state. Farrar told PolitiFact Georgia he considers himself a Republican. Voter records show Powell voted in six Georgia primaries between 1996 and 2008 and chose a Republican ballot in all of them. How do we rule? There are efforts to "remove Barack Obama from Georgia’s Presidential Ballot in 2012," as Democrats said. Whether "Republicans" are trying to do this is a dicier issue. The Georgia Democrats’ language could lead a reasonable person to think that the effort is organized by the GOP. It’s not. Nevertheless, these challenges are dyed bright red. A GOP state representative does represent two of the challengers, and two unsuccessful Republican candidates from Tennessee and California represent the rest. One challenger is chairman of his county GOP. Three of the four challengers consider themselves Republicans, and all of them have voted Republican. Because the state party is not involved in the challenge, but individual Republicans are leading the charge, we rate the Georgia Democrats’ statement Half True.

pomt-05135	Says a national Coca-Cola study showed Texans love Texas more than residents of any other state love their state; Wisconsinites ranked second.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jun/22/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-national-coca-cola-study-showed-tex/	U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, keynoting the Republican Party of Texas convention in Fort Worth, linked pride in Texas and Wisconsin, his home state, telling delegates on June 9, 2012: "I remember reading a few years ago a story about how Coca-Cola did this big, exhaustive marketing study about how people love their states. First place: Texas. Second place: Wisconsin." We sought the skinny on that. By email, Ryan campaign spokesman Kevin Seifert replied: "Ryan's statement is fairly straightforward, Wisconsinites and Texans both love and are proud of their home states." Seifert also pointed us to an entry on the website of Worthpoint, which provides market data on art, antiques and collectibles including soda paraphernalia. The entry states that national focus groups run by Coca-Cola once found that Wisconsin and Texas natives most strongly identify with their states, and by a wide margin. Also, the entry says, Wisconsin and Texas were the only states the Coca-Cola company allowed to develop logos and advertising lines tying each state to the brand and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Wisconsin "developed this program and used it for most of the decade of the nineties." Responding to our inquiry, a Worthpoint representative, Nathan Trapuzzano, pointed out by telephone that the online entry is a copy of a December 2006 eBay post related to the completed auction of a Coca-Cola jacket. "By putting it on our website, we’re not saying every word here is true," Trapuzzano said. We asked eBay to elaborate. By email, spokeswoman Kari Ramirez said eBay could not provide information on the person who posted that information. We also reached out to the Coca-Cola Company. Spokeswoman Kerry Tressler said that while the company's internal search for such a study came up dry, it is "likely possible that the study took place." In a follow-up email, Tressler said: "We launched a grassroots marketing effort in the early 1990s called ‘Coca-Cola Texas’ with a similar program in Wisconsin. Given the size and scope of that type of program, it is highly likely there was a marketing study at the time to validate the points of these campaigns." An online Nexis search led us to a Feb. 25, 1992, press release about Coca-Cola launching the Texas campaign, the "most comprehensive marketing initiative ever focusing on a single state." Separately, Seifert alerted us to a May 11, 1992, press release saying that up to 10 different radio spots would air in Wisconsin that year featuring a fictitious Coca-Cola truck driver touring the state to discover what "Wisconsin Proud" is all about. The release calls the campaign an extension of Coca-Cola’s "Wisconsin Proud" theme introduced, mainly on billboards, in 1989. We came up with nothing more potentially related to Ryan’s claim. You might say: That. Is. It. Our ruling We count on individuals who air claims to have factual backup. On this front, an unattributed eBay post about focus groups is insufficient. And while it’s believable that Coca-Cola ad campaigns launched 20 years ago drew on research, that does not demonstrate there was an exhaustive national study like the one described by Ryan. Ryan's claim still strikes us as having a touch of truth. As prideful Texans, we’re hat-in-hand sorry to rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-02985	"We’re 49th in the United States in new businesses created."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/20/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-second-last-business-for/	In her first extended TV interview, gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke downplayed the notion that Wisconsin’s tax climate is a roadblock to job growth that has lagged behind the national average. "We have to make sure we’re competitive with other states, but I’m not sure that’s a major factor," the Madison Democrat said Oct. 13, 2013 on WISN-TV’s Upfront with Mike Gousha show. "Companies look at qualified work force, being able to attract people to Wisconsin, the quality of life, the schools." One key to job growth, the former Trek Bicycle executive said, is to boost Wisconsin’s track record of developing new businesses. "Entrepreneurship is incredibly important to growing economies, and we’re 49th in the United States in new businesses created," Burke said. "So we have to make sure we’re supporting people starting their businesses, growing them and having the capital to do that." Is Wisconsin that close to scraping the bottom on business startups? It’s a particularly interesting question since Republican Gov. Scott Walker is emphasizing that more than 11,000 new business entities have formed since he took office in January 2011. That increase in net new formations, a 3 percent rise, is a positive economic sign but doesn’t say much about startups and new job creation because many of the new businesses are limited partnerships set up for legal or liability reasons and don’t employ anyone. That’s what we found in our recent Walk-O-Meter evaluation of Walker’s promise to create 10,000 new jobs. Digging into Burke’s numbers To back up her claim, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed us to a study conducted annually by the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation. The foundation’s study, which is widely cited and known as the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, uses U.S. Census data to capture the number of new business owners in their first month of significant business activity. The 2013 study, based on 2012 data, found that Wisconsin had the third-lowest number of entrepreneurs per 100,000 people. It was ahead of only Nebraska and Minnesota, equivalent to a ranking of 48th. So Burke was very close to the mark based on the study. And Wisconsin’s recent history shows a similar performance -- rankings of 40, 49, 28 and 48 in the Kauffman Index from 2011 to 2008. Notably, back in 2000, only two states had better numbers than Wisconsin. "Entrepreneurial activity rates follow strong geographical patterns," the 2013 study said. "Entrepreneurial activity generally is highest in Western and Southern states and lowest in Midwestern and Northeastern states." We should note that the Kauffman Foundation warns that its study isn’t meant to provide a precise ranking of states. But its report in effect does that by reporting precise ratings and singling out states in the top five highest and lowest groups. To expand the picture, we spoke to Kauffman spokeswoman Barb Pruitt and two academic experts with deep experience in researching the rate of business startups. All agreed that the Kauffman index is just one way to measure entrepreneurship, and has some significant limitations. For instance, it counts a lot of part-time self-employed people who by definition don’t employ anyone else. Kauffman, it turns out, funds the U.S. Census Bureau program that produces a separate set of statistics that tally openings and closings at businesses with paid employees. The data is collected from business-registry statistics and employer payrolls. This data sheds more light on entrepreneurial activity, we were told by two leading researchers in this area, Scott Shane, professor of entrepreneurial studies and economics at Case Western Reserve University, and Zoltan Acs, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship and Public Policy at George Mason University. Ian Hathaway, an economic advisor to Engine, a research and policy group for technology startups, analyzed 2011 data on openings and closings. He pointed us to a number that illustrates new business formation rate in each state. The results were identical to the Kauffman index report: Wisconsin was ahead of only two states. The same was true in 2010. An important note: Because of a time lag in Census reporting, the March 2011 snapshot is the latest available. That only covers a few months of Walker’s term. We asked Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, about Wisconsin’s track record on startups. "It’s an imperfect science but most indicators would confirm that Wisconsin ranks among the bottom 10 states for net company creation," Still said. "That may be explained, in part, because the recession started later in Wisconsin and ended later here, as well." Still said he’s optimistic the climate here is changing, but he added that future economic trends and public policy decisions on helping foster growth in startup-firms will play a big role. Finally, we found that Wisconsin looks better on a third measure: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures on the net number of "business establishments" in each state. In 2011, Wisconsin ranked 19th on its percentage increase over the year before, according to research by Economic Modeling Specialists Intl., a private firm that tracks labor-market trends. But EMSI and other experts say the BLS figures don’t reflect just new businesses; establishments can refer to new outlets or locations that existing businesses open up, for instance. Our rating In a discussion of how she would be different than Walker, Burke’s claim was that Wisconsin is "49th in the United States in new businesses created." Both the study she cited, as well as data seen as a better indicator of startup activity, put Wisconsin at 48th, not 49th. The data is somewhat dated, covering only part of Walker’s time, but is the latest available. With those clarifications, we rate her claim Mostly True.
