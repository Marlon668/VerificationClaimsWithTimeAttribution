pomt-10041	If we got solar energy from "an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/18/al-gore/al-gore-optimistic-about-solar-energy-and-pretty-a/	Al Gore startled a Senate committee with an optimistic scheme for harnessing the sun's energy. The former vice president sketched out the idea at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on climate change where he was the star witness. "A technology called 'concentrating solar thermal' is now becoming very competitive," Gore said at the Jan. 28, 2009, hearing. " Scientific American pointed out that if we took an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year." In January 2008, Scientific American published an influential article titled "A Solar Grand Plan." A conservative writer immediately attacked Gore's claim. The Scientific American article "did not say we needed an area 100 miles on each side, which is 10,000 square miles," William Tucker of the American Spectator wrote a day after Gore's testimony. "The article stated, 'To meet the 2050 projection [of electrical demand], 46,000 square miles of land would be needed..." Gore's spokeswoman, Kallee Kreider, said Gore had cited the wrong source — he intended to cite this report from Environment America, an advocacy group that promotes clean energy. That report in turn cites the U.S. Energy Department, which does indeed say on this Web page , "The solar energy resource in a 100-mile-square area of Nevada [otherwise known as 100-miles-squared, or 10,000 square miles] could supply the United States with all its electricity using modestly efficient (10%) commercial photovoltaic modules." That's a compelling source, but the apparent contradiction cited by Tucker made us wonder. So we called two of the authors of the Scientific American piece, James Mason and Ken Zweibel. They said that Gore was probably correct, and in fact their article — far from contradicting his claim — contains data that support it. Mason and Zweibel said that when they wrote that 46,000 square miles would be needed to meet the electricity demand in 2050, they were assuming electricity would provide a much greater portion of the country's energy than it does now — including, for example, 344 million plug-in hybrid vehicles. A 10,000-square-mile solar plant could well provide today's electricity needs, they said. Here's how (dense math ahead; proceed with caution): As graphics accompanying the print version of the Scientific American piece indicate, the sun in parts of the Southwestern United States provides an average of about 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day of solar radiation. Take that 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day and multiply that by the 365 days in a year and you get 2,372 kilowatt hours per square meter per year. We'll round it to 2,400. Solar-electric systems could — optimistically — convert about 15 percent of that to electricity. That comes to 360 kilowatt hours per square meter per year. You can't cram solar panels close together, because they would cast shadows on each other. For every square meter of solar panel in the southwestern U.S., you need 2.5 square meters of space. Once you account for that (by dividing 360 by 2.5), you find each square meter of a solar installation could produce 144 kilowatt hours per year. There are 25.9 billion square meters in 10,000 square miles. Multiply that 25.9 billion by the 144 kilowatt hours that a square meter can produce in a year, and you get 3,729 billion kilowatt hours per year. The U.S. consumes about 3,900 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year, according to the federal Energy Information Administration . So Gore's estimate was close enough considering the many uncertainties involved. "I don't think you've found a serious blunder," said Zweibel, director of the Institute for Analysis of Solar Energy at George Washington University. "Anywhere from 100 to 150 miles per side will easily produce all the electricity in the United States with any solar technology," said Mason, director of the American Solar Action Plan and the Renewable Energy Research Institute in Farmingdale, N.Y. That said, there are all sorts of reasons why building a 10,000-square-mile solar installation would be even more difficult than it sounds. For one, we would need a place to store the electricity so that it could be doled out in the dark night hours and on cloudy days. Mason and Zweibel suggest using the solar energy to compress air underground in caverns, old mines, aquifers and depleted natural gas wells. Then it could be released on demand to turn turbines that would generate electricity. Also, we would need a vast new system of transmission lines. To pay for that and other necessary improvements, Mason and Zweibel call for $420 billion of government subsidies. Even given all the challenges, they, like Gore, argue large-scale solar development makes sense when you consider the enormous amounts of land, energy and money we currently use to mine fossil fuels, produce electricity from them and control their pollution. Gore didn't exactly tell the whole story, since the 10,000-square-mile solar farm would not do the job "in and of itself" without other infrastructure improvements. But he was testifying on the broad issue of climate change, not delivering a lecture on building a solar plant. And his misattributing the claim to Scientific American is not a significant inaccuracy, since that article did contain statistics that support the claim. We find Gore's claim True.

pomt-14862	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has "no congressional oversight."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/14/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-consumer-financial-protection-b/	During the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Carly Fiorina brought up an issue that delves deep into the weeds of the federal regulatory system. She took aim at the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a law passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by President Barack Obama that placed significant new regulations on the financial services sector. Fiorina called Dodd-Frank "the classic of crony capitalism. The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we've created something called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that's digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud. This is how socialism starts, ladies and gentlemen. We must take our government back." We wondered: Was Fiorina right that, unlike other federal regulatory agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has "no congressional oversight"? We took a closer look. An unusual structure First, some background on the bureau. Its mission is to "protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws." This includes enforcing consumer financial protection laws, following up on consumer complaints, promoting financial education, conducting research on consumer behavior, and monitoring financial markets for risks. New agencies that seek to police well-established industries are often controversial, and the bureau is no different. Its champion was Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon who was considered the likely first head of the bureau until her appointment was effectively blocked by Republicans in Congress. Obama’s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a controversial recess appointment. Cordray was ultimately confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (The bureau declined to comment for this story. We did not hear back from Fiorina’s campaign.) Fiorina has a point that by Washington standards, the bureau is unusually unfettered by oversight, congressional and otherwise -- something specifically designed to limit any influence by the financial sector it oversees. Perhaps the clearest example of this long leash is that, unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. That means that Congress doesn’t approve the bureau’s budget every year. Instead, the bureau’s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve, currently capped at 12 percent of the Fed’s total operating expenses. This works out to about $600 million a year today. Those who are skeptical of the bureau say that seriously hampers Congress’ oversight ability. "Oversight without any budget leverage has turned out to be completely hollow," said Todd J. Zywicki, executive director of the George Mason Law and Economics Center at George Mason University and a frequent commentator on the issue. Brenden D. Soucy, a Miami-based lawyer, wrote an article critical of the the bureau’s degree of congressional oversight in the Florida State University Law Review in 2013. He called the bureau "the most independent agency in United States history." "The CFPB’s extreme independence is touted as one of its greatest virtues, but history has shown that while independence from political pressure can be a virtue, near total isolation is not," Soucy wrote. Congress does have some levers of influence So it’s clear that Congress lacks an important -- and perhaps the most important -- lever for allowing lawmakers to oversee and guide the agency. But does that really equal "no congressional oversight"? Not really. Here are a number of ways in which Congress can oversee the bureau: • Congress can use legislation to change (or even abolish) the bureau. Indeed, there’s currently legislation in both chambers to enshrine a variety of transparency standards, some of which passed the House Financial Services Committee with bipartisan backing. • The Senate must confirm the head of the bureau. • The board’s director must testify at least twice a year before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; the House Financial Services Committee; and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The bureau must also submit semi-annual budget justifications. • The bureau is subject to an annual financial audit by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional agency. Combined with other checks and balances by other parts of the executive branch and the judicial branch, this is a list of oversight mechanisms "that will measure up against any regulatory agency in Washington," Warren, the bureau’s patron saint, wrote in an October 2015 op-ed. Other experts in government regulation and oversight don’t go this far -- but they add that Fiorina’s characterization is an exaggeration. ‘The CFPB has a lot longer leash that almost any other federal agency," said Donald F. Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. But, he added, "Congress did it on purpose. Congress can change it." And Soucy, the lawyer who wrote critically of the lack of congressional oversight, agreed that Fiorina went too far with this statement. "While the CFPB is nearly completely free of congressional oversight, it is not true to say that it has ‘no’ congressional oversight," he said. Our ruling Fiorina said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has "no congressional oversight." She has a point that where the bureau is concerned, lawmakers lack one of their strongest levers of influence -- the power of the purse. This makes it reasonable to say that the bureau has an unusually low amount of congressional oversight. However, "low" does not equal "none." Lawmakers are already flexing their muscles by advancing laws that would stiffen the bureau’s transparency rules, and the bureau’s Senate-confirmed director must testify and provide financial documentation at least twice a year to three separate congressional committees. The bureau must also be audited annually by an arm of Congress, the Government Accountability Office. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-00870	"We've seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/13/nancy-devaney/marijuana-legalization-opponent-says-says-alcohol-/	Supporters of legalizing recreational marijuana last week unrolled the latest bill to decriminalize possession of small amounts of cannabis, saying it could mean up to $58 million in tax revenue and give the state an economic boost. But those on the other side of the debate caution that legalization would lead to greater consumption of the drug and other social problems. Rhode Islanders may end up driving impaired and endangering others, for example. Minors would find it even easier to obtain the drug, even if it would remain illegal for people under age 21 under the proposed law, they said. One such opponent is Nancy DeNuccio, chairwoman of the Ocean State Prevention Alliance, a coalition that aims to limit the impact of marijuana on youth. In a WJAR-10 news report about the latest legalization legislation, DeNuccio expressed her concern about the potential consequences to young people of legalizing marijuana for adults. "We've seen the increase of alcohol use for under age kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21," she said. After a reader asked us to check her statement, we called DeNuccio, who immediately told us that she’d misspoken, that it was a mistake. Still, we decided that we’d look into her claim because whatever we found might help inform our readers as lawmakers take up the debate. Also, the statement was made in a television interview that remains publicly available. We found our answer in data from the Centers for Disease Control’s national Youth Risk Behavior Survey. It shows that, in Rhode Island, the percentage of teens who reported drinking alcohol at least once in the past 30 days had fallen dramatically since 1997 -- from 52 percent in 1997 to 31 percent in 2013. Similarly, the number of state high schoolers who said they consumed alcohol beyond a sip or two before age 13 had dropped over the same period, from 34 percent to 14 percent. The same goes for the percentage of teenagers who said they had five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past 30 days. Those numbers decreased from 32 percent in 1997 to 15 percent in 2013. As for the percentage of Rhode Island high schoolers who reported consuming at least one alcoholic beverage in their lifetime, those numbers dropped from a high of 79 percent in 2001 to a low of 62 percent in 2011. The Rhode Island numbers mirror what has been reported around the country. Nationally, the percentages of teenagers reporting drinking declined in three of the same four criteria. The only category to remain static was the percentage of high schoolers who said they drank five or more drinks in one sitting at least once in the past 30 days. Those numbers showed gains and losses throughout the time period, keeping it steady, according to the survey. Our ruling Nancy DeNuccio said, "We've seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21." We note that DeNuccio immediately acknowledged that she had misspoken. Given the evidence we found, we rate the claim False	None	Nancy Denuccio	None	None	None	2015-03-13T00:01:00	2015-03-06	['None']

pomt-09761	All the talk about socialism during the campaign made young people more interested in it by Election Day.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/02/michael-moore/michael-moore-says-young-people-are-increasingly-w/	Responding to conservative critics of President Barack Obama who say the president is leading the United States toward socialism, filmmaker Michael Moore says that wouldn't necessarily be out of step with public opinion. In his just-released documentary, Capitalism: A Love Story , Moore recites an episode from the 2008 campaign that prompted critics to say Obama was a socialist. But Moore then cites poll statistics to show that socialism is surprisingly popular with American young people. "By Election Day, the Rasmussen poll reported that only 37 percent of young adults now favor capitalism over socialism," Moore says in the film. He added in footnotes to the movie on MichaelMoore.com that "despite fear-mongering about the word, particularly around the time of the 2008 presidential election, young people are increasingly interested in socialism." The footnotes say the Rasmussen Reports poll found that "adults under 30 are essentially evenly divided: 37 percent prefer capitalism, 33 percent socialism, and 30 percent are undecided." We located the poll in question. It was taken in April 2009 using automated telephone calls. It had 1,000 adult respondents and a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. But the Rasmussen poll was taken five months after the election. So in the movie, Moore incorrectly describes the timing. At the point the poll was taken, Obama had been in office for nearly three months and the nation was in the depths of a recession. We should point out that over the years, critics have faulted Rasmussen for using machines rather than human interviewers, although it and other "robo-call" pollsters have won some acceptance. But more importantly, Rasmussen made no effort to make sure the people taking part in the survey understood the difference between capitalism and socialism. Rasmussen asked, "Which is a better system, capitalism or socialism?" The survey did not define either term. Among survey participants of all ages, 53 percent preferred capitalism, 20 percent preferred socialism and 27 percent said they were unsure. But for adults under 30, the group Moore was talking about, the results broke down as 37 percent for capitalism, 33 percent for socialism and 30 percent undecided. So Moore reported those results accurately. Let's look closely, though, at how Moore phrased his assertion. He said on his Web site that young people "are increasingly interested in socialism." That means their attitudes had to have changed to some degree over time. And we can't find evidence of that. And in the movie, he incorrectly pegged it to the November 2008 election. The polling firm's president, Scott Rasmussen, told PolitiFact that he has only asked that question once. So there's no way to compare his April poll question against other Rasmussen questions taken at different times. As for data by other pollsters, we contacted Karlyn Bowman, a veteran polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. She said that as soon as the Rasmussen question about socialism came out in April and began attracting media attention, she asked an intern to trawl through her polling databases to locate similar questions over the years. The intern found about a dozen items that addressed the question of socialism or free markets, but most of them aren't especially comparable to Rasmussen's question. For starters, the questions' wording is all over the map — a problem because pollsters warn that questions asked with different wordings can elicit different answers. One asked whether respondents agreed with the statement, "The United States would be better off if it moved toward socialism," while another asked whether they agreed with the statement, "Most people are better off in a free market economy, even though some people are rich and some are poor." More importantly, though, Bowman could find only a few polls for which the response data was broken down by age. She said that age breakdowns are not typically included in the public versions of polls. Still, we'll report the two other polls with age breakdowns that we or Bowman were able to locate. One was a January 2009 Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll. It asked, "Do you think it would be a good thing or a bad thing for the United States to move away from capitalism and more toward socialism?" Among respondents of all ages, 23 percent said it was a good thing, 65 percent said it was a bad thing and 12 percent didn't know. But among the under-30 crowd, 31 percent said it was a good thing, 54 percent said it was a bad thing and 15 percent didn't know. That's more favorable to socialism than the all-age sample as a whole, but the poll doesn't exactly show that under-30s are "evenly divided," as they were in the Rasmussen poll. So this result undercuts Moore's claim that socialism is running strong among America's young people. Not convinced by a poll sponsored by Fox News, which liberals accuse of having a conservative bias? Then try one from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, which has a reputation for being nonideological. The Pew center took a poll in March 2009 that asked, "Generally, do you think people are better off in a free-market economy, even though there may be severe ups and downs from time to time, or don't you think so?" Among all respondents, 70 percent agreed that people were better off in a free-market economy, while 20 percent disagreed and 10 percent said they didn't know. Among respondents under 30, the numbers weren't much different: 69 percent agreed that people were better off in a free-market economy and 26 percent disagreed, with 6 percent saying they didn't know. So, these responses also undercut Moore's notion that younger Americans are looking fondly at socialism. Scott Rasmussen has a theory. He suggested that support for capitalism as it is currently practiced is weakening, even as support for the theory of free markets remains strong. He cites an April Rasmussen survey that asked whether respondents favored a free-market economy or a government-managed economy. Overall, 77 percent of respondents favored a free-market economy, while just 11 percent favored a government-managed economy. For those under 30, free markets led, 79 percent to 8 percent. These results simultaneously bolster and undercut the claim in Capitalism: A Love Story . On the plus side for Moore, Rasmussen suggested in an interview that "the word 'capitalism' had taken on a lot of baggage partly because it was seen through the lens of taxpayer bailouts" and other scandals and collapses on Wall Street. These developments are a primary target of Moore's movie. “It’s hard for people to embrace a system that lets big business keep profits in good times and then asks for taxpayer bailouts when times are tough," Rasmussen wrote in a news release announcing the poll results. On the other hand, the fact that Rasmussen found Americans under 30 supporting a free-market economy over a government-managed economy by nearly 10-to-1 undermines Moore's notion that young people are warm to socialism. After we inquired about it, Moore's camp acknowledged to PolitiFact that the "increasingly" reference on the Web site was wrong. "It looks like the problem here is with the fact-check section of the our Web site," said Jonathan Schwarz, a spokesman for Moore. "Now, I’m completely sure that the attitudes of young adults toward economic matters ARE different than those of young adults during (say) the Reagan administration or the late '90s, but the movie doesn’t make that specific claim." He said that the Web reference will be changed. But while that item may be corrected on the Web site, the statement in the movie still says that "by Election Day," socialism was more popular with young people than it used to be. There does not appear to be much, if any, poll data to support that. So Moore has not convincingly shown that young people are reacting to the U.S. economic system by moving toward socialism. We rate Moore's statement False.	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2009-10-02T17:26:24	2009-10-02	['None']
pomt-08429	Says Christopher Little has "a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst types of corporate polluters"	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/19/edwin-pacheco/pacheco-says-little-has-history-working-against-en/	Christopher H. Little, the Moderate Party’s candidate for attorney general, has tried to position himself as the candidate with the best experience to clean up Rhode Island’s politics and environment. Among other credentials, he cites his past chairmanship of Common Cause of Rhode Island and his three years as president of Save the Bay, beginning in 1987. So it was no surprise that someone might try to sully his Mr. Clean persona. Earlier this month, state Democratic Party Chairman Edwin R. Pacheco said Little’s claim to being an environmental champion was contaminated by his private law work for polluters. "Attorney general candidate Chris Little and his law firm have a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst type of corporate polluters," Pacheco said in an Oct. 4 news release. Little dismissed Pacheco’s charges, saying "Mr. Pacheco, you need to actually read these cases you’re citing. If you do you will find that I was actually trying to help preserve the environment." An open invitation to look at the record. How could we refuse? Pacheco cites three instances in which he claims Little represented clients who were polluters: * Two Massachusetts towns that took the federal Environmental Protection Agency to court over a proposed sludge dump * A chemical company whose North Carolina facility was designated a hazardous waste site * A Massachusetts-based gasoline station operator that was fined for a gasoline spill in Brockton We’ll look at them one-by-one. The EPA suit Pacheco’s first claim involves the Massachusetts towns of Walpole and Norfolk, which challenged a 1989 federal Environmental Protection Agency study that said it was environmentally safe to build a landfill for dried sewage sludge in Walpole. Pacheco’s news release said the EPA found "the towns violated water pollution laws. … Chris Little was on the side of polluters and lost." That case stemmed from the 1980s effort to clean up Boston Harbor. New filtration plants were built to purify sewage effluent before it was discharged into the harbor. But the new plants generated sludge, which had to be dumped somewhere. In 1989, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority decided that somewhere was in Walpole, near the Norfolk town line. The towns objected and sued the EPA, claiming the EPA’s environmental impact study failed to address environmental threats the landfill would pose. Little — who was with Tillinghast, Collins & Graham at the time — said he joined the effort in 1989 or 1990 on Norfolk’s behalf, after he’d represented the Rhode Island town of Richmond in its successful fight to stop a 70-acre landfill from being built there. A federal district court judge ruled for the EPA, finding that the agency had considered the issues and met the federal standards for an impact study. In the end, the dump was never built. In 1993, after lobbying by the state, the EPA agreed to a plan to have the dried sludge trucked to dumps in Utah. Pacheco bases his criticism of Little on a summary of the suit on LexisNexis, an Internet data base, which said "the EPA found that the towns had violated the Water Pollution Control Act..." However, the judge’s decision shows that summary was inaccurate. Rather than violating water pollution control laws, the towns were trying to get them enforced more stringently. In fact, the ruling shows it was Little’s client who sought tougher environmental law enforcement. The North Carolina company Pacheco's news release said: In 1988, Little's law firm continued their quest against environmental protection when his firm defended a company that had a history of contaminating drinking water supplies." That company was National Starch and Chemical, a North Carolina firm that makes chemicals for textile and furniture makers. Pacheco’s statement cites a 1980s case in which National Starch was cited for storing 350,000 gallons of liquid waste in unlined trenches on its property. Because of the threat to local drinking water wells, the EPA ordered it to clean up the site. Little did represent National Starch, but it was in a case in Rhode Island, not North Carolina. National Starch was among several companies that used a New Jersey company to dispose of their waste. The companies thought their waste was going to an incinerator in New Jersey, but instead it was taken to Rhode Island, where it was illegally dumped at the Davis site in Smithfield, later designated as a Superfund site. The company agreed to pay $5 million toward the cleanup; Little represented it in subsequent lawsuits to recover that money from the disposal company that misled it. Little maintains his work for National Starch wasn’t to defend a polluter but to make sure the real guilty party paid financially. The oil company Pacheco’s third claim involved legal work Little did for gasoline station owner Mutual Oil of Massachusetts. His news release says Mutual Oil was fined $50,000 by the state for spilling gasoline at a station it owned in Brockton, a claim we verified through the Massachusetts attorney general’s report for fiscal year 2002. Little did represent Mutual Oil, but not in that case. Instead, it was in a Rhode Island zoning dispute. In 1999 a developer wanted to build a gas station in a Stop & Shop shopping center on Mendon Road, in Cumberland, near the Blackstone River. A group of local gas station owners that wanted to stop a new competitor convinced the zoning board to reject the plan, in part because the gas station would have been built on a floodplain of the Blackstone River. Little said Mutual Oil financed his work on behalf of the local station owners. To summarize: Pacheco was wrong when he said Little "was on the side of the polluters" in the Massachusetts sludge case. He was correct when he said Little represented a North Carolina company that caused pollution problems in that state. But Little’s representation of the company had nothing to do with that case.

pomt-08170	A ban on earmarks greatly weakens the authority Congress has over spending, to the benefit of the executive branch.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/01/dave-obey/us-rep-dave-obey-says-earmarks-ban-would-greatly-w/	On Nov. 29, 2010, the U.S. Senate chamber rang with allegations that members were about to yield precious power to President Barack Obama and render themselves impotent when it comes to controlling spending. At issue was a proposed two-year moratorium on earmarks, those much-maligned special projects inserted by individual congressmen and associated with pork-barrel politics. The Senate ultimately voted down the ban, with opponents coming from both sides of the aisle -- though it could return once new members are sworn in come January. In the House, Republicans have voted in their caucus for a broad earmarks ban, but Democrats have not joined the move. The claim that a ban would save nothing has been thoroughly tested (PolitiFact National found that statement Mostly True). Receiving much less attention: The argument that a ban would greatly shift power to the executive branch. U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, says a ban would do just that. In a strongly worded statement, Obey suggested Republicans in Congress would be "turning total control over spending to the administration" by banning earmarks. He also suggested Republicans under the Tea Party philosophy were messing with powers that are "a large part of this institution’s constitutional authority." Obey, who is retiring from the House in January, spoke out after his replacement, Republican Sean Duffy, was picked to make the motion in the House Republican caucus to ban earmarks in the next Congress. So are Obey and other members on target in suggesting that an earmark ban could seriously affect the balance of power? First let’s look review some constitutional basics. Congress -- the legislative branch -- has "power of the purse" by virtue of Article 1 of the Constitution, which declares in part that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." But the president -- leader of the executive branch -- first proposes the budget. That sets up a fundamental tug-of-war between the branches. Congress passes massive appropriations bills to fund the budget, and also uses very specific earmarks and other procedures to direct that budgeted funds be spent on a particular project or program, or be directed to specific contractors. Earmarks can bypass competitive processes. Insiders, outsiders and scholars are all over the map on the congressional powers question. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group that backed the earmark moratoriums, said Obey’s contention was "not accurate." Not only does Congress have the lead role in appropriations, it has the ability to do much more to hold the executive branch accountable than it does now, Ellis said. He argues Congress has relied narrowly on the relatively small-ticket earmarking process to the detriment of its oversight into broader spending issues. Members could force better bidding procedures, for instance, so the administration is held more accountable. "Earmarks are a lazy way of deciding where the funding goes," Ellis said. "Congress became fat, dumb and happy." Scott Lilly disagrees. He had a front-row seat to the spending game as a top Obey aide for more than a decade and later as director of the House Appropriations Committee staff. Now he’s a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. Lilly thinks Obey is on point because constitutional authority alone has not assured that Congress actually controls appropriations as intended. Of an earmarks ban, Lilly said: "I don't think it is a complete capitulation, but it is certainly allowing your opponent to tie one arm behind your back." Lilly, echoing many scholars, thinks Congress has lost big ground to the executive branch, in part due to partisanship that has seeped into the appropriations process. Threats of filibusters have become common in recent years, he noted. A recent example: Congress has not passed a budget or any appropriations bills for the 2011 fiscal year, which began in October. Lilly said earmarks are often parochial but sometimes have serious and broad policy purposes. He cited an example of a powerful members earmarking funds for more vehicle armor in war zones. If an administration disregards congressional directives or spends funds for purposes not requested in its budget or fails to address an important issue, earmarks can prove a corrective, said Lilly, who supports limits but not a ban on earmarks. A conservative in the Senate, Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) agrees with the Obey-Lilly camp. Inhofe argued on the Senate floor that earmarks is such a loose term that virtually all congressional appropriation authority could be compromised by a ban. "It would be nothing short of criminal to go through all the trouble of electing great, new anti-establishment conservatives, only to be politically correct and have them cede to Obama their constitutional power of the purse," Inhofe said. Inhofe, though, is in a minority in his party, which is under Tea Party pressure to reform on spending -- even if it means giving up power to a Democratic president. Obey himself cited several examples in his remarks for the Journal Sentinel: "Does (an earmark ban) mean that the administration’s request for military family housing or Army Corps of Engineers projects is to be considered the final word on the subject? Shouldn’t Congress be able to alter that list to avoid waste or focus scarce resources to the highest priorities? Does that mean that if there is a disaster, like the shooting at Fort Hood, Congress shouldn’t have the power to address it?" So that’s the practical insiders’ take: In the real world, an earmarks ban would limit congressional power but not necessarily snuff it out -- the power comes from the Constitution, so if someone chooses not to use it, it is not eliminated. A prominent scholar on separation of powers agrees to some extent on the limiting effect of a ban. University of Virginia law professor John C. Harrison preaches caution on using a "blunderbuss" approach to banning earmarks. A broad ban could indeed significantly restrict important congressional discretion, he said. Congress should restrict earmarks to eliminate pointless pork-barrel spending, but without limiting its powers to make specific appropriations where appropriate, Harrison said. Another outsider, from the right, views the constitutional argument as a red herring. Tad DeHaven, budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, was skeptical about the suggestion that an earmark ban would have a major effect on checks and balances at the Capitol. He said Congress had already abdicated authority by setting up many bureaucracies to oversee spending: "These guys are hiding behind the constitution as a matter of convenience." And that conveniently brings us to our assessment. In the end, the debate over congressional spending authority operates on two levels -- on paper, and in practice. Obey and others overreach by suggesting Congress would be bereft of spending oversight under an earmarks moratorium. The legislative branch would still have power but might have to find new ways to exercise it on occasion. But critics of a ban correctly point out that earmarks have been not only for local congressional projects but important tools used on larger policy questions. As they note, congressional authority has slipped -- and a blanket approach to banning earmarks could further tip the scales to the administration. Depending on where you sit, the glass is half full or half empty. We rate Obey’s claim Half True.	None	Dave Obey	None	None	None	2010-12-01T09:00:00	2010-11-18	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-04160	Says Charlie Crist and Missouri Rep. Todd Akin "hold same abortion views. No exception except the life of the mother."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/dec/20/lenny-curry/lenny-curry-says-charlie-crist-and-todd-akin-hold-/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist’s evolution from Republican to independent to Democrat has prompted speculation that he will take on Republican Gov. Rick Scott -- and led to sharp criticism from Florida Republicans. After CNN's Soledad O’Brien interviewed Crist on Dec. 12, 2012, RPOF chairman Lenny Curry took to Twitter to keep up the attacks on Crist. He tweeted: "Crist has a record of being rigid on guns, gays, marriage and abortion. He is making an indecent proposal to Dems." Curry also tried to link Crist with U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, a Republican from Missouri famous for his comment during his 2012 U.S. Senate bid that "legitimate rape" rarely results in pregnancy. Akin apologized for his comment and lost the election. Akin was a longtime supporter of bills that were backed by abortion opponents. He's now so famous that he is a point of reference for abortion rights. Curry tweeted about Crist: "BTW, he holds the same position as Akin on abortion." He later tweeted: "Answer: Todd Akin & @charliecristfl hold same abortion views. No exception except the life of the mother. Google it. Its all there." Democratic consultant Kevin Cate tweeted "I’ll let @politifact sort it out...." Okay, we will. We’ve fact-checked many claims about Crist and abortion -- and several about Akin and abortion. But here we wanted to check to see if Curry was correct to claim that Akin and Crist hold identical positions on abortion, that they are opposed except when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. It is somewhat difficult to compare the views held by Akin, a member of Congress, to Crist, a former governor, because they didn’t have to act on the same pieces of legislation. But we can compare their comments and their actions on some bills. Crist’s views on abortion Crist’s stance on abortion throughout his career is too complex to boil down to a sound bite -- even though Crist tried to do that himself at times. He has called himself "pro-choice" and "pro-life." Long before he ditched the Republican Party, he was accused of changing his stance on abortion depending on his political race. We will borrow in part from previous fact-checks to explain Crist’s views. In 1992 when he was running for the state Legislature, the Miami Herald wrote that Crist said he was "pro-choice" but opposed state-funded abortion. When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998 against Democrat Bob Graham, Crist wrote in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times: "I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government." Crist said during that campaign that he would not support a constitutional ban on abortion. In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist’s comments about abortion "puzzled activists on both sides of the abortion debate," the Miami Herald wrote after one TV forum. ''I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,'' Crist said during that forum. "I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law." During his 2006 campaign, he told a priest that if elected he’d sign an abortion ban similar to South Dakota’s which only included an exception for the life of the mother. But later Crist told an Associated Press reporter that he’d only sign such a ban if it also included exceptions for rape and incest. He repeated that summary of his views -- only accepting a ban that included exceptions for life of the mother, rape and incest -- at other times that year. Crist also said he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade. When asked during his 2006 campaign about his opposition as a state senator to a 24-hour waiting period, he said the bill didn’t include an exception for medical emergencies. "There may have been a life-threatening situation that necessitates the procedure," he said. "That happens." While RPOF mailers defended Crist as a clear opponent of abortion, the Democrats issued press releases headlined, 'Criss-Crossin' Charlie's House of Waffles.'' In 2010, after leaving the Republican Party, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure "punitive" and that the measure was "almost mean spirited." On the eve of the Republican National Convention in Tampa in August 2012, Crist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women’s issues. "Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims," Crist wrote. We gave Crist’s GOP-Akin comparison a Half True because the GOP platform clearly opposes most abortions but is vague on the detail and does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims. Also, there is no official Akin amendment -- he didn’t play a role in drafting the platform language. RPOF’s explanation RPOF spokesman Brian Burgess told PolitiFact Florida in an email that "Crist is pro-life but allows exceptions for rape, incest and health of the mother." However, Curry only cited one in that tweet: life of the mother. Burgess backed up the claim by citing a 2006 interview of Crist, who was attorney general at the time, when he said that he would sign an abortion ban similar to South Dakota’s, which only allowed abortion to save a woman’s life. But Crist also said that South Dakota law was too restrictive and would only sign such a ban if it allowed abortions for victims of rape and incest. As for Akin, Burgess pointed to a couple of bills that he either co-sponsored or voted for that sought to ban funding for abortions but allowed for exceptions including victims of rape and incest. On Nov. 7, 2009, the House voted 240-194 with Akin in the majority for House Amendment 509 to H.R. 3962, a Medicare and pension bill, to prohibit federal funds for abortion services in the public option and prohibits individuals who receive affordability credits from purchasing a plan that provides elective abortions. The amendment said that it would include exceptions for the life of the mother, rape or incest. RPOF also cited a bill that Akin co-sponsored in 2011 -- the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. Akin was one of 227 sponsors of the bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. The bill prohibits federal funds from being used for any health benefits that include coverage of abortion, according to the Congressional Research Service. (Currently, federal funds cannot be used for abortion services and plans receiving federal funds must keep federal funds segregated from any funds for abortion services, the research summary stated.) The final version of the bill said such funding was permissible if "(1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself." The bill passed the house 251-175 in May 2011 and hasn’t had a vote in the Senate. Akin was consistent abortion opponent So it’s true that Akin supported a couple of abortion bills that contained exceptions. But those votes don’t paint a full portrait of Akin’s stance on abortion. Akin, a former Missouri Right to Life board member, has more than a two-decade record on abortion starting with his arrests in the 1980s at anti-abortion protests and history in the Missouri General Assembly where he was first elected in 1988. Over the years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch would call Akin a "Republican anti-abortion leader" and "abortion foe" and "long a staunch opponent of abortion rights." In the state’s General Assembly, Akin fought against what abortion opponents call "partial birth abortions" and funding for Planned Parenthood. The National Right to Life Committee says Akin supported the group's position on 59 of its 60 key votes. NARAL Pro-Choice America gave Akin a score of zero in its 2011 scorecard. In July 2012, the Post-Dispatch wrote that Akin and his GOP Senate primary opponents were all "staunchly anti-abortion but with some nuances in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered." "There are some extreme medical conditions where the lives of both mother and child are at risk, in these situations he supports the doctors and patients making a decision that maximizes life," said Akin's campaign. A month later, he seemed to take a harder line against abortion and was less supportive of exceptions. Akin's controversial remarks came in a televised interview in August, when he said: "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist." Akin apologized several times, but largely to say that he was wrong about his medical claim or used the wrong words -- not to walk back his implication that there shouldn’t be a rape exception. The Post-Dispatch wrote that Akin didn’t back down on his no-exceptions opposition: "Rape is a terrible, horrible tragedy," Akin said, when asked in a St. Louis radio interview whether he believes "morning-after" medications should be outlawed even for rape victims. "At the same time, I don't know that you fix one tragedy with another tragedy." Crist’s comments about Curry claim Crist spoke to us briefly about Curry’s claim. "I don’t even know Mr. Akin’s position except that it sounded pretty wacky during the campaign and inappropriate. ... The things Todd Akin said about this issue are pretty outrageous and has nothing to do with anything I believe." Crist spoke in generalities about his abortion stance: "I am pro-life but I would not impose my will on others," he said, and then referenced the bill he vetoed in 2010 that would have required women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion. Crist also repeated a line he used in 2006 when asked by a reporter about his pro-life stance and what laws he would change: "I said I wouldn’t change any -- I’d rather change hearts than laws. This has been my position for quite some time." We later emailed Crist again to ask "did you ever -- or do you now -- support no exceptions except life of the mother?" Crist dashed off a quick response to Curry’s claim: "Completely wrong. He doesn't speak for me!" Our ruling Since Crist has taken both sides on abortion, it is possible to attack his view and be partially correct -- just pick a year, race and quote that matches the attack. In this case, Curry said, "Todd Akin & @charliecristfl hold same abortion views. No exception except the life of the mother." But even RPOF acknowledges that Crist's exceptions go beyond the life of the mother to include rape and incest. And RPOF ignores Crist’s words and actions that would conflict with Akin’s stances -- such as when Crist called himself "pro-choice." We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11091	"After Texas cut" its "two-year family planning budget by $73 million, one in four clinics closed their doors."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/jun/14/lupe-valdez/lupe-valdez-says-1-4-texas-clinics-closed-after-la/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez tied state spending cuts on Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s watch to a plummet in women’s health services. In an online survey that came our way from Valdez on May 7, 2018, respondents were asked to mark their level of worry in response to this query: "Over the past decade, the GOP in Texas and across the country have been destroying women’s healthcare in every way they can in order to appease their special interest donors. After Texas cut their two-year family planning budget by $73 million, one in four clinics closed their doors." Those figures sounded familiar. We checked on whether they hold up. We previously noted that actions set in motion by the Republican-led 2011 Legislature drove down family planning spending in the state budget by more than $70 million from an existing two-year expenditure of $111 million to $37.9 million budgeted for 2012-13. To our refreshed inquiry this year, Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, confirmed the spending reduction. Mann told us by email, though, that the commission "cannot confirm the number of clinics that may have closed." Another HHSC spokeswoman, Carrie Williams, noted that programs and patient eligibility requirements also changed in subsequent years. A 2015 study Meantime, Oliver Bernstein of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for services to low-income Texans, reminded us by email that the 1-in-4 figure initially appeared in a study published in April 2015. That study, undertaken by entities including the Population Research Center at the University of Texas, estimated that 25 percent of Texas family planning clinics closed in the wake of the 2011 cuts. Researchers said they reached that percentage based on surveys and in-depth interviews of leaders of organizations that had previously fielded state family planning grants. The researchers summed up: "82 clinics closed or discontinued family planning services because of decreased funding. Many providers reported reduced hours and the elimination of evening or weekend hours. Reduced funding also led organizations to implement or expand systems requiring women to pay fixed fees (vs. as sliding scale) for services," the researchers said. The year before the cuts took effect, the study says, 217,884 women received family planning services funded by state-awarded block grants through Texas clinics overseen by 72 organizations while another state program served 119,083 women with incomes of up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level. On a related front, the researchers said: "In 2011, 71% of organizations widely offered long-acting reversible contraception; in 2012– 2013, only 46% did so. Organizations served 54% fewer clients than they had in the previous period." The study says: "In-depth interview respondents reported that they did not know what had happened to their former clients but suspected that they simply were not seeking reproductive health care." The study’s lead author, Dr. Kari White of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, elaborated at the time: "The 2011 funding cuts really had a dramatic impact on services for many organizations–including those who were not the targets of the legislation. They were simply unable to serve many women in need in their communities, and it will probably take some time before they are able to rebuild those connections and level of service." Lawmakers also targeted abortion providers The study further notes that lawmakers in 2011 also voted to bar state family planning aid from going to health care providers affiliated with organizations that perform or promote abortions such as Planned Parenthood; its clinics had been the Texas program’s biggest provider of contraceptive care and cancer screening, serving more than 40,000 women a year. Any rebound? Unsaid in Valdez’s survey question: State-budgeted family planning aid later escalated, programs were reorganized and, the HHSC says, there’s been an uptick in clinics. In 2015, we found True a claim that the 2013 Legislature increased spending on women’s health to record levels. The White-led study acknowledges that increase yet says programs backed by the fresh funding had yet to be implemented. Such measures would prove successful, the researchers said, "only if funding goes to organizations with necessary experience and training for efficient delivery of family planning services and if all Texans in need of services are eligible." In May 2018, we asked the researchers if the number of family planning clinics had turned around. In a statement sent by email, White reaffirmed the study’s finding that 25 percent of clinics initially closed or stopped providing family planning services. White said that while the research team hadn’t tallied clinics that subsequently opened, an April 2018 CPPP issue brief took note of the Texas HHSC allocating more aid to family planning for the fiscal year that ran through August 2017 "and," that brief says, the commission "re-opened contracts for the program for the first time in years, increasing clinic participation." That brief says more than 300,000 Texas women fielded government-supported family planning services in 2010-11, before the actions by the 2011 Legislature took effect, while about 215,000 women drew on such services in the fiscal year running through August 2016. According to the brief, the number of "Family Planning-contracted clinics" in Texas rose from 89 in 2016 to 258 clinics in 2017. "In comparison," the center wrote, "before the huge funding cuts that took effect in" fiscal "2012, about 290 clinics were contracted in the program in both 2010 and 2011." Put another way, it looked like Texas clinics with government-funded family planning services were lately down by 32, or 11 percent, from the clinics offering such services before the legislative moves of 2011. We asked the center if its 2018 analysis demonstrates a substantial rebound in clinics. By email, Bernstein pointed again to the 2015 study reporting the 25 percent decrease. He otherwise said HHSC figures show state-contracted family planning clinics escalating from as few as 89 in 2016 to 258 in 2017 and 246 in 2018. We also tried to gauge any rebound in Texas women getting state-supported family planning help. On April 26, 2018, a little more than a week before Valdez made her claim, the HHSC posted a report stating that in the fiscal year that ran through August 2017, 219,396 low-income Texans received family planning services through state-supported programs. (Earlier, the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights, estimated in a 2016 report that as of 2014, nearly 1.8 million Texas women needed publicly funded contraceptive services and supplies.) A day later, the CPPP said in a blog post about the report that in "good news," the number of Texas women fielding family planning services with state aid escalated 29 percent from 2016 to 2017. But, the center said, the number of women served still trailed--"by tens of thousands"--women served by government-backed family planning programs before the 2011 actions. We also queried the Texas Women’s Health Care Coalition, a nonpartisan group that says it’s dedicated to improving the health and well-being of women, babies and families by assuring access to preventive care for women. The group’s chair, Evelyn Delgado, said by phone there’ve been significant increases in women served by state-backed family planning programs though she and Erika Ramirez, the coalition’s director of policy and advocacy, said Texas has yet to serve the number of women who fielded such services before the 2011 actions. Williams, the HHSC spokeswoman, separately counseled by email against comparing 2016 or subsequent state counts of women drawing on state-supported family planning to past tallies because, she said, the older figures include double-counting due to patients drawing on multiple programs. Our ruling Valdez said that after Texas cut family planning spending $73 million, one in four clinics closed their doors. A 2015 study found that after Republicans made that cut--also barring such aid from entities associated with abortion providers--one in four family-planning clinics closed. But this statement also lacks information in that there was subsequently a burst of state family planning aid, a reorganization of programs and a rebound in clinics though, it appears, not a full catch-up in women getting services.

pomt-04821	"13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor won't tell them."	false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/17/aclu-florida/aclu-says-rick-scott-wont-tell-13000-ex-felons-the/	Florida has faced heat for how it handles restoring the rights of felons -- an issue with partisan and racial undertones. A disproportionate number of felons are black and blacks lean Democratic. Who has a right to vote is a pressing concern a few months before the Nov. 6 presidential election. The ACLU of Florida sent an email to supporters Aug. 3 sounding alarm bells and suggesting that thousands of ex-felons have been disenfranchised due to "suppression tactics" by the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott. The headline of the email stated: "13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor won’t tell them." Here is part of the body of the email: "... Because of a public records request we sent last week, we discovered thousands of rights restoration notifications sitting in storage in Tallahassee having never reached their intended recipients. As a result, there are over 13,000 Floridians who have regained the right to vote, but haven't registered to vote because they may not know that they can." The email later continued, saying that Scott "won't even help the Parole Commission inform citizens that their voting rights have been restored. There were no public announcements from the governor's office to let people know these letters existed, and no effort to allocate enough resources to help the underfunded Parole Commission. These critical documents are simply gathering dust." There are a lot of claims in that email but the one we wanted to check was the headline: Are there 13,000 Floridians able to vote but Scott won’t tell them? Restoration of rights changes under Crist In 2007, then-Gov. Charlie Crist said that the civil rights restoration process was too cumbersome, and he led the effort to allow non-violent criminals to get their rights restored without hearings if they completed their sentences and paid restitution if required. The change meant that 80 percent of ex-felons were eligible to get their rights restored without applying. (Felons lose their voting privileges in Florida.) Starting in April 2007, the Florida Parole Commission sent about 89,300 ex-felons certificates telling them their voting rights had been restored. "The last printed certificates were sent in September 2008," said Jane Tillman, spokeswoman for the Florida Parole Commission. "We sent 6,000 of them. We had a pizza party late in the night stuffing and licking envelopes." But the parole commission didn’t always know where to send the correspondence telling ex-felons they could now vote. The commission relied on the last address the former inmates provided to the Department of Corrections, but some people had gotten out of prison years -- even decades -- ago. About 35,000 of the certificates were returned undeliverable starting in 2007 through March 2011. If a letter was returned with a forwarding address it was resent, Tillman said. Starting around 2011, the commission checked state drivers' license records in an effort to find updated addresses. The state was able to track down about half of the remaining list, leaving 17,604 undeliverable by the spring of 2011. Those undeliverable certificates have been sitting in boxes at the parole commission’s office in Tallahassee. (Tillman said nearly all of them are restoration of civil rights but about 5 percent are for something different, such as pardons.) The ACLU picked up on the 17,604 yet-to-be-delivered certificates as part of a public records request. After comparing that list of names to a statewide voter database, the group found 13,517 people who were eligible to vote still hadn’t registered. That is the genesis of their claim. The letter is not needed to register to vote The certificate itself doesn’t mean an ex-felon is automatically registered to vote, and an ex-felon doesn’t need to have a letter in order to register to vote. Ex-felons whose voting rights have been restored simply have to go through the typical process of registering to vote in their home county. In Broward County, elections registration officials don’t ask for a copy of the certificate but will accept it if the person brings it, said spokeswoman Mary Cooney said. If an ex-felon tells elections officials that he isn’t certain if his rights have been restored, county officials will check the Parole Commission Office of Executive Clemency’s website. The Miami-Dade Supervisor of Elections office provided a similar account of the steps they take to register such voters. Spokeswoman Christina White said if the clemency office website doesn’t show the applicant’s rights have been restored, her office gives the applicant the website, email and phone number for the clemency office. We read the ACLU’s claim to Reggie Garcia, a longtime clemency attorney based in Tallahassee. Garcia argues cases before the governor, so he has a reason not to criticize Scott. But he said Crist’s initiative was well publicized and that if someone wants to become a voter, the ex-felon could make an effort to get in touch with the parole commission. "I don’t think it's Gov. Scott’s fault that the (commission) has now tried at least two, maybe three times, that … (they) can’t reach 20 percent of the people because of passage of time, mobility, change of addresses," he said. Garcia also said it's not unusual for someone leaving prison to change their address multiple times within their first year of leaving prison. It’s also possible, of course, for people on the list to be dead, to have moved out of state or simply not want to registered to vote. An important note: The voting rules for ex-felons changed in 2011. In February 2011, newly elected Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi said it was too easy for felons to get their rights restored. One month later Bondi, Scott and the rest of the all Republican Cabinet adopted new rules making it harder for ex-felons to vote, including getting rid of any automatic restoration of rights and adding a minimum of a five-year waiting period to apply -- a process that can take years. Since then, only 175 felons have had their rights restored. A second important note: The people who received a certificate -- or those who have one sitting in Tallahassee -- are eligible to vote under the old rules unless they lost that right because they re-offended. Our ruling The ACLU said in the headline of an email, "13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor won't tell them." But the state has tried to reach those potential voters using the address information at their disposal. In 2007 and 2008, the parole commission sent the ex-felons a certificate based on the last address they provided to the state Department of Corrections. When about 35,000 letters were returned undeliverable, the commission re-sent letters and cut that number in half. Also, the ACLU is blaming Scott for an issue that seems largely beyond his control. Some of the 13,000 could have moved out of state or died. And it’s possible some of the 13,000 don’t want to register to vote. Lastly, the certificate isn’t necessary to register to vote. Ex-felons can check to see if their rights were restored on the commission’s website, calling the commission or asking for help from their local supervisor of elections. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01496	"Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4"	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/25/ryan-lizza/lizza-says-obama-has-bombed-more-nations-bush/	The irony of President Barack Obama, Nobel Prize winner and putative anti-war candidate, launching extensive airstrikes in Syria, quickly led to comparisons with his predecessor, President George W. Bush. Ryan Lizza, Washington correspondent for the New Yorker summed it up in one tweet. "Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4." We asked Lizza for his list and he sent us this: Bush: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Somalia. Obama: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. As we fact-checked Lizza’s statement, we found little reason to challenge the nations he named. If anything, he shortchanged both presidents. There is no dispute whatsoever about airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Bush launched wars in the first two countries and drone strikes in Pakistan have been in the news for a long time, with or without official acknowledgment. Airstrikes in those places continued under Obama. Somalia falls largely in the same category as Pakistan. The New York Times, BBC News and other news organizations reported airstrikes as early as 2007 against people linked to the al-Qaida network. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service based at City University London, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in a number of countries, including Somalia and Yemen. The bureau annotates each incident with links to press reports. By its tally, American drone strikes against suspected terrorists in Somalia occurred under both Bush and Obama. The same pattern holds in Yemen. BBC News and Time magazine reported a CIA-directed drone attack in Yemen in 2002. This would increase Bush’s total to five countries, rather than the four Lizza cited. Lizza said he left Yemen off of Bush’s list because it was a "one-off strike, rather than a more sustained bombing campaign. Probably deserves an asterisk." The air attacks on Libya that helped topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 under Obama are well documented. In March 2011, the United States and British warships fired over 100 cruise missiles to destroy Libyan air defenses. And, of course, there’s now Syria. We might stop there but it is possible that the Philippines should be added to the rosters for both presidents. The New York Times cites "three current and former intelligence officials" as saying that drones fired Hellfire missiles at a suspected militant camp in the Philippines in 2006. And Akbar Ahmed, a professor at the American University School of International Service, wrote on the Brookings Institution website that a similar attack took place in 2012. If these reports are accurate, the totals for Bush and Obama would rise by one. The final, maximum number would be Bush 6: Obama 8. PunditFact cannot confirm the authenticity of these reports. This framework says little about the nature of each president’s air campaigns. According to Air Force data, the number of munitions dropped in Afghanistan and Iraq declined about 35 percent between 2007 under Bush and 2009 under Obama (adjusted for missing data in 2009). However in Afghanistan, the number of sorties with at least one weapon release and the number of munitions used rose in 2010 and 2011 before falling in 2012, according to Air Force data. The number of weapon releases fell greatly in 2013. The country tally also tells us nothing about the general military strategy under each president. Bush initiated the war in Iraq, while Obama was elected on the promise to end it. Our ruling Lizza said that Obama has bombed seven countries to Bush’s four. Depending on your view of Bush’s reported drone strike into Yemen, he may have slightly undercounted Bush’s tally. Both presidents also may have bombed the Philippines. But it's hard to fault Lizza for the numbers we use. We rate his claim True.	None	Ryan Lizza	None	None	None	2014-09-25T10:47:44	2014-09-22	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-02045	Says Barack Obama broke a decades-old policy of "not negotiating with terrorists."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/01/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-us-policy-has-changed-now-we-make-deals-t/	On Saturday, May 31, 2014, President Barack Obama announced from the Rose Garden that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl — America’s only prisoner of war — was freed by his Taliban captors after five years in custody. But Bergdahl’s release came at a cost: In return, the United States agreed to turn over five Taliban officials being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison to the country of Qatar. By Sunday, debate over the decision spilled into the political talk shows. White House national security adviser Susan Rice, speaking on ABC’s This Week, said Obama was justified because the U.S. was at war with Bergdahl’s captors even if it wasn’t in the traditional sense. But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took exception to that characterization. "Ambassador Rice basically said to you, ‘Yes, U.S. policy has changed. Now we make deals with terrorists,’ " Cruz said. Later, Cruz added: "The reason why the U.S. has had the policy for decades of not negotiating with terrorists is because once you start doing it, every other terrorist has an incentive to capture more soldiers." The merits of the swap will continue to undergo scrutiny, but we wanted to look at Cruz’s assertion that Obama deviated from long-standing policy. Presidents throughout history have reiterated that the "United States does not negotiate with terrorists" (we found several instances of Obama's State Department saying as much), but do they always hold true to that mantra? Back to the Founding Fathers First, whether the war in Afghanistan is a war in the traditional sense or something much different has clouded legal and military debate since it began. Similarly, whether the Taliban, who have controlled parts of Afghanistan, is a traditional enemy or a terrorist group akin to al-Qaida, remains a contentious debate. (Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel claimed on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday that the United States wasn’t negotiating with terrorists when it secured Bergdahl’s release.) The United States has a long history of negotiating prisoner trades in times of war. But does it have a history of negotiating with terrorists, as some might classify the Taliban? According to experts we spoke with, it does. (For his part, Cruz didn’t respond to a request for comment by our deadline. We'll add their response to this item if we hear from them.) "There’s little that’s actually new here," said Mitchell Reiss, who worked in the State Department under President George W. Bush and served as national security adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. "It may be new to certain individuals. Whether it’s new or not is not as important as whether it’s sound policy and promotes national security. That’s the ground where there’s a more legitimate debate." In his book, Negotiating with Evil, Reiss wrote that America actually has a detailed history of negotiating with terrorists and rogue regimes that support terrorist activity. How long? Even the Founding Fathers struck agreements with terrorists of the time: pirates. George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson "accommodated what today would be viewed as terrorists," Reiss wrote. "They each authorized payment to the Barbary pirates, and the U.S. Senate even ratified a treaty that enshrined the annual provision of naval supplies as ‘protection.’ " A century later, President Teddy Roosevelt granted demands from the descendants of those pirates to secure the release of captured American resident Ion Perdicaris. Recent history To his credit, Cruz said the policy of not engaging terrorists was decades old, not centuries. But there are more recent examples where, as Reiss wrote, "American presidents have negotiated with terrorists and rogue regimes to secure the release of hostages, to arrange temporary cease fires and to explore whether a more permanent truce might be possible." Here’s a few, according to Reiss’ book: After the North Koreans captured the U.S.S. Pueblo in 1968, President Lyndon Johnson apologized for spying as part of negotiations to secure the release of 83 American prisoners. In 1970, President Richard Nixon pressured Israel, Switzerland, West Germany and Britain to release Palestinian prisoners after two airlines were hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. During the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 to 1981, President Jimmy Carter agreed to unfreeze $8 billion in frozen Iranian assets after more than a year of negotiations with the Iranian revolutionaries. In perhaps the most famous swap, after seven Americans were captured in Beirut, Lebanon, President Ronald Reagan agreed to send missiles to Iran in what became known as the Iran-Contra scandal. President Bill Clinton’s administration sat down with Hamas in attempts to negotiate peace with Israel. His administration also worked directly with the Taliban nearly two decades ago on several occasions to see if the group would hand over Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders. Reiss also noted that President George W. Bush engaged in negotiations with Iran and North Korea even after decreeing them part of the "Axis of Evil." James Jeffrey, a former ambassador to Iraq under Obama and deputy national security adviser for George W. Bush, agreed that "there have been many cases of negotiations with terrorists or rogue regimes for the return of Americans." But he added: "releasing terrorists in exchange for captives, however, is rare." One recent example came in 2010, when the United States released Shia cleric Qais al-Khazali to the militia group Asaib al-Haq in exchange for Peter Moore, a private British contractor, and the bodies of Moore’s security officers. Asaib al-Haq is a militia group allegedly funded by Iran and headed by al-Khazali and staged and executed several attacks in Iraq that resulted in the deaths of U.S. soldiers. Our ruling Cruz said Obama changed "decades" of policy of not negotiating with terrorists when he brokered the deal that brought Bergdahl home. Even though presidents and officials often say "we do not negotiate with terrorists," it has not proven to be a hard-and-fast rule. Obama’s actions so far do not signal a change in policy, but rather the latest in a long line of exceptions presidents have made throughout recent history. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-09359	The Florida House is "holding the FINAL public hearing" of a controversial education bill in the middle of spring break..."when they hope (teachers) are not watching or listening."	false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/02/florida-education-association/teacher-tenure-hearing-spring-break/	A controversial education bill that would link teacher pay increases to student performance is scheduled to get its final public hearing April 5, 2010, and the teachers union fighting the measure is lining up troops to voice opposition. The Florida Education Association is calling on educators to appear before the House Education Policy Council during a public hearing scheduled to start at noon. Their rally cry comes with a not-so-subtle dig at Tallahassee lawmakers. "The Florida Senate held hearings on this terrible piece of legislation during FCAT testing. So it should be no surprise that the Florida House of Representatives is holding the FINAL public hearing on this bill smack dab in the middle of spring break...when they hope you are not watching or listening," the FEA says in a message on its Web site. "The FINAL hearing has been scheduled for Monday, April 5th from 12:00 noon until 8:15 p.m. and they are hoping you don't show!" In this item, we wanted to see if the Florida Legislature is scheduling this critical hearing so as to avoid a confrontation with teachers. The education initiative -- SB 6 in the Senate and HB 7189 in the House -- would link teacher pay increases to student performance, eliminate long-term job security for new teachers and require end-of-course exams for subjects not covered by the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test starting in the 2013-2014 school year. The legislation would cause a major shift from current teacher pay scales, which base salaries on degrees and years of experience. The Florida Education Association says the bill, which passed the Senate 21-17 on March 24, 2010, and awaits action in the House -- could push experienced teachers out of the classroom. To judge the FEA's claim, we wanted to see how many school districts will be on spring break on April 5, 2010. So we built this spreadsheet after visiting the Web sites for each of Florida's 67 public school districts. By our calculation, 33 of Florida's public school districts will be closed April 5, 2010. Some of the schools will be on formal spring break. Others are having a teacher work day, while students are off. What does any of that mean? On the surface, it seems to mean a lot of teachers won't be working and could possibly attend the bill hearing, if they chose. From the teachers' perspective, that would be a good thing, right? But then we looked back at the FEA's statement. The FEA previously was upset that the Senate held its hearings during FCAT testing, when teachers were working. That had us confused. The FEA was upset hearings were held when teachers had to be working. And now the group's upset because the House is holding hearings when teachers are off. Is there some other category between working and not working? But that's only part of the problem with the FEA's statement. The Florida Constitution limits the Legislature to one, 60-day legislative session each year. The Constitution also says the session must begin in March (the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March). The constraints in many ways bind the hands of legislators. The bill the House Education Policy Council will consider, HB 7189, wasn't filed until March 25, 2010 -- after its companion piece was approved by the Senate. The measure had a hearing at the House PreK-12 Policy Committee on March 25, 2010 (passing 9-6) and was forwarded to the House Education Policy Council. April 5 is the council's first meeting since March 17, 2010. If the bill advances through the House Education Policy Council, it must be passed by the full House. If the bill differs from the version approved in the Senate, the Senate would have to weigh in a second time. The session is scheduled to end April 30. That's a lot to happen in what amounts to 20 work days. House Republican spokeswoman Jill Chamberlin said House leaders decided to wait to consider the education reforms until the bill had passed the Senate. When it did, on March 24, the House was debating the state budget. Going forward, Chamberlin said, the weeks of April 12 and 19 have been set aside for more budget negotiations. Chamberlin said House leaders blocked eight hours for the education hearing, including evening hours to make sure people had an opportunity to speak. She also noted that many teachers visited Tallahassee in the last week of March -- when they were on spring break -- to oppose the measure. State Rep. Bill Heller, D-St. Petersburg, told PolitiFact Florida the compressed schedule is a perfect example of why the Legislature should have called a special session to handle proposed education reforms. "We can call a special session for a railroad project, when it only serves a portion of the state," said Heller, who opposes the bill and is the ranking Democratic member of the House Education Policy Council. "But when there's something that touches every city and every county, we're going to do just in a few hours." Heller agreed with concerns that people might not be able to attend the April 5 hearing, but he also expected a full committee room, and almost eight hours of public testimony. Heller said he has received about four e-mails in support of the legislation and about 1,600 against. Another 8,000 Floridians have signed a petition sent to Gov. Charlie Crist opposing the education proposals. House Speaker Larry Cretul's office had to add additional telephone lines to handle the flood of calls, more than 5,200, most of whom were from people opposing the bill, said Chamberlin, the Ocala Star-Banner reported.. That means the message is getting out. The state's big teachers union, the Florida Education Association, said the Florida House is holding the final hearing of a controversial education bill in the middle of spring break, when "they hope (teachers) are not watching or listening." We find the scheduling of the hearing is much more of a practical matter than an attempt to stomp out the voice of teachers. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04974	"USA is #1 in gun violence."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/23/facebook-posts/the-us-is-no-in-gun-violence-is-it/	In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence. A reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, "USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day." In this item, we’ll look at the first part of that claim -- that the "USA is #1 in gun violence." International comparisons are always tricky, because there are differences from country to country in the definitions being used as well as the reliability and timeliness of the data. The most comprehensive international comparisons we found were published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Because of limited comparable data, we are defining gun violence as gun homicides. Let’s look at a few statistics: Annual homicides from firearms According to the U.N. figures, the U.S. had 9,146 homicides by firearm in 2009. That year, Colombia and Venezuela both exceeded the U.S. total, with 12,808 and 11,115 firearm deaths, respectively. Three other nations topped the U.S. amount in the most recent year for which data is available: Brazil (34,678 in 2008), Mexico (11,309 in 2010) and Thailand (20,032 in 2000). So the U.S. ranks high in this category, but not first. Even using the higher U.S. homicide figure of 11,493 in 2010 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cited here), the U.S. still doesn’t rank first internationally. Annual homicide rate for firearms Because the U.S. is so big, it's better to compare the frequency of firearm homicides per capita, usually expressed as firearm homicides per 100,000 in national population. According to the U.N., the U.S. had 3.0 firearm homicides per 100,000 in population in 2009. But there were 14 other nations that had higher rates in 2009, primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean: Honduras (57.6), Jamaica (47.2), St. Kitts and Nevis (44.4), Venezuela (39.0), Guatemala (38.5), Colombia (28.1), Trinidad & Tobago (27.3), Panama (19.3), Dominican Republic (16.9), Bahamas (15.4), Belize (15.4), Mexico (7.9), Paraguay (7.3) and Nicaragua (5.9). Three other nations had higher rates in 2008: El Salvador (39.9), Brazil (18.1) and Ecuador (12.7). So the U.S. doesn’t rank no. 1 when firearm homicides are adjusted for population. Where the U.S. does rank high in firearm violence The main area where the U.S. exceeds the firearm violence of other nations is in comparison to other affluent nations. Using the U.N. data, European nations -- even former eastern bloc countries -- typically have rates well below 1 per 100,000, or far less than one-third the frequency seen in the U.S. The pattern is similar in other advanced industrialized nations, such as Canada, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. One study published in 2011 confirms this finding. The study, published in the Journal of Trauma -- Injury Infection & Critical Care, found that firearm homicide rates were 19.5 times higher in the U.S. than in 23 other "high income" countries studied, using 2003 data. Rates for other types of gun deaths were also higher in the U.S., but by somewhat smaller margins: 5.8 times higher for firearm suicides (even though overall suicide rates were 30 percent lower in the U.S.) and 5.2 times higher for unintentional firearm deaths. Our ruling The Facebook post says the "USA is #1 in gun violence." That's only true if you compare the U.S. with other affluent nations on a per capita basis. But widening the comparison to all nations, not just the richest ones, there are at least 17 other countries with higher per capita rates of gun homicides, most of them with rates astronomically higher than the U.S. rate. And measured by raw gun homicides, the U.S. doesn’t rank first -- at least two and possibly as many as five countries have had more gun homicides in recent years than the U.S. did. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2012-07-23T16:41:22	2012-07-21	['United_States']

pomt-01453	President Barack Obama "ordered our military to enlist illegal aliens."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/02/allen-west/obama-ordered-military-enlist-illegal-aliens-allen/	In case you missed this claim making the social media rounds, former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., is saying that President Barack Obama has extended open arms to illegal immigrants to join our military. "Morning folks. While you were sleeping, Barack Hussein Obama took out his pen and ordered our Military to enlist illegal aliens," West posted on his Facebook page on Sept. 26. "In other words, this charlatan has allowed those who have disrespected our Constitution and are not citizens to take an oath to support and defend the very document, our rule of law, of which they are in violation....." West declares Obama’s action an "illegal order" and says the military shouldn’t follow it. The post caught several PolitiFact readers’ eyes. We will take a closer look at the claim, focusing on the part of West’s post that claims Obama "ordered our Military to enlist illegal aliens." West, who represented part of Broward and Palm Beach for a term before he lost running to represent a different district in 2012, is a retired Army lieutenant colonel and a Fox News contributor. Aides to West sent us several news articles, including one in the Military Times, a trade publication that covers the armed services. The article is about an expansion announced Sept. 25, 2014, by the Defense Department to the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest program. Before we get any further, we should explain that this program wasn’t created by -- or even under -- Obama. In December 2008, under President George W. Bush, the Defense Department announced a pilot program to temporarily allow certain legal aliens who were doctors or nurses -- or could speak certain in-demand languages such as Haitian-Creole, Chinese or Farsi -- to join the military. (Spanish is not on the language list.) The program started with 1,000 recruits, and in May 2012 the cap was raised to 1,500 a year through Sept. 30, 2014. The program has been open to asylees, refugees, and certain categories of people who hold non-immigrant visas, such as students or workers. All told, the MAVNI program has enrolled about 2,900 individuals since its inception, Defense spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Christensen told PolitiFact. Just days before the program was set to expire, Jessica Wright, the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, signed a memo that extended the program through the end of fiscal year 2016 and allowed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients to apply. DACA -- announced by Obama in 2012 -- allows certain illegal immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation. As of the end of June 2014, about 580,000 individuals received initial deferred action under DACA. There are an estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Where West has a point is that some DACA recipients could eventually join the military program. But contrary to West’s sweeping suggestion, they would be a fraction of a very small program, experts say. The Defense Department doesn’t have any estimate regarding how many DACA recruits will join, but the cap of 1,500 recruits per year still applies. In the past, thousands more individuals have applied for the program than there are eligible spots. Margaret Stock, who helped create the MAVNI program when she worked for the Army and who now works as an immigration attorney, told PolitiFact that it will be difficult for immigrants with DACA status to pass the background investigation needed for top secret clearance. She predicted only a few dozen with DACA status will join MAVNI next year. "The Pentagon should have set up a separate recruiting program for the DACAs," she said. "They would make excellent military recruits, but hardly any of them can qualify for the MAVNI program, and the MAVNI program already has more than enough qualified recruits. Putting DACAs into the MAVNI program doesn’t make any sense," she said. We asked Christensen, the Pentagon spokesman, about the ability of those with DACA status to pass the background test and he told PolitiFact that the military currently does not enlist individuals with undocumented family members. However, the Defense Department "is working with the Department of Homeland Security to evaluate options to enlist individuals with undocumented family members and resolve the family members' status prior to the enlistee entering active duty.The Department continues to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in reviewing all MAVNI candidates." Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, expects only a small impact from this change. "Given the narrowness of the MAVNI program, the slight change made by the president, and the extremely limited number of people involved, I would rate the change as entirely insignificant," Janda said. Allowing DACA participants into MAVNI, he said, is "probably an attempt to court some favor with pro-immigration groups prior to the midterms, but it won’t be enough to make them happy. ... The odds of anyone getting in are very slim." Marc Rosenblum, deputy director at the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact that there are two likely reasons the program was expanded: It aims to attract people who have specialized skills but have a hard time getting into the military, and it falls broadly under the set of actions Obama can take related to immigration. However, it’s a very small piece of immigration reform, he said. Stock, who helped create MAVNI, also took issue with West’s assertion that Obama’s action was an "illegal order." "The Pentagon is acting pursuant to a statute, 10 USC 504(b)(2), which gives authority to the Service Secretaries to determine when someone’s enlistment is vital to the national interest," she told PolitiFact. We should also note that the changes open up the possibility of illegal aliens joining the military, but it is short of an order by the president that they be brought into this particular program, and it does not give them any special priority over other groups. It’s also worth noting some historical context. While the Department of Defense started this particular pilot program in 2008, non-citizens have served in the military since the Revolutionary War. About 5,000 non-citizens enlist for active duty each year. A 2011 consultant’s report for the U.S. Navy stated that about 4 percent of the military services are non-citizens. The report concluded that non-citizens are a valuable recruiting resource because of their large numbers, their useful language skills and the smaller likelihood they will leave the armed services quickly. In 2002, Bush signed an executive order to expedite naturalization of military members. Since then, the United States has naturalized about 93,100 members of the military. (Steve Blando, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that handles naturalization, told PolitiFact that all of the military members who were naturalized were lawful permanent residents -- that is, "green card" holders -- prior to becoming citizens.) Our ruling West said that Obama "ordered our military to enlist illegal aliens." He’s right that Obama’s decision to allow certain illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status under DACA then enabled the military to announce that those people could apply for the MAVNI program. However, West’s analysis exaggerates what’s going on. The program in question was initiated by Bush in 2008, before Obama was president. In addition, contrary to West’s sweeping suggestion, experts say it’s doubtful that many undocumented immigrants would be brought into the military. And Obama didn't order the military to take illegal aliens but rather made it an option. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11010	Says "Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/10/josh-hawley/did-claire-mccaskill-vote-100-obamas-judicial-nomi/	The prospect of President Donald Trump’s second Supreme Court pick became an issue in the Senate midterm elections even before Trump tapped Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacant seat on the court. Josh Hawley, the Missouri attorney general who is challenging Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, put up a website — supremeclaire.com — to draw a contrast between his stance on judges and the incumbent’s. One of the statements on the website was that "Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com From a Josh Hawley campaign website When we contacted McCaskill’s campaign, they did not dispute that she voted for all of Obama’s nominees. (They added that she has voted for 68 percent of Trump's judicial nominees.) So the substance of Hawley’s assertion is accurate. It’s worth noting, though, that the Republican ranks of senators that Hawley hopes to join also supported Obama’s judicial picks overwhelmingly. We looked at a database of Obama and Trump judicial picks maintained by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. For Obama’s tenure, the database includes 323 Obama nominees for district and circuit court seats who were ultimately considered by the Senate, along with the results of their confirmation votes. Here’s our breakdown of the results. The "no nay votes" category includes voice votes, approval by unanimous consent, recorded votes with zero nay votes: Degree of Senate opposition to nominee Obama nominees with this result No nay votes 220 Nay votes in single digits 45 Between 10 and 19 nay votes 10 More than 20 nay votes 48 In other words, 82 percent of Obama’s nominees received minimal opposition from Republicans. Eighty-two percent support is lower than the 100 percent support rate for McCaskill, but it does make Hawley’s seemingly black-and-white contrast between hard-line Republican opposition to Obama’s picks and blanket Democratic support a bit blurrier. This may surprise people who tune in to judicial nominations only for Supreme Court seats, battles that have become increasingly acrimonious. But for Obama’s lower-court nominations — and particularly for district-court seats, which are the initial trial-level federal courts — most nominees were easily confirmed. Why? Experts point to a few reasons. The first is that most judicial nominations that fail do so before a vote is cast. If opposition coalesces on the Senate Judiciary Committee, a nomination may be pulled before consideration (or a potential nomination may never be made), said Anthony Madonna, a University of Georgia political scientist. A second reason is that senators have historically been given an informal say on judicial nominations in their home states, enabling the most controversial candidates to be weeded before a nomination is even made, Madonna said. The GOP's ability to use these rules under Obama means that the nominations that made it to the floor "would have been likely to attract GOP votes," said Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist. McCaskill, for her part, was deferential to President George W. Bush’s judicial picks, Madonna said. He could locate only one McCaskill nay vote against a Bush judicial nominee — Leslie Southwick, who was up for an appeals-court seat — in McCaskill’s two years in the Senate when Bush was president. The growing acrimony over judicial nominations has dropped the percentage of slam-dunk nominations under Trump. The approval number, however, remains substantial. According to Wheeler’s data set, district-court nominations are still overwhelmingly approved without controversy: So far, 74 percent of Trump nominees have been confirmed by either zero nay votes or nay votes in the single digits. But for circuit court seats (that is, seats on appeals courts) only 17 percent of Trump’s picks have been approved with either zero nay votes or nay votes in the single digits. The remaining 15 Trump nominees have averaged 39 nay votes, meaning that most are getting some crossover support from Democratic senators, but not much. The increasing opposition under Trump, Wheeler said, stems from Senate Democrats’ anger over the GOP majority’s handling of Obama nominees toward the end of his tenure. In addition to blocking Obama’s third Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, for more than a year, Senate Republicans confirmed barely any circuit court judges during 2015 and 2016, which is "way below standard patterns for the final two years of eight-year presidencies," Wheeler said. Republicans counter that the confirmation system was broken well before 2015, including by the Senate Democrats’ decision to use the "nuclear option" to enable simple-majority approval for district- and circuit-court nominations in 2013. Our ruling Hawley said, "Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees." Senate Republicans also approved Obama’s nominees with minimal objections 82 percent of the time, and McCaskill voted for most of Bush’s nominees. Hawley's statement is accurate but requires a touch of clarification. That's our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-01948	"Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill that gives Florida's public officials an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/23/bill-nelson/rick-scott-signed-law-give-politicians-easy-way-av/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson passed up the chance to run for governor against Rick Scott this year, but that doesn’t mean he’s done attacking the Republican incumbent. Nelson went on the offensive against the governor, with a page on his website entitled "The public has a right to know," asking for people to sign up to protest Scott’s alleged lack of transparency. The message also went out via email. "Last year, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill giving Florida’s public officials and candidates an easy way to avoid financial disclosure of their assets," Nelson said in an email sent June 13, 2014. "Since then, Gov. Scott has been the only elected official to take advantage of this." Did Scott really sign a bill making it easier to hide assets from his financial disclosure statements? We’ll take a look at Florida law so you won’t be coming into this debate blind. Trusting disclosures While we didn’t hear back from Nelson’s office about clarifying this attack, it’s pretty obvious he’s referring to Senate Bill 2, a 2013 law unanimously passed by the Legislature that allowed state elected officials to establish a blind trust for their financial holdings and investments in order to prevent a conflict of interest. In essence, a blind trust is when someone turns over their portfolio to a third-party trustee, who then buys and sells stocks, bonds and other assets without the owner’s knowledge. Nelson is right that Scott signed SB 2 into law in May 2013. And yes, Scott is the only elected official in the state to use this law to put assets into a blind trust. The question is whether the law makes it easier to hide assets from the public. By definition, a blind trust makes it easier for a candidate to not disclose the investments that person owns. A blind trust allows Scott to declare a lump sum net worth without having to disclose the value of his vast portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, some of which are regulated by the state and whose value could be directly affected by Scott's policies. But under SB 2, politicians must first disclose the assets they put into the blind trust. Scott did this in 2011, before the law was in place. It’s only after those assets are in the trust that they are not available to the public -- or the official who put them there. Other officials have used a blind trust in the past. Alex Sink did it in December 2006 after she became the state’s chief financial officer, an issue that became a somewhat contentious element of her failed gubernatorial run against Scott in 2010, because she voted for a new bond sale process that included her former employer, Bank of America. Sink created a blind trust on her own, without an ethics law addressing it. Scott did the same thing after being elected as governor, disclosing all his investments in 2010, then forming his own blind trust in 2011 to avoid a conflict of interest, he said. For years, the state ethics commission advised the Legislature to pass a law allowing blind trusts to deal with official conflicts of interest. In 2013, both the House and Senate unanimously passed SB 2. The bill regulated blind trusts and set the powers and duties of appointed trustees, including prohibiting them from telling their clients, such as Scott, what assets are bought or sold. These rules had not been in place prior to the bill’s passage, leaving blind trusts unregulated by the state. Jan Jacobowitz, director of the Professional Responsibility & Ethics Program at the University of Miami, says the problem in Scott’s case is more who is managing the portfolio. In this case, the custodian of Scott’s $72 million portfolio is Alan Lee Bazaar, the chief executive of a New York investment advisory firm with ties to Scott’s business dealings. "If you sort of have an insider managing your blind trust, it doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in the people," Jacobowitz said. While the state law provides some safeguards against conflicts of interest drawn from similar federal regulations, there were more than a dozen federal guidelines the state’s law didn’t incorporate (a point reported by the website the BrowardBulldog.org). These included making trust agreements public, allowing the ethics commission to remove trustees for misconduct and requiring periodic trust performance reports to the commission. Another problem with blind trusts is the while the owner may not manage the holdings, they still know what they own when they put those investments in the trust. "If what you’re putting in has a conflict of interest, then there’s a problem. You still know what’s in it," Jacobowitz said. In May, former Democratic legislator and constitutional law expert Talbot (Sandy) D'Alemberte filed a lawsuit brought by Jim Apthorp, challenging the constitutionality of the law. Apthorp, a Democrat and former chief of staff to the late Gov. Reubin Askew, said the law violated state requirements for financial disclosure. As of June 20, the court is weighing that claim. On June 16, Scott disclosed all of his financials in order to run for governor. In addition to his 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns (he and wife Ann Scott filed for an extension on their 2013 return), the governor ended his blind trust and revealed all the investments in his candidacy filing. That move wasn’t required by the 2013 law, which only says he must disclose the value of the blind trust, not its contents. Scott's net worth rose from $83.8 million in 2012 to $132.7 million last year, an increase of more than half, according to his financial disclosures. When he first ran in 2010, his net worth was a reported $218.6 million. He bankrolled his own campaign and has kept a campaign promise not to draw a salary from the state. One of the notable things missing from Scott’s investments was any interest in French oil services company Schlumberger Ltd., which is involved in Everglades drilling. Scott had a $135,000 investment in 2011 when he formed the trust, but the stake was gone in his June 16 disclosure. The former holding has since drawn an ethics complaint. After filing his paperwork, Scott put the investments into a new blind trust. Our ruling Nelson said "Scott signed into law a bill that gives Florida's public officials an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances." In terms of historical context and content of the Senate Bill 2, that part is true. Blind trusts do let officials shield financial holdings from disclosure requirements, and Florida law now allows officials to use those trusts. The broader implication of Nelson’s statement is that Scott is being dishonest about what he owns, and that it affects his ability to govern without creating conflicts of interest. After Nelson made the statement, Scott ended the trust and disclosed all his holdings, but he was following a law both recommended by the state ethics commission and approved unanimously by the Legislature. That law requires any official to disclose the assets being put into the trust before being turned over to a manager. There is debate over the law’s rules regarding choosing that manager and whether assets in that portfolio may present a conflict of interest. What goes into the trust would be publicly disclosed, however, while how it is managed afterward would not. That’s not the same as hiding assets from voters. In this case, Scott ended the trust to disclose the portfolio’s contents, anyway. Nelson implied the blind trust law makes it easier to hide personal assets. They may be hidden, but only after they are listed and turned over to a trustee. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2014-06-23T12:09:35	2014-06-13	['None']
pomt-11972	In the Alabama Senate runoff, "the candidate I endorsed (Luther Strange) went up MANY points after endorsement!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-luther-strange-gained-many-point/	The defeat of Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., in a Sept. 26 runoff election was a blow for President Donald Trump, who had endorsed Strange over his Republican rival Roy Moore. Strange’s loss even led Trump to delete several of his pro-Strange tweets shortly after the election. But Trump didn’t drop the subject, tweeting a few days later, "In analyzing the Alabama Primary race, FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com When we took a closer look, we found weak support for Trump’s claim. The White House pointed us to a news release from Emerson College’s polling unit, which conducted several polls of the Alabama contest. The news release announcing the results of the Emerson poll conducted Sept. 21-23 included the following analysis: "Moore still leads Strange 50 percent to 40 percent, but the gap has narrowed. Strange trailed Moore by 14 points two weeks ago in Emerson’s previous Alabama poll … President Trump’s ardent support of Luther Strange in the recent weeks is the likely cause of the gap closing." (Trump’s rally in support of Strange was held on the evening of Sept. 22, meaning a portion of the survey occurred after that event.) The lines from the news release don’t provide as much support as Trump seems to think they do. For starters, there’s some question whether a four-point gain merits the label "MANY" -- or whether it’s even mathematically significant, given that the poll had a five-point margin of error. There are also questions about the timing. The Sept. 22 rally for Strange wasn’t actually the unveiling of Trump’s endorsement -- it had been public for weeks. Trump officially endorsed Strange on Aug. 8, a point Trump glossed over in his tweet. In other words, voters who had been paying attention during either the Aug. 15 primary (which included three major Republican candidates) and the Sept. 26 runoff (which included just Moore and Strange) would have known that Strange was Trump’s endorsed candidate. Finally, focusing solely on the Emerson poll leaves out a lot of other polling data that showed little movement toward Strange after either Trump’s formal endorsement or his rally. Here’s a rundown of polls from the RealClearPolitics.com archive: Poll Dates Moore Strange Leader in poll Primary polls WBRC-TV/ Strategy Research 7/24 - 7/24 33 35 Strange +2 RRH/PMI (R) 7/31 - 8/3 31 29 Moore +2 JMC Analytics 8/5 - 8/6 30 22 Moore +8 Trump endorsement 8/8 Trafalgar Group (R) 8/8 - 8/10 35 23 Moore +12 Emerson 8/10 - 8/12 29 32 Strange +3 Trafalgar Group (R) 8/12 - 8/13 38 24 Moore +15 Runoff polls Emerson 9/8 - 9/9 40 26 Moore +14 Gravis 9/21 - 9/22 48 40 Moore +8 Trump rally for Strange in Alabama 9/22 Emerson 9/21 - 9/23 50 40 Moore +10 0ptimus 9/22 - 9/23 55 45 Moore +10 Trafalgar Group (R) 9/23 - 9/24 57 41 Moore +16 These 11 polls show little convincing evidence that Trump’s official endorsement or his rally moved the needle for Strange. One Emerson poll, taken just after Trump’s official endorsement from Aug. 10 to Aug. 12, showed Strange up by three points. That was 11 points better than his eight-point deficit in the last pre-endorsement poll. However, in context, that Emerson poll looks like an outlier. To believe that Strange was really up by three points at that stage of the contest would require dismissing two polls by the Republican firm the Trafalgar Group that bookended the Emerson poll by two days on each side. One had Moore ahead by 12, while the other had Moore ahead by 15. As for polls after the rally, those undertaken at least partially afterward showed high and expanding leads for Moore. Indeed, if you look at the actual ballots cast -- the only vote that really counts -- Moore ended up outpacing Strange by an even wider margin in the runoff. "Moore’s edge over Strange grew from six points in the first round to nine in the second, so the actual votes suggest that Trump did not help Strange close the gap on Moore," said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Kondik also pointed to analysis of data from the polling firm 0ptimus by the Republican firm Firehouse Strategies. The analysis found that even as knowledge of Trump’s endorsement of Strange became better known among the electorate, Moore’s margin grew, from seven points on Sept. 13 to 10 points on Sept. 24, two days before the election. "We can concretely say that Donald Trump’s endorsement and active campaigning for Sen. Strange had absolutely no impact on the ballot," Firehouse Strategies concluded. Our ruling Trump tweeted that in the recent Alabama Senate runoff, "the candidate I endorsed (Luther Strange) went up MANY points after endorsement!" Trump can point to one poll that showed Strange narrowing Moore’s lead by four points after his rally. But other polling data doesn’t back this up, and his tweet glosses over the fact that he had announced his endorsement weeks earlier and that the increase in that one poll is so modest as to be within the margin of error. We rate his statement Mostly False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-10-02T17:23:04	2017-09-30	['Alabama_Senate']
pomt-04691	Mitt Romney said we should let foreclosures "hit the bottom."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/kamala-harris/Kamala-Harris-Romney-favors-letting-foreclosures/	To demonstrate the contrast between President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney, California Attorney General Kamala Harris pointed to the housing crisis. "We don't have to guess what Mitt Romney would have done if he were president. Because he told us," Harris said in a Sept. 5 speech at the Democratic National Convention. "He said we should let foreclosures—and I quote—’hit the bottom’ so the market could—I quote—’run its course.’" The Democratic National Committee made this claim in an ad last year, and PolitiFact checked it out. We found that a significant portion of Romney’s quote was omitted. Here’s a recap. What he said The quote about housing comes from an interview Romney gave to the Las Vegas Review-Journal’s editorial board last year. The newspaper posted video of his comments online, noting that they were in answer to the question, "How will you help with the housing and foreclosure problems in the U.S.?" Here’s a transcript of Romney’s extended answer: "As to what to do for the housing industry specifically, and are there things you can do to encourage housing? One is, don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom. Allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up, and let it turn around and come back up. The Obama administration has slow-walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang. Number two, the credit (that) was given to first-time homebuyers was insufficient and inadequate to turn around the housing market. I think it was an ineffective idea. It was a little bit like the cash-for-clunkers program, throwing government money at something which was not market oriented, did not staunch the decline in home values anymore than it encouraged the auto industry to take off. I think the idea of helping people refinance homes to stay in them is one that's worth further consideration. But I'm not signing on until I find out who's going to pay and who’s going to get bailed out, and that's not something which we know all the answers to." We also reviewed Romney's economic plan, "Believe in America: Mitt Romney’s plan for Jobs and Economic Growth," but it has only passing mentions of the housing sector. It emphasizes low tax rates, reduced regulations for business, initiatives for the energy sector and measures that would reduce the influence of organized labor. In the interview with the newspaper, Romney expressed some hesitation about too much government intervention in the housing market. But he did indicate he was open to the idea of helping homeowners refinance through some government action to encourage it. Our ruling Harris quoted Romney as saying the housing market should be allowed to "hit the bottom" so the crisis could "run its course." He did say that, but he also said that when new investors come in and rehab homes, the market could then "turn around and come back up." Romney also suggested he’d be open to refinancing options that would help some homeowners stay in their homes. That’s important context omitted from Harris’ speech. We rate her statement Half True.

pomt-14985	"We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-people-are-getting-prison-sent/	Marijuana came up a number of times during the first Democratic debate on Oct. 14, 2015 -- in some cases when candidates were asked whether they had used the stuff, and at other times in the context of criminal justice policy. A reader asked us to check one claim by Sen. Bernie Sanders related to marijuana. Late in the debate, Sanders was asked whether he had a position on a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana in Nevada, the state where the debate was being held. If he were a Nevada resident, Sanders said, "I suspect I would vote yes. And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for nonviolent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs." A moment later, Sanders’ rival for the nomination, Hillary Clinton, provided rhetorical support for Sanders’ claim, saying, "I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana." But is it true that, as Sanders put it, the United States is "imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana"? We decided to take a closer look. Prisoner data What the figures show is that possession itself isn’t usually enough to land someone in jail. Rather, those sentenced to prison for marijuana offenses were typically found to be committing crimes more serious than just possessing marijuana (or "smoking" it, as Sanders put it). Often, this means selling it or trafficking it. The Justice Department estimated that 3.6 percent of state inmates in 2013 had drug possession as their most serious offense. That includes possession charges for all drugs, not just marijuana. To gauge the marijuana-only percentage, we have to go back to data that’s about a decade old. The Justice Department periodically carries out surveys of inmates in state and federal correctional facilities, the last of which was from 2004. According to this study, only about three-tenths of 1 percent of state prison inmates were there because of marijuana possession alone, without a more serious charge. Meanwhile, the statistics for federal inmates paint a similar picture. The data shows that among the roughly 67,600 offenders sentenced to prison in federal criminal cases between Oct. 1, 2011 and Sept. 30, 2012, only 28 of them were incarcerated on drug-possession charges alone -- roughly four one-hundredths of 1 percent of all incarcerations. And that includes all drugs, not just marijuana. Looked at another way, the same report found that 99.9 percent of those sentenced to federal prison for any drug-related crime during that year-long period were sent to prison for something more serious than simple possession. Drug policy experts we contacted agree that imprisonment for marijuana possession by itself is rare. "He’s wrong," said Jonathan P. Caulkins, a public policy professor and drug-policy specialist at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. "Basically no one goes to prison just because they use marijuana. The vast majority of time, the people who are in jail for marijuana possession also have other things that are part of their record." Nancy G. La Vigne, director of the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, agreed. "Very, very few people are incarcerated for low quantities of marijuana possession," she said. And Allen St. Pierre -- executive director of the pro-marijuana-legalization group NORML -- concurs, calling Sanders’ claim "a tad off." NORML and other groups have estimated that there are 50,000 to 110,000 cannabis-only offenders are in prison in the United States -- yet "most, but not all, of those incarcerated on marijuana charges are there for cultivation, sales or trafficking," he said. Some caveats All this said, we should note a few points. Experts say different jurisdictions may have divergent standards and thresholds in charging defendants for marijuana possession. Some states even consider passing around a joint at a party to be considered "distributing," said Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor. In addition, the statistics we cited above do not include people sent temporarily to jail -- potentially a much larger population than those serving sentences prison. The jail population could include people who have violated probation for testing positive for marijuana, or for failing to pay a fine for marijuana possession, said Bill Piper, the director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance. Marijuana arrests As it happens, Sanders might have been on safer ground had he stuck to citing arrests for marijuana possession rather than prison time. St. Pierre said that the most recent FBI data shows that of the roughly 700,000 arrests for marijuana-related charges in 2014, about 90 percent were for possession only -- and these arrests can have radiating consequences. Even spending a night or two in jail for marijuana possession can cause "tremendous disruption to their lives -- they can lose their jobs when they don’t show up for work the next day, or they can miss critical doctor appointments, or they can’t pick up their kids from school," Piper said. "This is regardless of whatever penalty they get, and even if the charges are ultimately dropped." La Vigne added that the high arrest rates for marijuana possession has other negative consequences, such as racial disparities in exposure to the criminal justice system. Indeed, when we checked with Sanders’ staff, spokesman Warren Gunnels cited a news report of the FBI arrest statistics. As for prison time, he said that even if the numbers of people in prison for marijuana possession are relatively small, it’s still more than "the number of senior executives on Wall Street who went to jail for the near collapse of the economy in 2008" -- which is the comparison Sanders made during the debate. Our ruling Sanders said, "We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana." Being sentenced to prison for marijuana possession by itself can happen -- but it’s exceedingly rare. Sanders would have been on safer ground had he kept to pointing out continuing high levels of arrests for marijuana possession. These can result in a night in jail and a cascade of problems for those who are arrested, but getting a prison sentence for just smoking a joint is extremely unusual. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10101	If parents "don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have (for their children), they will be fined."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/26/john-mccain/fines-are-possible-but-for-uninsured/	In an appearance on Meet the Press with a little more than a week to go before Election Day, John McCain criticized Barack Obama's health plan as too burdensome to many Americans. "I think that we cannot fine small business people ... small business people who have employees without health insurance, that he's going to fine them if they don't have the insurance policy that Senator Obama wants them to have, that if they have children that don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have, they will be fined," McCain said. We've previously checked McCain's statement that Obama wants to fine small businesses that don't participate in his health plan and found it False . Now we'll look at the statement that "if they have children that don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have, they will be fined." Obama's health plan does have a mandate that children have insurance, and it would likely include an eventual fine once all the elements of the health plan are in place. Here's how Obama explained it in an interview with the Indianapolis Recorder published Oct. 24, 2008: "We would not impose a penalty until we’ve ensured the (State Children's Health Insurance Program) and other programs have made it absolutely affordable for every child to be covered. My belief is that you’ve got to make sure people have an option before you start fining them. Once we’ve got the options in place, we’d impose a fine in the ballpark of what it’d cost to provide insurance for their child. ... Children are relatively cheap to insure. We’re going to be providing subsidies to make sure people can afford them, but we’re also going to expect our parents are showing some responsibility in signing up their kids." So McCain is right about a possible fine, even if he doesn't mention that it would not be imposed until after the program is in place. We have a bigger problem with McCain's explanation that people get fined if their children "d on't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have." Actually, the fine is if the children are uninsured, not if they are insured under a certain type of plan. Obama wants all children to be insured, but he leaves many options through which this could occur. One of the central premises of Obama's plan is that people who are currently insured keep the insurance they have. So we find McCain is correct to say that the parents of children could face fines, but he is wrong to imply that it's the type of coverage that matters. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01486	Countries with a higher minimum wage than the United States’ $7.25 an hour include Denmark at $21, Australia at $15.81, Germany at $11 and France at $12.35.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/26/facebook-posts/do-other-countries-have-higher-minimum-wage-united/	One of the most popular Democratic talking points this campaign season has been to call for an increase in the minimum wage. A social-media meme that’s been circulating recently provides a justification for hiking the minimum wage -- namely that the minimum wage in the United States falls well below that of other advanced industrialized nations. Here’s the text on the meme, which Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., among others, put on his Facebook feed: "Minimum wages around the world in U.S. dollars: Denmark $21/hr., Australia $15.81/hr., Germany $11/hr., France $12.35/hr. United States $7.25/hr. Share if you agree we should catch up with the rest of the world." We wondered how accurate the meme was, so we took a look. Using foreign-exchange rates There are two major methods for comparing minimum wages between countries. The meme uses the most basic way -- using exchange rates to convert the wage amount from the foreign country’s currency to U.S. dollars. Using this method, the meme isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty close. Australia’s minimum wage was recently raised to 16.87 per hour in Australian dollars. At current exchange rates, that’s $14.81 in U.S. dollars -- a little lower than the $15.81 cited in the meme, but still well above the United States’ rate of $7.25 an hour. Germany recently established a national minimum wage for the first time, at 8.5 Euros per hour. (Previously, Germany had a patchwork of different rates.) That works out to $10.79 in U.S. dollars, not far from the $11 cited in the meme, and still quite a bit higher than the minimum wage in the United States. In France, the minimum wage is currently 9.53 Euros, which works out to $12.10. That’s pretty close to the $12.35 in the meme, and it’s well above the U.S. minimum wage. Of the four countries cited in the meme, the description of Denmark is the least accurate. There is actually no minimum wage in Denmark, according to a summary published by the U.S. State Department. According to that summary, "unions and employer associations negotiate minimum wages. The average minimum wage for all private and public sector collective bargaining agreements was approximately DKK 110 ($20) per hour, exclusive of pension benefits." In other words, the Danish "minimum wage" of $20 or $21 is actually an average of all minimum wages across a variety of sectors. That means many Danish workers will be working in companies or industries that have a "minimum wage" lower than $20 or $21. And that undercuts the notion of a "minimum wage," which is supposed to be a floor for wages. So, using foreign-exchange rates, the meme is pretty close for Australia, France and Germany, and somewhat misleading on Denmark. But that’s not the only method you can use. Using purchasing power parity Taking exchange rates into account takes care of one problem related to comparing one country’s minimum wage to another. Untouched, though, is the difference in the cost of living between one country and the other. This difference can be handled by using what’s called "purchasing power parity," or "PPP." If there’s a higher wage but also a higher cost of living in a given country, factoring in purchasing power parity will adjust for that. In two of the four countries -- Australia and France -- factoring in purchasing power parity reduces the gap between the United States’ minimum wage and that of the other country. (We could not find equivalent data for Denmark or Germany.) The data comes from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research group for advanced industrialized countries. OECD reports that in Australia, the PPP-adjusted minimum wage is $10.20, rather than the $15.81 shown in the meme. Meanwhile, France’s PPP-adjusted minimum wage works out to $10.60, rather than $12.35 as in the meme. That’s a 36 percent reduction in the figure for Australia and a 14 percent reduction for France. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, says a PPP-adjusted wage is preferable for this sort of comparison. "Most economists agree that the PPP exchange rate offers a better measure of the standard-of-living comparison between countries than does the commercial exchange rate," he said. "Also, PPP exchange rates fluctuate less from year to year than commercial exchange rates." Our ruling The meme says that countries with a higher minimum wage than the United States’ $7.25 an hour include Denmark at $21, Australia at $15.81, Germany at $11 and France at $12.35. The figure for Denmark is questionable because the country has no single minimum wage. Meanwhile, the figures for the four other countries have been converted into U.S. dollars, but they do not take into account differences in the cost of living in each country -- in other words, how far that wage would go in purchasing goods and services. Economists tend to favor taking purchasing power into account when doing cross-country comparisons of this sort. When purchasing power is taken into account, the gap between the other countries and the United States narrows, though it does not disappear. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-01358	"Ninety-five percent of Oregonians now have health insurance coverage, tens of thousands for the very first time."	true	/oregon/statements/2014/oct/20/john-kitzhaber/do-95-percent-oregonians-now-have-health-insurance/	The rollout of Cover Oregon -- the state’s health insurance marketplace -- could hardly have been messier. Cost overruns, a famously dysfunctional website and, now, litigation, left the entire effort somewhere between comedy and tragedy. But that didn’t stop Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber, during a recent televised debate with Republican challenger Rep. Dennis Richardson, from claiming that health care in Oregon has never been more successful in terms of the number of people covered. The claim: Kitzhaber said the state will have an operating website for new insurance sign-ups within weeks. He added: "Ninety-five percent of Oregonians now have health insurance coverage, tens of thousands of them for the very first time." Do that many Oregonians now have health insurance? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We contacted Kitzhaber’s campaign and received an email back from spokeswoman Amy Wojcicki. She provided links to three news stories, all on the release in September of a report produced by Oregon Health & Science University. All three cited the report’s finding that "an estimated" 95 percent of Oregon residents now have health coverage (up from 86 percent one year ago). Wanting to check the original source, we contacted the report’s author, OHSU health economist Peter Graven. He explained that the insurance numbers in the report came directly from state enrollment reporting. "Oregon is one of only a few states that collect health insurance enrollment information from its insurers," according to the report. "These data sources make it possible to implement this approach with a greater degree of confidence than would otherwise be possible." The biggest driver in reducing the number of uninsured people in Oregon, he said, was the large expansion of Medicaid that was key to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. That expansion, all paid for by the federal government, saw participation in the Oregon Health Plan increase by more than 360,000 individuals, or 59 percent, Graven said. The state, though, deserves credit for both reaching out to eligible populations and obtaining a waiver from the federal government to use a "fast track" process to automatically enroll eligible individuals and families, he said. "Oregon pursued those options very aggressively," Graven said. "Other states didn’t do that." Cover Oregon, forced to sign people up manually, made a far smaller dent in the number of uninsured, he said. Using an extended open enrollment period and relying on insurance agents and community partners, Cover Oregon allowed nearly 80,000 people to find insurance through the marketplace. Of those, about 80 percent received tax credits based on their incomes. The estimated 550,000 Oregon residents who had no health insurance in June 2013 dropped to 201,794 one year later, Graven said. The number who gained insurance was offset somewhat by people who lost insurance offered through small- and large-group plans, Graven said. In some of those instances, employers eliminated company-offered health care, leaving people to seek other insurance options on their own. Of the 3.9 million residents living in the state in June 2013, 14 percent had no health insurance, he said. That number dropped by June 2014. "We’ve never seen a nine-point drop in the overall population of uninsured," Graven said. "We used to get really excited about two-point drops. This blows that out of the water." The ruling: Kitzhaber, trying in a debate to put the Cover Oregon debacle in the best light, claimed that 95 percent of Oregon residents have health insurance coverage, many for the first time. The author of the report that produced the number said its accuracy is bolstered by regulations that make Oregon one of a few states allowed to collect comprehensive health insurance enrollment information directly from insurers. None of those insurers has questioned the validity of the report’s numbers, including the 95 percent figure. The claim is healthy enough to be rated True.

pomt-08543	Says Scott Bruun "still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/02/kurt-schrader/kurt-schrader-says-scott-bruun-wants-privatize-soc/	As sure as the sun rises each morning and more people ease into retirement, the future of Social Security becomes a boiling issue every election. It’s happening again in the race for Oregon’s 5th congressional district. Incumbent Democrat Kurt Schrader has claimed that Republican Scott Bruun advocates ``privatizing Social Security.’’ It happened most recently during a Sept. 10 debate at the Salem City Clubwhen Schrader said this: `` ... My opponent apparently still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize social security.’’ It’s a combustible allegation that could lead some voters to believe they would be at the mercy of an unpredictable stock market as they step into retirement. Many voters, especially older ones who rely on Social Security and who vote in high numbers, would not be pleased if they thought their cherished safety net was going to be less of a sure thing. Schrader is just one of a big number of mostly Democratic candidates talking about Social Security and suggesting Republicans would leave seniors stranded. But is his claim accurate? First, a little background is needed. Social Security is a retirement and disability program guaranteed and fully funded by the U.S. government. That means if you qualify for benefits, the check will be delivered without fail each month just as it’s been since 1935 when Social Security was created by Congress. It’s an enormously popular program that currently provides benefits to 53.4 million people. But it has a huge budget and it’s only getting more expensive as the population ages, a larger number of people qualify for benefits and fewer workers are left to shoulder the cost. Here’s how AARP summarizes the dilemma: ``The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the reserve fund and payroll taxes will cover full payment of benefits through 2037.’’ That’s why Congress and politicians periodically float suggestions for saving Social Security. In 2005, President George W. Bush devoted a portion of his State of the Union address to a plan that would allow workers under age 55 the option of diverting up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into personal accounts. He argued that private investing could bring better returns while easing some of the fiscal pressure on Social Security. The proposal died as most Democrats opposed it, as did some Republicans. Critics said that unscrupulous financial advisers would charge huge fees and that the stock market’s unpredictability could strand millions of seniors without the retirement nest egg they’d counted on. And that brings us to 2010 and Schrader vs. Bruun. Schrader’s claim is based on comments Bruun has made over the years, including an Oct. 22, 1996, letter to the editor published in The Oregonian. ``We can address this problem by growing the economy and by slowly converting contributions into private investments, which will earn a much higher rate of return," he wrote then. Today, he takes a bit less muscular and more nuanced view. In the section of his campaign website devoted to issues, Bruun flatly states he does ``not support a complete privatization of Social Security.’’ At the same time, he would allow workers ``the option to invest a portion’’ of their payroll taxes in private accounts. That is essentially the same idea that crashed and burned in 2006. ``I am committed to pursuing bipartisan solutions to this challenge, and I am eager to look at any proposal that will protect Social Security benefits for today’s seniors without increasing taxes. I do not support a complete privatization of Social Security for younger workers, but I do believe that option to invest a portion of their payroll taxes to conservatively managed private equity accounts should be a choice available to future recipients of Social Security benefits,’’ Bruun says on his website. So what about Schrader’s claim that Bruun "apparently still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security"? Bruun does seem to be suggesting an approach similar to Bush’s in that he would allow younger workers to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds monitored by the government. But that's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security, which Bruun has said he does not support. If he follows Bush, Bruun would change nothing for workers 55 and older. They would not be able to opt into a personal account. And for younger workers (under 55 in Bush’s plan), the possibility of creating a personal retirement account would be totally optional -- one could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as promised. Bruun’s spokeswoman Alee Lockman says Bruun has not suggested a specific age limit for workers who want to contribute to private funds. He says only ``younger workers.’ It’s beyond dispute that, if he’s elected to Congress, Bruun would vote to partially privatize Social Security. But Schrader exaggerates, suggesting that Bruun wants to fully privatize the system. That’s simply not the case and it’s the reason we rate his claim Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-12374	Clean energy employs "more than half a million Californians. That’s nearly ten times more the number of coal mining jobs that exist in the entire nation."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/jun/02/kevin-de-leon/does-california-have-10-times-many-clean-energy-jo/	Democrats in California vowed to take on greater leadership on climate change this week after President Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord. The day before Trump’s action, State Senate Leader Kevin de León, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said California should sprint ahead on aggressive renewable energy goals not only to fight climate change but because it makes economic sense. "We have already seen the economic benefits," of clean energy policies, De León told his colleagues on the Senate floor on May 31, 2017. "Today, California is home to over 100,000 solar jobs." He made his comments as he promoted a plan to require California produce all of its energy from renewable sources by 2045. De León then made a related claim that caught our attention: "Clean energy is in fact a pillar of our economy that employs now more than half a million Californians. That’s nearly ten times more the number of coal mining jobs that exist in the entire nation. So, clean energy is the future." De León makes his claim at about the 2:30 minute mark in the video above. We know California is home to many jobs tied to solar, wind and other renewable forms of energy. But do those really amount to nearly ten times the number of coal mining jobs nationwide? We dug in on a fact check. Coal mining jobs We’ll start by examining the number of coal mining jobs. As of May 2017, there were 51,000 coal mining jobs nationwide, according to an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This includes all categories of workers in the industry, from clerks and accountants to truck drivers and security guards. The number of extraction workers -- those who actually mine the coal -- was far smaller, at 11,620, according to 2016 breakdown of these jobs by the Bureau. In the mid 1980s, there were nearly 180,000 coal mining jobs in the United States. The industry has experienced a steady decline in employment since that time, with a few exceptions. De León appears to be on the right track with his claim that California’s half million clean energy jobs are nearly ten times the nation’s 51,000 coal mining jobs. Clean energy jobs Verifying the number of clean energy jobs in California is more complex. "There isn’t a formal way the state collects data on clean energy jobs, at least not at this point," said Brook Taylor, deputy director of the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development. Instead, Taylor said, the state relies on a survey by Advanced Energy Economy Institute, which is affiliated with a national association that promotes clean and affordable energy. He said the organization takes a deep look at California’s "advanced energy" jobs, which Taylor described as an interchangeable term for clean energy employment. As of 2015, AEEI’s survey found 507,703 advanced energy jobs in California, up 18 percent from the previous year. It estimated that figure would grow to nearly 550,000 in 2016. AEEI said it based its data on a survey of 831 companies doing business in California. It defines advanced energy employees are those who are full-time and part-time permanent employees who support the advanced energy portion of a business, including administrative staff and excluding interns and other temporary workers. De León's spokesman pointed to this survey as evidence for the senator’s claim. ‘Really elusive number’ Labor economists, however, say the AEE survey isn’t perfect. "This is a really elusive number," Carol Zabin, director of the Green Economy Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, said of the number of clean energy jobs in the state. "The study he cited by AEE, it may be an exaggeration. But we don’t have anything better." Zabin said the way clean energy jobs are counted is problematic. An electrician whose company starts installing more efficient lighting, she explained, might be counted as having a clean energy job. A bus driver who operates a diesel bus one year and then a cleaner burning bus the next might similarly be counted in the survey as having a clean energy job. But those aren’t new jobs, they are the "greening of jobs," she added. The survey also might count employees who spend only part of their time performing clean energy tasks as clean energy workers, added Betony Jones, associate director at the university’s Green Economy Program. De León's statement does not specifically address whether these are new jobs or existing positions that have shifted to clean energy roles. The senator’s spokesman also pointed to a 2017 U.S. Energy and Employment report that at least partly backs up the claim. That report cites just over 300,000 energy efficiency jobs in the state. In addition, the report includes 200,000 electric power generation jobs, of which about 153,000 belong to the solar industry and about 4,600 in wind. This approaches the half million jobs De Leon cited, though many of them would be subject to the same caveats expressed by the labor economists. Our rating State Senator Kevin de León recently stated that California has "more than half a million" clean energy jobs. "That’s nearly ten times more the number of coal mining jobs that exist in the entire nation." Government data and a survey by the Advanced Energy Economy Institute, which is affiliated with a clean energy trade group, largely back up De León's claim. Labor economists say pinpointing the exact number of clean energy jobs in any state is difficult. There aren’t always clear definitions for these jobs. And the way some clean energy jobs are counted is problematic, they said, because some positions only focus on clean energy as a portion of their overall responsibilties. Still, they said, the evidence cited by the senator is the best available. We found De León's statement is accurate but needs clarification.

pomt-13823	Says Mark Kirk "called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans" and "was apparently fine with Trump’s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation."	false	/illinois/statements/2016/jul/15/tammy-duckworth/says-mark-kirk-called-mass-arrest-18000-african-am/	In the hotly contested Illinois U.S. Senate race, Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth is doing everything she can to link Republican incumbent Mark Kirk to Donald Trump. Even after Kirk said he would not support Trump on June 7, the Duckworth camp kept at it in this tweet: That's a packed tweet. Is it true that Kirk called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans and, second, that Kirk had no objection to Trump’s call for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants? We checked the record. What Kirk said Duckworth's deputy campaign manager Matt McGrath said in an email she was referencing a statement Kirk made in May 2013 during an interview with Fox 32 Chicago political editor Mike Flannery. Kirk told Flannery: "My top priority is to arrest the Gangster Disciple gang, which is 18,000 people. I would like to do a mass pickup of them and put them all in the Thomson Correctional Facility. I will be proposing this to the assembled federal law enforcement: ATF, DEA and FBI." Kirk made that statement in response to the January 2013 shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was struck in the back by a stray bullet during a gang-related shooting on Chicago’s south side. The Gangster Disciples is an African-American gang from the city's south side and has an estimated 18,000 members, though its membership could be as high as 30,000, according to the Chicago Crime Commission’s press officer John Pastuovic. The statement drew criticism from the media as well as from Kirk’s colleagues in Congress, including U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill, who called the proposal an "upper middle class elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about." But Kirk acknowledged in July 2013 that his plan to arrest every member of the Gangster Disciples was "not actually that practical." Still, not only does Duckworth's tweet take what Kirk said out of context, it also implies he supported the general mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans, even though Kirk never mentioned race or used the term "African-Americans" during his interview with Fox 32 Chicago. What about Kirk on deportation? And as for Duckworth’s claim that Kirk "was apparently fine with Trump’s call for mass deportation?" On May 4, Trump appeared on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, where he reiterated his plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants if he were to become president. In a May 6 interview with CNN before Trump’s primary-clinching win in Indiana, Kirk said he would support Trump as the Republican nominee, calling Trump’s candidacy a "net benefit" for his own campaign in Illinois. Kirk withdrew his support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee on June 7 after Trump said an American-born federal judge of Mexican ancestry couldn’t preside fairly over civil fraud lawsuits against the defunct Trump University because he has called for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border. While Kirk did back Trump knowing his position on illegal immigration, Kirk has made clear in the past he does not support Trump’s controversial immigration policies. In July 2015, Kirk told reporters at news conference he had a message for Trump: "In a typical Chicago way, to my Mexican-American friends, I would say, 'Donald Trump callate' shut up." And Kirk’s congressional voting record suggests he would not be "fine" with deporting 11 million immigrants living here illegally. Eleni Demertzis, the Kirk campaign’s communications director, noted in an email the senator supported and voted for the high-profile comprehensive immigration reform package in June 2013, which first would have secured the border and then created a tough but fair pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, among other things. But that measure never made it to a vote in the House. In addition to his pro-immigration reform stance, Kirk in October 2015 broke ranks with his party and was the only GOP Senator who voted to preserve federal funding for "sanctuary cities." However, Kirk did vote in favor of increasing penalties from two years to five years for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country illegally after being deported, denied entry or removed for other reasons, voting largely along party lines. Our ruling Duckworth tweeted: "Kirk, who called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans, was apparently fine with Trump’s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation." While Kirk did call for the mass arrest of the Gangster Disciples, an African-American gang estimated to have 18,000 members, Duckworth’s tweet takes Kirk’s statement out of context and gives the impression he had called for the general mass incarceration of 18,000 African-Americans. Duckworth also fails to acknowledge Kirk walked back his statement shortly after he made it. More importantly, Kirk did not mention race when he originally called for a "mass pickup" of the Gangster Disciples gang. As for Kirk being "apparently fine" with mass deportation, his congressional voting record on immigration shows he supports comprehensive reform that would both improve border security and implement a tough, but fair pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- not to mention he was the lone Republican senator to vote against legislation that would have withheld federal funds from sanctuary cities.

pomt-12922	"Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/13/sheri-dillon/trump-lawyer-foreign-dignitaries-staying-trump-hot/	Here’s a hypothetical scenario giving some ethics watchdogs heartburn: A foreign dignitary visits Washington, D.C., on government business and decides to stay at the Trump International Hotel. He or she might choose to stay there because of its amenities, its convenient location four blocks from the White House, or to build up goodwill with the president who owns the hotel. If his hotel accepts the foreign government’s bill payment for the dignitary’s stay, some critics argue Donald Trump would, as president, be in violation of the Constitution’s provision to block foreign influence. The emoluments clause says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress. But lawyers for Trump say that the critics are mistaken, because this clause doesn’t apply to fair-value exchanges, such as paying standard market rates for a hotel room. "These people are wrong," said Morgan Lewis & Bockius partner Sheri Dillon at a Jan. 11 press conference. "This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument." Despite this position, Dillon said Trump’s company would donate to the U.S. Treasury any profits earned from foreign governments through his business, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. And his company will also refrain from engaging in any new deals with foreign governments while Trump is president. But given the backlash about Dillon’s interpretation of the emoluments clause from some legal commentators, we decided to fact-check her claim that fair-value exchanges — like paying a hotel bill — are not emoluments. The answer we found isn’t very satisfying: Some legal scholars say Dillon has a point, others say she doesn’t. The emoluments clause hasn’t come before the courts in any meaningful way, so there aren’t any past judicial rulings to look at for guidance about the scope of the emoluments clause. Whether the clause even applies to the president remains an unsettled legal question. "Anything anyone tells you about the emoluments clause is a matter of opinion," said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause. Before we go any further, here’s the full text of the emoluments clause, found in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution: "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." What that means is someone holding a government position cannot take an emolument, meaning payment or salary, from a foreign government. A clear example of an emolument would be if a government employee made a decision favorable to a foreign country and, in exchange, a representative of that country’s government gave the American employee a check. Dillon’s law firm explained in a Jan. 10 white paper why they believe this clause doesn’t ban, say, a foreign government paying a fair rate to stay in a hotel owned by a government worker. The authors of the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper wrote that the Constitution’s authors understood the term "emoluments" to mean "a payment or other benefit received as a consequence of discharging the duties of an office." So paying a hotel to offer standard hotel services is not an emolument because the service provided is not associated with the office of a president. They also wrote that in the early 1800s, the country nearly amended the Constitution to extend the emoluments clause to all citizens, not just federal office holders. They did not see evidence that anyone thought that extending the clause’s reach would inhibit citizens’ ability to engage in fair commerce with foreign governments or their representatives. Tillman said he largely agrees with the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper — especially because the money would be flowing into the Trump Organization, not Trump’s pockets directly. "The concern is related to the concept of office," he said. "It’s not about business deals like staying in hotels when the price is fixed." That, however, is far from the final word. Several legal scholars wrote in a Brookings memo that they read the emoluments clause as applying to fair-value exchanges. The clause is intended to block any arrangement with a foreign state that could result in a profit or benefit for the officeholder because it carries the risk of "improper foreign influence," as the officeholder’s legitimate business interests would depend, at least in part, on the foreign state, the authors wrote. They are Norman L. Eisen, chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, and Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard University. The historical evidence shows, they argue, that the drafters of the Constitution wanted the emoluments clause to be broad in scope, in order to limit even the possibility of corruption. For example, the phrasing in the clause specifically refers to emoluments "of any kind whatever." "Wholly apart from any actual quid pro quo arrangements or demonstrable bribes or payoffs, the emoluments clause will be violated whenever a foreign diplomat stays in a Trump hotel or hosts a reception in one," they wrote. Despite their position, Eisen, Painter and Tribe note that "there is not yet a firm consensus on this point." All of this discussion assumes that Trump, as president, would be subject to the emoluments clause. But that’s still not a certainty, and there is evidence, both modern and from the time of the Constitution’s ratification, that supports either side. We should note that hotel stays are not the only way representatives of foreign states interact with Trump’s business. He has worked with foreign governments to do business in around 20 countries. The Bank of China is a tenant in Trump Tower in Manhattan. Depending on how his plans to separate himself from his business play out, these dealings could present, if not a violation of the emoluments clause, a serious conflict of interest. Our ruling Dillon, a lawyer for Trump, said under the Constitution, "Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument." Whether the emoluments clause would include a situation where representatives of a foreign state paid for a room in one of Trump’s hotels is an unanswered legal question. We encountered reasonable arguments on both sides, and there isn’t any judicial precedent to guide us to the right answer. Maybe this question will get answered in a meaningful way during the Trump administration. But for now, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-12490	"President Trump has passed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/may/01/tom-mcclintock/mcclintock-trump-signed-more-laws-first-100-days-a/	California Republican Congressman Tom McClintock gave President Trump high marks for his initial performance in the White House, especially when it comes to the number of bills he’s signed into law. "President Trump has passed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman," McClintock claimed in an interview on Sacramento’s KFBK radio station on April 28, 2017, one day before Trump’s 100th day in office. McClintock’s district includes the suburbs east of Sacramento and large stretches of the Sierra Nevada. The congressman’s claim echoed a statement by White House press secretary Sean Spicer just a few days earlier. "Despite the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats, he's worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman, and these bills deliver on some of his most significant promises to the American people," Spicer said at the White House daily press briefing April 25. The national PolitiFact team has already examined Spicer’s claim. We’ll use their analysis to rate McClintock. Trump most productive? In a related fact-check in April 2017, PolitiFact rated as False Trump’s claim that no administration had accomplished as much as he did, period. It found Trump has had some achievements in office, but at the very least, they are much less numerous and far-reaching than those of President Roosevelt, the standard against whom all presidents are measured. In more recent years, other presidents, including Obama, have accomplished more in their first 100 days than Trump has, historians told PolitiFact. Looking at the number of bills, Trump had signed 28 as of late April 2017, just before his 100 day mark in office. Spicer and McClintock are correct that this is more than every president going back about 70 years. Trump signed 31 executive orders during his first 100 days, also more than any president since Truman, according to calculations in a CNN.com article. Many of those rolled back orders signed by President Obama. "Those mean something to certain groups, but they don't have the kind of broad impact that legislation has, that programs that are approved by Congress have, because the fact that they can be rescinded by a stroke of a president's pen means they can be reimplemented with the stroke of another president’s pen," H.W. Brands, a professor of history at the University of Texas, who has written biographies of Woodrow Wilson, Andrew Jackson, and Benjamin Franklin, told Vox.com in a recent interview. "Furthermore, they don't have legitimacy, the credibility, of having the approval of more than just one person. If you get major legislation passed, it has the approval of Congress and the presidency, and that means a whole lot more than if it's just the preference of a president." Still, the bill signing measurement isn’t perfect either. That's primarily because not all bills are created equal. None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant or include any of his major campaign promises. The numbers Truman signed 55 bills in his first 100 days after his 1948 election. (Truman first became president in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in office. So we’re starting with the first 100 days of Truman’s first full term.) No president since Truman has signed as many bills in his first 100 days, according to data from GovTrack and research by political scientists John Frendreis, Raymond Tatalovich and Jon Schaff. The next highest after Trump, who has signed 28 bills, was John F. Kennedy, who signed 26. The lowest was George W. Bush, who signed seven. No president comes close to Roosevelt, who began the tradition of marking the first 100 days. He signed 76. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Note on the chart: For presidents Jimmy Carter through Trump, we did our own count using GovTrack. For earlier presidents, we used data confirmed by Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. For Lyndon Johnson and Truman, who both came into office to replace a president midterm, we used the first 100 days after their re-election. We left out Gerald Ford because he did not serve a full term. Of the post-Truman presidents, Trump is "fairly typical" in terms of the number of bills signed so far, Frendreis said. The bills Spicer says that Trump has shepherded these bills through Congress. However, the 28 bills aren’t very significant and don’t appear to have required vote whipping from the White House. For example, three bills appoint individuals to the Smithsonian Institution board, two name buildings, and one designates a location for a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial. Trump worked directly with members of Congress to repeal Obamacare but failed to convince enough to end the federal healthcare law during his first 100 days. The most notable bills Trump has signed are a set of 13 that reverse Obama-era regulations on a range of issues including on internet privacy and gun control. While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it’s important to note these bills made it to Trump’s desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump’s first 100 days. Notably missing from the list of 28 bills that have reached his desk: A bill repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, along with several other laws Trump said he would usher through Congress within his first 100 days. Compare this to President Barack Obama, who signed 14 laws, but those laws included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the $800 billion stimulus package. Or Roosevelt, who within 100 days signed 15 major bills including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed bills that legalized the manufacture and sale of beer and wine and established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Generally speaking, it’s rare for a president to sign major legislation in his first 100 days, Frendreis said. "Outsider" presidents like Trump, in particular, need time to learn how to navigate the lawmaking process in Washington, and major legislation doesn’t move through Congress quickly. The first 100 days is "not necessarily an accurate reflection of how effective a president is going to be in leading Congress," he said. Our ruling White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump has "worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman." California Republican Congressman Tom McClintock made a similar claim about Trump passing more legislation than any president since Truman. In the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills. The president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28. The national PoltiFact rated Spicer’s claim Mostly True, with the key clarification that none of the bills Trump has signed so far are major pieces of legislation. They added that his accomplishment doesn’t indicate that Trump has been particularly skilled at getting his agenda through Congress so far. For the same reasons, and with the same key clarification, we rate McClintock’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-06514	"More than 25 million Americans are unemployed. More than 50 million live without health insurance. Perhaps 100 million live in poverty."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/11/occupied-wall-street-journal/are-statistics-occupied-wall-street-journal-correc/	To back up their complaints about economic injustice, protesters taking part in the demonstrations in New York's Financial District in New York have been handing out the Occupied Wall Street Journal. "Our system is broken," said an Oct. 5, 2011, article headlined "The Revolution Begins at Home: An Open Letter to Join the Wall Street Occupation," which was also posted here. "More than 25 million Americans are unemployed. More than 50 million live without health insurance. Perhaps 100 million live in poverty. Yet the fat cats are showered with billions in tax breaks while politicians compete to turn the screws on the rest of us." We wondered if the article’s numbers were accurate. We’ll take them one by one: "More than 25 million Americans are unemployed." This is nearly double the government's official number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted almost 14 million unemployed Americans in September 2011. This is the number that’s used to calculate the official unemployment rate of 9.1 percent. But some critics have long argued that this definition of unemployment is too limiting, since it doesn’t count people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job. So BLS also offers an alternative measure (known to economists as "U-6") that factors in both groups. Using this measure, BLS in September 2010 found an additional 2.5 million Americans who are "marginally attached" to the labor force, meaning they’d be ready to work if a job became available, and another 9.3 million Americans who are working part time but who would prefer a full-time job. Together, these three categories added up to 25.8 million people in September 2011, for a total "U-6" rate of 16.5 percent, or well above the official unemployment rate. That’s in line with what the article said -- but only if you consider "unemployed" to mean "unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force, or working only part-time for economic reasons." And while there are good reasons for looking at the "U-6" rate when discussing the current jobs picture, "U-6" is not the official definition of "unemployed." "More than 50 million live without health insurance." The article nailed this one just about perfectly. The most recent U.S. Census Bureau study, "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage: 2010," found that 49.9 million Americans were uninsured in 2010, or 16.3 percent of the population. "Perhaps 100 million live in poverty." The article hedges its claim by saying "perhaps," but you still have to stretch the official definition of poverty quite a bit to make the number work. According to the same Census Bureau report -- "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage: 2010" -- there were 46.2 million Americans below the poverty line in 2010, or 15.1 percent of the population. That's less than half the 100 million claim in the article. However, some critics have long questioned whether the official poverty line is set too low. So the Census Bureau also calculates the number of Americans whose incomes put them at various multiples of the poverty line -- people, in other words, who are poor but not officially impoverished. These numbers show that 60.4 million Americans are at 125 percent of the poverty line, 75.3 million are at 150 percent of the poverty line, and 103.6 million Americans -- or just over one-third -- are at twice the poverty line. So to get to 100 million Americans, the article would have to count people who are at roughly twice the official poverty level. Most people would agree that these people are in a low-income category. But according to official government statistics, they are not "in poverty." Our ruling The numbers in the Occupied Wall Street Journal rely on the broadest definitions of economic deprivation in America, but they are at odds with official government statistical definitions. While the number for the uninsured is essentially correct, the indicators for unemployment and poverty refer to broader, alternative measures that have some usefulness in policy discussions but that aren’t accurately described by the terminology in the article. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Occupied Wall Street Journal	None	None	None	2011-10-11T11:25:56	2011-10-05	['United_States']
pomt-09864	Health care reform legislation is “likely to mandate free ‘sex change’ surgeries.”	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/07/blog-posting/conservative-news-release-says-health-care-bill-li/	In trying to build opposition to President Barack Obama's health care proposal, critics have suggested that health care would be government-controlled , that people would be left to die if their treatment exceeded a certain cost and that it would require counseling telling people " how to end their life sooner ." (We've ruled versions of each of those False or Pants on Fire.) Now comes a new one: that taxpayers may soon be footing the bill for free sex-change operations. On Aug. 4, a news release to that effect went out under the name of Matt Barber, who is director of cultural affairs with Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group, and the associate dean of Liberty University School of Law, which was founded by the late televangelist Jerry Falwell. It was quickly spread by blogs on the left and the right. Titled, “ObamaCare Likely to Mandate Free ‘Sex Change’ Surgeries,” the release asserted that “the weight of the evidence indicates that cosmetic ‘gender reassignment’ surgeries for both U.S. citizens and illegal immigrants who suffer from [the American Psychiatric Association-] recognized ‘Gender Identity Disorder’ (GID) may also be provided – free of charge – courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. The current price tag for such a procedure can exceed $50,000.” To confirm Barber’s authorship and learn more about his reasoning, we tried to reach him through the phone number and e-mail address listed on the release, as well as through a call to a different number at Liberty Counsel. But he did not respond. Because we couldn't confirm his authorship, we're attributing this item to our generic category "bloggers," since they have spread it so widely. Before we delve into our findings in detail, here's an overview of why we found the claim was False: The news release tries to stitch together a patchwork of unrelated items to back up the sex-change claim, but the health care bills as they appear today simply don't do what the release alleges. There is no mandate for sex-change coverage. The news release offers three pieces of evidence: • An exchange between Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., about the legislation covering treatments that would be "medically necessary." • Language in the House version of the health care bill that provides for "standards, as appropriate, for the collection of accurate data on health and health care" based on "sex, sexual orientation [and] gender identity." • And language in a draft Senate bill that requires the Department of Health and Human Services to “‘develop standards for the measurement of gender’ (i.e., officially recognize subjectively self-determined "transgender" or "transsexual" gender identities). It further mandates ‘participation in the institutions’ programs of individuals and groups from ... different genders and sexual orientations.” Let’s take these assertions one by one. The Hatch-Mikulski exchange It came during a session held by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to revise a Senate version of the health care bill. The committee was discussing an amendment by Mikulski that would require health insurance plans to include preventive women's health services. Hatch asked his colleague whether that meant that coverage of abortions would be required. She replied that the measure would not “mandate” abortion coverage but would “provide for any service deemed medically necessary or medically appropriate.” The amendment narrowly passed the committee and was appended to the bill. It's worth noting that Mikulski's amendment may not survive to enactment. And her comments quoted in the news release aren’t, in and of themselves, binding. Still, the news release used Mikulski’s explanation on abortion to assert that sex-change treatments would also be covered under the same doctrine. Before we get to the substance of that claim, let’s look at the significance of Mikulski's phrase "medically necessary." Seth Chandler, the co-director of the Health Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston, said that the phrase does carry weight. “That is kind of a magic word in health insurance, in that virtually every private insurance plan I know of contains an exclusion for procedures that are not medically necessary,” he said. “It’s designed to preclude fraudulent or highly experimental procedures.” The American Medical Association, the nation’s leading doctors’ group, has already gone on record saying that gender-reassignment surgery can be medically necessary. In 2008, the AMA passed a resolution on gender identity disorder that opposes coverage limitations “when such care is based upon sound scientific evidence and sound medical opinion.” Even so, insurers have not made such coverage universal today. The Web site of the National Center for Lesbian Rights posts a fact sheet that says that such surgeries have long been banned by Medicare and CHAMPUS, the federally run military health plan. Medicaid does not specifically bar those surgeries, the fact sheet added, but some states have statutes barring them. As for the private sector, neither America’s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for private insurers, nor the Transgender Law Center could provide us with figures on how common it is for transgender surgeries to be covered by insurance. But AHIP’s vice president of communications, Susan Pisano, said that, anecdotally, “my understanding is that there is less coverage for those procedures and treatments. … Some employers do provide it, but I don’t think most people have coverage for those services.” Indeed, the AMA resolution noted that “many health insurance plans categorically exclude coverage of mental health, medical, and surgical treatments for GID, even though many of these same treatments, such as psychotherapy, hormone therapy, breast augmentation and removal, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and salpingectomy, are often covered for other medical conditions.” Still, there is at least a nugget of plausibility in the news release citing Mikulski’s language. It may indeed make it into the final version of health reform, and if so, it could provide justification for expanding (though not necessarily mandating) coverage of procedures that are controversial but deemed medically necessary. The House and Senate language But in its other points, relating to language in the House and Senate bills, the news release offers little evidence to back up its claim. The release's discussion of the House bill's language focuses on one mention of collecting health care data based on “sex, sexual orientation [and] gender identity.” We looked up the passage, and it comes in a section that lays out the job description for a new assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for health information. That official is charged with setting standards for data collection on a number of factors, including such commonplace categories as race, sex, ethnicity, primary language and geographic setting in addition to “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” While it’s true that the section mentions gender identity, it merely addresses how health care data on a wide variety of subgroups should be collected. It is not a green light to cover sex-change surgeries. The evidence is even flimsier in the release's claim about the Senate bill’s language. The first phrase the news release cites – that a Senate draft bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to “develop standards for the measurement of gender” – would, according the release, “officially recognize subjectively self-determined ‘transgender’ or ‘transsexual’ gender identities.” We find that's a ridiculous leap of logic. The passage in question is the equivalent of the House bill’s language on data collection, not mandated coverage. The full passage cites the development of statistical standards to measure not just for gender but also for “geographic location, socioeconomic status, primary language and disability measures.” The second passage cited from the Senate bill addresses mental and behavioral health grants that may be awarded by the federal government to students. Its reference to “participation in the institutions’ programs of individuals and groups from ... different genders and sexual orientations” merely constitutes a requirement that schools receiving support under the grant program adhere to principles of nondiscrimination and diversity in “racial, ethnic, cultural, geographic, religious, linguistic, and class backgrounds” as well as for “different genders and sexual orientations.” That's simply a requirement that the participating educational institutions not discriminate — not a mandate for covering sex-change surgeries. The bottom line is that neither bill talks specifically about gender-reassignment surgery. The news release has attempted — poorly, in most cases — to piece together a patchwork case. But the health reform plans as they stand now don't do what the release claims. In theory, the House bill does offer one path by which coverage of sex-change surgeries could be made mandatory. If that part of the bill survives to enactment, a new panel called the Health Benefits Advisory Council could eventually recommend that sex-change surgeries be covered. The council, chaired by the surgeon general, would be tasked with recommending to the HHS secretary what “treatments, items and services” constitute “essential benefits.” If the HHS secretary agreed with the recommendations, they would initially take effect for public-option plans if such plans were part of the final legislation. After a five-year transitional period, private plans would have to adhere to this basic package of services. So in theory, it would be in the Health Benefits Advisory Council’s power to decide to include gender-reassignment surgery in the package of essential benefits. But that's a far cry — and many political hurdles away — from "mandating" sex-change coverage. Given the public’s squeamishness about the topic, it doesn't seem to us that it's “likely,” as the news release suggested. So let’s recap. The release may have a point that Mikulski’s comment could open the door to "medically necessary" coverage which conceivably may include sex-change operations. But it's unclear whether her amendment will remain in the legislation, and there's nothing specific in the legislation on sex-change procedures and nothing else solid that indicates such coverage will be provided. The news release cherry-picked a few fleeting references to “gender” and “sexual orientation” in completely unrelated contexts to argue that proposed health care legislation would mandate free sex-change surgeries (and allow them for illegal aliens, no less). To us, these bits of evidence are wholly unpersuasive. We find the claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2009-08-07T12:13:20	2009-08-04	['None']

pomt-04023	"Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in five years."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/02/central-falls-police-department/central-falls-ri-animal-control-says-one-male-cat-/	We love cats. They sit on your lap. They purr. They play with yarn. We tease them with laser pointers. Who knew the males of the species were lean, mean reproductive machines? That's what we learned from a Jan. 28 news release from the Central Falls Police Department that announced a $30,000 animal control grant intended to help low-income pet owners keep the cat population down through spaying and neutering. "Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in just five years," the release says. Usually, when we see a statement we'd like to check, we ask, "Is that true?" In this case we asked, "Is that even possible?" We rushed to our calculator. Five years is 1,827 days (counting leap years). The typical number of kittens in a litter is four. That means the male cat would have to find and successfully inseminate 57 females per day to create that many kittens over five years. "He would be a very busy boy," joked Central Falls police Capt. Steven Bradley, listed as the contact person on the news release, after we told him what the numbers revealed. "Maybe he's got a line on some good catnip." And steroids! So clearly the math shows the statement is wrong. Bradley said the statistic came from Rita Falaguerra of Cat Adoption Team Services, which secured the grant. Falaguerra said she stands by the statistic because it came from the state veterinarian, Peter Belinsky. Belinsky said she may have seen it as a pamphlet posted in his examination room which said 400,000 cats could come from one pair of cats over seven years under ideal conditions. "I might have quoted it, but that was a long time ago," he said, acknowledging that he was not sure if the widely-cited number was true. We found the questionable factoid (or differing versions of it) repeated on many pet-lover websites, such as the Pet Health Network, the ASPCA, and in the mainstream media. (The Journal repeated it on Jan. 29 and a day earlier on its website.) Most often, the claims involve the reproduction potential of female cats, not male. The amount of time deemed necessary varies from five to seven years, depending on who is talking. So what's the real story? Belinsky also cited a 1993 article published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Like many similar claims, it offers numbers based on raw mathematical population growth and does not factor real life into the equation. It said that if all the cats remain healthy and get enough nutrition, with no premature deaths, and each female produces eight kittens per year, it’s theoretically possible that 174,760 cats could descend from a single female after seven years. That statistic is also quoted frequently. But it assumes that females are only fertile for one year. If all the females remain fertile indefinitely, the paper says, there would be 781,250 cats after seven years. We checked the calculations. They turned out to be off. It would take eight years, not seven, to reach either number. After five years, the timeframe we're looking at, the cat population would be 2,729 if female fertility lasted one year and 6,249 if all the females remained fertile. That's a far cry -- or should we say meow -- from 420,000. Belinsky said even those lower numbers are unrealistic, especially when you're talking about cats in the wild. "You've got predation, you've got toxins, you’ve got infectious disease, and they don't live more than a year or two in the wild, so this would be under ideal conditions," Belinsky said. A more reasonable estimate for feral cats, he said, would be roughly 1.8 surviving cats for every female per year. At that rate, we calculated, you would have perhaps 49 cats alive after five years. As it turns out, the 420,000 statistic has been debunked in articles going back a few years. The Wall Street Journal shot it down in 2006. The San Francisco Chronicle did so in 2010. Where does it come from? The website HumaneWatch.org says it found the Humane Society of the United States using it in a news release in 1989. Whatever the source, the fallacious feline factoid has nine lives -- if not more -- among pet enthusiasts. "That's the craziness of all these quotes," said Belinsky. "They're not derived from actually following the animals in the wild or under a controlled experiment. They just extrapolate based on math and best guess." Our ruling Central Falls police, citing a cat adoption service, said, "Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in five years." In the real world, that's impossible. The idea that one female cat and her succeeding generations could produce that many cats in half a decade is just as ridiculous. There are overwhelmingly good reasons to have a cat spayed or neutered. Trying to prevent a single male cat from producing more than 400,000 offspring in five years isn't one of them.

pomt-05761	Says Mitt Romney said he does not "line up with the NRA."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/29/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-ad-quotes-mitt-romney-distancing-him/	Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is running a television ad that uses rival Mitt Romney’s own words against him. The ad contains no voice-over, only sound effects as Romney’s quotes pop onto the screen against a black background. The first says, "I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association." The NRA wields enormous political power at the state and national levels, and conservative candidates crave its endorsement. It’s startling to see a Republican contender distancing himself from the group, so we decided to delve into the ad’s claim. Did Romney really say that? In short, yes, he did. But it was in 1994. Running for Senate in Massachusetts, Romney criticized his opponent, Democrat Ted Kennedy, for supporting a crime bill in Congress. Romney said Kennedy had worked to expand the cost of the bill while weakening several provisions. According to a story in the Boston Globe about the issue, Romney stressed that he supported the bill's ban on 19 different types of assault weapons -- which the NRA opposed. "I don't line up with the NRA," Romney said, according to the story. The quote was not a blanket statement of disagreement with the NRA, as Santorum’s ad could suggest. Rather Romney was talking about a particular issue on which he didn't agree with the NRA's position. At the time, Romney also voiced support for the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales. The NRA opposed that bill. His words since In 2002, while running for governor, Romney was still talking the gun control talk. In a debate comment captured in this YouTube video, Romney said, "We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them. I won’t chip away at them. I believe they help protect us and provide for our safety." In fact, he expanded those protections in the state. In 2004, Gov. Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons such as the AK-47 and Uzi. The NRA called the law "ineffective and unnecessary." By 2007, when he was making his first run for president, Romney’s tone had begun to change. The Globe reported on his shift in rhetoric: "He now touts his work as governor to ease restrictions on gun owners. He proudly describes himself as a member of the NRA -- though his campaign won't say when he joined. And Friday, at his campaign's request, top officials of the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation led him around one of the country's biggest gun shows. "Romney says he still backs the ban on assault weapons, but he won't say whether he stands by the Brady Bill. And after the gun show tour, his campaign declined to say whether he would still describe himself as a supporter of tough gun laws." The Globe later reported that Romney admitted to joining the NRA in August, 2006, just months before announcing his presidential candidacy. At the time his campaign touted his pro-gun efforts as governor, including his signing of an NRA-backed bill that reduced a testing requirement on certain pistol-makers before they could sell guns in Massachusetts and his designation of May 7, 2005, as "The Right to Bear Arms Day" in Massachusetts to honor "the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms in defense of their families, persons, and property and for all lawful purposes, including the common defense." The best evidence we found on the matter comes from a 2007 interview Romney gave on Meet the Press. Host Tim Russert confronted Romney with his quotes from 1994 and asked him to explain. Romney said, "My position on guns is the same position I’ve had for a long, long time. That position is that I don’t line up a hundred percent with the NRA. I don’t see eye to eye with the NRA on every issue." He said he still supported banning weapons that are "unusually lethal" but hedged on waiting periods. He said the Brady Bill originally included a waiting period because the time was necessary for performing background checks. Now that technology enables instant background checks, such waiting periods are unnecessary, he said. Then he spoke a bit about Second Amendment rights. "We should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns, either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose. I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t," he told Russert. The 2012 campaign Romney didn’t attend the NRA’s national convention in 2011 in Pittsburgh and instead sent a videotaped message. He said nothing about gun rights. He offered congratulations to the organization and its leaders for their work defending the Constitution and criticized political leaders who would expand the reach of government. "I believe in America. I believe in free enterprise," he said. Romney’s campaign website has a section devoted to gun rights. It does not mention the NRA or the Massachusetts ban on assault weapons he signed as governor. Instead, it touts his work on behalf of gun owners, including extending the terms of gun licenses in Massachusetts and making replacement licenses free. "As president, Mitt will work to expand and enhance access and opportunities for Americans to hunt, shoot, and protect their families, homes and property, and he will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment," the website says. We contacted the NRA for this story but didn’t hear back. The group has not endorsed any primary candidate -- which isn’t unusual. It didn’t announce its backing of John McCain in the last election until October of 2008. But the group has made clear its goal is to defeat President Barack Obama. Christopher Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist told Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs in February 2012 that "any of these (Republican) candidates would be a lot better than this president. ... So we take any of them over this guy." Our ruling Santorum’s ad flashes a quote from Romney saying "I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association." The quote is accurate, though it omits the fact that Romney spoke those words 18 years ago and used them to describe his position on a single issue. Romney clearly has shifted his position on the issue of gun rights to align himself more closely with the NRA. For one thing, he became a member. And in campaigns subsequent to that 1994 senatorial bid, he has emphasized his work in favor of gun ownership rather than on tightening laws. But when Romney addressed the issue in 2007, he did not contradict what he said in 1994. "I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t," he told Tim Russert. What else? He signed an assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA as Massachusetts governor. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07165	"We have the highest per-pupil cost in the country."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/13/steve-oroho/sen-steve-oroho-says-new-jersey-has-nations-highes/	What’s so bad about finishing in first place? Plenty, if you’re New Jersey and per-pupil costs top those of any other state in the nation, according to State Sen. Steve Oroho (R-Dist. 24). He cited that statistic in a May 26 Star-Ledger news story about how the Legislature will fit a Supreme Court-ordered $500 million payment to New Jersey’s 31 Abbott districts in the state budget. Lawmakers have to reach an agreement before July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year, on how to spend approximately $30 billion. Oroho said in that story that he won’t vote for a budget that sends the $500 million just to the Abbott districts. "We have the highest per-pupil cost in the country," he said. "No one can say there’s not enough money in education." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether Oroho was right. The senator, a certified financial planner who serves on the Senate’s Budget and Appropriations and Economic Growth committees, told us he researched National Center for Education Statistics data going back to the 2004-05 academic year. He said his statement was based on data for 2006-07, which showed that New Jersey’s per-pupil cost -- for grades K-12 and including all school districts -- was $17,794. PolitiFact New Jersey contacted the nonpartisan National Center for Education Statistics to vet Oroho’s statistic. We studied nearly 10 years’ worth of data and found that among states, New Jersey has had the highest per-pupil cost in the nation since at least the 1999-00 school year. It’s worth noting that Washington, DC -- not a state -- had higher per-pupil costs than New Jersey from 1999-03 and from 2006-07. Cathy Clement, operations officer for the National Center for Education Statistics, explained that the center’s data comes from information reported by local jurisdictions to states, which then report the data to the U.S. Department of Education. The national center is part of the Education Department’s Institute of Education Sciences. The New Jersey Education Association, however, disputes Oroho’s claim. Spokesman Steve Baker shared with PolitiFact New Jersey the Public Education Finances: 2009 report issued May 20 by the U.S. Census Bureau. It shows that New Jersey was third in per-pupil spending for the 2008-09 year, at $16,271. New York was highest, at $18,126, followed by Washington, DC, $16,408. The National Center for Education Statistics told us the discrepancy stems from slight differences in what costs get reported and factors such as whether public charter schools are included. We also checked with the New Jersey Department of Education to see which agency’s figures they would rely on for accurate per-pupil cost data. "We often cite National Center for Education Statistics," said Alan Guenther, department spokesman. So why is education so expensive in New Jersey? Both Oroho and Baker say there are multiple factors involved. Oroho points to administrative costs and regulatory requirements as possible factors. The NJEA’s Baker, referring to the School Finance 101 blog by Bruce Baker, no relation, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University, cited special-needs programming and interventions, as well as education needs for children in poverty, as elements that contribute to per-pupil costs. Let’s return to Oroho’s statement. The senator says New Jersey has the highest per-pupil costs in the country, but admits basing that statement on data for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 school years. Still, our analysis of data from a nonpartisan arm of the U.S. Department of Education shows that among states only, New Jersey has held the title of highest per-pupil costs in the nation for nearly a decade. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, ranks New Jersey’s per-pupil spending for 2008-09 as third-highest in the nation. Therefore, we rate Oroho’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-05873	"91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college," but Marco Rubio opposes it.	true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/09/presente/most-hispanics-support-dream-act-marco-rubio-does-/	With speculation that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio may end up in the veep slot on the Republican presidential ticket, a left-leaning political group is taking out ads in Florida to say that the Hispanic vote isn’t automatically his for the taking. "Marco Rubio just might become the first Latino on the presidential ticket," the ad from Presente Action begins. "With the tea party and others attacking immigrants, does Marco Rubio stand with Latinos?" The ad goes on to juxtapose polling results against video of Rubio discussing his own political positions. The ad: "81 percent of Latinos oppose SB 1070, Arizona’s racial profiling law." Rubio: "Arizona’s going to do what’s in the best interest of the people of Arizona. They have a right to do that, and I respect that." The ad: "88 percent of Latinos support legalization for undocumented immigrants." Rubio: "I am not and I will never support -- never have and never will support -- any effort to grant blanket legalization." The ad: "91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college." Rubio: "People in the United States who are here without documents should not benefit from programs like in-state tuition." The ad concludes, "When it comes to voting for what we care about most, no somos Rubios." Translation: "We’re not Rubios," which flashes as text in English. The ad is now running on television in Florida, and Presente Action is fundraising off the ad on its website. Roberto Lovato, the group’s co-founder, told us that the ad may run nationally in the future. We’re putting one statement on our meter -- that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act and Rubio does not -- but we’ll look at the accuracy of the other claims as well. A note on methodology: We found many national polls that looked at general public opinion on these issues, and those polls included Hispanic respondents. But polls on the opinions of Hispanics as a group must have enough Hispanic respondents to be statistically valid, and most general polls do not meet this standard. However, we were able to find two major polling groups that focused on Hispanics: the Pew Hispanic Center and Latino Decisions. When we asked Presente to back up the ad’s claims, it pointed to various polls from these two groups. The Arizona law The ad says that "81 percent of Latinos oppose SB 1070, Arizona’s racial profiling law." That’s a somewhat loaded way to describe the 2010 law, which enlists local police authorities in cracking down on illegal immigration. Supporters of the law have said it seeks to avoid racial profiling. Most of the polls we found about the Arizona law dated back to 2010, the year the law was passed. Courts have blocked some of the law’s provisions from going into effect, and litigation is ongoing. Presente pointed us to a 2010 poll from Latino Decisions for the National Council of La Raza and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), two groups that opposed the law. That poll was only for Hispanics in Arizona. It found that 70 percent were strongly opposed, and another 11 percent were somewhat opposed, for a total of 81 percent. Pew Hispanic Center polled Hispanics nationwide on the issue, though, also in 2010. It found an almost identical level of opposition to the law at 79 percent. In 2011, Latino Decisions asked Hispanics nationwide if they would support state laws that would "require state and local police to check on immigration status." The poll found 56 percent strongly disapproved and 12 percent somewhat disapproved, for a total of 68 percent. That’s still strong opposition, but slightly lower than results from 2010. Legalization for undocumented immigrants The ad claimed that 88 percent of Latinos "support legalization for undocumented immigrants." The Pew Hispanic Center poll from 2011 asked the question this way: "What should be the priority for dealing with illegal immigration in the U.S. -- a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants; better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws; or both should be given equal priority?" Pew found that 46 percent supported both a path to citizenship and better border security; another 42 percent said just a path to citizenship. So a total of 88 percent supported a path to citizenship overall. Latino Decisions conducted a poll in January 2012 with Univision News and ABC. It asked what government policy should be toward undocumented immigrants. In this poll, 71 percent supported earned citizenship, 14 percent supported a guest worker program and 11 percent said undocumented immigrants should be considered felons. Adding the answers for legalization of some type, the total is 85 percent. The DREAM Act The ad said, "91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college." The DREAM Act stands for "Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors." The DREAM Act would have provided a path to permanent residency for young adults brought to the United States illegally as children. The young people would have to meet certain requirements, such as going to school or joining the military. In some states, they would qualify for in-state tuition at public universities. The Pew Hispanic Center’s 2011 poll found that 91 percent of Latinos favored the DREAM Act when it asked the question this way: "Thinking about immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children … Would you favor or oppose a law that would let these young adults become legal residents if they go to college or serve in the military for two years?" The Latino Decisions 2012 poll asked this way: "Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?" It found that 66 percent strongly supported the law, and another 19 percent somewhat supported the law, for a total of 85 percent. The margin of error for both polls was about 4 percentage points, which makes the results very close. Rubio’s views In recent months, Rubio has urged that Republicans tone down heated rhetoric on immigration policy. "The Republican Party needs to be the pro-legal immigration party," Rubio said in October. "We need to say, 'We believe in immigration, and we think it's good for America.' But it has to be orderly, a system based on law, a system that works." Still, as a U.S. senator he has opposed the federal DREAM Act and policies that could lead to citizenship for illegal immigrants. On the Arizona law, he initially expressed concern, but later said he was comfortable with changes made prior to it becoming law. We sent the ad to Rubio’s staff for comment, but we didn’t hear back. One other interesting point: Latino Decisions asked Hispanic voters in January if they would be more or less likely to vote for the Republican ticket for president if Rubio had the vice presidential spot. Nationally, 25 percent said they would be more likely to vote for the ticket, while 47 percent said it would make no difference. Another 19 percent said less likely. Florida Latinos, who are more familiar with Rubio, answered that 43 percent would be more likely to vote Republican with Rubio on the ticket, while 31 percent said it would make no difference. Another 20 percent said less likely. The ad doesn’t seem to be making electoral predictions. Rather, it seems to be making its factual points and asking viewers to draw their own conclusions. Our ruling For the Truth-O-Meter, we’re checking the claim that "91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college," while Rubio opposes the program. The Pew Hispanic Center’s polling found that to be the case, and Latino Decisions found a very similar high number of 85 percent. As a U.S. senator, Rubio has opposed the DREAM Act. We rate the ad’s statement True.	None	Presente.org	None	None	None	2012-02-09T09:00:00	2012-01-27	['Marco_Rubio']

pomt-13081	"Anyone who knows you can just" look it up to "see if you voted."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/09/amy-schumer/didnt-vote-president-youll-be-shamed-comedian-amy-/	Now that the election is over, according to comedian Amy Schumer, some Americans truly have something to fear. Public shaming. "People are going to know if you voted or not," Schumer intoned in a video posted online Nov. 3, 2016, five days before the historic presidential contest. "Your voting history is public record. It doesn’t say who you voted for, but it says if you voted at all. Anyone who knows you can just look that s*** up …. "Your decision to vote or not is obviously up to you," she added. "But judging you for that decision could be up to the Internet. And everyone has access to that. Even our parents." Schumer ended the video (which showed up in the Facebook feed of more than one Wisconsinite) with a call to vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, while making disparaging comments about the Republican nominee (and now president-elect) Donald Trump. So, Schumer doesn’t explicitly state that you can simply go online to see if someone voted. But her just-look-it-up reference makes it sound easy. Elections experts told us that, as Schumer stated, voter records generally are public records (except, of course, who you voted for). So, by and large, a person’s voting history is generally available by request. But not everywhere. And don’t expect it to be as easy as typing a name onto a website. Let’s start with Wisconsin, one of the states that, unexpectedly, helped carry Trump to victory. In Wisconsin If you know a voter’s full name and date of birth, you can search that person’s voting history on a website maintained by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. It’s super quick. But voter participation isn’t instantly recorded. For the just-ended election, local election clerks have up to 45 days to record voter participation. And if you don’t know a person’s date of birth, the look-up is more difficult. You can still make a request of the state election commission -- or at the municipal clerk’s office, if you know where the voter lives. The request can be made by mail, email, fax or in person and, depending on how busy an office is, the records are provided as quickly as possible, state elections commission spokesman Reid Magney told us. Other states In other states, accessing voting histories can be more difficult -- or, in at least one state, not allowed. To search online in Nevada, the state requires a date of birth plus either the voter’s drivers license number or the last four digits of his or her Social Security number. Alabama doesn’t offer an online search option. Secretary of State spokesman John Bennett told us that if you make the request in person, by email or via phone from his office, often the record can be provided the same day (for 1 cent per voter, a fee that can be rounded up to $1). In Virginia, however, a voter’s voting history is not a public record that is available to the general public, the Virginia Department of Elections told us. Individual voting histories are provided, for a fee, only to groups such as candidates or political groups. That being said, it’s possible to pull up a Virginia resident’s voting history online -- but at the risk of violating the state’s computer fraud law. You must click a box certifying that you are searching for your own voter record, or that you are authorized to search for someone else’s record. (Schumer's publicist didn't respond to our requests for information.) Our rating Schumer said: "Anyone who knows you can just" look it up to "see if you voted." Generally speaking, an individual’s voting history is a public record, though how easy it is to access can vary. Depending on the state, you might need information such as a date of birth to do an online search. And if you don’t have such details, you might have to make a request from a state elections office. Moreover, an individual’s voting history is not a public record in at least one state (Virginia). For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23001946-d8d0-4426-b34d-3209ac90ff47	None	Amy Schumer	None	None	None	2016-11-09T14:30:10	2016-11-03	['None']
pomt-04417	Says six studies verify that the math adds up for Mitt Romney’s tax plan.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/15/paul-ryan/ryan-says-six-studies-say-math-works-romney-tax-pl/	Mitt Romney’s tax plan plays a vital role in his economic program. He says it by itself will create seven million new jobs. He has been defending his proposal ever since economists at the Tax Policy Center -- a team with both Republican and Democratic connections -- said the numbers in Romney’s plan do not add up. The Obama campaign has relied on that study to attack Romney in television ads and on the stump. In the vice presidential debate, the moderator pressed Paul Ryan to fill in the missing details that would allow a clear assessment of what the tax changes might do. Ryan did not provide any but claimed other analysts confirm that the plan will accomplish everything it promises. "Six studies have verified that this math adds up," Ryan said. This is a claim that Romney and Ryan first made in early September, although back then, they cited five studies. We rated it Mostly False because two of the "studies" were actually Wall Street Journal editorials and one was double-counting another research paper. Since then, the campaign has dropped the two editorials and added additional research for the new claim of six studies. For this fact check, we are building on our previous work and examining the claim in light of the additional studies being cited. The basics of Romney’s plan Briefly, Romney’s plan would cut individual and corporate rates, and eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. This would put the government in the hole about $5 trillion over 10 years, but Romney would offset that by doing away with deductions, exemptions, credits and other wrinkles in the tax code that currently give people a tax break. Some of the largest ones are the home mortgage deduction and the tax-free treatment of employer health benefits. Romney is clear about the tax cuts, but is largely silent about how he would offset them with reductions in tax breaks. However, he promises that the plan will be revenue neutral and it won’t shift the tax burden from the very rich to the middle class. The six studies Before we go through the list, we should note that all of the studies, both those supporting Romney’s plan and the one from the Tax Policy Center, speculate on the details of the deductions and tax breaks that Romney would reduce or eliminate. Martin Feldstein, in the first study, says "It is impossible to calculate the exact effects of the future reforms since Gov. Romney hasn't specified what he would do." Curtis Dubay, the author of the newest study we examine, says (Romney’s) "plan would offset the revenue loss from those changes by broadening the tax base in unspecified ways." In short, all analysts must fill in the blanks. This is akin to trying on a pair of pants before both legs are done. 1 & 2. Martin Feldstein, Harvard University "Romney’s tax plan can raise revenue" and "A reply to comments" Feldstein, an adviser to the Romney campaign, uses 2009 IRS data to demonstrate that Romney can meet all his goals and not increase taxes on the middle class. First he estimates the lost revenue due to Romney’s 20 percent across the board rate cut and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Feldstein figures that would be $186 billion. Next, he looks at how much could be gained by reducing or eliminating deductions. At this point, he makes an important decision. He defines high-income as households making $100,000 or more. The Tax Policy Center sets the bar at $200,000 and anyone making less is part of the middle class. By choosing the broader definition, Feldstein has a lot more revenue to work with. In 2009, Feldstein says, the total value of itemized deductions for households making $100,000 and up was about $636 billion. By his estimate, if you eliminate those deductions, the IRS stands to gain about $191 billion. "More than enough to offset the revenue losses from the individual income tax cuts proposed by Gov. Romney," Feldstein says. Feldstein underscores that he isn’t advocating such a move. He only notes that eliminating deductions, or broadening the tax base as it is called, can net huge returns. In his second piece, Feldstein defends treating households making $100,000 or more as "high-income" because they are in the upper 20 percent of income earners. He offers more details on the tax breaks that could be reduced for this group, such as tax-free health benefits and the child tax credit. The response Feldstein’s definition of middle class is at odds with the one Mitt Romney has used. In an ABC interview, Romney said people making $200,000 or less are part of the middle class and would be protected in his plan. The Tax Policy Center notes that Feldstein needs to go after the deductions used by less affluent people -- those making between $100,000 and $200,000 -- in order to make the books balance. The center analysts also notes that this assumes these people would not be allowed to take even the basic standard deduction. The group further challenges Feldstein’s use of the 30 percent tax rate, saying a more accurate estimate is 24 percent which would leave Feldstein $70 billion short of the revenues lost through the rest of Romney’s tax cuts. (In his response, Feldstein says he could use the lower rate and still make the numbers work by going after other tax breaks.) 3. Harvey Rosen, Princeton University "Growth, distribution and tax reform: Thoughts on the Romney proposal" Rosen’s main point is that any assessment of the Romney tax plan that ignores its impact on economic growth is incomplete. "This is curious," Rosen said, "because increasing growth is the motivation for the proposal in the first place." Growth creates more income for the government to tax which would help offset the revenues lost through rate cuts. Rosen readily admits that no one can accurately predict the future so he runs the numbers using three growth rates for GDP - 3 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent. By comparison, the White House budget planners assume an average rate of close to 3 percent. Like Feldstein, he used 2009 data. Unlike Feldstein, he analyzed what happens for taxpayers making $100,000 and up, and then repeated it for those making $200,000 and up. Rosen found that when all possible deductions are eliminated, from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits, it means that increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax cuts. There is only one scenario where Rosen saw a wrinkle -- when households making less than $200,000 are shielded from the loss of deductions under certain tax and growth assumptions. Rosen saw a $28 billion gap and said "maintaining an approximately constant tax burden on high-income individuals would be more challenging." But not "mathematically impossible." The response The criticism that the Tax Policy Center failed to account for growth is incorrect. William Gale, one of the center’s economists who was on the Council of Economic Advisers for President George H.W. Bush, says the team specifically tested their results using different assumptions of economic growth. "Incorporating the growth effects did not change the conclusion," Gale said. The center said groups including the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation take a cautious approach on assuming that tax changes alone will lead to new growth. This is particularly true when tax cuts are combined with base-broadening, which lies at the heart of the Romney plan. Both Rosen and Feldstein use 2009 data. Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley, said 2009 presents problems for analysts. 2009 was the bottom of the recession. In pure dollar amounts, upper income households saw huge investment losses in 2008. When the stock market recovered, they offset those gains with losses from the year before. In 2009, they had less income that would benefit from the lower rates Romney proposes. Accordingly, the cost of a tax cut would be smaller and so would the amount you would need to pick up by getting rid of tax deductions and other tax breaks as Romney has said he wants. Auerbach said 2009 would be a relatively easy year to make the numbers work. 4. Matt Jensen, American Enterprise Institute, "How the Tax Policy Center could improve its Romney tax study" Jensen challenges the Tax Policy Center findings on two fronts. First, he said it should have considered the elimination of two tax breaks that the center’s analysts said "were off the table." One is the interest on state and local bonds; the other is interest on life insurance policies. "Both of these exclusions largely benefit the wealthy," Jensen said. "Added together their repeal would net upwards of $90 billion that could be redistributed to lower-income individuals." Jensen called his analysis "nothing if not rough." Jensen also said the center’s definition of who is high-income is arbitrary. Rather than declare everyone over $200,000 as high income, he suggested the center show the lowest income level at which the Romney plan would work out mathematically. The response The Tax Policy Center challenged Jensen’s "rough" number. It said a more accurate figure would be $25 billion. 5. Alex Brill, American Enterprise Institute, "The Romney tax plan: Not a tax hike on the middle class" Brill also faults the Tax Policy Center for ignoring the impact of growth, but he has three specific criticisms. He says the center made mistakes in how it dealt with taxes related to the health care reform law and gains made on insurance policies. Brill also says the center ignored the option to tax earnings from state and local bonds. The total value of these changes, Brill says, brings the Romney plan within $12 billion of balancing out. The response As with the other studies, Brill is off the mark in saying the Tax Policy Center ignored the impact of growth. On his specific criticisms, he finds support for two of them from Josh Barro, a columnist with Bloomberg News who agrees that the Obamacare taxes and life insurance gains should be folded into the picture. But on state and local bonds, Barro disagrees. He says Brill has exaggerated the potential money in this pot. Brill said it would be $20 billion. Barro says only about $5 billion of that goes to bondholders. Following the cash gets complicated very quickly but bottom line, Barro warns that if these bonds are not tax free, then state and local governments would pay more to borrow money. "A key effect would be state and local governments raising taxes (mostly not on the wealthy) to pay higher interest costs," Barro wrote. 6. Curtis Dubay, Heritage Foundation, "The Tax Policy Center’s skewed analysis of Governor Romney’s tax plan" Dubay relies on three of the studies already listed, from Feldstein, Rosen and Jensen, but adds a new criticism of the Tax Policy Center study. Dubay says the center failed to make adjustment what is called the "step-up in basis" from inherited assets. Take the example of inheriting stock from your mother. Under Romney’s plan, there would be no estate tax. If you sold the stock, you would owe taxes on any profit. That profit, Dubay says, should be based on the value of the stock when your mother bought it, not its value when you inherited it. The difference is called a "step-up" and getting rid of it makes a lot more money taxable. The Tax Policy Center did not count on this, producing a "critical error" that "significantly biases" the results, Dubay says. He estimated the value at $19 billion. The response Gale with the Tax Policy Center says Dubay’s change would not generate the revenues he predicts for two reasons. First, not all the inherited property would be sold and for any that wasn’t, no tax would be collected. Second, Dubay uses the current tax rates to calculate the tax collections, but Romney would cut those rates and so the amount of revenues would drop. Our ruling Ryan said that six studies verify that the numbers in the Romney tax plan add up. Hearing that, you might think that each is independent research. But not all studies are created equal and these come from people or groups with ties to Romney. Two of those studies come from Feldstein, a Romney campaign adviser. Three come from conservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute, which have analysts who advise the Romney campaign. While every analyst would insist that they make their own judgments, the Tax Policy Center is fully independent of the Obama campaign. The studies from Feldstein and Rosen use 2009 data. That was an abnormal year and one that made it easier to make the math work for the Romney plan. The analysts could have chosen other years but decided not to. Of the studies that examine the middle class tax burden, none shows conclusively that households making less than $200,000 would be spared a tax increase. That is a group of taxpayers that Romney defines as middle class and says he would protect. None of the studies can accurately model Romney’s tax plan because he has said so little about how he would pay for it. As a result, all of them make assumptions as to what tax breaks might be reduced. They can speak in rough terms about a concept, but they can not verify a plan when no detailed plan exists. We see no more than one fully independent study out of the six claimed. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-10-15T18:09:49	2012-10-11	['None']

pomt-02748	Iran President Hassan "Rouhani has more Cabinet members with Ph.D.s from American universities" than members of Barack Obama’s Cabinet.	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/16/bob-schieffer/bob-schieffer-says-iran-president-hassan-rouhani-h/	Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is seen as a moderate more willing to engage the West, in part because of the backgrounds of his closest advisers. Unlike brash, hard-lined predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Rouhani nominated several cabinet members with advanced degrees from other countries -- a fact that surfaced during a discussion on the Iranian nuclear deal moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS’ Face the Nation. "I was very interested that I read, I think it was in The Atlantic, that Rouhani has more cabinet members with Ph.D.s from American universities, he has more of those in his cabinet than President (Barack) Obama does," Schieffer said at the Dec. 9, 2013, forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Intrigued by the point, we wanted to know if it was true. Just days earlier, The Atlantic published "The Case for Giving Iran's Scholar-Diplomats a Chance" by contributing editor Moisés Naím, a senior associate in international economics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. His column began with exactly the information we were looking for: Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, has more cabinet members with Ph.D. degrees from U.S. universities than Barack Obama does. In fact, Iran has more holders of American Ph.D.s in its presidential cabinet than France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, or Spain — combined. What’s the significance? The cabinet of scholars could launch a new chapter in Iran’s typically troubled relations with western countries and negotiations over its nuclear program -- or not, Naím wrote, since the country’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, ultimately calls the shots. "But compared to the kind of people that Ahmadinejad had in his cabinet, they were a very different kind of crowd," Naím told PunditFact by phone. "So one would expect people with American Ph.D.s to be more sophisticated, more integrated in the world." His piece singled out three Iranian cabinet officials from the 30-position body with American degrees. PunditFact verified each of the following officials graduated from these American universities: Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, Rouhani’s chief of staff, was awarded a Ph.D. in economics on Jan. 30, 1994, from George Washington University. Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country’s foreign affairs minister, completed his Ph.D. in international law and politics at the University of Denver in 1988. Zarif, who was the lead negotiator in the nuclear deal, was Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations based in New York. Ali Akbar Salehi, a vice president and head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, earned a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1977. Several other members of Rouhani’s Cabinet graduated from universities in Europe, according to Naím’s piece. His minister of information and communications technology, Mahmoud Vaezi, enrolled at a doctoral program at Louisiana State University after studying at other American schools but ended up finishing his Ph.D. in international relations at Warsaw University in Poland. Even Rouhani earned a doctorate from Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, and several other members have advanced degrees from Iranian universities. Rouhani’s cabinet has an important role in preparing policy and budgets, but it’s not all that powerful because decisions can be overruled by the supreme leader’s office and the Guardian Council, which is appointed by the supreme leader and considers legislation, said Alex Vatanka, an expert on Iran at the Middle East Institute. The U.S. Cabinet does not face similar wildcards, he said. "There is no sort of element of surprise in the middle of it with one of the priests coming from nearby churches saying, ‘No, no, this is ungodly and shouldn’t be done’," Vatanka said. "The cabinet has been a way for the president to cautiously advance a reform agenda in Iran," said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He pointed out that another Rouhani adviser who is not in the cabinet, Mahmood Sariolghalam, earned a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California. How does Obama’s Cabinet compare? There are a couple of ways of looking at Obama’s Cabinet, and neither measure produces more doctoral degrees from American universities than the three we confirmed in Iran. The U.S. cabinet is stacked with lawyers, which is pretty typical. The advisory group includes Vice President Joe Biden and the leaders of 15 executive agencies. Of those, just one has an American Ph.D. Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary, has no fewer than four honorary degrees. The one that counts for our purpose is his doctorate in theoretical physics from Stanford University. If you expand the pool to include seven more Cabinet-rank officials listed on the same White House page, you find another doctorate. That’s Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University (as well as master’s degrees in government from Harvard and in economics from the London School of Economics). Our ruling Bob Schieffer referenced an Atlantic piece when he said Rouhani’s cabinet has more members with Ph.D.s from American universities than Obama’s. While we could not nail down the academic background of each member of Iran’s cabinet, we found enough members with verifiable degrees -- three -- to deem his statement accurate. Obama has two, including one official with Cabinet-rank. What it all means for international relations remains to be seen. We rate Schieffer’s statement True.

pomt-00526	"Between 2010 and 2014, there was no net in-migration from Mexico."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/22/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-zero-net-migration-mexico-2010/	Among the more inflammatory words out of Donald Trump’s mouth during his kick-off speech were the ones about Mexico. "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best," Trump said as he announced his White House bid. "They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems (to) us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." That last phrase hardly counterbalanced the rest. Mexican officials took serious offense. The interior minister said the charge was absurd and prejudiced, and that it served only to generate controversy. The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart had a go at Trump with former President Bill Clinton on June 17, 2015. Clinton: "What he said about the Mexicans, which was …" Stewart: "Bizarre." Clinton: "Not only that, just wrong. Basically between 2010 and 2014, there was no net in-migration from Mexico. That surprise you all? All we read about is the violence and the drug war. The truth is that the previous president built 140 tuition free universities. Two years ago, the Mexicans produced 113,000 engineers. We produced 120,000. They’ve had very brisk growth, and except in the narco-centers, the crime rate, the murder rate has gone down. It’s a very interesting country." There’s plenty of interesting statistics there, but we’ll focus just on the one about zero net in-migration. We asked the Clinton Foundation for the data behind that claim but didn’t hear back. Still, we were able to reach experts who were able to walk us through the numbers. One way to measure net migration (the number of new arrivals versus the number who leave) is the count of people living in America who were born in Mexico. The Census Bureau tracks this. We used two sets of numbers from the American Community Survey -- an estimate based on three years of surveys and an estimate based on just the year the survey took place. Year Born in Mexico 3-year average estimate (1,000s) 1-year estimate (1,000s) 2013 11,604 11,585 2012 11,650 11,563 2011 11,700 11,673 2010 11,642 11,711 Source: American Community Survey While there’s a little variation, both estimates show a drop from 2010 to 2013. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us that the Mexican-born figures are a valid indicator of the overall trend. "This strongly implies zero net (migration)," Camarota said. Another researcher, Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute, echoed that point. What about 2014? That’s the end point for Clinton’s comparison, but finalized numbers aren’t out yet. To get a sense of what the numbers might say, Camarota dug into the raw monthly counts from the Current Population Survey. These figures are less reliable, but they too show a consistent decline for Mexicans living in the United States in each of the first quarters of 2012 through 2014. (Camarota did find a rise in the first quarter of 2015, but that is outside Clinton’s window.) We should note that using a population count isn’t a perfect yardstick. In theory, a higher death rate could drive the numbers down, but that’s unlikely. First, it would be headline news if thousands of people started dying like that. Second, Rosenblum noted that Mexican immigrants tend to be in their prime working years and younger people are healthier. A more complete study of net migration from Mexico came out in 2012. The Pew Research Center reported back then that based on census data from both sides of the border, from 2005 to 2010, more people moved from America to Mexico than the reverse. That study raised the possibility that the net migration rate wasn’t just zero -- it might actually be negative. Rosenblum thinks that’s probably still true because some factors behind the shift show no sign of letting up. In short, Clinton is right on the general trend experts agree, though we don’t yet have the numbers for 2014 to completely confirm his point. Four reasons for the decline Demographics is possibly the biggest driver of the change in migration. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990 and now stands at 2.2 children per woman. Rosenblum said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. "In the 1980s, there was a surge of teenagers," Rosenblum said. "With the birth rate having been down for several decades, we’re now seeing many fewer Mexicans entering the prime working age group." Rosenblum said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop of more than 50 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped over half a million people coming in from Mexico. Last year, it was about 230,000. Not all of those people were Mexican, but the numbers are in line with the picture Clinton paints. Rosenblum also believes that more surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect. "All that enforcement has begun to pay off," he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling Clinton said that between 2010 and 2014, there was zero net in-migration from Mexico. The census data to prove that is not in for 2014, but the numbers up to 2013 support his point, as do very preliminary 2014 data.The population of people living in America but born in Mexico fell by about 40,000 since 2010. That’s not a perfect measure, but the experts we reached said it is a strong indication of a prevailing trend. The experts we reached said that other data, including a rapid decline in apprehensions at the border and changing demographics in Mexico add weight to the conclusion that Clinton was correct. With a caveat for the missing year of survey information, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2015-06-22T12:09:47	2015-06-17	['Mexico']

pomt-07894	"We currently have one guy who is in charge of painting the entire Milwaukee County parks system."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/04/jim-sullivan/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jim-sullivan-/	Jim Sullivan, one of five candidates running for Milwaukee County executive, said in an interview that in privatizing county services "we’ve gone about far enough." The former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa noted that an arbitrator had recently ordered the county to rehire courthouse security guards. Under then-County Executive Scott Walker, the guards had been laid off and replaced with private guards in an effort to save money. Sullivan also cited what he described as another example of bad privatization. "It’s been brought to my attention we currently have one guy who is in charge of painting the entire Milwaukee County parks system," he told the Journal Sentinel on Jan. 31, 2011. "You hear the expression ‘busier than a one-armed paper hanger’ and this guy’s got to be a really busy guy." Sullivan went on to say that if the county hired more employees to paint, they would be less expensive and more responsive than painters hired on contract. The question of public vs private painters is its own issue. Privatization of various county services was a priority for Walker, who clashed with the County Board over his efforts but did privatize janitorial services, projecting it would save $2.6 million. What stopped us about Sullivan’s comment was this: Is there really just one guy in charge of all the painting for the more than 140 county parks? Gillian Morris, Sullivan’s campaign aide, said Sullivan was told about the lone county parks painter by John Jorgensen, business manager of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades AFL-CIO. So we turned to him. Jorgensen said that for years, the county has been eliminating trade positions such as painters and carpenters. He said the only county painter left in the parks system is one of his union members, Tim Hanson. So we found Hanson. It turns out Hanson, 50, also happens to hold the part-time position of Wauwatosa alderman. A county employee since 1988, he said he’s been the parks’ only painter for two years, ever since the county stopped using apprentice painters. As a result, Hanson said, most of his time is spent on a priority job: graffiti patrol. "I’m removing more paint than I’m applying," he said. Hanson may be the only county staffer assigned to do painting in the parks. But he is not the only person with a brush and a roller there. Some paint jobs are contracted out to painters from private companies, some painting is done privately as part of larger renovation projects and painting is also done by partners such as the Bartolotta Restaurants, which operates Lake Park Bistro, according to Parks Director Sue Black. In addition, when Hanson is off, some of the county’s seven public works painters pitch in, said Public Works Director Jack Takerian. But overall, the majority of painting work in the parks is done by Hanson, according to Jim Keegan, the parks system’s chief of administration. OK, we’ve painted you a picture. Let’s assess Sullivan’s statement. The would-be county executive claimed there’s only "one guy who is in charge of painting the entire Milwaukee County parks system." He’s the one as busy as that one-armed paper hanger. That comment was a pretty broad brush, since there may only be one full-time painter, but the parks use many private ones. Sullivan’s claim was accurate, but leaves out important details. That’s the PolitiFact definition for Half True. And that’s our rating.

pomt-00491	"There is a big correlation between third grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third grade reading level."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/aug/07/jeff-greene/greenes-third-grade-statistics-mostly-hold/	With the Florida governor’s Democratic primary set for Aug. 28, Jeff Greene has made education a vital piece of his platform. In a July 29 interview, Greene said, "There is a big correlation between third-grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now, only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third-grade reading level." It’s spooky to imagine that the performance of an eight-year-old could predict their destiny more than a decade later. We decided to see if Greene’s statistics held up. Correlation between reading level and college A 2010 study by the University of Chicago found that third-grade reading level can be a powerful predictor of future academic success. Researchers tracked thousands of students in the Chicago Public School system from third grade through their high school graduations. The students took a test in the third grade that measured their reading ability and compared their results with national scores. Students who scored lower than 75 percent of third graders nationwide were defined as "below grade level." Among students who read below grade level in third grade, only 45 percent graduated high school in five years. Graduation rates were much higher for students who read at grade-level (60 percent) and above grade level (80 percent). The study controlled for demographic factors, so researchers could examine the correlation between test scores and graduation rates without worrying that race or poverty were influencing the results. Though the variables are correlated -- which means a change in one is connected to a change in the other -- the connection is not causal. Low third grade test scores are not causing kids to dropout of high school. Likewise, students who read at or below grade level in third grade were significantly less likely to attend college than their peers. Only about 20 percent of below-grade-level students attended college, whereas roughly a third of at grade-level students did. Nearly 60 percent of above-grade-level readers attended college. Reading level and prison There are no studies that directly connect third-grade reading level to incarceration, so the Greene campaign connected it by a two-step process. As noted in the Chicago study, and backed up by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Georgia governor’s office, students who score below grade level on third grade reading tests are less likely to graduate. Then, there are studies that show high school dropouts are more likely to go to prison. A study from Northeastern University showed that a man with a high school degree had a 1 in 33 chance of incarceration. For a high school dropout, that rate rose to 1 in 10. So, the Greene campaign argues, students who read below grade-level in third grade tend not to graduate high school, and people who don’t graduate high school tend to have higher incarceration rates. Katharine Abraham, director of the University of Maryland Center for Economics and Public Policy, said this conclusion "seems plausible but doesn’t necessarily follow from the cited facts." The term "correlation" implies that two variables are related, and that one will change alongside the other. One can not assume that because variables A and B are related, and B and C are related, A is also correlated to C. For example, there might be a correlation between higher temperatures and sunny days. There might also be a correlation between sunny days and the number of people who get sunburned. However, this does not mean there is a direct correlation between higher temperatures and sunburns. When asked if it would be accurate to say test scores are correlated to incarceration, Abraham said, "It might well be true, but you can't logically draw that inference." The "56 percent" Greene also said that only 56 percent of kids in Florida are coming out of third grade at the appropriate reading level. He had more concrete data to back up this claim. He was referring to the results of the most recent administration of the Florida Standards Assessments, which were released in May 2018. The Florida Standards Assessments, or FSA, are a suite of standardized tests that Florida public schools students in grades 3-10 take yearly. They include mathematics exams as well as reading and writing exams. Students’ results on the FSA are classified into five groups, the lowest being Level 1 and highest being Level 5. Level 3 or higher means the student is reading at grade level or above. The spring 2018 results of the English Language Arts (ELA) Grade 3 Reading Exam show that 57 percent of third grade students scored at Level 3 or above. So Greene actually undersold his point. The statistic he was referring to kept track of students reading at or above grade level, not just those reading at grade level. Our ruling Greene said, "There is a big correlation between third grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third grade reading level." Studies have shown that there are correlations between elementary school reading proficiency, high school graduation, and college attendance. There are also studies which show a correlation between high school dropout rates and incarceration. However, experts say that you can’t assume a direct correlation between reading scores and prison rates based on this data alone. Greene claimed that "there is a big correlation between third grade reading level … and whether you go to prison." This might be true, but we cannot know for sure. In addition, the results from the 2018 administration of the Florida Standards Assessments show that only 57 percent of third graders pass the reading test at or above grade level. So Greene is correct on that point. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jeff Greene	None	None	None	2018-08-07T14:40:48	2018-07-29	['None']

pomt-07808	"Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/17/mitch-daniels/mitch-daniels-says-interest-debt-will-soon-exceed-/	Budget season in Washington often brings out colorful comparisons designed to highlight economic folly. Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana offered one in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 11, 2011. Speaking at the CPAC Ronald Reagan Centennial Dinner, Daniels likened the mounting national debt to a foreign invader -- a "new Red Menace, this time consisting of ink." The possible presidential candidate then declared that servicing that debt will soon cost more than national security: "We are currently borrowing the entire defense budget from foreign investors," Daniels told conservative conference-goers. "Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security. That is not, as our military friends say, a ‘robust strategy.’" We decided to do the math on that striking comparison for ourselves. As is often the case, different definitions can change the budget picture dramatically -- though not enough to make Daniels’ claim hold up. The White House’s newly released budget seemed like a good place to start. Handily, it divides discretionary spending into security-related outlays (including Defense, Homeland Security and ongoing wars) and everything else. Projected security spending rises from $815 billion in 2010 to $914 billion in 2021. (It dips slightly along the way, reflecting savings from planned troop reductions in Iraq and Afghanistan.) Meanwhile the budget has net interest payments rising fourfold, from $196 billion last year to a stunning $844 billion by 2021. As two budget analysts we interviewed confirmed, interest payments will grow explosively over the next decade but do not exceed security spending in any given year -- much less "in a few years." Of course White House budget proposals are just that, proposals, so we ran the comparison again using the Congressional Budget Office’s latest baseline forecasts. Daniels did a little better here, because the CBO’s measure of discretionary "defense" spending excludes Homeland Security and several other budget lines. Still, defense spending topped interest payments through 2021. Is there any way to make Daniels’ math add up? If you limit "national security" spending to the Department of Defense budget -- an extremely narrow definition -- then interest payments pull ahead in 2017 (or perhaps in 2016, since outlays usually fall short of budget authority). Another possibility would be to apply a worst-case scenario to the U.S. debt forecast, explained Josh Gordon, policy director with the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. If federal spending isn’t restrained at all, and if Bush-era tax cuts become permanent, by 2021 interest payments might sneak past national defense. "But that’s an odd position for a Republican presidential candidate to take," Gordon said. In a follow-up e-mail he explained that "for Daniels to assume discretionary spending rises at 3 percent a year over ten years means he is assuming Republicans will have no effect on the levels of government spending over the next ten years, or even that they will encourage Obama to spend more than he is proposing to spend in his budget." When we asked Gov. Daniels’ office to explain his reasoning, a spokesperson pointed out that the current defense budget "is close to $700 billion," and that by the end of the decade, under White House estimates, "we will be paying $700 billion a year" to service the national debt. She directed us to a Nov. 24, 2009, piece in the Washington Examiner making a similar point. But that’s hardly "in a few years" -- and more important, it compares apples today to oranges a decade from now. This mathematical sleight-of-hand was not disclosed in Daniels' speech. So he is incorrect that "within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security." It is true that interest on the national debt will grow faster than any other category of federal spending, even Medicare. But the comparison Daniels drew to illustrate that falls short under any reasonable definition of "national security" spending. We rate his statement False.

pomt-12124	"There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. ... There’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/16/roy-moore/alabamas-roy-moore-says-whole-communities-midwest-/	On the eve of his first-place finish in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, Roy Moore -- a former Alabama judge who advocated for the display of the Ten Commandments -- attracted some attention for a comment he made about Muslim Sharia law. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation. Some commentators, particularly on the right, have warned that Sharia poses a threat to the United States’ legal system. But PolitiFact has debunked a string of claims about the influence of Sharia law (or aspects of it) in the United States, including by retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who became President Donald Trump’s short-lived national security adviser. Moore made his comments during a campaign stop to meet with members of the pro-gun group BamaCarry Inc. There, reporter Jeff Stein of the website Vox.com asked him, "Some right-wing conservatives think Sharia law is a danger to America -- do you?" Moore responded, "There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don’t know if they may be Muslim communities. But Sharia law is a little different from American law. It is founded on religious concepts." Stein pressed Moore to name the communities under Sharia law. He responded, "Well, there’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know." Later in the interview, Stein tried again, asking Moore to be specific and name which communities he was referring to. Moore said, "I was informed that there were. But if they’re not, it doesn’t matter. Sharia law incorporates Muslim law into the law. That’s not what we do. We do not punish people according to the Christian precepts of our faith -- so there’s a difference." So are there really entire communities that ignore U.S. law and operate instead under Sharia law? We found zero evidence of it. (We did not hear back from the Moore campaign.) The office of the Illinois attorney general told PolitiFact that there are "no communities under Sharia law" in the state. Experts were equally dubious. "Seriously, I've never heard of any such thing," said Nathan J. Brown, director of George Washington University’s Institute for Middle East Studies and a specialist on the rule of law in the Arab world. "I suspect the only accurate part of his statement is when he confesses, ‘I don't know.’ " Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na‘im, an Emory University law professor, was equally skeptical. "I have not seen evidence of entire communities being run by Sharia law anywhere in the United States," An-Na‘im said. In fact, "it is legally impossible for any community anywhere in the United States to be ‘under Sharia law’ simply because for that to happen, Sharia law must be enacted as the law of the state, and that is unconstitutional under the First Amendment." Specifically, the First Amendment "allows for accommodation but not establishment," said Cyra Akila Choudhury, a law professor at Florida International University. "So, private groups may choose to abide by religious law, such as Jews who abide by judgments made by rabbinical courts and Muslims who might abide by a decision made by their Sharia council or imam. But to assert that Sharia is being enforced by the state is entirely incorrect." That exception -- the use of religious law to settle intra-community disputes between consenting parties, outside of the United States legal system -- is sometimes a source of confusion for critics of Sharia law, experts said. "If Muslims choose to abide by Sharia as a private matter with regard to the practice of their religion, it is protected by the Constitution insofar as the practice does not contravene the laws of the land," Choudhury said. "So, for example, Sharia principles of criminal law would not be given accommodation. Or, if you marry in the United States, your religious ceremony may not be recognized unless you have a state license and conform to the state's requirements." Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, agreed that his group knows of no such Sharia-ruled communities. Making such a suggestion, he added, "feeds into the fear that Muslims are attempting to impose their laws on others in our country. Individual Muslims and their families may voluntarily observe Sharia-related rituals, but this is no different from Jews or Christians living their lives in accordance with the dictates of their own religious traditions." Tuchman suggested that Moore might have been mistakenly referring to a satirical column published in the Daily Beast in 2015. The column, written by Muslim-American radio host and comedian Dean Obeidallah, was headlined, "Next, We Muslims Bring Sharia to Indiana." It poked fun at Indiana, which was facing criticism for a new religious-liberty law signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president. In the column, Obeidallah jokingly floated ways that Muslims could take advantage of a law that was mostly supported by conservative Christians. "Some might be asking, could Muslims really impose Sharia law in some fashion in Indiana -- turning Indiana into a mini Muslim caliphate?" he wrote. "Well, the Indiana law doesn’t just provide ‘religious liberty’ for Christians. It provides ‘liberty’ for all faiths, and that includes us Muslims. … There are now so many things we can do in Indiana that we are not able to do in the rest of America," from taking more than one wife to requiring that restaurants institute halal-compliant rules. When we brought Moore’s comments to Obeidallah’s attention, he responded, "LOL." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Moore said, "There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. ... There’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana — up there. I don't know." After checking with multiple experts, we found no evidence of such a community.

pomt-12716	"The son-in-law of the president met with Russian officials at the Trump Tower after having them come in the back door."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/08/mark-pocan/russian-officials-went-back-door-trump-tower-meet-/	U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan says questions about possible ties between President Donald Trump and Russia must be answered before Congress can take up issues such as the Affordable Care Act and tax reform. Making his points in a March 3, 2017, Wisconsin Public Television interview, the Madison-area Democrat also made a Russia-related claim about Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior adviser in his administration, that we want to check. The claim came during this exchange between Pocan and Frederica Freyberg, host of the talk show "Here and Now:" Pocan: When a country like Russia comes in and interferes with our elections, that should bother everybody. And I give people like John McCain and others credit, because they’re saying that. But the fact that Donald Trump acts like nothing happened, makes me even more suspicious of how much he knows and when he knew about it. Freyberg: What about other people across the aisle, your peers, are they taking this as seriously as you are? Pocan: More and more are, as more of this information comes out. So, I think at first, they also were told, Oh, there’s nothing here to look at, nothing here to look at. But now you find out the son-in-law of the president met with Russian officials at the Trump Tower after having them come in the back door. Did Kushner meet with Russian officials at Trump Tower who came in the back door? The evidence Pocan’s office pointed us to a New York Times news article published the day before Pocan’s interview. It reported that the White House said Kushner had taken part in a meeting with one Russian official. According to the Times: In December 2016, Michael Flynn, who at the time was Trump’s incoming national security adviser, and Kushner met at Trump Tower with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. The purpose was to establish a line of communication between the new administration and the Russian government. Flynn appears to have been "the main interlocutor with the Russian envoy — the two were in contact during the campaign and the transition, Kislyak and current and former American officials have said." "They generally discussed the relationship and it made sense to establish a line of communication," said White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks. "Jared has had meetings with many other foreign countries and representatives — as many as two dozen other foreign countries’ leaders and representatives." "It is common and not improper for transition officials to meet with foreign officials," the Times article said. "But all meetings between Trump associates and Russians are now significant as the FBI investigates Russian interference in the American election and whether anyone close to Trump’s campaign was involved." Kushner’s attendance at the meeting was first reported by the New Yorker magazine. The White House also confirmed the meeting to other news media. Pocan’s office also cited a news article in The Telegraph, a British newspaper, that said the Russian diplomat "reportedly" entered Trump Tower for the meeting by a back entrance. We found a few claims and assumptions that the ambassador entered the building by a rear entrance, but no definitive reports that that was the case. Our rating Pocan said Kushner "met with Russian officials at the Trump Tower after having them come in the back door." It’s been confirmed that Kushner and Flynn met with the Russian ambassador in December 2016 at Trump Tower, but not confirmed that the ambassador entered through a back door of the tower.

pomt-04398	Says Barack Obama has pension investments that include Chinese firms, and "investments through a Caymans trust."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-also-has-investments-chinese-com/	One of the many tense moments in the second presidential debate turned on a new topic in the race: President Barack Obama’s pension account. Here’s how it came up: Early in the face-off, Obama scoffed at Mitt Romney’s pledge to crack down on unfair trading practices by China, saying Romney is currently invested in companies "that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks." Romney later explained that, yes, he understands that his blind trust has invested in foreign firms, including companies in China. Then he confronted Obama. Romney: "Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension?" Obama: "You know, I don’t look at my pension. It’s not as big as yours so it doesn’t take as long. I don’t check it that often." Romney: "Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust." The exchange was a role reversal: An Obama campaign ad in July 2012 claimed Romney had millions in the Cayman Islands, among other "tax havens." We rated that True, noting that nothing was illegal or improper about the investments through his blind trust. We also reviewed an Obama claim from an ad in September 2012 that said, "Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China." We rated that Mostly True, noting that Romney had money invested in funds that owned shares in two Chinese firms, but that Obama’s claim suggested Romney had more to do with the investment decision than is the case. (We further noted that the New York Times reported that one of the funds had invested in a Chinese video surveillance company that supplies cameras to police for watching public spaces.) Okay, so what about Romney’s debate description of Obama’s pension investments? The Romney campaign told us it was referring to investments made by the Illinois State Board of Investment on behalf of the state employees’ retirement system there. Obama, you may recall, was an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004 before winning election to the U.S. Senate. He is a participant in the General Assembly Retirement System in Illinois, said William Atwood, executive director of the Board of Investment, who confirmed that for us. The Romney campaign pointed us to that pension fund’s holding in an entity that is part of Advent International. Advent has described itself as "one of the world’s most global private equity firms" and has buyout offices in 16 countries. Atwood confirmed that the pension fund has invested $30 million in one of Advent’s limited partnerships, Advent International GPE VI-A. That partnership was organized in the Cayman Islands, Atwood said. Public filings back that up. What about Romney’s broader claims, about Obama’s foreign investments? The Illinois pension fund also has numerous foreign investments, including in Chinese companies, as part of its diversified portfolio, Atwood said. The Obama campaign has connected Romney’s overseas investments in the Caymans to methods for avoiding U.S. taxes. But there’s no evidence Obama receives any tax advantage from his overseas pension investments. David S. Miller, a tax attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP in New York, reviewed public filings by Advent and said it was highly unlikely Obama got any tax advantage from the pension fund’s investment in the Advent partnership. Atwood went further, saying: "There is no tax advantage to any (pension) plan participant" from that investment. Miller offered this analysis: "There is no evidence that the fund helped the Illinois pension fund avoid any taxes – in this respect, the Illinois pension fund would have been treated identically had the fund been organized as a domestic (U.S.) partnership. However, the fact that it was organized as a Cayman partnership might have allowed some taxable investors to defer some tax on foreign (non-U.S.) portfolio companies purchased by the Fund." Atwood emphasized that neither Obama nor any other participant in the retirement system has anything to do with selecting investments for the fund. Miller concurred with that, and added that Romney legitimately can claim that he has similar distance from foreign investments made through his individual retirement accounts. It’s "entirely accurate" for Romney to say that Obama’s pension plan has investments in foreign companies and through a Caymans trust, Miller said. Technically, it’s a Cayman-based partnership, but that’s a trivial difference, he added. Our rating Romney told Obama: "You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust." It’s an accurate set of statements when you consider investments made by managers of the Illinois pension fund in which Obama has an account. As we noted in reviewing previous claims about Romney’s investments in China, the investments involved are indirect and -- as far as anybody has said -- made without the knowledge of the account holder. With that clarification, we rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-17T17:50:03	2012-10-16	['Cayman_Islands', 'China']

pomt-08979	"Forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/16/marco-rubio/marco-rubios-favorite-statistic/	Conservative champion Marco Rubio has declared war on President Barack Obama's spending habits. He blasts the growing deficit, vulnerable entitlement programs and congressional earmarks on network interviews and at whistle stops across the state. He unveiled a spending plan that calls for making President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, ending the inheritance tax and nixing a value-added tax. And, in one of his most reliable lines, Rubio links the federal budget to his offspring's economic future. "Forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children," he told Fox News on June 28, 2010. "I think that's outrageous. We have to stop doing that." Rubio repeated the claim at an event just outside of St. Petersburg on July 13: "Forty cents of every dollar the federal government spends is borrowed from my children's and your children's and grandchildren's generation. No Americans before have ever done that — not at this perverse level, not at this sustained rate." Given that Rubio's budget beef has become the heart of his Tea Party-esque stump speech, we wondered whether the father of four was using hard numbers or pushing some kind of GOP fairy tale. The Rubio campaign directed us to an Associated Press article published in the New York Times on Feb. 4, 2010: "The House voted Thursday to allow the government to go $1.9 trillion deeper in debt, an increase of about $6,000 for every United States resident. The accumulated debt already amounts to roughly $40,000 per person. The debt increase, approved 217 to 212, is only enough to keep the government afloat for about another year as it borrows more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends." "This was a widely reported stat," said campaign spokesman Alex Burgos. The Associated Press report doesn't cite a source, but a quick review of the White House's budget summaries shows Rubio's 40 percent claim is as authentic as a 24-pack of Silly Bandz. The White House spent $3.5 trillion during the 2009-2010 fiscal year, of which $1.4 trillion could not be paid for, creating a deficit of exactly 40 percent. Policy and economic experts confirmed that the numbers in the White House's budget summary are a credible source. "They may have actually got that figure from me," said Brian Riedl, the Heritage Foundation's lead budget analyst who has discussed the 40 percent figure in various media reports. "It's solid, basic math. It just calculates the deficit as a percentage of total spending." Everyone we spoke with said the deficit will eventually need to be trimmed -- and soon. But, Rubio's larger point -- that the deficit is bad policy -- was largely debated. "The reason the deficit is so big right now is because we have a massive economic meltdown and deficit spending is appropriate," said Elliott Parker, a University of Nevada Reno economics professor Parker opposes Rubio's spending plan. "This is politics at its silliest," Parker said. "You cannot simultaneously make Bush’s tax cuts permanent and deal with the federal deficit, unless you are willing to severely cut Social Security and Medicare." Leonard Burman, a Syracuse University public affairs professor and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at the Department of the Treasury, also cautioned against using current deficit figures as a rallying call. The White House's budget predicts the deficit will fall to 33 percent in 2011, 22 percent in 2012 and 17 percent by 2015 under current policy. However, Burman, like Rubio, expressed concern that Obama has not taken more forceful actions to decrease the deficit. One of Obama's high-profile solutions was to form a debt commission, which is due to make recommendations to Congress by December. "I hope the commission is successful, but I also hope to see the Tooth Fairy some day," Burman deadpanned. In short, we can't predict whether the Rubio children will be stuck with our tab. That is up to future policy decisions. What we do know is in this instance, when it comes to the hard numbers, father still knows best: The United States government spent 40 percent more than what it collected during the most recent fiscal year.

pomt-03052	"Eighty-five percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/04/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-only-15-percent-federal-spending-be/	When someone says the government is "shut down," it sounds like most services have ground to a halt, except for activities to protect life and property. But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., suggests that dire image is exaggerated. During an interview on CNN on Oct. 2, 2013, Paul told anchor Erin Burnett that "85 percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down." Is he right? We took a closer look and found that there are different ways to measure government. Government spending is one way, but the picture changes when you look at the federal workforce. First, some background. A government shutdown happens when one particular kind of federal funding stops flowing -- money that’s appropriated by Congress. Appropriations bills are supposed to be passed annually, though in recent years, acrimony between Congress and the president has made it happen more irregularly. However, other types of federal spending are unaffected by the shutdown because they aren’t subject to annual appropriations. An important one is known as mandatory spending -- money paid out to anyone who meets a fixed definition, such as someone who qualifies for Social Security or Medicare. Much of President Barack Obama’s health care law is also unaffected by the shutdown since it is not dependent on regular appropriations, Also, interest payments on the debt are not affected by a shutdown. So if you’re trying to determine how much spending is "on" during a shutdown and how much is "off," you have to compare the amounts that fit into these various categories. According to the fiscal year 2014 figures from the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- the federal budget includes $2.2 trillion for mandatory spending, plus $237 billion in interest payments. These two categories add up to $2.4 trillion, out of a total budget of $3.6 trillion -- or about 68 percent. The percentage grows closer to Paul’s estimate of 85 percent once you add in spending on military personnel. Such spending would ordinarily be subject to cutbacks, but it was exempted by enactment of the Pay Our Military Act, which Congress passed and the president signed shortly before the shutdown began. Paul’s office, citing Senate Budget Committee calculations, said the Pay Our Military Act frees up $225 billion in payments to be paid. That brings the percentage up to 74 percent. And the percentage rises further once you count the costs of federal activities that are continuing during the shutdown because they safeguard the public’s safety and property. The problem is that it’s hard to nail down exactly how much money is being spent on such activities, since we’re so early in the shutdown and because many of the decisions have been made on the fly. In order to reach Paul’s 85 percent threshold, the government would need to be spending $404 billion from its "discretionary" (or appropriated) budget beyond military personnel. That means the government would be spending 43 percent of the remaining discretionary spending on activities that continue through the shutdown. Experts we spoke to said that percentage is plausible. Even if you cut that $404 billion figure in half, Paul would still be pretty close -- the figure would be 79 percent rather than 85 percent. We’ll only know the final number for certain after the shutdown is over. Still, spending isn’t the only way to look at this issue. For instance, if you look at the number of federal employees furloughed, the percentage left unscathed by the shutdown is likely much lower than the 85 percent figure Paul cited for spending. Estimates published in the New York Times suggest that at least six agencies were expecting to keep 20 percent or less of their workforce laboring through the shutdown, with another three expecting to continue employing between 21 percent and 50 percent. Using spending as the unit of measurement biases the perception of how far-reaching the shutdown is, because so much of the budget is spent on things like Social Security and Medicare -- programs that are dollar-heavy but personnel-light, said John M. Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, an advocacy group for government service. "Government spending does not equal government," said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "So while it hard to come up with an accurate figure as to how much government is still being done, the spending burn rate is not the best way." Our ruling Paul said that "85 percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down." Government shutdowns by nature are somewhat haphazard, so it’s hard at this point to calculate these numbers with any precision. However, due to the big role of entitlement spending in the federal budget, Paul is likely in the ballpark when he measures "government" by the yardstick of spending. However, measuring government in other ways, such as the percentage of federal employees being furloughed in major departments, would make the impact appear bigger. And when he said that "85 percent of government" is operating right now, that’s more of a stretch. Paul’s comment is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-07477	To pay for government growth, leaders of both parties "borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/15/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-leaders-borrowing-4-billion/	Down-to-the-wire budget negotiations may have avoided a federal government shutdown on April 8, 2011, but those dealings are likely only a precursor to even fiercer partisan bickering over whether to raise the national debt ceiling. President Barack Obama's deficit-reduction speech on April 13, and the GOP reaction to it, was the latest salvo. The nation’s current debt is creeping closer to the $14.3 trillion cap allowed by law. By May 16, the national debt could exceed the cap, causing the U.S. to default on its obligations, according to an April 5 memo from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to Congress. Congress has raised the federal debt ceiling nine times in the past 10 years, according to a January 2011 report from the Congressional Research Service. From 1997 to 2001, the debt ceiling remained steady at $5.9 trillion. In 2002, Congress approved raising the cap to $6.4 trillion and has raised it almost every year since as the debt has grown. Republicans have repeatedly said they will not vote to increase the cap again, unless there are measures to ensure future long-term cuts in spending. Democratic leaders have argued that the increase is necessary to avoid sending an already fragile economy back into a tailspin. On March 30, 2011, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio penned an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal explaining why he does not plan to support raising the debt ceiling. "I will vote to defeat an increase in the debt limit unless it is the last one we ever authorize and is accompanied by a plan for fundamental tax reform, an overhaul of our regulatory structure, a cut to discretionary spending, a balanced-budget amendment, and reforms to save Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid," he said. In the article, Rubio wrote that, "Leaders of both parties have grown our government for decades by spending money we didn't have. To pay for it, they borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt." We were curious if Rubio was correct -- is the U.S. borrowing $4 billion a day to run the government? Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos offered the following explanation in an e-mail as to how the senator arrived at the $4 billion figure. "Our budget deficit this year is roughly $1.5 trillion, according to the Congressional Budgeting Office. 1.5 trillion/365 = roughly $4 billion per day." The explanation seems rather straightforward, but throughout Rubio’s Wall Street Journal piece, there is only mention of the national debt, not the deficit that he uses to calculate the $4 billion figure. While the two terms are linked, they are not interchangeable. So we decided to reach out to several economists to get their expert take on Rubio’s mathematics. First, a primer on the differences between the "national deficit" and the "national debt." The deficit is the result of the government spending more in a single budget year than it takes in as revenue from taxes and other sources. The deficit in 2010 was $1.293 trillion, according to the website of the Office of Management and Budget, and we've had a deficit every year since 2002. Before that, from 1998 to 2001, for a brief period at the end of President Bill Clinton's term and the start of President George W. Bush's administration, the federal government was actually operating with a surplus, according to the Congressional Research Service report previously mentioned. The national debt, meanwhile, is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia looked at a similar $4 billion-a-day claim recently and described the debt this way: There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion (as of April 6). The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show. The national debt stretches back to the founding of the country. It was $75 million in 1791, passed $1 billion in 1862 during the Civil War, and topped $1 trillion for the first time in 1982 during President Ronald Reagan's first term. You can see the federal debt at the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of the Public Debt website. For the yearly federal budget deficits (and occasional surpluses) back to 1901, see the Office of Management and Budget's website. "The debt is the sum of all past deficits," said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "When you run a deficit, that adds to your outstanding debt," Snaith explained in a phone interview. The deficit "drives the other one higher. If we didn't run deficits, than we could reduce the debt." Snaith said Rubio’s numbers seemed legitimate, though they likely wouldn’t be routinely used by economists. "The actual borrowing doesn’t occur every day," Snaith explained. "The periodic auction of bonds, that’s when the money is raised. But when you’re dealing with a figure like $1.5 trillion, it’s like a light year, it doesn’t register for many people. To make it a bit more comprehensible, they probably tried to bring it down to a level that is easier to visualize." We also turned to David Denslow, an economist with the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Denslow reminded us of another way the deficit and debt are linked: Every year that we have a deficit, the debt grows larger and we have to pay more interest on that debt. "What we worry about it the accumulating interest," he said in an e-mail, referring to it as a "secondary deficit." He warned, "The effect starts out slow, but becomes explosive." As we noted, interest on the debt was more than $400 billion in 2010. While Denslow agreed with the mathematics behind Rubio’s statement, he still suggested the wording could be clearer. "The phrasing is a bit misleading. I would phrase it, 'To pay for it, they are now borrowing $4 billion a day, raising the debt to $14 trillion,’" Denslow wrote in an e-mail. So two experts agree with Rubio’s $4 billion a day figure but quibble over the phrasing. Still, we wondered if it was accurate to refer to deficit spending "for decades" and justify it with the deficit over the most recent 365 days. After all, using the OMB list of deficits in the past 10 years, it was $3.5 billion a day in 2010, $1.25 billion a day in 2008 and $680 million a day in 2006. We posed the question to Marc Goldwein, policy director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "In terms of when the deficits were created, of course deficits are the result of a variety of tax and spending decisions -- some which have been made in the last few weeks, some which were made in the 1930s," Goldwein said. "But, when the decision is made is a different question from when the money is borrowed. It is being borrowed now." Goldwein's assessment: Rubio's description "seems to me to be more or less true on average." Again, not quite a ringing endorsement. Rubio's statement was that, to pay for government growth over decades, leaders "borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt." The sentence mixes a breakdown of the deficit and a total for the debt, and the casual reader could easily confuse the two concepts. We think it would have been more accurate to say that leaders "borrowed $4 billion a day last year to cover the deficit, pushing today's debt to $14 trillion." Still, the senator’s calculation works, even though the money isn't really borrowed every single day. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11576	"I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2018/feb/02/bruce-rauner/rauners-dubious-balanced-budget-claims-again/	The Illinois Constitution requires Gov. Bruce Rauner to draw up a budget plan each year that is balanced. But a wide range of fiscal experts agree he didn’t do it in 2015 after taking office. He didn’t do it in 2016. He didn’t do it last year either, even though he claimed otherwise. Indeed, the budget Rauner proposed last year was so clearly billions of dollars out of whack that, when he presented it to the General Assembly last March, PolitiFact Illinois handed the governor the lowest possible Pants on Fire! credibility rating for contending it was in balance. So we were puzzled when Rauner on Monday declared to the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board: "I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor." Rauner followed that on Wednesday during his annual State of the State speech to lawmakers in Springfield with a declaration that unintentionally drew a boisterous round of sarcastic cackling from Democrats in the chamber. "I will submit a balanced budget proposal next month," Rauner said, pausing a couple of beats before adding, "Again." Rauner’s budget proposal for the next fiscal year is still under wraps, so it’s too early to judge whether available revenue will align with expenditures as required by law. But his persistence in arguing that his past budgets were all balanced, despite broad and convincing evidence to the contrary, inspired us to take another look. A broken record Appearing at a mini-debate before the Tribune’s editorial board, Rauner was pressed about his budgeting by his Republican primary challenger, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton. The incumbent protested that he’d proposed balanced budgets every year. That prompted us to ask the governor’s office if anything had changed in the last year since PolitiFact deemed his claim absurd. A spokesperson emailed back: "Year after year, Governor Rauner has introduced balanced budgets, along with the reforms needed to save taxpayer dollars and put Illinois back on a firm fiscal footing and, year after year, he has been met with resistance from those more comfortable with the status quo. The Governor will continue to push for balanced budgets, pension reform, cutting regulatory red tape, reforms to make our jobs climate competitive, and spending reductions so that Illinois can grow again." In short, Rauner’s office avoided a direct answer to the question we posed. The statement does, however, further a factually challenged narrative that the governor often repeats. There’s history here. Critics say Rauner’s balanced budget boast which earned him a Pants on Fire! in 2017 was no anomaly. "He has never introduced a balanced budget," said Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a Chicago-based think tank partly funded by labor unions. "What he has put out there doesn’t even rise to smoke and mirrors." Martire said the same air of unreality applies to Rauner’s latest statements on the budget. "Maybe in a place where they have unicorns?" Martire said. Last year, in panning Rauner’s claim about his 2017 budget, PolitiFact pointed to some stark numbers that didn’t add up. "Democratic opponents have suggested Rauner’s plan is $4.6 billion to $7 billion out of balance," PolitiFact wrote then. Much of that might have been dismissed as the product of partisan sniping, except for one suspect entry in Rauner’s budget in which he penciled in $4.57 billion in savings for what was described in vague terms as "working together on a grand bargain." The "bargain" in question depended on lawmakers hammering out a broad compromise on a range of spending and ancillary issues including contentious topics like workers’ compensation and tax reform. Rauner ultimately sank the package by withholding support even though he factored its approval into his budget calculations. While the "grand bargain" itself never materialized, attempts at reaching it evolved into a bipartisan effort in the Legislature to break an historic budget stalemate that lasted a total of two years. Last summer, a handful of Republicans crossed the aisle to help override Rauner’s veto of a spending plan authored by Democrats. ‘Pixie dust and magic beans’ After PolitiFact bestowed a Pants on Fire! on Rauner’s earlier budget claim, new information came to light that only served to underscore the rating. In the budget blueprint he proposed last year, Rauner called for creation of a 401(k) style savings plan for newly hired public school teachers and public workers. He estimated that would slice $500 million in savings off the state’s pension costs for fiscal 2018, which began last July 1. Despite the budgetary feuding, the Democratic budget included the 401(k) plan Rauner had asked for. Even so, an investigation by the Better Government Association later raised doubts that any savings from the new retirement program would materialize before 2019 at the earliest. Ironically, Rauner in vetoing the Democrats’ budget faulted them for counting on the same $500 million in savings that he had included in his own spending plan months earlier. Head spinners like that have provided ample fodder for those in Springfield who question Rauner’s credibility when it comes to budget matters. Prominent among the critics is Democratic state Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who issued this statement following the governor’s State of the State address: "We just heard Governor Rauner's re-election speech. Now he has 14 days to deliver a balanced budget that doesn’t involve pixie dust and magic beans." Our ruling Rauner last year earned PolitiFact’s Pants on Fire! rating for his claim that a state budget he proposed was balanced. Indeed, fiscal experts say Rauner has never proposed a balanced budget as required under the state Constitution since taking office in 2015. All facts to the contrary, Rauner repeated a similar claim this week during an appearance at the Chicago Tribune. "I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor," Rauner said. Aides to the governor filibustered when we asked them to back up his latest statement. A year ago, PolitiFact called Rauner out on his balanced budget claim. His most recent comment is equally outrageous. Once again, we rate it Pants on Fire!	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2018-02-02T07:00:00	2018-01-29	['None']

"In New York, when she ran for reelection, she carried 58 of our 62 counties. George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years earlier," he said. He is suggesting Sen. Hillary Clinton's strong reelection showing in Republican-leaning counties in 2006 means she can win nationwide, a key question facing her candidacy. It is true that she carried 58 out of 62 New York counties, and that President George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years before. In the interview, the former president delved further into the numbers from the 2006 race, in which she beat Republican John Spencer by more than 2 to 1. "In the counties that President Bush won, she got a reelection margin of about 60 percent, which means some -- a lot of Republicans and conservative independents voted for her, because they know her now, and they like her, and they saw her in action working for them," he said. That's not far off the mark from what pollsters say about the reasons for Hillary Clinton's strong showing in her 2006 reelection. Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research, says she gained 18 percentage points among independent voters from 2000 to 2006 -- even better than her 15-point gain among moderates. But he and others also attribute the increase to the fact that Mrs. Clinton was a well-known incumbent with a weak Republican challenger. And she also had the advantage of a national wave, fueled by the unpopularity of President Bush and the Republican-led Congress, that propelled Democrats nationwide in 2006 and helped them regain control of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. Mrs. Clinton may not be able to count on moving independents elsewhere. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 47-percent of independents nationally view her unfavorably.

pomt-08117	Eliminating the state tax on health savings accounts will "make it easier for small business owners to provide health insurance to their employees."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-eliminating-state-tax-health-sav/	Governor-elect Scott Walker promises to "open Wisconsin for business" on Jan. 3, with his first official act to be convening an emergency session of the Legislature to consider economic development measures aimed at creating jobs. That package will include a change in state law -- sought by the business community -- that was rebuffed in the past by Gov. Jim Doyle and his fellow Democrats: a state income tax credit for contributions to health saving accounts. Walker included a pledge to eliminate the tax as one of his campaign promises, declaring on his website that the change would "make it easier for small business owners to provide health insurance to their employees." In other words, more health coverage -- even without a mandate from Washington. On Dec. 9, 2010, Walker unveiled some details of his HSA plan -- and again pitched its importance. We had decided days earlier to look at the issue, and had contacted his campaign office about it. So, a special thanks to them for going out of their way to make this item extra timely. During the campaign, as the campaign website shows, Walker positioned the change as a boon to the employers of the state. So that’s our starting point. Some background: Wisconsin is among only four states that do not allow employees to deduct their contributions to health savings accounts. There already is a federal tax deduction available. Supporters see the plans as a key to keeping health care costs under control. Opponents, such as Gov. Jim Doyle, argue that such savings accounts benefit only higher income workers -- and note that the change would cost the state millions in lost tax revenue at a time of huge budget deficits. Health savings accounts are allowed with plans that have deductibles of at least $1,200 for individual and $2,400 for family coverage. With such plans, workers (and employers if they choose to do so) can set aside money into a spending account for employees to use on health care expenses. Many businesses have embraced high-deductible plans, which typically mean lower premiums than on conventional insurance plans. "They’re an important tool" toward keeping the cost of health insurance down, said Jon Rauser, a Milwaukee insurance broker who serves small businesses. What does it mean for those with accounts? On an account with $3,000 in annual contributions, the annual state tax credit would be about $195. Let’s underline: That’s what the employee would receive on his or her tax return. What about the argument, as the Walker campaign advanced, that this would help the bottom line for businesses? Steve Baas, legislative director for the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, says businesses believe the current rules could discourage workers from signing up with a plan that includes a HSA. "It’s incredibly frustrating," he said. "Why are we an outlier on this?" In a letter to its members in spring of 2010, the MMAC in a letter called the lack of a deduction "an unwarranted tax on employees." Walker transition spokesman Cullen Werwie argued allowing HSA contributions to be deducted would put Wisconsin on par with most other states by removing a competitive disadvantage for state businesses. However, neither Werwie nor others involved with the issue said they were aware of any business that was holding off on high deductible plans because of the state tax issue. "Does an employer really care about an employee’s tax situation?" said Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute. "I don’t know if that amount of (tax savings) money makes any difference." Fronstein said about 10 million Americans were covered by health plans that were deemed eligible for HSA accounts. Doyle vetoed versions of the bill in 2004 and 2006. In his 2004 veto message, the governor said he feared that expanded use of HSAs "could decrease employer-sponsored insurance coverage. "Additionally, HSAs are only viable for healthy persons with higher incomes," Doyle wrote. "As healthy individuals with higher incomes opt out of traditional insurance pools, the risk profiles of these existing health plans will worsen, which in turn will cause insurance companies to raise rates on remaining members likely to be those without any other options." It’s a little unclear what the exact cost to the state coffers would be if the tax break was allowed. Doyle noted in 2004 the proposal would cost the state some $38.7 million over eight years; his 2006 veto message put the cost at $50 million but didn’t say over what period of time he was referring to. A version of the bill introduced last spring included a fiscal note that said it would cost $14.8 million in fiscal year 2011. Walker’s announcement Dec. 9 said that under his measure "taxpayers will save $4 million to $8 million in lower taxes if HSAs are tax-exempt." However, those estimates were based on a fiscal note from the 2005 version of the bill. The issue is bigger than the dollar impact of the tax deduction for employees, said John Torinus, retired chairman of Serigraph Corp. who has advised Walker on economic issues. He said the change would "remove a small impediment" to getting workers into high deductible plans and "would send a signal that the state of Wisconsin wants consumer driven health plans." Rauser said when he speaks before companies considering the plans, he has to remind workers that Wisconsin does not allow a tax deduction on the accounts. He termed it "more of a nuisance than an impediment" to getting workers to sign up for them. But again, that’s on the side of the employee, not the employer. State Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), a sponsor of the measures Doyle vetoed and a subsequent bill that died in the last session, said without the break, "employers have trouble convincing their employees (having high deductible plans) is an advantage." HSA plans also lead to more prudent spending on health care because employees use health care providers more prudently, she said, because "they have skin in the game." What’s the bottom line? The consensus is pretty clear: State workers who have health savings accounts are getting nicked by Madison. And allowing them to take a tax deduction would bring Wisconsin in line with most other states. That may all be true. But Walker is arguing that a tax break for individuals -- not employers -- would boost the number of small businesses that provide health insurance. He and other supporters have provided no evidence it would. We rate that statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2010-12-10T09:00:00	2010-12-09	['None']
pomt-08980	He has "ushered in $3 billion in new investment."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/16/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-he-ushered-3-billion-providence-dev/	Rome wasn't built in a day. But Providence was built in just a few short years. By one man. Or so Mayor David Cicilline would like you to think. Since he launched his campaign for Congress, the Providence Democrat, who took office in 2003, has repeatedly taken credit for billions in economic development throughout the city, making it a centerpiece of his election bid. His claim is specific: "By restoring trust in city government, Cicilline has ushered in $3 billion in new investment and restored vibrancy to downtown and the 25 neighborhoods of the city." He's been saying it for nearly five years and it has become a central part of his campaign message. But that's a lot of investment for a city whose entire annual budget was less than $620 million last year. Our interest sufficiently piqued, we called the Cicilline team for a breakdown. A Rose-Colored History After multiple requests, the mayor's administration finally provided us with a list. It was so exhaustive it suggested that Cicilline was responsible for nearly every major piece of Capital City development in the seven years since he took office -- and in a few cases, projects that began before he got near City Hall. Frequented the Auto Zone on Manton Avenue or the expanded fitness center at Brown University? Thank Cicilline. How about the parking garage at Rhode Island Hospital or the Walmart on Charles Street? Or what about the storage units on Reservoir Avenue, or the West River endoscopy offices? The mayor also takes credit for the construction of new condos, retail stores and several not-yet-built office buildings, as well as public projects including work on schools and roads. The list goes on. Over 100 projects in total. The biggest item that he says he "ushered in" is the $610-million I-Way project, the relocation of a portion of Route 195 in downtown Providence. But the I-Way planning began more than a decade ago; the federal environmental impact statement was completed in 1996. The earliest phases of construction began in 1999, three years before Cicilline took office, and the financing came mostly from the federal government. When we asked the Cicilline administration to defend the I-Way claim, they agreed it was an overstatement. Cicilline spokeswoman Karen Watts said in an email that the mayor "agrees with you that including the whole of the highway project in this list isn't correct." But the administration insisted the rest of the list is accurate. What about the combined sewer overflow project, a two-decade effort to build a three-mile long underground tunnel to contain sewage overflow during storms? He takes credit for $275 million of the $359 million development. According to the Narragansett Bay Commission's website, the planning for this project dates to 1993. Construction began in June 2001, more than 18 months before Cicilline took office. The sewer project and the I-Way alone make up almost 30 percent of Cicilline's claim. So even if the rest of the list is valid -- which we don't think it is -- the accuracy of the statement has slipped significantly. "The bigger projects, the 195 and the combined sewer, those were things that were going to happen, but the mayor pushed and got the changes needed [for them]," Providence Planning Director Thomas Deller said in an interview. "....Can we take credit for it? No, it was something that was going to happen. But it may have happened a little faster [with Cicilline as mayor] or a little slower" without him. The problem is that the mayor did take credit for it. He said he "ushered" it in, remember? The Cicilline team argues that while they may not have actually brought in every dollar for every project themselves, they created a predictable, trustworthy environment that made small business owners and developers want to invest there. "The fact of the matter is that [the person] who is in office and who works for them has a lot to do with decisions about how projects move forward," Deller said. "The point the mayor was trying to make is how we work aggressively to make things happen." We don't fault the mayor for claiming credit for hotels or developments such as the new Blue Cross headquarters. In several instances, it's clear his administration played an active role in making those developments happen. But he doesn't deserve credit for every permit issued. It was not a one-time slip of the tongue either. $3 Billion Claim Repeated Cicilline has been using the $3-billion figure at least since January 2006, when he cited it in his State of the City address. In the years since, he has been quoted saying it more than a dozen times in The Providence Journal. The claim came out of the "A Vision For Providence" study, a 2005 report that highlighted economic development, neighborhood by neighborhood. What's interesting is how the claim evolved. In those early mentions, Cicilline said that economic development in the city hit $3 billion. Over the years, the statement morphed into one in which Cicilline took credit for bringing those projects in. And when projects such as the One Ten Westminster condos fell through, the Cicilline administration just replaced that item with another, so the final $3 billion figure never changed. Again, it's fair for a mayor to take credit for some of the economic development that occurred during his tenure. But not to exaggerate his role in those projects. On his campaign website, Cicilline clearly implies that he had a hand in making the developments happen. Not only that, he takes credit for ventures that predate his term in office, and he repeats the claim in public. We presented our research to Deller, a Providence City Hall veteran. At the end of a long conversation, his response: "If this were 2005 and I thought there would be a Truth-O-Meter sometime in the future, I might not have put it that way."

pomt-11790	Says Paul Ryan is leading the effort to "pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan" in "another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/22/naral-pro-choice/house-tax-bill-contains-language-about-unborn-chil/	On the morning of Nov. 15, 2017, readers who clicked on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s home page were confronted by a large pop-up ad attacking U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan that linked a Republican tax reform proposal to abortion: The ad was from NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. If you clicked on an image at the bottom that said "Call Rep. Ryan Now," a link sent you to a page with more information. That page contained a statement that began with this: House Republicans are quickly moving to pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan. This is another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights. Leading the charge has been House Speaker Paul Ryan. NARAL made similar claims on social media. And the group said that, besides Ryan, the online ads targeted eight other House Republicans: Rod Blum of Iowa, Steve Knight and Darrell Issa of California, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Karen Handel of Georgia and Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania. Let’s look at each of the three parts of the attack on Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. 1. ‘Ryan is leading the effort’ The House tax bill was introduced on Nov. 2, 2017, and was approved by the House on Nov. 16, 2017, the day after NARAL’s ad on JSOnline.com. Ryan has long been touting a GOP tax reform proposal, describing it as the first major tax reform since 1986, and promising that its tax cuts and other tax changes would stimulate the economy. A spokeswoman in the speaker’s office told us Ryan supports the provision that is targeted by NARAL, which would change so-called 529 college savings accounts. But she said she wasn’t aware of any public statement Ryan has made on that provision, and we couldn’t find any, which indicates Ryan hasn’t taken the lead on pushing that particular provision. So, this part of the claim is partially accurate. 2. ‘Conception language disguised as savings plan’ People use 529 accounts (529 refers to that section of the tax code) as investment vehicles to save money for college expenses. The savings are for -- as the Internal Revenue Service explains it -- "a designated beneficiary, such as a child or grandchild." A key attraction is that earnings on investments are not subject to federal tax. The House tax bill would allow 529 accounts to be opened explicitly for unborn children. That provision says: Nothing shall prevent an unborn child from being treated as a designated beneficiary or an individual under this section. The term "unborn child" means a child in utero. The term "child in utero" means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb. The provision is "disguised" in the sense that adding the unborn child language doesn’t enable savers to do anything they can’t already do for future children -- a point U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., raised during a hearing. Expectant parents and other savers can already open a 529 in anyone’s name, including their own, and later change the beneficiary -- for instance, after a child is born. Meanwhile, it’s clear the provision is divisive. NARAL is among a number of groups that opposes it; meanwhile, anti-abortion groups support the provision, with one, the Susan B. Anthony List, saying: "It's a small increment in the momentum that we're building to ensure that one day every child is welcomed and protected under the law." So, this part of the claim is mostly on target. 3. ‘Another attempt to ban abortion’ The third part of the claim, however, goes too far. The 529 provision would not ban abortion; it strictly deals with college savings accounts, not any restrictions on abortion. In fact, in announcing its ads, NARAL itself labeled the provision as merely a beginning step, saying: The sole purpose of this provision is to codify the radical, anti-choice idea that life begins at conception into law and begin the process of banning abortion altogether ….This is the first time ‘personhood’ language has made it into tax reform legislation, leaving the door open for future laws to use the same, ideological definition of when life begins … There is evidence that, as the New York Times reported, "the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn." The anti-abortion group March for Life said in a statement: "We are heartened to see this bill promote the personhood of an unborn child … and see this as a huge stride toward expanding the child tax credit to recognize life beginning at conception." Snopes fact checked whether the tax provision attempts to codify "fetal personhood" — the legal theory that a fetus has the same legal rights as a person -- and found the claim largely accurate. Two experts, echoing others, told us that inserting an unborn child definition into federal law is part of a broader strategy to limit abortion rights in the future. "It is part of the anti-abortion strategy to work on all fronts to establish fetal personhood/citizenship claims," said Yale Law School professor Mindy Roseman, whose specialties include reproduction rights. The "unborn child" or human "from moment of conception" language is also in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ strategic plan, said University of Wisconsin-Madison law and bioethics professor Alta Charo, whose specialties include reproductive health. Such efforts are aimed, she said, "at building an impression that everywhere in federal law the embryo and fetus is considered morally and perhaps legally equal to a live-born child. It is like building a wall. At the end, abortion stands out as a singular exception, a single missing brick in the wall, and seems harder and harder to justify either morally or constitutionally." Ryan’s response Asked to respond to NARAL’s ad, Ryan’s office referred us to a statement about the provision issued by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The statement says in part: Today, our tax code doesn’t recognize children with eyes, ears, noses, arms, legs, fingers, and heartbeats as children just because they haven’t yet left the womb ….So our tax plan adds clear language that allows parents to start a college savings account before their son or daughter is born by explicitly and unambiguously declaring these sons and daughters "unborn children." Our ruling NARAL says Ryan is leading the effort to "pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan" in "another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights." Ryan is leading the effort to pass the tax bill. But while he supports the college savings plan provision, he hasn’t spoken out publicly to push that provision. Conception language in the provision is divisive among anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups. And it is ‘disguised’ in the sense that it inserts the concept of unborn children into federal law without making any material change to what are known as 529 college savings plans. The provision would not, however, ban or even restrict abortion rights -- although advocates fear that inserting unborn children language into federal law could be used to erode abortion rights in the future. NARAL’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.	None	NARAL Pro-Choice America	None	None	None	2017-11-22T05:00:00	2017-11-15	['None']

pomt-11642	Conservative groups have spent $5 million "against" Tammy Baldwin -- five times more than against all other Democratic U.S. Senate incumbents up for election in 2018 combined.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/17/martha-laning/millions-more-spent-defeat-tammy-baldwin-all-other/	Moneywise, the most important U.S. Senate race in the country might be for the seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. At least that’s the suggestion from Martha Laning, chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. Laning was interviewed on the "Devil’s Advocates," a liberal radio talk show based in Milwaukee, on Jan. 5, 2018 -- 10 months ahead of the general election. Co-host Dominic Salvia said the Huffington Post reported that conservative groups had already spent $3 million against Baldwin. He asked Laning how Baldwin and the state Democratic Party could counteract that. Laning replied with an even more eye-catching money claim, saying: Well, I want you to know, first, that it's $5 million that's been spent against Tammy -- and it is five times more money spent against Tammy Baldwin, our senator, than all of the other U.S. Senate candidates up in 2018 combined. So, they are coming after Tammy Baldwin like no other. That means Laning is claiming $5 million has been spent against Baldwin -- five times more than has been spent, in total, against all of the other Senate Democrat incumbents who are up for re-election in 2018. The stakes It won’t be known until after the August 2018 primary election which GOP opponent that Baldwin, who was elected in 2012, will face. So far, two suburban Milwaukee Republicans are running: State Sen. Leah Vukmir and political newcomer and former Marine Kevin Nicholson. Including Baldwin, Democrats are defending 25 U.S. Senate seats in 2018 (two seats are held by independents who caucus with the Democrats). The New York Times says it’s a "tossup" as to whether Democrats can wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which has a two-seat edge. Noting the Huffington Post article that was referenced in Laning’s interview, the political news website Axios made this observation about the Senate races and President Donald Trump: There are 10 Democratic senators [including Baldwin] up for re-election this year in states that Trump won. But if conservative groups’ spending is any indication, Wisconsin might be the hardest seat for Democrats to keep. The numbers The Huffington Post article was based on data collected by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which is based on reports made to the Federal Election Commission. So, we went to the center’s website to produce this breakdown on how much conservative groups have reported spending so far against Baldwin: Expenditures against Baldwin during the 2018 election cycle Group Affiliation Amount Spent Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce Arlington, Va.-based hub for spending by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch $1.66 million Americas PAC Marion, Iowa,-based super PAC $703,500 Restoration PAC Suburban Chicago-based super PAC $527,499 Committee to Defend the President Hybrid PAC/super PAC that supports Donald Trump $130,680 Stars & Stripes Forever PAC Alexandria, Va,.-based super PAC $17,569 Restore American Freedom & Liberty Denver-based hybrid PAC/super PAC $14,000 Conservative Freedom Fighters Denver-based hybrid PAC/super PAC $12,000 Conservative Liberty Coalition Denver-based super PAC $2,000 Wisconsin Right To Life Victory Fund Milwaukee-based super PAC $800 Total $3.07 million By comparison, a total of $599,688 has been spent against other incumbent Senate Democrats (only 12 of the 25 have had groups spend against them, the Center for Responsive Politics told us). So, the $3 million spent against Baldwin is five times as much as has been spent against the other Democrats. But what about the $5 million that Laning claims? To reach that, you have to add in how much conservative groups have spent in support of Nicholson, the GOP newcomer (so far, none have reported expenditures in support of Vukmir). Here’s that breakdown based on the Center for Responsive Politics data: Expenditures for Nicholson during the 2018 election cycle Group Affiliation Amount Spent Restoration PAC Suburban Chicago-based super PAC $1.14 million Americas PAC Marion, Iowa-based super PAC $868,843* Solutions for Wisconsin Austin, Texas-based single-candidate super PAC that supports Nicholson $209,056 John Bolton Super PAC Bolton was U.S. ambassador to United Nations under GOP President George W. Bush $196,860 Club for Growth PAC Anti-tax group $18,568 Club for Growth Action super PAC $11 Total $2.43 million So, if you add what’s been spent in support of Nicholson to what’s been spent against Baldwin, that’s a total of $5.43 million. And that figure is seven times more than the $758,101 that’s been spent against the other Senate Democrat incumbents, or for their opponents, according to the center. It’s worth noting that the pro-Nicholson money, largely for ads promoting his personal background, are not against Baldwin in the same way as the money spent attacking her positions or votes. But the pro-Nicholson money clearly is aimed at helping Nicholson win Baldwin’s seat. A closing note In defending Laning’s statement, the Wisconsin Democratic Party told us that a consultant for Baldwin’s campaign had determined that $5.5 million has been spent on ads directly against Baldwin -- $4.5 million on TV ads and $1 million on web ads. (Baldwin's campaign would not identify the consultant to us.) This approach takes in additional spending, since not all the groups have to report to the Federal Election Commission. But the consultant could not provide a comparable tally for the other Democratic incumbents. Our rating Laning says conservative groups have spent $5 million "against" Baldwin -- five times more than against all other Democratic U.S. Senate incumbents up for election in 2018 combined. Based on reports to the Federal Election Commission that were analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, the total exceeds $5 million and is actually seven times more than what has been spent against the other Democrats. The only caveat is that $3 million has been spent directly attacking Baldwin, while the rest has been spent in support of one of her opponents. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-09461	"Congressman McCollum voted to dismantle Social Security."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/mar/04/florida-democratic-party/democrats-mccollum-dismantle-social-security/	The Florida Democratic Party says Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican candidate for governor, has targeted a sacred cow: Social Security. In a press release Feb. 3, 2010, the state party said that when he was in Congress, McCollum "voted to dismantle Social Security." That's a major charge. The Democrats are not simply saying he voted to reduce the program that provides income for millions of senior citizens, but alleging that he sought to tear it apart. To back up the claim, the Democrats cited nine votes McCollum took related to Social Security in the 1990s. The McCollum campaign doesn't dispute the individual votes but disagrees with how they're being interpreted. "Bill McCollum was always a supporter of Social Security, despite the attempts of Democrats to portray him (and every other Republican) as its enemy,'' wrote McCollum campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell in an e-mail. We examined those votes and showed them to experts on Social Security. We then concluded the Democrats are distorting McCollum's votes and making an incorrect claim based on flimsy evidence. Patricia Dilley, a University of Florida law professor who helped write Social Security legislation in the 1980s, said it was a stretch to describe the votes in such stark terms. "There is not a vote in here directly to dismantle Social Security,'' she said. The Democrats cite these votes by McCollum to support their claim: * McCollum voted in May 1995 for a Republican budget resolution that would have used a lower rate of growth in the Consumer Price Index, which is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other programs. Some economists have said the CPI overstates inflation, prompting Republican proposals to reduce the growth in the CPI. Henry Aaron, a senior fellow who studies health care for the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said the GOP proposal that McCollum supported would have reduced future benefits -- and reduced the purchasing power of seniors who receive Social Security. But he said "it's not dismantling" the program. * McCollum voted against using the surplus from the overall federal budget to bolster Social Security. The Florida Democratic Party said that, "In the late 1990's, when both the federal budget and Social Security were running surpluses, McCollum voted seven times against using those surpluses to secure Social Security." The party is referring to an initiative by then-President Bill Clinton to set aside the surplus for Social Security -- to put the money in the "lockbox" that became the subject of many jokes (and some funny Saturday Night Live skits) during the 2000 campaign. So the Democrats are alleging that because McCollum didn't want to put the money in their version of a lockbox that it's the equivalent of dismantling the program. Let's examine one of the votes the Democrats cite, a House resolution in May 1999 to do just that. McCollum voted no. But as the McCollum campaign noted, on the same day, he voted for a measure approved by the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats that aimed to make it more difficult for Congress to borrow from the Social Security trust fund surplus to pay for other programs. The vote was supposed to signal the GOP's support for Social Security, even if Republicans didn't want the surpluses used for it. (Republicans preferred using the surplus to provide broad tax cuts.) "He absolutely voted for the lockbox,'' said Campbell. "It was a question of how much he put in the lockbox. Do you put everything in the kitchen sink for the lockbox or do you preserve the trust fund itself. It was the question for two or three years." There's disagreement about the significance of these votes. Aaron said the proposals about lockboxes and securing the surplus were "completely bogus. The surplus of Social Security is secured -- they hold Treasury bonds -- Social Security can cash them in at face value whenever they need the money. I think voting for or against the bills didn't amount to much because Social security reserves are already safe." But Dilley said the lockbox bills could have had some long-term value. "If the lockbox had passed, it would be much more difficult for people to argue we need to cut Social Security to balance the budget,'' Dilley said. "It would have meant people could not now be making the argument we need to address the federal deficit by privatizing or cutting Social Security." Still, we don't see evidence here that the votes were to dismantle the program. They simply reflect different strategies by the parties about what to do with the federal budget surplus. * The Democrats also cite McCollum's votes for $80 billion in tax cuts as "using the Social Security surplus." They contend that McCollum's support of the tax cuts effectively raided the surplus that could have been used for Social Security. McCollum did vote for the tax cuts, but it's a huge leap of logic to equate that with "dismantling" Social Security. Congress tapped the surplus from the general fund, not directly from Social Security accounts. Former U.S. Rep. Clay Shaw, a Republican from Fort Lauderdale who chaired the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, said by the Democrats' logic that "you could make the argument that anything is coming out of Social Security." And contrary to the Democrats' overall point, we found a few articles that mention votes McCollum took to protect Social Security. McCollum even bucked his party to vote for an amendment by Democrat Rep. Barney Frank to protect the program, according to a Jan. 12, 1995, article in Newsday. Frank's amendment was to exempt the Social Security Trust Fund from an amendment to balance the budget. "There should be no temptation to reduce Social Security benefits to achieve the goal of a balanced budget," Frank argued, according to the Newsday article. McCollum was the "lone Republican to vote for Frank's losing proposal. He comes from Florida, which has a large retired population,'' the Newsday article stated. McCollum's campaign also pointed to a 1983 bill McCollum supported that was "to assure the solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds." The Democrats, meanwhile, cited a few news articles with McCollum's comments about George Bush's suggestions during the 2000 presidential campaign to create individual investment accounts for Social Security. That proposal, which would have retained traditional Social Security benefits for older Americans and given younger workers the flexibility to invest the money in different kinds of accounts, was criticized by many Democrats who said it was an effort to dismantle the program. Republicans said they were merely trying to give younger workers more control of their money and an opportunity for higher returns. The Orlando Sentinel quoted McCollum as saying, "I don’t believe in privatizing Social Security. I do believe, however, that the next generation ought to have the right to grow private saving accounts and have a greater savings opportunity than the seniors have had today," McCollum said. But it's important to note that their only evidence about the Bush proposal comes from comments in news stories. They do not cite any votes because the proposal did not come before a vote of the full House. So the Democrats have built a strong charge on flimsy evidence. Yes, McCollum opposed Democratic proposals to use the surplus for Social Security and he wanted to slow the growth in the Consumer Price Index for Social Security and he spoke in favor of Bush's proposal. But it's a ridiculous leap to equate those votes with "dismantling" the program. Pants on Fire!	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2010-03-04T17:16:59	2010-02-03	['None']

pomt-07288	"Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/may/22/michael-williams/michael-williams-says-gas-prices-are-2-obama-becam/	On Twitter, GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Michael Wiiliams of Texas urged online pals to join him in seeking a national policy encouraging all forms of energy production, writing: "Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office. We need More American Energy." Williams adds on his campaign website: "If I didn’t know better, I’d think President Obama is actually trying to see what $5 gasoline looks like." Energy policy aside, did Williams accurately peg the price of gas on Obama’s watch? After leaving Williams a message, we drilled for price changes since Obama took office in 2009 and during previous presidencies. First, a little perspective: Presidents can’t do anything to lower gas prices in the short term, an energy policy expert at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota recently told WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. In an April 27 post, the station quotes associate professor Elizabeth Wilson saying that the United States doesn’t have a lot of control over prices because "oil is an international commodity, fungible commodity, traded on international markets." Presidents can tap the nation’s strategic oil reserves, which President George W. Bush did in 2005, causing oil prices to drop 10 percent. But, Wilson said, "you could argue that the high prices, while painful, are not potentially strategic reasons to drain the reserves." Or, she said, the president could go after speculators who some blame for driving up the price of oil. Speculative energy contracts have increased 35 percent since the unrest in Egypt began in January; the government could limit the number of contracts big players could purchase, though Wilson said that’s unlikely to have an immediate impact on prices at the pump. Gas prices have caught Obama’s attention. On May 14, he said in his weekly radio address: "Without a doubt, one of the biggest burdens over the last few months has been the price of gasoline." He said he was ordering various governmental moves, including annual lease sales in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve to speed the evaluation of oil and gas resources in the mid and south Atlantic. How much have gas prices gone up since Obama was inaugurated Jan. 20, 2009? That week, the average per-gallon price of unleaded gas in Texas was $1.72, according to the AAA, which tracks prices at the pump by daily surveying more than 100,000 self-service gas stations. It was $3.77 the week of Williams’ tweet--up $2.05. That price was still shy of the July 2008 average of $3.97, the highest average Texas price during predecessor George W. Bush’s presidency, a $2.55 increase from the week Bush began his first term in 2001. In his first two-plus years--the period comparable to where Obama is today-- the average per-gallon Texas price of unleaded gas scarcely shifted, going from $1.42 to $1.47, according to AAA. Next, we looked at national retail prices for all formulations of gas posted online by the EIA. That information, starting from mid-August 1990, suggests that such prices bumped up less than a dime in the comparable part of Bill Clinton’s presidency and about 10 cents in the matching portion of George W. Bush’s first term—compared to about $2.10 for Obama. Another EIA chart shows annual prices for unleaded gas over the five presidencies preceding Obama. Adjusted for 2005-value dollars, the national price went up from $1.74 to $2.06 in the first three years of Jimmy Carter’s presidency; from $2.64 down to $2.15 in that part of Ronald Reagan’s tenure; up from $1.47 to $1.53 for George H.W. Bush; from $1.42 down to $1.41 for Clinton; and up from $1.61 to $1.69 for the second Bush president. Next, we wondered about the cause/effect relationship implied by Williams’ statement. That is, Is it fair to saddle any president with responsibility for the price of gas at the pump? The U.S. Energy Information Administration calls the price of crude oil the "main contributor to the general increase in retail gasoline prices since the start of 2009." Its March 22 post lists several factors affecting the price of crude oil including political events in the Middle East and North Africa, shifts in inventory levels, gradual improvements in the economies of the world and bumps in profits taken by gasoline refiners. Regardless, presidents historically get blamed when the price of gas increases and they aren’t necessarily rewarded when it falls, according to a May 2006 Bloomberg Business Week story. It states that the price-at-the-pump problem has "bedeviled presidents at least since 1973, when the Arab oil embargo created gas lines, a price spiral toward 55 cents per gallon, and an additional headache for President Richard Nixon. Of course, price spikes aren't the sole cause of falling presidential popularity. The relationship is a correlation, and other factors contribute to public perceptions of a president." Our take? Gas costs $2 more per gallon than it did when Obama took office; in the past 35 years, no other president saw such a price surge by this point of his presidency. However, Williams errs by implying the president is at fault; key factors driving gas prices are beyond a president’s control. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02065	The Wisconsin school voucher program "has no research that shows that it’s going to improve student learning."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/28/mary-burke/no-evidence-students-voucher-schools-perform-bette/	One way Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke contrasts herself with Gov. Scott Walker is with the state's school voucher program, which uses public money to pay for lower-income children to attend private schools. With his 2013-’15 state budget, Walker expanded the voucher program, also known as school choice, by opening it to a limited number of students outside of Milwaukee and Racine. Burke, a Madison School Board member, opposes the expansion. Speaking to the Milwaukee Rotary Club on May 6, 2014, she elaborated on why, saying: "What I want to see is initiatives and programs that are actually based on research and success that’s going to improve education, instead of saying that, well, our answer is just to roll out a voucher program that actually has no research that shows that it’s going to improve student learning." This debate has been engaged many times before. So let's see what we know about research into the performance of public vs. voucher school students. Vouchers and their expansion Vouchers in Wisconsin date to 1989, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and a Democratic-majority Legislature created the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, the nation's first urban school voucher program of its kind in the country. Under the original law, the number of vouchers was limited to 1 percent of the enrollment in Milwaukee Public Schools. And only non-sectarian private schools in the city were eligible to take choice students. Choice started with about 300 students in the 1990-’91 school year. The program has since been expanded several times -- more than 25,000 students now participate -- with the two most recent expansions occurring under Walker: Expansion of school vouchers in Wisconsin 1995: Religious schools can participate; voucher limit raised to 15 percent of Milwaukee Public Schools enrollment 2005: Voucher limit raised to 22,500 MPS students 2011: Voucher limit eliminated; income eligibility raised; private schools outside Milwaukee can accept Milwaukee choice students; Racine-area students and schools are made eligible 2013: On limited basis, vouchers available to students outside of Milwaukee and Racine Now let’s look at data on the performance of public vs voucher students. Test scores and Arkansas research In assessing Burke’s claim, it’s important to note there are limited ways to compare the performance of voucher vs public school students. Wisconsin does not require voucher schools to publicly disclose measures such as retention rates, graduation rates or college-entrance exam scores. As we reported in an April 2013 article on competing claims about voucher schools, and as we found in doing additional research for this article, there are two primary measures of vouchers in Wisconsin: 1. Annual statewide test scores reported in 2011 through 2014; and 2. A study by researchers based at the University of Arkansas that tracked the test scores of particular choice and Milwaukee Public Schools students over five years, ending in 2011. 1. Here’s how public and voucher students compared on statewide test scores: 2011: In first direct comparison involving statewide tests, students in Milwaukee Public Schools performed better than or about the same as voucher students in reading and math 2012 and 2013: Students attending public schools were more proficient, as a group, than their private school-choice counterparts in Milwaukee and Racine in reading and math 2014: On average, MPS students performed higher than Milwaukee choice students in reading and math. Racine public school students also scored higher on math and reading proficiency than Racine voucher students. An April 2014 report from the Public Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research group in Milwaukee, shows that from 2010-’11 through 2012-’13, Milwaukee Public Schools students outperformed voucher students at every grade level (third through 10th grades) on the statewide reading and math tests. So, overall, four years worth of publicly available, annual state test scores give a clear edge to public school students over voucher students. 2. Arkansas research The Arkansas research, meanwhile, took a different approach. Its "longitudinal" study tracked representative samples of 2,727 Milwaukee choice students and 2,727 Milwaukee Public Schools for five years, from the 2006-’07 through 2010-’11 school years. Key findings: Growth in math achievement was similar in all years, while voucher students made gains in reading in 2010-'11 that were higher than students in the Milwaukee Public Schools sample. Milwaukee students enrolling in a private high school in the choice program "increases the likelihood of a student graduating from high school, enrolling in a four-year college and persisting in college by 4 to 7 percentage points." It’s important to note that the reading advantage was for just one year, and the Arkansas researchers cautioned that some evidence suggested it was due to the introduction of a new state testing requirement for private choice schools. University of Arkansas education reform professor Patrick Wolf told us there's no way to know whether the reading improvement was due to the voucher schools themselves or other factors, such as teachers preparing their students more for the annual test because 2011 was the first year that voucher schools had to publicly disclose their test scores. On the high school finding, a majority of students who were enrolled in private choice schools in the ninth grade were no longer in a choice school by the time they reached 12th grade. The results, therefore, should be interpreted as the effect of "exposure" to choice schools rather than long-term persistence in that sector, the Arkansas study found. Wolf said that while there is no overall evidence that voucher schools improved learning in Milwaukee, for Burke to say there is no evidence "is a bit of a stretch," given what the Arkansas research found. Before we close, we’ll note two other studies that indicate voucher schools have an indirect impact on student learning. One study was done in 2003 by an economics professor then at Harvard University and one was done in 2008 by an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The studies said competition from voucher schools were linked with improved performance of students in Milwaukee Public Schools. For example, the 2003 study found that test scores in math, science, social studies, language and reading increased more in MPS schools where at least two-thirds of students were eligible for vouchers. Our rating Burke said the Wisconsin voucher program "has no research that shows that it’s going to improve student learning." Public school students consistently outperformed voucher students on statewide test scores from 2011 to 2014. The one study held up by choice advocates shows only limited instances in which voucher students performed better, and the study couldn't determine whether the voucher schools themselves or other factors were the reason. Burke goes too far in saying there is no evidence that vouchers improve student learning, but the evidence is thin. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-06555	Says "Every year air pollution protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/03/earl-blumenauer/earl-blumenauer-says-delaying-air-pollution-rules-/	Even in these cynical, partisan days, there are some universal truths. For example: Sulfur dioxide is a pollutant that can severely affect a person’s health and, in extreme cases, be fatal. Nitrogen oxide is another common and nasty pollutant that makes people sick. Scientists and non-scientists as well as Republicans and Democrats generally agree the stuff is bad for you. But how you deal with it is where agreement ends -- at least in Congress. On the House floor Sept. 23, Republicans muscled through legislation that would delay or scrap rules to reduce mercury and other harmful air emissions, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Though the bill passed, it’s highly unlikely to pass the Senate and would be vetoed by President Barack Obama if it did. Nevertheless, the House debate was lively. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., was one of the loudest critics, insisting that delaying the tougher air pollution rules would have dire results. "Every year these protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely," he said. Really? That’s a lot of dead bodies and it’s very specific. Perfect for PolitiFact. First, some background. As passed on a nearly party-line vote of 249-169, the bill would, among other things, require the president to set up a committee of Cabinet-level officials to evaluate the toll that a dozen-plus Environmental Protection Agency regulations would have on jobs, electricity, gasoline prices and competitiveness. Republicans said action was needed to slow down a runaway bureaucracy. "While there are reasonable regulations that protect our children and help keep our environment clean, we need to stop unelected bureaucrats from imposing excessive regulations that unnecessarily increase costs for consumers and make it harder for our economy to create jobs," House Speaker John Boehner said. Blumenauer and other Democrats said the bill was a craven gift to business that would result in dirtier air and more death. Blumenauer’s dire prediction was directed at the bill’s delay of something called the Cross‐State Air Pollution Rule which would limit the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide belching from power plants in 27 states. The pollutants react in the atmosphere to create ground-level ozone and set free tiny particulates that can damage lung capacity and cause respiratory problems. In real numbers, the EPA says the rules would reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide from the plants by 6.4 million tons a year (from 8.8 million tons in 2005) and to 1.4 million tons a year of nitrogen oxide (from 2.6 million tons annually in 2005). Those are big numbers and Blumenauer argued Sept. 22 during floor debate that lawmakers voting for the bill would be directly responsible for making people sick. "The losers are hundreds of thousands of people (who) will die, get illness from cancer, asthma, lost school days, millions of lost work days, the lost quality of life that is documented beyond belief," he said. "This is real, and these people lose." Blumenauer’s aides said he was relying on studies conducted by the EPA to support his claim. The most authoritative of those studies is a 414-page analysis released in June. The dense title suggests it’s a product of science rather than sound-byte politicians: "Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone in 27 States; Correction of SIP Approvals for 22 States." The report relied on the work of EPA scientists and a survey of independent, peer-reviewed studies by outside scientists. And there, listed among the "key findings" is this: "The benefits result primarily from 13,000 to 34,000 fewer (particulate matter) and ozone-related premature mortalities." The report repeats the number eight more times. We find that Blumenauer was on solid ground. But he also cherry-picked the highest death number rather than using the range of 13,000 to 34,000 additional deaths. While that omission does not change the conclusion that air pollution is bad for public health, it could exaggerate the problem. For that reason, we rate this claim: Mostly True.

pomt-06601	Says U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin is backing President Barack Obama’s plan to pass a $1.5 trillion tax increase.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/23/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republican-group-says-rep-tammy-baldwin-backs-15-t/	When President Barack Obama unveiled a long-term deficit-reduction plan on Sept. 19, 2011, top congressional Republicans dismissed it as a stunt featuring $1.5 trillion in tax increases leaning heavily on the wealthy. While Obama’s plan has little chance in the GOP-controlled House, it did give Republicans more fodder to rail against Democrats for insisting on tax hikes -- and to tie Democrats to Obama’s sinking poll numbers. One of the targets was U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for the seat that Sen. Herb Kohl, a fellow Democrat, will vacate after 2012. The messenger was the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), a campaign arm of the GOP that issued similar news releases going after Democratic Senate candidates in states including Virginia, Florida, Montana, Missouri and New Mexico. "Today, as Baldwin continues to double down on her support of the failed first stimulus and the rest of his tax-and-spend policies, President Obama proposed the largest tax hike in U.S. history – a $1.5 trillion tax increase on investors and small businesses that he says is needed to pay for their reckless spending agenda...," the NRSC news release said. Here’s the part of the release that caught our eye (italics ours) -- a quote from NRSC spokesman Chris Bond: "Under the Obama-Baldwin economic record, America has lost 2.4 million jobs, the federal debt has skyrocketed past $14.6 trillion, government spending has grown to record levels, and the response from Obama and Baldwin is to pass a record tax increase on the backs of Wisconsin small businesses," the release said. Did Baldwin, who recently launched her Senate bid, really come out in favor of a $1.5 trillion tax increase? When we asked Bond for evidence, he pointed to: Baldwin’s press statement on Sept. 8, 2011 expressing support after Obama’s speech that night. In his address, the president focused on the $447 billion American Jobs Act. Baldwin’s comments in favor of the Jobs Act on Sept. 17, 2011 at a Madison rally dubbed "Fighting Bob Fest" after Progressive icon Robert La Follette. The Jobs Act is separate from Obama’s broader "Long-Term Deficit Reduction Plan," which would raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for the jobs bill and help fund a 10-year drive to reduce federal deficits by some $3 trillion. The president touted the principles of that plan in the same speech where the Jobs Act was unveiled but did not lay out the details until Sept. 19, 2011. That announcement was what prompted the NRSC release -- and where the timing gets interesting. Bond said because the Jobs Act and Obama’s long term deficit reduction plan were linked in the initial speech and have somewhat overlapping funding sources, it’s fair to say Baldwin supports the White House’s deficit-reduction plan and the $1.5 trillion in tax increases to pay for it. "This is one big policy rollout that they are doing," Bond said. Let’s look at the record. Baldwin indeed praised the Jobs Act -- specifically Obama’s focus on creating construction jobs to erect public infrastructure so America doesn’t "sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads." Baldwin’s press statement the night of the president’s speech on jobs and deficits was both broad (praising his call for "bold action") and specific (citing the Jobs Act infrastructure plan). The middle class, Baldwin said, "is taking it on the chin in both the economic and political environments." Her comments came before and after Obama announced tax hikes to pay for the Jobs Act -- but two days before Obama released the specific and much longer list of tax hikes in his Long-Term Deficit Reduction plan. Those are the ones that tally out to $1.5 trillion. We could not find any public comments by Baldwin in favor of the large package of tax hikes -- the one the NRSC says Baldwin is backing. We asked Bond if he had evidence that Baldwin was specifically endorsing the tax package. "I haven’t seen any politician say that," he told us. "She hasn’t done it." Baldwin’s campaign confirmed this in an email: "While Tammy Baldwin applauds the President’s plan to create jobs, she hasn’t taken a position on the (deficit-plan) revenue package and is concerned about some of the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that have been proposed." Obama’s deficit plan drew public praise from some liberal Democrats, especially the new minimum tax rate for individuals making more than $1 million a year, the so-called Warren Buffett rule. There was an undercurrent of caution among Democrats, though, with some saying they wanted to see details to ensure Medicare and Medicaid were protected. Our conclusion The NRSC contended that Baldwin backed $1.5 trillion in tax hikes in Obama’s 10-year deficit plan. Republicans certainly have a case that Baldwin prefers what Obama calls a "balanced" approach to deficit fighting -- revenue hikes along with spending cuts. She may ultimately side with many of Obama’s ideas, which were sent to the congressional "super committee" that is to propose a major debt plan late this year. But the NRSC itself acknowledges Baldwin has not endorsed Obama’s deficit plan, which is a much broader proposal than the Jobs Act. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13781	"There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/20/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-there-are-more-hoosiers-going-work/	In his first major speech as the 2016 Republican vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence repeated a talking point about his economic record back home. "There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before," Pence said. That’s similar to a comment Pence had made just over a week earlier, shortly before Trump chose him as his running mate. The statistic isn’t as meaningful as it sounds. Pence has a point that more people in Indiana are working today than at any time in history -- 3.07 million in May 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s a chart showing BLS data for Indiana as far back as the database goes online: However, the historical peak Pence cites has more to do with long-term population growth than with the robustness of the economy. Economists agree that the most accurate way to analyze a statement like this is to look at the percentage of people working, not the raw number. Otherwise, you could say that President Barack Obama at the depths of the Great Recession was presiding over a healthier job market than Ronald Reagan in his second term, because 25 percent more Americans were working. The difference was that the base U.S. population -- rather than job prospects -- grew substantially in the interim. As a general rule, "focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading," Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed, told us when we looked at Pence’s earlier comment. Let’s take a look at what happens if you calculate the percentage of the Indiana population that is working. According to the Census Bureau’s 2015 population estimate — the most recent one available — Indiana has a population of about 6.48 million. So 47.3 percent of Indiana residents were working this year. By contrast, at the previous raw-number peak in Indiana employment -- May 2000 -- there were 3.02 million residents working. That year, the state had 6.08 million residents, so the percentage working was 49.7 percent. In other words, a bigger percentage of Indiana’s population was working in 2000 than in 2016. That throws some cold water on Pence’s assertion. These calculations use all Indiana residents as a baseline, regardless of age, but the same pattern holds if you just look at Indiana residents between the ages of 18 and 64, the prime working years. Currently, 75.4 percent of Indiana residents in that age range are working. In 2000, the comparable figure was 80.5 percent. So by this measure, too, Pence is wrong about 2016 representing a historical peak. Then there’s the more traditional measure of the health of the job market, the unemployment rate. This statistic uses as its baseline the number of people who are looking for a job, which makes it even more precise and in most cases more useful to economists. Indiana’s current unemployment rate of 5 percent is what experts would generally consider good, but it’s hardly a historical low for Indiana. For most of the time between 1993 and 2008, Indiana’s unemployment was right around 5 percent and often even lower. Here’s a chart going back to 1976: Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, noticed another pattern in the numbers. He used federal data to determine that even though the state’s working-age population grew by 311,000 between 2000 and 2015, the number of people actually working in the state increased by far less over that period -- only 45,400. That does not seem like an obvious sign of a strong employment trend. Our ruling Pence said, "There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before." Literally, more Indiana residents are employed now than at any time in the past. But it’s a data point with very little meaning, since, as any statistician will tell you, it doesn’t take into account the size of the state’s population. Looking instead at the percentage of Hoosiers working shows that the percentage was higher during the previous employment peak in 2000. And the widely used unemployment rate — which is even more precise because it is based on the number of residents who are actively looking for a job — has been lower than its current rate over long stretches of recent history.

pomt-03928	"More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single Moderate on their ballot."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/22/kenneth-block/block-says-moderate-party-has-lots-votes/	Rhode Island was among 14 states in the last election cycle that allowed voters to use the so-called "master lever," enabling them to vote for candidates from one political party with one ballot mark. On Rhode Island ballots, it is the option called Straight Party. Kenneth Block, founder and chairman of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island, has launched a campaign to get rid of the master lever, saying it’s outdated and creates confusion for many voters. In a recent appearance on the "State of the State" television program, Block said that in the November 2012 election, "More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single Moderate on their ballot." Block, a businessman, gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot in 2010 as the Moderate Party’s candidate for governor. He came in last in a four-way race, with 6.5 percent of the votes. But that was enough to win a spot on the 2012 and 2014 ballots for his party. We wanted to know how Block calculated that 9,000 figure. By e-mail, Block said that he started with 9,424 -- the number of people he said voted by the master lever for the Moderate Party. Then he did some estimating, based in part on the size of the communities and districts with a Moderate candidate on the ballot. He noted that the Moderate Party had a candidate in just three communities -- Burrillville, East Greenwich and South Kingstown -- and two legislative districts -- House District 65, in East Providence, and Senate District 16, which is all of Central Falls and a piece of Pawtucket. Block then estimated the number of voters he thought would have cast a straight-party Moderate vote in those communities and districts. He subtracted that estimated total from the total of all Rhode Island voters who selected the Moderate Party with one ballot mark. He didn’t provide an exact final number -- just "more than 9,000." When we checked Block’s number, we discovered he was close, but not directly on target. To begin with, both the secretary of state’s office and the Board of Elections said the number of Moderate Party straight-party votes was actually 9,295 -- not the 9,424 Block started with. Then we obtained exact numbers of master-lever votes for the Moderate Party in the communities and districts with Moderates on the ballot . Miguel J. Nunez, planning specialist at the Board of Elections, told us there were 208 such votes in Burrillville, where a Moderate candidate was running for School Committee. But that race was non-partisan and the candidates weren’t identified by party so, technically, it doesn’t fit Block’s definition. In the other communities and legislative districts with identified Moderate candidates on the ballot, there were a total of 642 master-lever votes cast for the party. Subtract that number from the 9,295 statewide votes and you get 8,653 -- close to 350 fewer than Block’s "more than 9,000." Even if you add the 208 votes from Burrillville, you still don’t get to 9,000. Our ruling Kenneth Block said, "More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single moderate on their ballot." He derived that number in part from guesswork. But according to the precise figures from the Board of Elections, he was off by nearly 350 -- roughly 4 percent. But Block’s underlying point that the master lever confuses many voters is valid. More than 8,000 used it to vote for Moderate Party candidates when there weren’t any on their ballots. For those reasons, we rule his claim Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-14049	"Look, we are at war with these people and they don't wear uniforms. … This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-letting-tens-thousands-terror/	Donald Trump has advocated for a "temporary" ban on Muslims coming into the United States to prevent any terrorists from crossing the border. But are there already tens of thousands of terrorists coming into the country now? That’s what he claimed in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. "Look, we are at war with these people, and they don't wear uniforms," Trump said during the May 23, 2016, interview. "It's not your traditional war where it's a war against Germany, Japan, or whoever. This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now." As with some previous Trump comments we’ve analyzed, this remark is all over the place, making it hard to parse. And the Trump campaign did not get back to us to clarify what he meant. Still, we decided to take a closer look. On the one hand, by referring to "vicious, violent people," Trump seems to be referring to terrorists and violent extremists. But there is no evidence that tens of thousands of terrorists are being admitted into the United States today -- much less that they are being "allowed" in, as if there is a visa preference program for terrorists. On the other hand, Trump is in the numerical ballpark if he’s referring to the number of refugees being admitted into the United States every year -- something else he’s expressed reservations about. Currently, the United States accepts 70,000 refugees from around the world -- not just the Middle East -- and that number is poised to grow to 100,000 in 2017 due to scheduled increases from Syria and Iraq. However, this would mean that Trump is saying that all or nearly all refugees are terrorists, including the many who are not even Muslim and who don’t come from the Middle East. This is decidedly not the case, experts agreed. "Donald Trump is conflating the terrorists with those who flee terror," said Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS, originally known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. "We are not letting in terrorists, we are letting in refugees from terror. His likening refugees to terrorists is not unlike those who said German Jews from Nazi Germany should be denied immigration because they posed a security risk." Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that is critical of illegal immigration, speculated that when Trump was referring to "tens of thousands" he may have been conflating the number of refugees and the much larger population of undocumented immigrants, and also conflating run-of-the-mill violent criminals with terrorists. "It is correct to say there are tens of thousands of violent criminal aliens," Camarota said. "But remember the total noncitizen population who could be subject to removal is huge, and in any human population of this size there will always be tens of thousands who are criminals." Of course, even if Trump’s statement could be manhandled into an interpretation that possessed some degree of accuracy, it was still wrong as he stated it. "Trump is certainly wrong on the facts here," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. That said, Gartenstein-Ross added that more reasonable concerns could have been expressed with less "hyperbolic" rhetoric. The recent migrant flows from Syria and Iraq into Europe, he said, have provided greater cover for terrorists than experts had predicted early on, and while the United States is not facing as much risk from its ongoing inflow of refugees, that risk is not zero. Just going by the math, some small fraction of refugees can be expected to either be well-concealed operatives who made it through the screening process or, much more likely, people who self-radicalize after arriving in the United States. Still, Gartenstein-Ross agreed that there is no evidence that "tens of thousands of them" are already here, as Trump said. Our ruling Trump said, "Look, we are at war with these people and they don't wear uniforms. … This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now." There is no evidence that "tens of thousands" of terrorists are coming into the United States, much less that they are being "allowed" in on purpose. While there may be legitimate counter-terrorism concerns about refugee flows, Trump’s overheated rhetoric complicates rather than clarifies the situation.

pomt-08089	"When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits," just as there have been in the legal battle over the new health care law.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-compares-legal-battle-over-health-car/	During a White House interview with Tampa's WFLA-TV on Dec. 13, 2010, President Barack Obama reacted to a decision earlier that day to strike down a key portion of the health care law passed earlier this year. In the recently announced ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson of Virginia declared unconstitutional the law's requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or face a penalty. In the interview, Keith Cate, an anchor at NBC affiliate News Channel 8, asked the president for his thoughts on the ruling. Obama began by noting that other lower courts had issued more favorable rulings, and that the issue was destined to go through additional legal steps on its way to the Supreme Court. "That's the nature of these things," Obama said. "When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits. When the Civil Rights Act was passed and the Voting Rights Act was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits." In this item, we'll focus on the Social Security Act, in part because we thought we'd give the president a second chance after earning a False from us on a different comment about the early history of Social Security. It turns out that in his second historical comment, the president was accurate. Even though American society was less litigious in the 1930s, the creation of Social Security -- which is a landmark moment in the history of the federal government -- did attract not just one lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court, but three. And as we looked deeper into the history of the legal battle over Social Security, the more we noticed how much its details echo the battle playing out now over the health care law. So we'll provide an overview of the history here, in which we rely heavily on by an official history of the period written in 1999 by Social Security Administration historian Larry DeWitt. "Even though the Social Security Act was enacted into law on August 14, 1935, the country still had to hear from the Supreme Court," DeWitt wrote. "This was a new, untested area of federal authority and it was inevitable that it would be challenged in the courts, and until the Supreme Court ruled, no one could be sure that the nascent Social Security Act would survive its infancy." DeWitt noted that under the 10th Amendment, powers not given to the federal government are left to the states or the people, so the federal government, in its defense of the Social Security Act, would have to find justification in the Constitution for the expansion of its powers. Even before the Social Security Act was passed, other parts of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal -- the cluster of programs designed to alleviate the Great Depression -- had been subject to legal attacks and in some cases were ruled unconstitutional by lower courts for overstepping federal powers, just as one of the requirements of the health care law has been. In 1935 and 1936, a sharply divided Supreme Court -- split between three liberals, four conservatives and two swing votes -- invalidated the Railroad Retirement Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The defeat of three pillars of the New Deal drove Roosevelt to propose, in early 1937, an ill-fated "court-packing" scheme in which he would expand the number of justices, thus shifting the court's ideological complexion in his direction. The proposal was soundly defeated by Congress, with significant collateral damage to Roosevelt's standing with the public and historians. But beginning in March 1937, one of the swing justices, Owen Roberts, shifted from the opponents' camp to become a supporter of New Deal programs, enabling a minimum wage law, the National Labor Relations Act and the Social Security Act to stand. Three specific cases attacking Social Security reached the Supreme Court. In one, the Steward Machine Company case, the company sued over having to pay unemployment insurance tax under the law. Another case, Carmichael vs. Southern Coal & Coke Co. and Gulf States Paper, challenged a different facet of the unemployment provision having to do with the states. But the most directly relevant for Obama's comment was Helvering vs. Davis, in which George P. Davis, a minority stockholder in an electric company, objected to being forced to pay the payroll tax that funded the old-age insurance program. The administration, represented by Internal Revenue Service commissioner Guy T. Helvering, filed suit to force compliance. "The attorneys for Davis argued that the payroll tax was a new type of tax not listed in the Constitution's tally of taxes, and so it was unconstitutional," DeWitt wrote. "At one point they even introduced into their argument the definitions of 'taxes' from dictionaries in 1788 (the year before the Constitution was ratified) to prove how earnest they were in the belief that powers not explicitly granted in 1789 could not be created in 1935. Davis was also of the view that providing for the general welfare of the aged was a power reserved to the states." This sounds to us a lot like some of the arguments in the health care case, which revolves around the question of whether the federal government is justified in imposing a tax-based penalty on Americans who refuse to sign up for health care coverage. The high court handed down its decision on May 24, 1937. Reflecting a divisive debate in Congress and among the justices, the Court upheld the unemployment-insurance provision by a narrow, 5-4 vote. But in the old-age insurance, the Roosevelt administration won a resounding 7-2 victory, without even a written dissent by the dissenters. In his majority opinion in Helvering vs. Davis, Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote that the Great Depression was a national problem that demanded national solutions. "The ill is all one or at least not greatly different whether men are thrown out of work because there is no longer work to do or because the disabilities of age make them incapable of doing it," Cardozo wrote. "Rescue becomes necessary irrespective of the cause. The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journey's end is near." Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that Obama has a point that there are similarities between the legal battle over Social Security and the fight over the health care law. "Like the Affordable Care Act, the Social Security Act was subject to constitutional challenges, lower courts reached conflicting conclusions, and the issue was not resolved until the cases reached the Supreme Court," he said. If the recent past is any guide, the court that eventually takes up the health care law, led by another Justice Roberts, will also be one with a close ideological divide. Of course, there are limits to the comparison. "The fact that there are all kinds of lawsuits challenging X, which was eventually upheld, obviously does not mean that every other law that is challenged by all kinds of lawsuits will also be eventually upheld," said Stuart Taylor, a veteran commentator on the Supreme Court. Taylor added that while many of the broader themes are similar, the specific legal arguments are not identical. "The issue at the heart of the health care individual mandate -- whether the government can, in the name of regulating interstate commerce, require individuals to buy a commercial product simply because they were born and they live in this country -- was raised neither by the Social Security cases nor by any other case in the nation's history," Taylor said. "Also, while one can plausibly defend the individual mandate's enforcement provision as a tax in support of the general welfare, like the Social Security tax, that argument is somewhat undermined by the facts that the President and Congress strenuously denied that the mandate is a tax in order to get it passed and that the law itself was changed to call it a penalty, not a tax." So, Obama's comparison is not exact. But there are some striking similarities, so -- unlike in our previous item -- we think the president was justified in making the broad comparison. And on the narrow question of whether "there were all kinds of lawsuits" when Social Security was passed, we rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-00972	Alabamians "haven’t changed their opinion" on same-sex marriage since voting to ban it in 2006.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/13/roy-moore/alabama-chief-justice-roy-moore-81-percent-alabami/	CNN’s Chris Cuomo challenged Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore to defend a decision that will allow local courts to ignore a federal judge’s ruling striking down the state’s anti-gay marriage law. "Times have changed as they did with slavery," Cuomo said Feb. 12 on New Day. "The population no longer feels the same way. And even in your state, people no longer feel the same way." Moore held firm that marriage was defined as between a man and a woman, and said, "81 percent as recently as 2006 said it was the definition. They haven’t changed their opinion." Support for gay marriage has increased nationwide significantly in just the last decade. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2006, 55 percent of Americans opposed gay marriage. By 2014, 52 percent supported marriage rights for same-sex couples, and opposition was down to 40 percent. But has there been no movement on the issue in Alabama, as Moore claimed? We decided to take a look. In June 2006, voters in Alabama overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment barring authorities from issuing marriage licenses to "parties of the same sex." The referendum passed with 81 percent of the vote. Moore’s office confirmed that was the number he was alluding to. What has happened since then? Being a solidly red state, and a rural one at that, Alabama is not surveyed as often as some other states. But here’s what we found from the polls that do exist. In 2012, a poll of likely voters by the Capital Survey Research Center — an arm of the Alabama Education Association and one of the most consistent pollsters in the state until it recently closed — found 71 percent opposed same-sex marriage. Likely voters would be those most expected to show up for an off-year primary election, as was the case when the referendum passed in 2006. So by that measure, while gay marriage remains deeply unpopular in the state, there was a 10 percentage point decrease in opposition. That drop in Alabama is largely in line with the slope of the decline in opposition at the national level. During the same time frame, nationwide opposition to gay marriage fell to 46 percent in 2012 from 55 percent in 2006, according to Pew. It’s not a perfect comparison to look at the 2006 Alabama referendum, which asked people to vote on a constitutional ban on gay marriage, and a 2012 survey that queried voters on whether they support gay marriage. For example, some people might have opposed gay marriage but didn’t think a constitutional amendment was necessary. But it’s a measurable change in sentiment on the overall topic that is backed up by other research. In 2005, 87 percent of registered voters told the Capital Survey Research Center that they supported the position of, "Allowing only traditional marriage between a man and a woman." But an Alabama television station found in 2015 that 70 percent of registered voters oppose gay marriage. Finally, the Williams Institute at UCLA estimated marriage opinions for every state in 2004 and 2012 based on each state’s demographics in those years. How was this accomplished? They took the demographic make-up (age, religion, race, etc.) of each state and compared it against national survey data that broke down sentiments about marriage by those demographics. Researchers took this approach because lack of polling data in many states made it difficult to spot trends. What they found was support for gay marriage in Alabama grew from 16 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in 2012. Alabama’s increase of 16 percentage points was actually larger than the national average (13.5 percentage point increase), though the starting point there was much, much lower than most states. And that’s an important point to note: Alabama was among the states with the lowest support for gay marriage in 2004 and it remains among the lowest today. By the Williams Institute’s estimate, only Arkansas and Louisiana have a fewer percentage of citizens supportive of gay marriage (31 percent). That result is echoed by the Public Religion Research Institute, which found that Alabama and Mississippi in 2014 had the lowest support for same-sex marriage among their populations at 32 percent. Our ruling Moore said since voters passed a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage in 2006, Alabamians "haven’t changed their opinion." An overwhelming number of people still oppose same-sex marriage in Alabama, and it remains one of the least-supportive states of gay marriage, according to the information available. But polling data suggests measurable movement on this issue. In 2006, 81 percent of voters supported the referendum to prohibit gay marriage in Alabama. Recent polls show about 71 percent of likely voters oppose same-sex marriage today. That’s in line with other data that show growing support for same-sex marriage in the last decade there, and is similar to the rate of decline in opposition nationally. The statement contains partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Roy Moore	None	None	None	2015-02-13T15:57:39	2015-02-12	['None']

pomt-13002	"Republicans Looking To Cut Social Security As Much As 50 percent Immediately."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/14/new-century-times/website-makes-dubious-claim-gop-will-cut-social-se/	A newly introduced bill to overhaul Social Security has prompted a wave of urgent appeals to current and future Social Security beneficiaries to prevent the program from being gutted. A reader noticed an Internet post being widely shared and asked us if it was accurate. The post in question, from a website called the New Century Times, is headlined, "Republicans Looking To Cut Social Security As Much As 50% Immediately." A 50 percent monthly benefit cut starting "immediately" would indeed be a serious problem for a lot of Social Security beneficiaries. However, the primary article the post linked to doesn’t support the headline, and a related article provides only weak support. The New Century Times post links to a column by Josh Marshall, the editor and publisher of the liberal news and commentary website Talking Points Memo. The column analyzes a bill offered by Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, that would raise the retirement age for Americans 49 or younger from 67 to 69, change the formula for determining a beneficiary’s first payments, and effectively reduce their future cost-of-living adjustments. "Republicans apparently aren’t going to be satisfied with phasing out Medicare," Marshall wrote. "They’re going to try to pass huge cuts to Social Security this year too. Not Bush-style partial phase-out, but just big, big cuts. And you’re out of luck even if you’re a current beneficiary." But Marshall’s column doesn’t say the cuts will be "50 percent immediately," and the New Century Times article never provides any other backing for it. (A side note: The author of the New Century Times article is Sarah Wood, who is the creator of a satirical website called the Free Wood Post. However, she writes separately for the New Century Times, according to her Twitter biography, and we have no reason to believe that the Social Security article is intended as satire. Wood did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Adding to the confusion, the New Century Times separately quotes a statement by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that says the Johnson bill "cuts benefits by more than a third" -- not 50 percent. We didn’t hear back from Johnson’s staff, but we did find a different Talking Points Memo piece that could be the source of the 50 percent figure. This article offers a number of scenarios exploring how the Johnson bill could affect particular beneficiaries, depending on how much income they make, when they retire and how long they live. A number of the examples in the Talking Points Memo article show increases well below 50 percent. "A 65-year-old retiree (who earned an average of $12,280 and) was only in the workforce for 20 years would see a 19 percent decrease … in 2030," the article said. "That cut would be 32 percent, if the 65-year-old was retiring in 2050." Some examples even show increases. "A 65-year-old who made an average of $12,280 ... after being in the workforce for 30 years would see his benefits increase by 9 percent when he retired in 2030, as compared to the current law," the article said. But some examples do show decreases in excess of 50 percent. Specifically, the Talking Points Memo article says, "a 65-year-old at the top of the scale, a $118,500 average earner, would see his benefits cut by 25 percent when he retired in 2030, compared to the current law, and that reduction would grow to 55 percent compared to current law by the time the retiree was 85 years old. Likewise, those cuts get larger the longer the law is in place. The 65 year-old at the top of scale who retires in 2050 will see a 43 percent cut in his benefits, compared to current law, that will grow to a 74 percent reduction by the time he is 85." Clearly, cuts of 55 percent or 74 percent are significant. But a lot of important context was lost between the Talking Points Memo article and the New Century Times headline that got so much attention on social media feeds. First, these are very specific examples; many other beneficiaries would experience far less severe effects. The New Century Times headline leaves the impression that this would be an across-the-board cut. Second, these specific examples happen to be clustered among new retirees at the top of the income scale, meaning they would be more able to afford the cuts. Some low earners, as we saw, actually come out ahead in the calculations. Third, these cuts would be about as far from "immediate" as one can imagine. No one currently receiving Social Security or about to start receiving benefits would experience a 50 percent benefit cut -- the most logical way to read the headline. Rather, in the example with the 55 percent cut, that would take full effect in 2050. In the example with the 74 percent cut, that would take full effect in 2070. For a sense of context, lots of Gen-Xers would have reached, or would soon reach, 100 years old by 2070. Our ruling A widely shared New Century Times post was headlined, "Republicans Looking To Cut Social Security As Much As 50% Immediately." A recently released bill would indeed raise the retirement age and make changes to Social Security formulas that would effectively cut future benefits for many recipients. But by highlighting cuts as large as 50 percent without noting that these are for a specific (and affluent) subset of beneficiaries, the headline engages in extreme cherry picking. And none of these massive cuts would happen immediately -- they would happen 34 and 54 years in the future. This claim revives a well-honed Social Security scare tactic.

pomt-00217	The 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches "are going up."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/oct/12/stephen-carter/no-5-4-supreme-court-rulings-are-not-rise/	Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s seating on the Supreme Court followed one of the most bitter and divisive confirmation fights in the High Court’s history. Some legal commentators suggested that, in addition to questions of Kavanaugh’s personal history and judicial temperament, the Supreme Court’s own internal dynamics helped intensify the fight over the vacant seat. "One of the reasons I think we fight so hard is you look at the number of 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches. Those are going up," said Yale Law professor Stephen Carter. "The more those decisions go up, the more valuable each seat is, each vacancy." There may be a public perception that 5-4 decisions are up, perhaps owing to blockbuster rulings in recent years on everything from health care to voting rights to political spending that were decided by this slimmest of margins. It’s also possible that Kavanaugh could cast deciding votes on cases with major implications for American society. But the data shows that 5-4 decisions are not trending upward. Not trending up We reached out to Carter, who said he’d misspoken. "Mea culpa. I do know better," he said of his Oct. 10 appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "When I talk about this subject to students and colleagues, I usually refer to the perception that there are lots of 5-4 decisions as the driver of perceived value of each vacancy." To be sure, many high profile cases have been decided on a 5-4 basis in recent years. The most recent term also had a higher rate of 5-4 decisions than the previous two terms. However, there’s no discernible long-term upward trend, according to a SCOTUSBlog analysis of past 13 terms, as well as interviews with Supreme Court watchers: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "I don’t think there’s a particular trend there," said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "I don’t think it’s accurate to say that the rate of 5-4 decisions is increasing." What about ‘big’ cases? Not all cases the justices hear are equal, of course. Each year, some cases carry greater potential impact and public interest than others. Experts told us that when charting the relative frequency of 5-4 decisions over time, there’s no objective way to separate the (for lack of better term) major cases from minor cases. However, Sara Benesh, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, said blockbuster cases do tend to produce less consensus than minor ones. But that’s nothing new, she said. "It is true that ‘big,’ controversial cases are more likely to be decided 5-4 than more ‘routine’ cases," she said. "But that has been true over time as well." Oftentimes those divisions break along familiar ideological lines. Justice Elena Kagan, an Obama appointee, addressed the Court’s voting breakdown in a recent speech. She said the Court’s relatively high frequency of 9-0 opinions is underappreciated, but acknowledged that big cases often do produce more disagreement. "There are some issues — some important issues that people care about — in which the court is more closely divided and tends to be divided along lines that you might predict, if you look at who nominated each of us," she said. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Overall, the rate of 9-0 decisions have outnumbered the rate of 5-4 decisions in recent years, according to Sarah Turberville of the government watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, who provided the following chart: "It’s not entirely accurate to say 5-4 decisions have increased," Turberville said. "Yes, there was an increase from 2016 to 2017, but there was also an increase in 9-0 decisions over that course of time." Our ruling Carter said that the 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches "are going up." The most recent Supreme Court term had a higher rate of 5-4 decisions than the previous two terms. However, the data since at least 2005 shows 5-4 decisions are not trending upward. Carter himself said he misspoke, and meant to say there was a perception that such cases were on the rise.

Rick Perry stated that in 2001, only four Texas legislators voted against the measure. The statement came as Perry apologized in a Sept. 28, 2011, interview with Newsmax TV for saying anyone who opposed giving tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants did not "have a heart" — a comment he made in the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate. In an article about the interview, though, Newsmax noted that Perry stood by his view that the decision in his state to extend tuition breaks was the right one. "I was probably a bit over-passionate by using that word, and it was inappropriate," Perry was quoted as saying. "In Texas, in 2001, we had 181 members of the Legislature — only four voted against this piece of legislation — because it wasn't about immigration, it was about education." Only four of the 181 members voted no? We’ve written other items about this law in recent days, so our interest was piqued. (We checked statements about whether Perry gave illegal immigrants in-state rates and the difference in dollars between in-state and out-of-state tuition.) According to the journals for the 2001 session kept by the Texas House and Senate, Perry is darned close. Versions of the proposal cleared House and Senate education panels with no opposition. The House passed the measure 142-1, with Rep. Will Hartnett, R-Dallas, being the lone "no" vote; five House members were absent, according to the April 23, 2001, House Journal entry. After amending the bill, the Senate approved it 27-3 on May 21, 2001, with Republicans Mike Jackson of La Porte, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in opposition. Three days later, the House approved the Senate's changes 130-2; the "no" voters were Hartnett and Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson. Sixteen members were not present. Perry signed the measure into law June 16, 2001. Our count: Five of the 181 legislators referred to by Perry (31 state senators, 150 House members) voted against the tuition legislation. That's close enough for us to rate his claim True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-09-28T18:49:23	2011-09-28	['Texas']
pomt-02459	Says Alex Sink supported "higher property taxes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/feb/24/republican-party-florida/alex-sink-supported-higher-property-taxes-florida-/	Alex Sink’s campaign for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat has been under attack by Republicans resurrecting her positions on Florida taxes over the years. One such claim is rooted in Sink’s record as the state’s chief financial officer. A Republican Party of Florida campaign mailer that reached Pinellas County homes by Feb. 10 accused her of leaving out "some key facts" in one of her TV ads. The flier read, "Alex Sink supported higher taxes. She has a long record of supporting higher taxes -- higher property taxes, higher sales taxes, even higher taxes on water and TV." We’ve checked many of these claims before; we found the sales tax attack Mostly False, and the water and TV taxes claim Mostly True. But what about the property taxes? Back on the homestead The GOP said it was basing their accusation on a Jan. 23, 2008, story in the Tampa Bay Times in which then-CFO Sink voiced her opposition to Amendment 1, a ballot measure focusing on how the state’s homestead exemption would be applied to property taxes. The amendment aimed to increase the exemption, saving homeowners an average of $240 on property taxes annually. It also allowed homeowners to transfer their tax benefits under the 1992 Save Our Homes Amendment, which capped assessment increases on homes, to a new residence. The amendment further created a new $25,000 exemption for some business properties and limited assessment increases for non-homesteaded properties to 10 percent annually. In the story, Sink was briefly mentioned as not supporting the measure because she was afraid of the potential loss of services that might happen if tax revenues fell. Specifically, she mentioned firefighters losing jobs, because they are paid with property taxes. She said her constituents largely shared her opposition. "They're really more concerned about the little amount of money (they would get back) and the possible broader implications for our quality of life," Sink said. The GOP did not make any reference to a statement Sink made a day earlier, which clarified her stance on the measure. "For 20 dollars a month, I'm not willing to take the risk that my fire service is going to be deteriorated, my schools aren't going to be supported, and I'm not going to get my potholes fixed," Sink told the Times Jan. 22, 2008, prior to the article Republicans cited. The piece noted that as Florida’s fire marshal, a role the CFO assumes, she was hearing from fire chiefs statewide that they were worried about losing firefighters. Fire agencies relied solely on ad valorem taxes for their budgets. She said in the piece that she shared the views of Florida TaxWatch, which opposed Amendment 1. She also noted she didn’t think tax policy should be a part of the state Constitution. "If the policy's in the Constitution and it's not working right, how do you unwind it?" Sink added. Her public position on the measure, which passed on Jan. 29, 2008, with 64 percent of the vote, came up in June 2009 when she spoke before the Latin Builders Association in Miami to ramp up her campaign for governor. She said then that she couldn’t recall how she voted on the amendment, drawing criticism from conservatives. Combined with a plunging real estate market during the Great Recession, the amendment led to a precipitous drop in tax revenues statewide. The expanded homestead exemption alone, which was retroactive to Jan. 1, 2008, took $93 billion out of coffers statewide in the first year, according to state records. The resultant budget cuts did eventually force many fire agencies to institute hiring freezes or cut personnel, including first responders, and delay or kill equipment purchases and capital improvements. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida says Sink supported "higher property taxes," referring to her somewhat lukewarm opposition to 2008’s Save Our Homes Amendment 1, which adjusted property taxes in a way that lowered them for most homeowners. The claim is misleading in that it implies to voters she wanted to raise property taxes across the board. That wasn’t the case; Sink wanted to keep taxes at the same level, not raise them. There’s an element of truth here, but it leaves out context that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03822	Says bag litter increased after San Francisco banned single-use shopping bags.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/mar/20/drew-springer/drew-springer-says-bag-litter-increased-after-san-/	Austin’s ban on disposable shopping bags is "all for show," according to freshman state Rep. Drew Springer. "In San Francisco, litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban," he said in a press release issued March 5, the day he introduced his "Shopping Bag Freedom Act." Springer, a Republican from the North Texas town of Muenster, said he filed House Bill 2416 to stop Texas cities from ruling that businesses can’t give customers single-use plastic or paper bags. Brownsville, South Padre Island and Fort Stockton also have bag bans, and a Dallas City Council member wants "to follow in Austin’s footsteps." After Austin’s ban went into effect March 1, 2013, retailers could no longer offer thin, so-called single-use plastic and paper bags at checkout counters. The City Council passed it in 2012, saying the plastic bags, in particular, often end up as litter and are costly to clean up. And did bag litter rise after the San Fran ban? San Francisco’s 2007 ordinance banning single-use plastic bags at certain stores was the first such U.S. law, according to a March 28, 2007, San Francisco Chronicle news story. In November 2007, large grocery stores had to stop giving out single-use plastic bags; six months later, large chain pharmacies had to comply, the story said. Springer’s chief of staff, Travis McCormick, said by email that the lawmaker’s statement was based on the City of San Francisco Street Litter Re-Audit conducted in April-May 2008, which showed that plastic retail bags constituted 0.64 percent of all large litter (items more than 4 square inches). That was a 6.7 percent increase over the 0.6 percent share shown in the city’s April-May 2007 audit, McCormick said, so there was a slight bump in such litter despite the ban. San Francisco environmental department spokesman Guillermo Rodriguez told us by phone that retail plastic bag litter dropped the following year. He emailed us the city’s 2009 study, which showed plastic retail bags accounted for 0.52 percent of large litter. We looked over the city’s three litter audits, for 2007 through 2009, and here’s the thing: We’re talking about differences of about two plastic bags in each year’s litter samples. For the audits, observers counted pieces of litter at more than 100 sites, classified the found items as large or small, then tallied them in dozens of subcategories. In 2007, they recorded 23 plastic retail bags and pieces of such bags across all the checked sites. They found 25.5 of the bags and pieces of bags in 2008 -- and 23.5 in 2009. Those counts match up with the percentages McCormick cited and the percentage in the 2009 report. About half of San Francisco’s large litter in each audit came from "fiber materials" such as paper, cardboard and napkins. The "second-most significant material type" was plastic, accounting for 20 percent to 24 percent of total large litter in the surveys. In each of the three years, the largest category of plastic was "miscellaneous," accounting for 4.7 percent to 9 percent of all large litter and defined as "litter that is broken up or weathered such that auditors cannot identify it with certainty but can identify the litter as plastic." Raw numbers of large litter items in San Francisco 2009 audit Source: The City of San Francisco Streets Litter Re-Audit 2009 Rodriguez called the 2009 audit "a better snapshot" of the ban’s effects primarily because the 2008 audit was conducted only a few months after the ban started to take effect in November 2007. The 2008 litter audit counted litter samples taken from April 7 to April 18, 2008. That would have been before large pharmacies had to stop giving out disposable plastic bags on May 20, 2008, according to a Chronicle news story published that day. Finally, because Springer’s claim referred to "litter from bags," we looked at San Francisco’s total bag data even though the city’s ban did not address paper bags. In contrast, Austin’s City Council banned both plastic and paper bags except for bags considered reusable -- such as ones with handles. Overall bag litter in San Francisco followed the same pattern as plastic retail bag litter -- rising in 2008 before falling below the 2007 and 2008 levels in 2009 (measured as a percentage of total large litter). Specifically, all paper and plastic bags made up 4.45 percent of large litter in 2007, 5.91 percent in 2008 and 4.22 percent in 2009. That’s a 33 percent increase in 2008; then the 2008 percentage dropped 28.6 percent in 2009. As of October 2012, San Francisco barred all retailers, large and small, from providing single-use plastic bags, according to other Chronicle news stories and news blog entries. Also, the city began requiring retailers to charge a 10-cent fee for each other bag they give out. Both requirements will apply to restaurants starting in October 2013. Our ruling Springer said San Francisco’s "litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban" on plastic bags. A litter audit conducted before the ban took full effect found two more retail plastic bags than the previous year’s sampling. However, the next audit, launched after the ban had been fully in place for nearly a year, saw a two-bag drop. Maybe this means that such litter is decreasing, though we would want more research to reach definitive conclusions. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

pomt-08890	"Only a few months ago the FBI arrested three Broward County Commissioners for accepting millions of dollars in trade for illegal favors."	false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/30/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-says-three-broward-county-commissioners-a/	Arrests of public officials in South Florida have been common headlines in recent years. We've been witness to all sorts of drama including a school board member sticking cold hard cash in a doggie bag and later made famous by a photo of her running away from the cameras, a county commissioner receiving money in a golf bag and later crying at the courthouse, and an ex-city commissioner who once resolved a spat at Winn-Dixie with a gun and was later defiant at his sentencing in a corruption probe. All three of those officials hailed from Broward County -- a place where perhaps the most common question among observers and critics of politicians is, "Whose next?" Republican Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, who is running for attorney general, wants such government corruption stopped. But does Kottkamp have his facts right on which government officials had the handcuffs slapped on them for which crimes? On the morning of July 30, we looked at Kottkamp's campaign website and found his position paper on "Stopping Government Corruption" in which he vows to crack down on officials who violate the public's trust. Kottkamp wrote: "Only a few months ago the FBI arrested three Broward County Commissioners for accepting millions of dollars in trade for illegal favors. This rash of public corruption lead the Governor to petition the Florida Supreme Court to empanel a grand jury to investigate corruption in South Florida. I support this effort as a necessary first step to restore public confidence in government." For this claim, we will evaluate that first sentence in three parts: Were three Broward County Commisisoners arrested by the FBI? Did the three accept millions of dollars? And were the arrests a few months ago? We started with the Broward County Commission. So far, the feds have arrested only one Broward County Commissioner -- Josephus Eggelletion on Sept. 23, 2009 -- in a scheme in which he participated in laundering about $900,000 and profited about $23,000. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. In March, a tearful Eggelletion was sentenced to 30 months in prison. In July, the Broward State Attorney's Office announced the arrest of Broward County Commissioner Diana Wasserman-Rubin for seven counts of unlawful compensation, but the FBI was not involved. Prosecutors have accused her of repeatedly voting on grants that benefitted her husband who received $45,000 in bonuses. She has denied wrongdoing and has not had her first court hearing. But Eggelletion wasn't the only Broward notable to land in prison this year. On the same day that federal prosecutors announced their case against Eggelletion, they unveiled charges against School Board Member Beverly Gallagher (the doggie bag/dashing away from the press politician) and former Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman who was later defiant at his sentencing. Here is the press release that summarizes the separate charges in the Broward cases. Gallagher pleaded guilty to bribery for accepting about $9,000 from undercover agents posing as consultants trying to get school district business. In June she was sentenced to 37 months in prison. Salesman was convicted of bribery and extortion at trial for taking $3,340 from undercover agents who were trying to get business from the city of Miramar. Salesman was sentenced in July to 51 months in prison. So there clearly weren't three Broward County commissioners busted by the FBI -- only one Broward county commissioner was arrested by the feds. Or another way of looking at it: two politicians in Broward and a former politician in Broward were convicted after federal corruption probes -- none of which involved the convicts pocketing anywhere close to millions. But there were three Palm Beach County commissioners -- the county immediately to the north of Broward -- who were convicted in federal corruption probes between 2007 and 2009: Tony Masilotti, Warren Newell and Mary McCarty. There were also a list of other public officials in Broward -- including two on the Deerfield City Commission and a Davie town manager -- who have been charged with corruption in recent years. We spoke with Kottkamp campaign manager Jill Gran and spokesman David Bishop at about 10:40 a.m. July 30, 2010, and told them we thought the claim was wrong. "We didn't write it, by the way," Gran said. It was written by a researcher in conjunction with Kottkamp, she said. Bishop said they would look into it and if it was wrong they would correct it. Bishop sent us an e-mail less than two hours later saying they had made a mistake. "Our error was calling them Broward County commissioners when we should have said Broward County elected officials and then distinguish between county commissioner, school board member and former Miramar City commissioner. That has now been corrected on the website. It’s clear from the FBI news release that large sums of money were being transferred for illegal activity. That is why the issue paper says million[s] of dollars. We spoke with Bishop to ask him to clarify the "millions" part of the original claim. He pointed to the press release from the U.S. Attorney's office announcing the arrests, which stated about Eggelletion and his co-defendants (two businessmen and an attorney) "in a series of wire transfers, the defendants laundered approximately $900,000 from an account in Miami through the Bahamian account into an account controlled by the FBI in St. Croix. As well, the UCAs [undercover agents] discussed an additional $200,000 and $500,000 transfer with Eggelletion and [Ronald] Owens, respectively, but none of these additional funds was actually transferred." Bishop said: "Eggelletion may have only gotten $23,000 out of this but acted in conjunction with co-conspirators in attempting to defraud $900,000 and discussed $200,000 and $500,000. I can see where that can be confusing so we changed that as well." When the Kottkamp campaign changed the sentence on the website July 30, here is how they wrote it: "In September 2009, the FBI arrested a Broward County Commissioner, Broward County School Board Member and former Miramar City Commissioner on corruption charges." Note the campaign took out the "millions'' remark. The way they have it written now is accurate. "We acknowledge the mistake,'' Bishop said. "It was brought to our attention, and we fixed it as quickly as we could." In South Florida we've had quite a few public officials get arrested in recent years so we can understand how the average person could mix some of them up. (We think it would be fun and handy if someone would create trading cards to help the public keep their corrupt politicians straight.) But there has been extensive news coverage, press releases and court records on these cases making it easy for a high-profile candidate to get the facts right when summarizing in a sentence. So did Kottkamp get anything right here? Well there was one Broward County commissioner arrested by the FBI, but he did not accept millions -- though he was involved in laundering about $900,000. But Kottkamp did at least get one element of his sentence right: the timing of the arrests. Bishop said that the page was initially posted in February 2010 -- that was a few months after the September arrests of Eggelletion, Gallagher and Salesman. In total, Kottkamp's claim -- up on his website for about six months -- was wrong. Only time will tell if any other members of the Broward County Commission get arrested. Kottkamp's staff gets kudos for fixing it promptly, but it was wrong since February. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11040	"Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they've been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don't have high powered attorneys."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/jun/29/ted-lieu/do-more-450000-americans-sit-jail-because-they-are/	A California Democrat responded to news of Paul Manafort’s pretrial jailing by pointing out that many other Americans suffer the same fate, due to a simple lack of money. Responding to an appearance by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz on Fox & Friends in which Dershowitz called the pretrial jailing of Paul Manafort "unfair," U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu took to Twitter to point out how pretrial detention affects the poor. "Dear @AlanDersh: I hope you will work with us on bail reform. Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they've been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don't have high powered attorneys," Lieu tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Various media outlets and experts in the field have referred to a figure of 450,000 Americans when discussing the scope of the problems with bail. However, we wanted to figure out where Lieu got his numbers from, so we did some digging of our own. Ultimately, we found that the number in Lieu’s tweet is an overestimate of the number of Americans who are in jail because they can’t afford to pay bail. In addition, the statistic Lieu is referring to is not one that is kept nationally. In other words, no accurate count exists of the amount of people in jail in America who are too poor to pay bail, so there’s no way to fully verify Lieu’s claim. The real meaning of "over 450,000" We reached out to Lieu’s office and asked where they got the number of 450,000 Americans from. As evidence, Jenna Bushnell, Lieu’s communication director, cited a Marshall Project article and Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the latter of which discloses that there were 458,600 unconvicted inmates in local jails at the end of 2016. There’s just one problem: that’s not the statistic that Lieu is describing in the tweet. In his tweet, Lieu equates the Americans who "are in jail not because they’ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail" with the 458,600 count from the BJS report. However, the BJS statistic is a count of the total number of Americans who were detained and held in jail before their trials. That count includes those who can’t afford to pay bail, but it also includes other groups of people who are in jail before trial for different reasons. Included within that "over 450,000" statistic are people who are not bailable, like those being held without any bail, meaning that no amount of money paid would result in their release. In other words, Lieu’s tweet is an overestimation of the number of Americans who are too poor to bail their way out of jail. And there are still other groups included in the 458,600 figure. "The unconvicted population in jails can also include mentally-ill persons awaiting commitment to a mental-health facility," Darren Hutchinson, a University of Florida professor, told us. Lauryn Gouldin, an Associate Professor of Law at Syracuse University, said that it’s also important to distinguish between judges who make informed, intentional decisions about setting high bails, and judges who are more careless in their decisions. "Judges setting bail may be oblivious to the financial circumstances of those who end up detained (so is it ignorance/judicial accident that leads to detention) or judges may deliberately set high bails to assure detention for those they believe are high public safety/flight risks," Gouldin said. Because the BJS data only distinguishes "convicted" from "unconvicted" members of the jail population, there’s no way Lieu would know the exact number of how many people are in jail because they’re too poor to pay bail. Although the data on how many people can’t afford to pay bail is scarce, the experts we spoke to pointed to some resources that were the best data available. Gouldin cited a Vera Institute of Justice study that said nine out of 10 felony defendants are unable to afford the bail amount set by the judge. Meanwhile, Insha Rahman, a program director at the Vera Institute of Justice, pointed to two studies that locally analyzed how many people were being detained pretrial due to an inability to pay bail. In all three studies, a majority of the pretrial detainees were in jail because they could not afford to pay their bail. However, both Gouldin and Rahman cautioned against generalizing the results of these studies to the national unconvicted jail population. "I think the tweet is about as accurate as our scandalous lack of attention to what we are doing in the criminal system allows," Alec Karakatsanis, the founder and Executive Director of Civil Rights Corps, said. Gouldin concurred, saying "It would be great if we had more information about exactly how many of the (458,600 unconvicted Americans)...spend time in jail because they can’t afford bail. I think there is more attention being paid to the fact that we don’t have this information we should have." Our ruling Lieu tweeted, "Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they’ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don’t have high powered attorneys." The 450,000 number counts how many people are detained before their trials each year in America. However, Lieu uses it incorrectly here: included in that number are not only unconvicted inmates who are too poor to pay bail, but also unconvicted inmates who are being detained preventively and held without any bail. Experts confirmed that there is no national figure keeping track of how many unconvicted inmates are unable to pay bail. That said, the point of Lieu’s tweet—that some Americans languish in jail without ever being proven guilty—is largely accurate. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-09257	"At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/03/katrina-vanden-heuvel/vanden-heuvel-claims-energy-industry-isnt-investin/	With thousands of gallons of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico, conversation on the May 2, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week quickly turned to U.S. energy policy. Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation, argued that one way to prevent such spills in the future is to transition to a clean energy economy -- which she said will be difficult given how little energy companies invest in research and development. "At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D. We can do better. We are a nation which should do better ... and not rely on dirty energy, which just compounds the problem affecting this country and the planet," vanden Heuvel said. We thought that would be a relatively easy statistic to track down, but it led to a wild op-ed goose chase. Vanden Heuvel told us she got the information from a David Brooks column in the New York Times last week. His April 29 column lamented the minuscule amount of funding energy companies invest in R&D compared with other industries. "Technology companies spend 5 percent to 15 percent of revenue on research and development," he wrote. "Energy companies, on the other hand, spend only one-quarter of 1 percent. The federal government spends $30 billion on health research, but only $3 billion on clean energy research." But that, in turn, came from another opinion article: Brooks' assistant told us that he got it from an op-ed by Bill Gates and Chad Holliday, former chairman of DuPont, published a week earlier in the Washington Post. Here's what the duo wrote: "Our country is neglecting a field central to our national prospect and security: energy. Although the information technology and pharmaceutical industries spend 5 to 15 percent of their revenue on research and development each year, U.S. companies' spending on energy R&D has averaged only about one-quarter of 1 percent of revenue over the past 15 years." The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to our request for more background on the claim. But we found two sources that indicate vanden Heuvel is very close: A report published by the Brookings Institution last year shows the energy industry output in 2003 was about $1.2 trillion, and it spent about $2.4 billion on research and development -- about 0.2 percent of the industry's total output. Data from the National Science Foundation published in the federal Statistical Abstract of the United States shows the petroleum and coal products industry spent about 0.3 percent of its net sales on research and development in 2007, the most recent year available. According to the same data, R&D spending has hovered around 0.3 percent for several years. We also ran vanden Heuvel's claim by two experts who told us that it's pretty accurate. "It's close to correct," said Nate Lewis, a professor at California Institute of Technology who assisted on the Brookings Institution report. "As a percent of revenue, (the amount the energy industry spends on R&D) is a really small number. The pharmaceutical and intelligence industries spend between 10 and 12 percent on R&D. We're not even in the same ballpark here." So, even though vanden Heuvel was relying on another pundit for her claim (and he, in turn, was relying on an op-ed), the number is very close to numbers published by Brookings and the National Science Foundation. We find her claim True.	None	Katrina vanden Heuvel	None	None	None	2010-05-03T18:46:32	2010-05-02	['None']

pomt-12307	"Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/23/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-claim-seven-years-later-scott-walker-ha/	U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan blasted Gov. Scott Walker’s ability to keep his No.1 campaign promise during the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s annual convention. Pocan, D-Madison, attacked Walker and Republican lawmakers on job growth and other issues during his 15-minute speech, at one point focusing on the governor’s failed 2010 campaign promise to add 250,000 private-sector jobs within his first term. "Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs," Pocan said halfway through his June 2, 2017 speech. The convention took place as state Democrats seek to ramp up support among its base before the 2018 mid-term elections. Walker is expected to be on the ballot again, seeking a third term. So the promise is likely to come up again … and again. Here, we’ll briefly revisit Walker’s original promise, and see where the jobs tally currently stands. The promise In 2010, Walker first sought the governor’s office on the promise that he would bring 250,000 private-sector jobs to Wisconsin by the end of his first term. "(Scott Walker will) get government out of the way of employers ... who will then help Wisconsin create 250,000 jobs by 2015, and as we create those new jobs, we will be able to add 10,000 new businesses," his campaign said at the time. For the years 2011 through 2014, Wisconsin added 130,153 private-sector jobs, meaning Walker fell short of his first-term promise by about 100,000 jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. For this tally, we used the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which surveys nearly all state businesses, to get the most accurate picture for Walker's years in office. We made comparisons using the fourth quarter reports from the QCEW. On the Walk-O-Meter, which we use to track the governor’s campaign promises, we rated Walker’s pledge as a Promise Broken when economists said in September 2014 that it was impossible to reach his the target by the end of his first term. The picture since Wisconsin’s economy has continued to add jobs throughout Walker’s second term, but at a much slower pace. The fourth quarter numbers for 2015 and 2016 from the BLS show Wisconsin added 38,077 and 11,548 jobs respectively. The 2016 growth numbers were the worst during Walker’s tenure and the worst since the economy rebounded after the 2008-’09 recession. In total, Wisconsin has added a total of 179,778 private sector jobs during Walker’s near seven years as governor, which puts him 70,000 short of the pledged 250,000 new jobs. Pocan spokesman David Kolovson said in an email that the congressman’s claim was based on a March 12, 2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which stated the governor’s promise "remains elusive." The Journal Sentinel story listed the total number of jobs under Walker as 185,208, which differs from the total offered here because that article was published before the BLS released final numbers covering the end of 2016. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson also pointed to the same story and Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development numbers, saying in email "we don’t have anything to add." "Wisconsin’s business climate has consistently improved from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best under Governor Walker, and our state’s economy is in the best shape it’s been in 16 years," Evenson said quoted as saying in the March story. "We’ve seen more people employed than ever before, wages are up, and Wisconsin’s labor force participation rate continues to be one of the best in the country." And yet, the topic of job creation under Walker lingers. President Donald Trump ran on the platform of being a jobs president, famously saying "I’ll be the greatest jobs president God ever created." In a June 13, 2017 visit to Wisconsin, President Donald Trump hinted at a major manufacturer locating to Wisconsin. The Journal Sentinel reported on June 15 that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that assembles Apple’s iPhones and other electronics, is considering Wisconsin as the site for a 1,000-acre manufacturing plant, which could generate thousands of jobs. Our rating At the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s state convention, Pocan said, "Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs." Pocan is right to say Walker hasn’t hit his first campaign promise. In 2014, we rated Walker’s campaign pledge as a Promise Broken. The number of jobs created still falls short of that promise. We rate Pocan’s statement True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2017-06-23T05:00:00	2017-06-02	['None']

pomt-07684	"On my first day in office, I ordered a review of every regulation in the pipeline and every contract exceeding $1 million."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/08/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-highlights-regulation-freeze-first-/	Over and over during his campaign for governor, Rick Scott said state government regulations were killing jobs and that state spending had spun out of control. Scott used part of his first State of the State speech on March 8, 2011, to highlight what he'd done to rein back government red tape. "On my first day in office, I ordered a review of every regulation in the pipeline and every contract exceeding $1 million," Scott told a joint session of the Legislature at the start of its 60-day legislative session. Is Scott right? Mostly. Within an hour of his inauguration, Scott issued Executive Order No. 11-01, which required "all agencies under the direction of the governor to immediately suspend all rulemaking." The order also imposed a 90-day suspension on contracts with a value in excess of $1 million. As part of the order, both the contracts and rules needed the approval of the governor's new Office of Fiscal Accountability and Regulatory Reform. Scott denied his first contract on Feb. 18, according to the St. Petersburg Times, rejecting an $18 million Medicaid contract between MedSolutions and the Agency for Health Care Administration for outpatient imaging services. Here's the text explaining the governor's decision to reject the contract. "Beginning Fiscal Year 2005-06 through Fiscal Year 2008-09, the following proviso was inserted and continued in the General Appropriations Act: From the funds in Specific Appropriation XXX, the agency is authorized to implement a utilization management program for outpatient diagnostic services. To date, the agency never implemented a utilization management program for outpatient diagnostic services. Proviso language is only valid for one year. The last time the above-mentioned proviso was in the General Appropriations Act was Fiscal Year 2008-09. It is uncertain if the agency would still have authority to implement such a program. The agency is unable to provide an independent study or other supporting data which would validate significant savings to the Medicaid program if such a $18,000,000.00 program were implemented." The caveat here is that while the governor instituted the freeze for the offices he controls, many state agencies were not asked to comply, including those led by members of the Florida Cabinet. On Jan. 14, the three members of the Cabinet, all Republicans -- Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam -- told the Times that they would not comply with Scott's request to have pending regulations in their offices frozen and then reviewed by the governor's office before becoming effective. "We are not sending our rules to the governor's office," Atwater spokesman Sterling Ivey said. "We are looking at all of our rules internally to make sure they align with the direction the commissioner wants to go with the department." Scott is right that he froze regulations and certain contracts upon taking office. But it didn't apply to all state agencies, and we've only found one contract that's actually been denied since the freeze took effect. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08805	The United States is "number 14, number 15" in college graduation rates, and "we're leading the world in high school dropout rates."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/17/laura-tyson/laura-tyson-correct-us-lag-college-grads-overstate/	During the Aug. 15, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Laura Tyson -- who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton -- discussed what she considers a root problem with the American economy and the current rash of high unemployment. She said, "Let me turn to investment in education. It is the case -- we used to be number one in the world in college graduation rates. We are now number 14, number 15. We're leading the world in high school dropout rates. And as I said, the unemployment problem is most severe in dropouts." (In fact, we rated a separate claim of hers from This Week that compared unemployment rates for those with and without college degrees. We gave it a Mostly True.) We wondered whether it was true that the United States ranks 14th or 15th internationally in college graduation rates and whether we're really first in high school dropout rates. To answer the question, we turned to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies. It produces statistics on a wide variety of economic and social topics that are considered the best way to compare the U.S. to its international peers. On college graduation rates, we found a table that compared 22 countries in 2007 on what proportion of the population has graduated from college by the typical college graduation age in that country. On that list, the U.S. does indeed rank 14th, with 36.5 percent having a college degree. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Sweden and the United Kingdom all ranked higher than the U.S., while Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Switzerland all ranked lower. So on this statistic, Tyson seems to be correct. Meanwhile, the OECD doesn't directly calculate high school dropout rates. We can come close by looking at a statistic that the group does track -- high school graduation rates. We looked at another table and found that the U.S. has the eighth-lowest high-school graduation rate among the countries studied. The U.S. trails Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The countries with a lower high-school graduation rate are Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey. So on this one, Tyson is off by quite a bit, though the U.S. still has higher dropout rates than the OECD average. Meanwhile, several experts warned us about a few caveats to keep in mind about these international comparisons. First, in some countries -- especially Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom -- the college graduation rates can be skewed by the presence of a lot of foreign college students. When the percentage is calculated, these students add to the numerator (that is, the number of students graduating college) but not to the denominator (the universe of possible native-born students), thus making the percentages seem higher than they would be otherwise. Second, despite the OECD's best efforts to standardize the data, there are still some variations from country to country in the nature and quality of the statistics. We noticed that while the college graduation rate for the U.S. and a number of other OECD countries rose by a few percentage points from 2000 to 2007, several countries posted increases of 10 to 15 percentage points, and Iceland nearly doubled its rate from 33 percent to 63 percent. Such massive increases probably stem from a mixture of methodological differences and a concerted effort in Europe to improve educational attainment during the past decade, said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education and a specialist in international statistical comparisons. "But overall, OECD is generally reliable for assessing the big picture, if not the fine points," he added. So let's recap. Allowing for some general caution over international education comparisons, Tyson was on the money where college graduation rates were concerned, but was wrong that the U.S. led the world in high-school dropout rates. She bats .500, so we rate her statement Half True.	None	Laura Tyson	None	None	None	2010-08-17T15:48:46	2010-08-15	['United_States']

pomt-00258	"The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world. That happened just recently."	half-true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/04/donald-trump/united-states-no-1-energy-producer-world/	Energy production -- particularly coal production -- has long been an integral part of West Virginia’s economy. During the 2016 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump vowed to send coal miners back to work and end the regulations on carbon emissions sought by President Barack Obama. Coal-producing states, particularly West Virginia, responded with strong support. So when Trump came to Wheeling, W.Va., for a rally on Sept. 29, it was no surprise that he touted the nation’s record in harnessing its energy resources. "The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world," Trump said at the rally. "That happened just recently." Is he correct? Petroleum and crude oil According to the Energy Information Administration, the federal office that collects energy statistics, 2017 data -- the most recent available -- shows that the United States ranks first in production of petroleum and other liquid fuels. The United States has a sizable lead over both Saudi Arabia and Russia. It’s been a tighter contest for a subset of petroleum production -- crude oil production -- but the United States has a case for the top spot as well. EIA projections released in September 2018 show that the United States likely edged past Saudi Arabia and Russia in crude oil production sometime this summer. Natural gas The United States also ranks first in natural gas production, according to EIA data for 2015, the most recent year available. Russia is the only close competitor in this category. Coal This is the one category where the United States is not the leader. According to 2016 data from the Energy Information Administration, the United States ranked third, behind China -- the world’s clear leader -- and India. The question of timing Beyond the question of who’s No. 1, Trump also said that this achievement "happened just recently." With the exception of the recent shift in crude oil, that’s not the case. As we noted in a 2015 fact-check, the United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years. Our ruling Trump said, "The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world. That happened just recently." The United States does rank first internationally in petroleum, crude oil, and natural gas production, though it ranks third in the world in coal production. Meanwhile, only for crude oil was the No. 1 spot achieved recently. For petroleum and natural gas, the United States has ranked first for years. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-05838	Florida "unemployment has dropped more than 2 percentage points, down from 12 percent to 9.9 percent, the second-largest drop in the nation."	true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/16/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-unemployment-rate-had-sec/	The unemployment rate in Florida is on the mend, said Gov. Rick Scott at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 11, 2012. As evidence for his claim, he cited the state’s unemployment rate. "In my first year in office, unemployment has dropped more than 2 percentage points, down from 12 percent to 9.9 percent, the second-largest drop in the nation," Scott said. We wanted to know if Scott had his numbers right, particularly on whether Florida has seen the second-largest drop in the nation. We should note that it’s too early to say whether Scott should get credit for putting Florida’s economy on the road to recovery. In the speech, he’s clearly claiming some credit, but we’ve examined Scott’s campaign promise to create 700,000 jobs, and -- for a variety of reasons -- we’ve rated it Stalled. Here, we’re looking only at Scott’s numerical claim, that unemployment is down during his first year in office, and that it’s the second-largest drop in the country. To check his claim, we turned to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. In December 2010, the month before Scott took office, the unemployment rate was 12 percent. In December 2011, the most recent month for which statistics were available, the unemployment rate was 9.9 percent. So unemployment dropped 2.1 percent. The BLS also ranks states based on how much unemployment has fallen. Sure enough, Florida was in second place in December 2011, right behind Nevada, which dropped 2.3 percentage points, from 14.9 percent to 12.6 percent. We should note that Florida’s rate has dropped the second-most because the state’s unemployment rate has been one of the highest in the nation. And even with the 2.1 percentage point decrease, Florida still has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country. (Nevada is No. 1.) That mitigates the significance of Scott's claim but not the veracity of it. We rate his statement True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-02-16T11:26:38	2012-02-11	['None']

pomt-10509	The Jewish holiday Purim is "their version of Halloween here."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/20/john-mccain/costumes-yes-but-not-halloween/	Sen. John McCain's weeklong overseas trip to Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Britain and France in March 2008 was a bumpy one for accuracy. Thankfully, he had Sen. Joe Lieberman for a traveling companion. During a visit to Israel, McCain was making a somber point about the strain of Hamas rocket attacks on Israel when he dropped in a bit of a cultural gaffe, likening the Jewish holiday of Purim to Halloween. "Nine hundred rocket attacks in less than three months, an average of one every one to two hours," McCain said, during a news conference with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on March 19, 2008. "Obviously this puts an enormous and hard to understand strain on the people here, especially the children. As they celebrate their version of Halloween here, they are somewhere close to a 15-second warning, which is the amount of time they have from the time the rocket is launched to get to safety. That's not a way for people to live obviously." When Lieberman had a chance to speak at the news conference, he took the fall for McCain's mistake. "I had a brief exchange with one of the mothers whose children was in there in a costume for Purim," said Lieberman, who became the first Jewish candidate on the presidential ticket for a major American political party when he ran with Al Gore in 2000. "And it's my fault that I said to Senator McCain that this is the Israeli version of Halloween. It is in the sense because the kids dress up and it's a very happy holiday and actually it is in the sense that the sweets are very important of both holidays." Purim is a minor Jewish holiday whose roots come from a story in the Book of Esther in the Bible. According to the story, Esther was a beauty pageant winner who became queen to King Ahasuerus of Persia, but kept her Jewishness a secret. When the king's villainous minister, Haman, persuaded the king to wipe out all the Jews in the kingdom, Esther's uncle Mordecai persuaded Esther to reveal her Jewish identity to the king, and plead with him to spare her people. The king had Haman killed and elevated Mordecai to minister. "It is a story that teaches about standing up for who you are and standing up for one's community," said Rabbi Michael Torop of Temple Beth-El in St. Petersburg, and president of the Pinellas County Board of Rabbis. "It's also about standing up against hatred and injustice." During Purim, Jewish people often hold a costume parade and re-enact the story, Torop said. People sometimes dress up as kings, queens and villians from the story, but the custom has expanded into a wider variety of costumes as well (though it does not include ghouls, witches and other scary costumes commonly seen at Halloween). And friends often exchange a plate or basket of sweets, usually to include a specific pastry called hamantashen. "The only way in which Purim is like Halloween is in the wearing of costumes," said Torop. "At that point, the similarities end." Torop said he doesn't find McCain's comment offensive, but says it shows "this is one person who doesn't get it. He doesn't really understand (Purim's) meaning and its message." Which would be fine, Torop said, but when someone decides to make a public comment about someone else's faith or religion, they ought to at least understand a bit about it. Later, McCain tried to smooth things over, saying, "Could I just say that I understand this is the holiday of Hadassah, otherwise known as Esther." Lieberman's wife is named Hadassah. That's the Hebrew name of Esther, Torop said, explaining the joke McCain appeared to be making. On a Political Gaffe scale of 1 to 10, with a one being John Kerry referring to the Green Bay Packers' hallowed home as "Lambert Field" and Dan Quayle telling that poor 6th-grader to add an "e" to the end of potato being a 15, we'd rate McCain's as maybe a two. He gets a bit of a pass because he apparently got bad info from his Jewish tour guide, Lieberman. And inasmuch as both holidays involve getting dressed up, it's somewhat understandable. But still, it's False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-03-20T00:00:00	2008-03-19	['None']
pomt-02551	Says he didn't tell viewers that the Obama campaign hid news about the motives behind the attack in Benghazi because Obama was running for re-election.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/04/bill-oreilly/oreilly-denies-accusing-wh-political-motives-early/	The real fireworks of Super Bowl Sunday happened long before the snoozer of a football game between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks. The matchup: Fox News host Bill O’Reilly versus President Barack Obama. For 10 minutes in the lead-up to the big game, O’Reilly grilled the president about the botched rollout of the government’s health care website, IRS officials who scrutinized conservative advocacy groups and the president’s reaction to the fatal attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, which left the American ambassador and three other Americans dead. On Benghazi, O’Reilly and the president had this testy exchange: O'Reilly: Your detractors believe that you did not tell the world it was a terror attack because your campaign didn't want that out. Obama: Bill, think about... O'Reilly: That's what they believe. Obama: -- and they believe it because folks like you are telling them that. O'Reilly: No, I'm not telling them that. The exchange was taken by some as Obama lashing out at Fox News and others as O’Reilly grandstanding. O'Reilly, who has been with Fox News since 1996, drew more than 4 million viewers for his Feb. 3, 2014, episode, which included more of the Obama interview. As fact-checkers, we can’t address either notion. But we wondered about O’Reilly’s claim that he did not peddle a narrative that Obama withheld information about the Benghazi attacks in order to advance his presidential campaign. A Benghazi timeline To refresh your memory, ground zero in this part of the Benghazi debate came Sept. 16, 2012, when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said on national television that the attack on the compound began spontaneously and was not pre-planned. The reality is murkier than that statement would imply, though the exact nature of the attack remains at least somewhat unclear. O’Reilly didn’t press Obama on what happened on the ground in Benghazi. He focused on how the administration characterized the attack. Rice’s interview came less than two months before what looked to be a very tight presidential election. So let’s look at what the White House said in the days surrounding the attack. Sept. 11 - A mix of a mob and armed attackers launch grenades and set fire to the American compound. Sept. 12 -- Obama said "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation." He repeats those words on Sept. 13 and 14. Sept. 13 -- White House spokesman Jay Carney referred to an inflammatory video and said, "The protests we're seeing around the region are in reaction to this movie. They are not directly in reaction to any policy of the United States or the government of the United States or the people of the United States." Sept. 14 -- A State Department spokeswoman said, "We are very cautious about drawing any conclusions with regard to who the perpetrators were, what their motivations were, whether it was premeditated." But she ended with this: "Obviously, there are plenty of people around the region citing this disgusting video as something that has been motivating." Sept. 16 -- Rice said, "We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned." Sept. 20 -- Carney told reporters, "It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials." Sept. 20 -- Obama told an audience at a town hall meeting, "What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests." Sept. 21 -- The administration as a whole stated publicly that the attack was planned and executed by a terrorist group. Based on that record, O'Reilly isn't 100 percent correct to say Obama "did not tell the world it was a terror attack." But our question is whether O’Reilly advanced that argument and said it was for political reasons. O’Reilly on the record We searched transcripts and videos of The O’Reilly Factor and found that O’Reilly did not exactly say he personally believes that political strategists intervened to shape what Rice and others said. However, for more than a year, O’Reilly continued to raise the question when other news networks had less interest. And O’Reilly consistently cast the question of what happened during those 10 days in the worst possible light. A conversation between O’Reilly and retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters on May 6, 2013, is a prime example. O'Reilly: You believe the Obama administration did not tell the truth to the world, not just the American people, on purpose, for political reasons. That’s what you believe? Peters: I believe that President Obama lied to the American people. O'Reilly: Himself. Peters: Himself. Sec. (Hillary) Clinton lied to Congress. Susan Rice lied to the U.N.. Jay Carney lied to the media. And the mainstream establishment media have protected this administration right down the line. O’Reilly then said, "Those are very serious charges, impeachable charges, if proven. How likely are we to get proof this week or going onward about what you believe?" Peters said the proof is already there for those who want to see it. O’Reilly didn’t challenge Peters to prove his case. He did say that concrete proof would be needed. Then he pivoted to another Fox News analyst who described an Israeli airstrike on a Syrian weapons compound. With this, O’Reilly raised the specter of American military intervention in Syria. "You know what Bill Clinton did when he got in trouble with Monica Lewinsky. He started to bomb," O’Reilly said. "To divert attention and the ‘wag the dog’ theory. But we’re not going to speculate on that. All we’re going to do is report the facts." Presumed political interference A few days later on May 10, 2013 -- eight months after the Benghazi attack -- O’Reilly interviewed ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl on Fox News and posed a question in a way that assumed a cover-up. "Here is the bottom line," O’Reilly said. "We need to find out who in the White House drove this, whether it was the president or somebody else trying to protect him in a re-election campaign. That's the main story, is it not?" In a November interview on ABC with George Stephanopoulos as part of a book tour, O’Reilly asked, "Who told her (Rice) to mislead the American public?" On other occasions, O’Reilly invoked Watergate and the impeachments of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. In 2012, during his Talking Points Memo segment, he asked if "the Libya situation is another Watergate?" While conceding that this could turn out to be a "big nothing," O’Reilly pressed the comparison. "Look at it this way," O’Reilly said. "Back in 1972, Richard Nixon denied he had anything to do with a low-level political break in. If the press had not been aggressive, Nixon would have gotten away with it. And certainly the break in at the Watergate Hotel was not nearly as important as failing to define a terrorist attack that killed four Americans." In addition, O’Reilly told his viewers that they would not get the complete story from other large news organizations. "We all know the media is sympathetic to Barack Obama," he said in his May interview with the Fox analysts. "We all know they nurture him. They root for him. And they even promote his policies. That is beyond a reasonable doubt." Appealing to Fox viewers O’Reilly’s enduring interest in Benghazi fits with the Fox News audience. A May 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to follow the latest news about Benghazi and that over half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents regularly watch Fox News. This group voiced the greatest frustration with the Benghazi situation. "Fully 79 percent of Republicans who regularly watch Fox News say the Obama administration has been dishonest," the report said. That O’Reilly might stick with the Benghazi story comes as no surprise to Mike Conway, a journalism professor at Indiana University. "The Fox audience would like the news to reflect what they believe," Conway said. "If it makes a Democrat look bad, that story will resonate stronger and if a story resonates with your core audience, that’s a reason to stay with it." Our ruling O’Reilly said he didn't tell viewers that the Obama campaign hid news about the motives behind the attack in Benghazi because he was running for re-election. While O’Reilly did not use those exact words, he consistently said that someone was trying to mislead the American public. He repeatedly compared the situation to the impeachments of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. O’Reilly nurtured suspicion. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-06007	"In campaigns in the past with Sen. McCain and President George W. Bush and others, they have tended to release tax records in April."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-presidential-candidates-tend-rele/	Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, under pressure to release his tax records, now says he'll do it in April 2012 — when taxes are due. Why wait? That's tradition, he argued at the Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Jan. 16. "You know, I looked at what has been done in campaigns in the past with Sen. McCain and President George W. Bush and others. They have tended to release tax records in April or tax season," he said. Later, he added, "And if I become our nominee, and what's happened in history is people have released them in about April of the coming year, and that's probably what I would do." PolitiFact has already checked whether presidential candidates usually release their tax returns, a claim we found Mostly True. (There are several notable exceptions, such as publisher Steve Forbes in 1996.) But the question of timing intrigued us: Is April truly the month of choice? McCain, Bush and others We reviewed news accounts going back six presidential elections for clues. We've got to mention that there's nothing new about the battle for tax records. Candidates aren't required to disclose them and sometimes don't. Competitors and the press browbeat Jesse Jackson for weeks before he released returns in 1988. Forbes' refusal to release tax records became a hot campaign issue in 1996, since he focused on a proposal for a flat tax. And no sooner had John Kerry released his own tax records in 2004 than the drumbeat began for his wife's financial history. But back to Romney's appeal to an April tradition. Here's what we found: • April is a typical month to release tax records for the most recent year. It only makes sense — a candidate would file his or her tax return, then release it to the public. There were exceptions, of course, with candidates dragging their feet for weeks or refusing to release records at all. • Romney focused on two candidates who released tax records after they had wrapped up the GOP nomination, but plenty of primary contenders joined the disclosure-fest earlier in the process. (In 2008, several Republicans declined, but in 2004, all the major Democratic contenders released at least a year's returns, according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.) • On Bush and McCain, Romney was generally right. In 2000, Bush released estimates of his earnings and taxes in April but got a six-month extension to release the actual forms in October. In 2004, as president, Bush released records in April. In 2008, Republican nominee McCain released tax records in April. (Democratic primary candidate Hillary Clinton also released her tax return in April; Obama released a batch in March, then his most recent return in April.) • But the April trend was less clear when it came to previous years' tax records. In 1996, Republican candidate Bob Dole released 30 years of tax returns in January, weeks before he became the presumptive nominee. In 1987, Democrat Michael Dukakis released five years of federal tax returns in November — in advance of the election year and well before the primaries. Dole one-upped him in January 1988 with 21 years of tax returns. Who kicked off all this voluntary transparency? Romney's father, George, who as a presidential candidate in 1967 released 12 years of income tax returns — in November before election year. For a quick glimpse at when candidates released returns for the last six presidential races, here's a nonexhaustive list. (It doesn't include every primary candidate, such as the batch of Democrats in 2004 — many of whom were already in the habit of annually releasing returns — nor all sitting presidents, who typically release returns when they file. Both of those categories, because they mostly reflect current returns released around the same time they are filed, would further bulk up the April list.) Months for tax return releases November before election year: Bill Bradley, 1999 Michael Dukakis, 1987 (5 years' worth) January: Bob Dole, 1996 (30 years' worth) Phil Gramm, 1996 Bob Dole, 1988 (21 years' worth) March: Barack Obama, 2008 (6 years' worth) April: Barack Obama, 2008 (his just filed return) Hillary Clinton, 2008 John McCain, 2008 John Kerry, 2004 George W. Bush, 2000 Al Gore, 2000 Bob Dole, 1996 Bill Clinton, 1992 (12 years' worth) May: Michael Dukakis, 1988 Jesse Jackson, 1988 Our ruling Romney's right that there's a strong April trend for releasing tax records, especially among politicians who practice annual disclosure. But that's not Romney's history — he's steadfastly refused to open his personal tax records for public consumption. That weakens his appeal to tradition. He could just as easily follow in the footsteps of Obama, Bill Clinton, Dukakis, Dole and his own father and release a batch of earlier federal tax returns now. Meanwhile, he implies that only party nominees release their tax records — when recent history shows primary candidates opening their files to inspection. His statement that candidates "have tended to release tax records in April" is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-01974	"There are 278 Republicans in Congress. (With Eric Cantor's defeat), they are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/18/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-without-eric-cantor-republicans-co/	Dave Brat’s surprise primary win over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor didn’t just knock out a potential successor to Speaker John Boehner. Because Cantor was Jewish, the lone voice for religious diversity in the GOP’s congressional ranks will also disappear, argued Bill Maher, host of HBO’s Real Time. "Now there are no non-Christian Republicans. This is an amazing fact," Maher said June 13. "There are 278 Republicans in Congress. They are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed. So this is an entirely Christian, white party." Does Cantor’s primary defeat mean Republicans in Congress are now all white and all Christian? Republicans ‘all Christian’ The 2012 elections ushered in the first Buddhist in the Senate (Hawaii’s Mazie Hirono, a Democrat), the first Hindu in either chamber (Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat), and the first Congress member to list her religious affiliation as "none" (Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat), according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which recorded the religious affiliation of members for a 2012 report. They joined two Muslims (Democrats) and a Unitarian Universalist (a Democrat). When it comes to Republicans, 192 of 278 GOP members identify with a Protestant denomination (Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc.), 70 identify as Catholic, three are Orthodox Christian, and 12 are Mormon (more on that in a moment). Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, is Jewish and makes No. 278, but Brat, the Republican who could succeed him after the November election, is Catholic. The only possible hang-up to Maher’s claim when examining the current makeup of Congress when it comes to religion is how you view Mormonism. Some Christians do not recognize Mormons, belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as Christians. Mormons do consider themselves Christians. Republicans ‘all white’ Maher also said the GOP’s congressional ranks are all-white except for one appointed African-American official. That’s Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who resigned his House seat for a Senate appointment in January 2013. To say the other Republicans in Congress are all white depends on your definition of "all white," which isn’t always so easy to define. There are no other African-American Republicans in Congress (there are 43 black Democrats). There also are no Asian or Pacific Islander Republicans in Congress (there are 13 Democrats). But there are three Hispanic Republican senators and seven Hispanic Republicans in the House, according to the Congressional Research Service. That includes Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Florida Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, and Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, born in Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau, however, does not include Hispanic or Latino as a racial designation, instead using the categories white, black, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian. The Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnicity, which is based on cultural or linguistic similarity. Hispanics could identify with any race depending on the region from where they descend, or list none at all. Pew says as many as 6.2 percent of census respondents selected "some other race" in the 2010 census, the vast majority of whom were Hispanic. And there is a movement to include Hispanic as a racial category in future censuses, says Kevin Dougherty, Baylor University sociology professor. "To say they are all white, you think they have very fair skin and have European descent," Dougherty said. "It does mask an important source of diversity that is present among Republicans in Congress." It’s not just Hispanics who are unaccounted for in Maher’s claim. We know of two Republicans that are enrolled members of federally recognized American Indian tribes. The first is Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation tribe. The second is freshman Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. The timeline of all this One more critical point: When Maher says the Republicans in Congress are "now" all white and all Christian, that’s not accurate -- Cantor isn’t going anywhere yet. The GOP’s lone Jewish member will not leave until his replacement is sworn into office in early 2015, after the midterm elections. And as he leaves office, it’s possible that new non-white, non-Christian Republicans could take seats in Congress. There are several possibilities: Mia Love, a Republican African-American running for Congress in Utah, is a far-and-away favorite to win a seat in the U.S. House come November. Will Hurd, an African-American Republican, secured the GOP nomination in Texas’ most-competitive House district (which backed Mitt Romney for president in 2012). T.W. Shannon, an African-American Republican, has the support of Texas’ Cruz in Shannon’s bid for an Oklahoma Senate seat. (His primary is June 24.) A Jewish Republican and state lawmaker, Adam Kwasman, is running in the Republican primary in Arizona’s 1st Congressional District. Our ruling Without Cantor, Maher said, the GOP in Congress is "now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed." Maher’s show did not respond to a request for comment. If we learned anything from this fact-check, it is that straightforward sounding claims about religion and race are rarely that straightforward. Still, Maher’s unequivocal statement glosses over some diversity within the GOP’s ranks. On religion, Maher's claim comes down to how you view Mormonism. On race, the question is even more murky. There are two members of federally recognized American Indian tribes, which is classified as a race by the U.S. Census Bureau, and there are as many 10 Republicans in the House and Senate with Hispanic roots. Some may consider their race white, Hispanic or something else. Also, Cantor isn’t leaving office until the end of his term in January. It’s possible the November elections will bring non-Christian or non-white Republican members who will take office when Cantor leaves. Maher’s statement is partially accurare but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08624	"Ganley said that if elected, he wants to ‘cut the dickens’ out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/20/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-campaign-claims-tom-ganley-wants-cut-/	Tom Ganley is the first serious challenger that Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton has faced since she was first elected to Congress in 2006. The wealthy auto dealer from Brecksville won the GOP nod to run against her and funneled more than $2 million of his personal fortune into his campaign. In an effort to fill her own campaign coffers, Sutton has sent fundraising missives to supporters. A fundraising email in early September from her campaign began: "Dishonest used car dealer Tom Ganley is at it again, and this time he’s going after seniors and veterans. Recently, Ganley said that if elected, he wants to ‘cut the dickens’ out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits." Does Ganley want to play Scrooge with popular entitlement programs? AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka repeated the claim at the Lorain Labor Day Festival, where he and Sutton appeared together. "And how about Republican candidate Tom Ganley of Akron, who wants Betty Sutton’s job?" Trumka asked the crowd. "He’s the guy with the Mercedes dealership who promises to – and I quote – ‘cut the Dickens’ out of Medicare, Social Security and Veterans’ benefits for average working people." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look, and contacted Ganley campaign spokesperson, Meghan Snyder, who says it ain’t so. Ganley believes programs like Social Security should be protected and Democrats are twisting his words from an Aug. 29 interview with the conservative news site "Human Events," she says. In that interview, Ganley said he wants to freeze all federal spending for at least a year "and then surgically attack it. National defense should be left alone, but everything else should be on the table and studied carefully. So much of the budget is now mandated, that we have to re-open entitlements. All domestic discretionary spending should have the dickens cut out of it." According to the federal budgeting experts at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Medicare, Social Security and Veterans’ benefits are not considered discretionary spending under the federal budget. They are entitlement programs. Unlike discretionary programs, entitlements are not controlled by yearly appropriations from Congress. About a third of the federal budget is considered discretionary, including areas like education, health research and housing. Discretionary areas like those are where Ganley said "the dickens" should be cut. We talked to AFL-CIO spokesman Josh Goldstein, who defended Trumka’s assertion. Ganley’s words to Human Events clearly state "he wants to cut everything but defense and then tags the dickens line to ‘discretionary,’ " Goldstein said. He noted that the distorted version of Ganley’s quote was also picked up by the liberal "Buckeyestateblog," and was cited in a Lorain Morning Journal "Letter to the Editor." "I do think the quote there clearly states his intentions," Goldstein said in an email. "You are right to point out the unintended mistake in directly quoting, but there’s no question that the point is completely accurate." Sutton campaign manager Julie Sweet sent an email that gave her rationale for claiming Ganley wants to cut "the dickens" out of particular entitlement programs, when he actually said "the dickens" should be cut from discretionary programs. 　 "Tom Ganley’s statement to Human Events couldn’t be any clearer: Entitlements – which his spokesperson says include Social Security, Medicare, and programs designed to benefit older Americans – should be re-opened and therefore not protected as mandatory spending. And if he doesn’t want them to be mandatory spending, he wants them to be discretionary, and he wants to cut the dickens out of discretionary spending." We think Ganley’s statement is clear, and it doesn’t say what the campaign claims it says. Sutton could justifiably question the meaning of his assertion that entitlements should be reopened. But she’s also a veteran member of Congress who knows that’s not done easily. And the claim that Ganley wants to "cut the dickens" out of Medicare, Social Security and Veterans programs is a leap. Ganley never told Human Events he wants to cut "the dickens" out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits. That’s why we rate this as a Pants on Fire claim. Comment on this item.

pomt-11631	"Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jan/22/rahm-emanuel/chicagos-private-sector-employment-really-highest-/	In a recent WGN radio interview, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel boasted that the count of private sector jobs in the city had hit an all-time high even as employment statewide sagged. "Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city," Emanuel told host Steve Cochran. "And we’re doing it even with a state that’s actually dragging us back." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To put a fine point on it, Emanuel repeated the claim a minute later. "I just told you, Chicago now has the highest private sector employment — ever," the mayor said, stressing the word "ever." All of which raises a demographic and workplace quandary. Census data make clear that the Chicago of today is a much smaller place than the Chicago of yesteryear. State officials counted nearly 1.18 million private sector jobs in Chicago, a number Emanuel’s office says is a record. How then to reconcile that claim with a city population swoon dating back to the 1950s? We decided to check. The exceptions that prove the rule Chicago was long known as the "second city," and while there is debate about the derivation of that nickname it is clear that for much of the last century the city trailed only New York in size. Census data show the city’s population peaked at 3.6 million in the official 1950 count. It was a very different era. South Side steel mills were thriving and the stockyards of "hog butcher to the world" fame were humming. The postwar suburban boom was only in its infancy, and the expressway system that eventually would make reverse commutes feasible had yet to be laid out. Just shy of 1.5 million Chicago residents held private sector jobs, according to the 1950 census, more than one-third of which were in manufacturing industries. Back then, Chicago’s workforce was still very much a collection of lunch-pail toting, blue-collar strap hangars, the decline of which is much lamented by politicians of today. The city’s population dwindled over the intervening decades, as did the number of jobs held by its residents. Today, the census pegs the city’s population at 2.7 million, down 900,000 from its 1950 high. But as late as 1970, census data show the population stood at nearly 3.4 million, with 1.2 million employed in the private sector. Yet Emanuel says private sector employment in the city is the highest ever. For an explanation, we reached out to the mayor’s office, where Emanuel spokesman Grant Klinzman pointed us to a December report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. Klinzman said the nearly 1.18 million private sector jobs for Chicago were the highest in the history of the state report, which is issued annually. That explanation is problematic. In his radio remarks, Emanuel was emphatic that the 2017 jobs numbers were "the highest in the history of the city," not just in the history of the report. What’s more, the Chicago numbers aren’t the highest in the history of the report, not by a longshot. Indeed, IDES spokesman Bob Gough said the state report series goes back to the 1950s, though only the last few decades worth of reports are posted online. Gough provided a copy of an old report that detailed city jobs numbers dating back to 1957. That year, it showed, Chicago logged 1.38 million private sector jobs—200,000 more than the current figure Emanuel says is a record. In 1990, the IDES private sector job tally for Chicago stood at 1.2 million, still in excess of the 2017 total. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Gough said the methodology of data collection had changed over the years, but the bottom line employment numbers were unaffected. While Emanuel’s claim is contradicted by both state employment and federal census data, it’s important to note that the two agencies measure different things so their results don’t perfectly align. The census counts jobs held by Chicago residents, while the IDES counts jobs physically located in the city even if they are held by suburbanites and other non-residents. When we ran the old census data by Klinzman, he dismissed the line of questioning as irrelevant. "At this point, we are parsing footnotes on a census report that predates the Eisenhower Administration," he wrote in an email. Experts we spoke with didn’t see it that way. "Just the raw population of the city of Chicago in 1950 was 3.6 million people," said Peter Creticos, director of the Chicago-based Institute for Work and the Economy. "We're at 2.7 (million). Just sort of on the face of it, you start to wonder." Our ruling Emanuel said,"Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city." That claim is refuted by a broad array of both state and federal jobs data which show Chicago was once a much bigger city with many more residents employed and many more jobs within the city limits than it has today. There is no doubt that the city jobs picture is brighter now than it has been in quite some time. But Emanuel took inarguably good news and sought to make it stupendous with his unsupportable contention that Chicago’s count of private sector jobs is now greater than at any time in the city’s history.

pomt-07996	"Every dropout costs us $72,000 for the life of that person."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jan/16/robert-flanders/education-chairman-says-each-high-school-dropout-c/	With Rhode Island facing a budget crisis, officials are desperate to find ways to generate more revenue or save money. During a Dec. 17, 2010, budget summit, Robert G. Flanders Jr., chairman of the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education, said bringing down the state's high school dropout rate could be the key because a well-educated work force would attract new business. In addition, he said, there could be a direct monetary benefit to government as well. "The biggest thing I think we can do at the state level to promote savings is to do a better job of keeping kids in school and not having them turn out to be dropouts because the dropout problem -- it's not unique to Rhode Island of course -- but every dropout costs us $72,000 for the life of that person, whereas any person who has a college degree is generating hundreds of thousands of dollars for the state," he said. "The most expensive tuition we pay is the tuition to send kids to the training school or the ACI [Adult Correction Institutions], and those are disproportionately populated with people who have no education or who have dropped out and have no skills to get jobs." Does each dropout really cost the state $72,000 over a lifetime? We're always curious where the numbers like these come from, so we decided to go to the source. Flanders' office directed us to an April 2009 report from Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies prepared for the Board of Governors for Higher Education, The Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Rhode Island. To find out how much high school dropouts cost the state, the authors used data gathered for the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to make several estimates. One was their average earnings from age 18 to 64 in 2007 dollars. That number turns out to be $827,438. Then they estimated how much a typical dropout pays during that period in federal, state and local taxes, including property and sales taxes. Finally, they subtracted how much the typical dropout is expected to receive in unemployment compensation, disability, food stamps, Medicaid, workers' compensation and other social welfare programs, or how much would be spent to keep them in prison, using national incarceration statistics. It turns out that, by their reckoning, an average high school dropout costs society $440,214 from age 18 to 64. That's offset by the $367,867 he or she pays in taxes. Thus, a dropout's lifetime cost is $72,347, which is where Flanders' $72,000 number comes from. Looked at another way, the money you save by converting one dropout to one high school graduate is even higher. According to the methods used in the study, graduates have a lifetime income of $1,206,250, pay $532,922 in taxes, and consume $216,217 in services. Instead of being a $72,347 drain to the government, they add $316,705 to state, local, city and town coffers. So the average net benefit to the tax rolls of preventing one dropout is $389,052 over a lifetime. In theory. One problem with Flanders' comment is that he was talking about the impact of dropouts on the state, while the study looked at all taxes -- state, federal and local. State taxes make up about one quarter of a person's tax burden, according to estimates from The Tax Foundation, a respected business-backed tax policy group. Suddenly the $389,052 in tax benefit accrued by preventing one dropout and helping them graduate drops to about $100,000 over a lifetime. That's $2,100 per year. Meanwhile, we found other sources of information that made us wonder about the estimates. If you do the math, you discover that, according to the study, dropouts and high school graduates pay 44 percent of their lifetime earnings in taxes. But The Tax Foundation, which gives an annual estimate of how much Americans pay in taxes, reports that state, federal and local taxes amount to 27 percent of income, a much smaller ratio. Also, in 2005, Cecilia Rouse, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, made her own estimate of the lifetime difference in income between dropouts and high school graduates. She pegged it at $260,000, much smaller than estimate of $378,812 found in the study cited by Flanders. In her study, Rouse noted that the dollar amount varies significantly depending on how the economy behaves. The lifetime estimate could be as low as $121,000 or as high as $294,000. Rouse, who now works at the White House as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, said such estimates include all sorts of assumptions that can quickly turn out to be outdated. "There's a lot of variation in this," she said. "These numbers are, at best, illustrative and are meant to make a point, and I don't encourage anybody to . . . say, 'That's the number.'" Christy Huebner Caridi, director of the Marist College Bureau of Economic Research in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., expressed concern that the Harrington study "didn't pick up indirect costs such as the need for increased police and private security because there's an increased criminal element" with more dropouts. "There are many factors they couldn't take into consideration in a study like this," she said. We asked Paul Harrington, the chief author of the study cited by Flanders, who is now at Drexel University in Philadelphia, about some of the discrepancies. He said one reason for the variation is that other reports exclude people who have no earnings; even though they have no income, they do end up paying some types of taxes such as sales tax. "Because there are many more zero earners among dropouts, this will bring down their average per capita lifetime earnings estimates proportionately more than it will lower their average lifetime tax burden, given that they do pay some taxes," he warned. "Our findings are consistent with other reports once we exclude zero earners from the analysis." He also noted, correctly, that the Rouse study looked at employee payroll taxes, state income and federal income taxes, not sales and other types of taxes. So that's another reason why the analysis would come up with different numbers. "I think we're using some of the best data out there for research purposes," he said. "I think these are probably pretty solid numbers." There's no disagreement that dropping out of high school is harmful, both for the individual and society. Dropouts tend to make less money, get in trouble with the law more often, require more social services and end up with more health problems. But the $72,000 figure strikes us as another example of experts making assumptions and doing calculations that produce numbers that sound precise, yet may only be rough approximations of the truth. In the end, while experts may calculate the cost of dropouts in different ways, they all agree that turning would-be dropouts into high school graduates is beneficial to the economy. But Flanders cited the $72,000 figure with a degree of certainty that is undeserved. And he did not make it clear that the figure includes lost tax revenue to the federal government, not just the state. As a result, the Truth-O-Meter grades his assertion as Half True.

pomt-02767	"The middle class can be defined to include those with income between roughly $20,000 and $60,000."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/11/oregon-business-association/does-middle-class-include-those-income-between-200/	Every election season, politicians seek to renew their love affair with the American middle class. Proposals, stretching from "middle-class tax breaks" to tuition tax credits for "middle class" parents of college students, fill the airwaves. Trouble is, there’s no definition of this group that everyone can agree upon. The meaning of the term, depending on who is using it and for what purpose, can be stretched like a rubber band. "There’s not really a definition of what constitutes middle class," Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., wrote in an email. "It’s more of a notional concept of how you view yourself relative to others." Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, for instance, last year set the upper-end figure for middle class membership at a household income of $250,000 a year. President Barack Obama set the bar a little lower, at $200,000. Actual income levels around the country make both of those figures high. The Oregon Business Association made "rebuilding the middle class" the top priority in its recently unveiled 2014 work plan. That goal is critical, according to the Portland-based association, because middle-class jobs took the biggest hit during the Great Recession and have been slowest to grow in the recent expansion. When it came to defining terms, the association said this: "The middle class can be defined to include those with income between roughly $20,000 and $60,000." The $60,000 figure sounded about right, despite Romney’s and Obama’s definitions, but $20,000 struck us as low. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called D.J. Vogt, the business association’s legislative director. He said the figures came from a chart in a recent state Office of Economic Analysis report showing the bulk of "middle income" wages for various occupations in Oregon falling between $20,000 and $60,000. "I was including anything that could be considered middle class," Vogt said. "I took the broadest possible income level to put a number on it." We then called Mark McMullen, Oregon state economist, who co-authored the report that Vogt relied on. He noted that nowhere did the term "middle class" appear. "We stick to calling them middle-wage jobs," McMullen said. "We don’t want to make any inference about spending power or quality of life given those income levels." In addition, he said, the term is simply too loaded politically to serve a useful research purpose. But what about saying that the "middle" of Oregon’s income scale is bookended by $20,000 and $60,000? A review of 2011 Oregon tax returns, the most recent year for which information is available, puts the business association on firmer ground, McMullen said. Oregon Revenue Department figures for 2011 show the high end of each quintile -- the standard slicing of income ranges into fifths, with each quintile having roughly the same number of tax filers -- looks like this: Bottom 20 percent: up to $9,881 Second-lowest 20 percent: up to $22,833 Middle 20 percent: up to $41,631 Second-highest 20 percent: up to $75,152 Top 20 percent, split into three groups: the first 15 percent, up to $145,039; the next 4 percent, up to $302,811; and the top 1 percent, more than $302,811. So while the association’s high-end "middle class" figure looked pretty solid, its low-end $20,000 looked dubious. Someone earning that much a year is actually near the bottom of the state’s income scale. For reference, we also checked federal statistics, which place the poverty threshold at $11,490 for a single-earner and $23,500 for a family of four. So someone earning $20,000 might be in poverty if they’re supporting others, or not far off. Not a great place, in other words, to be calling the middle-class home. Mary C. King, a Portland State University economics professor, disputed the idea that $20,000 a year, even for a single-earner, can be called middle class. However, she acknowledged the same stumbling block others identify, that "middle class" can be as much of an idea as a definable economic reality. "Still," she said, "that just makes no sense at all. That’s $10 an hour. No one is getting a mortgage on $20,000 a year." The median income for all U.S. households last year was just over $51,000, she noted, and the average was about $71,000. PolitiFact has waded into this territory before and agrees there is no official definition of "middle class." Is it having a home mortgage? Being able to afford two cars or send kids to college? We’re still not certain -- and neither are most economists, as indicated by Mathur’s email reply -- but we do think the term has its economic limits. And those limits don’t extend anywhere near the official poverty range, as the business association’s $20,000 does. The association’s upper end of $60,000 is much more solid, though, landing well above the median income level for all Oregon tax filers and roughly in the middle of Oregon income levels. We also need to allow for households with two wage-earners -- one with two people earning $20,000 each, for example, could more realistically be considered part of the middle class. Splitting the difference between a dubious low level and a sound high one, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Oregon Business Association	None	None	None	2013-12-11T16:37:21	2013-12-09	['None']

pomt-09782	"FDR was called a socialist and a communist."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/22/barack-obama/obama-roosevelt-socialist-communist/	Sound familiar? The president was accused of being "a socialist, not a Democrat." His plan was described as "undisguised state socialism." One critic, who controlled some powerful media outlets, suggested that communists had infiltrated the president's administration. Those are some of the attacks that Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced in the 1930s — attacks cited recently by President Barack Obama to emphasize that he's not unique. Obama has mentioned the Roosevelt comparison several times recently, including during an interview on Late Night with David Letterman on Sept. 21, 2009: "What's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes, particularly during times of economic unease, then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up," Obama said. "FDR was called a socialist and a communist." Indeed, Roosevelt was called a socialist or a communist many times. Most of that criticism came in the 1930s, when he was enacting programs intended to pull the country out of the Great Depression. • "Roosevelt is a socialist, not a Democrat," declared Republican Rep. Robert Rich of Pennsylvania during a debate on the House floor on July 23, 1935. That remark came after Republicans hinted they were considering a move to impeach Roosevelt, according to the New York Times . • "The New Deal is now undisguised state socialism, declared Senator Simeon D. Fess (R-Ohio) today as he pictured President Roosevelt as the New Deal's leading socialist," reported the Chicago Daily Tribune on Aug. 7, 1934. "The president's recent statements," Fess said, "remove any doubt of his policy of state socialism, which necessitates increased activities of the government in either ownership or operation of industry, or both." • "The Russian newspapers during the last election [1932] published the photograph of Franklin D. Roosevelt over the caption, 'The first communistic President of the United States,'" said Sen. Thomas Schall, a Republican from Minnesota. "Evidently the Russian newspapers had knowledge concerning the ultimate intent of the President, which had been carefully withheld from the voters in this country. In fact, the voters of the United States were meticulously misled as to such intentions." We found Schall's comments in the book, All But the People: Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Critics, 1933-1939 . And then there's FDR being called a socialist by William Randolph Hearst. Hearst, a newspaper mogul, initially supported Roosevelt. But he gradually became disillusioned with the new president's policies. He especially hated Roosevelt's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, and his papers routinely referred to the New Deal as the Raw Deal. By 1936, when Roosevelt was running for re-election, Hearst decided to support Republican Alf Landon and oppose Roosevelt with all the power of the press he could muster. Historian Ben Procter summarized this moment in history in his book William Randolph Hearst: The Later Years, 1911-1951 : "On September 6, Hearst newspapers began a prolonged assault on the administration. The New York American published a front-page editorial titled, 'The Radical Brand on the New Deal.' It charged that radical and communist leaders had already given their approval to support Roosevelt against Landon. During the next two weeks Hearst editors trumpeted these recurring themes: that communists had infiltrated the New Deal; that communism was un-American and undemocratic; that 'America can only judge Mr. Roosevelt and his administration by the strange silence that has prevailed in official quarters.'" That was as much as Roosevelt was willing to take. The White House issued a statement that mentioned "a certain notorious newspaper owner," and rebutted the accusations. The statement concluded, "The American people will not permit their attention to be diverted from real issues to fake issues which no patriotic, honorable, decent citizen would purposefully inject into American affairs." Hearst shot back in a front-page editorial, which he signed personally. "Let me say that I have not stated at any time whether the President willingly or unwillingly received the support of the Karl Marx Socialists, the Frankfurter radicals, communists and anarchists, the Tugwell bolsheviks, and the Richberg revolutionists which constitute the bulk of his following," Hearst wrote. "I have simply said and shown that he does receive the support of these enemies of the American system of government, and that he has done his best to deserve the support of all such disturbing and destructive elements." Hearst's efforts were for naught. Roosevelt won the 1936 election in a landslide, while the Hearst newspaper chain slid into bankruptcy. There's not much controversy on this one, but it did provide an interesting opportunity to review American history. We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-01414	Milwaukee police and firefighters "are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting zero or one percent raises."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/09/nik-kovac/alderman-nik-kovac-says-police-fire-workers-routin/	Some city employees would get a New Year’s gift under a proposal by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett to soften Act 10’s effect on their pocketbooks. After losing a legal fight, the city is complying with Gov. Scott Walker’s 2011 collective-bargaining law and will begin deducting pension contributions from those workers not already making them. To help offset the pension contributions, Barrett wants to give 3.9 percent raises for general city employees. The plan, which carries a price tag of $4.8 million, would not apply to police and firefighters. They were exempted from the provisions of Act 10. City officials say most fire and police personnel pay little or nothing toward their pensions and -- unlike most other city employees -- still can negotiate over benefits and pay. East Side Alderman Nik Kovac said Barrett’s plan for raises seems reasonable. And in a Sept. 30, 2014 Fox6 TV interview, Kovac addressed the disparities between different groups of city employees under Act 10. Police and fire officials "are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting a zero or 1 percent raise," Kovac said. "That imbalance, the longer it continues, is going to hurt morale and make it harder and harder to run the city in a fair manner." Four percent vs. nothing? Routinely? That got our attention. On Facebook, a few firefighters pushed back on Kovac’s claim, saying they have not seen a raise in two or three years. "Nic, where are you getting 4% annually?" a Fire Department employee commented. "This is not just misleading, it’s wrong." What are the real numbers? When we asked Kovac for backup, he said he spoke off the cuff with the TV reporter. In doing so, he misspoke. After checking the recent history of raises with the city budget office, Kovac said he should not have said "routine" or "annual" in regards to 4 percent raises for police and fire. Maria Monteagudo, the city’s employee relations director, sent us the base pay increases for city employees back to 1991. Here are the percentage raises from 2010 to present. (Fire and police unions ratified contracts for 2010-2012 after Act 10 took effect in 2011). Fire Police General Managers 2010 0% 0% 0% 0% 2011 0.5%-0.8% 0% 0% 0% 2012 4.3% 3.55%* 0% 0% 2013 n/a** n/a** 1.5% 1.5% 2014 n/a** n/a** 1.0% 1.0% *Patrol officers received another $575 per year **Contract negotiations ongoing In 2012, firefighters and police received raises in the 4 percent range while general employees received nothing. But that was a one-year blip. With that exception, across-the-board raises have been small or nonexistent for all city employees dating to 2010, the year before Act 10. One important note: For 2013 and 2014, public safety employees have not yet negotiated a contract with the city. So while they have received nothing so far, they could still receive raises retroactively once a contract agreement is reached. General city workers and managers received small raises for those two years. That was done without collective bargaining for most of those workers, because the largest labor union representing city employees was not recertified under Act 10 rules, Monteagudo said. Before 2010, city employees of all types typically got 2 percent to 3 percent raises with small variations. Unionized workers typically were around the top of that range, with non-represented managers closer to the low end. Within the union ranks since 2007, police and fire raises have outstripped those for general workers. Mandatory furloughs, including of police and fire workers, have cut further into pay. Barrett’s 2015 budget would eliminate furloughs for non-uniformed workers, while their future use for police and fire workers would depend on the outcome of labor negotiations. Our rating Kovac said police and fire workers "are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting zero or one percent raises." That scenario was seen in 2012, but so far has not reappeared. Uniformed workers have had a leg up on general employees since Act 10, but only marginally in a time of austerity.

pomt-13365	Says "Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party want to get rid of the public school system."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/29/chelsea-clinton/partial-credit-chelsea-clinton-gets-says-gary-john/	Cosmopolitan magazine interviewed Chelsea Clinton the morning after the first presidential debate and asked the former First Daughter about the move of millennials from Democrat Bernie Sanders to Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein. "I would just urge young voters to actually look at what the different candidates are offering," Clinton said. "Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party want to get rid of the public school system in our country. If that’s what you believe, then you should actually support him. I think the public school system in our country has been one of the greatest, if not the greatest, investment of our values of the belief that everyone and anyone should have the chance to, as my mom says, 'live up to their God-given potential.' " "We have a lot of work to do to ensure that that is true in every school district and every school in our country," she added. "But I don’t think the work that we have to do entails getting rid of the public school system." A reader asked if Clinton was correct and if abolition of public education is really part of the platform of Johnson and his party. Because a party platform doesn't necessarily reflect the views of a presidential candidate, we'll consider them separately. The party The Libertarian Party believes that government should play a minimal role in human affairs and that this minimalist approach fosters liberty, enterprise and personal responsibility. The party's website says, "Government's only role is to help individuals defend themselves from force and fraud." That would leave out education. Its latest platform, adopted at its May 2016 convention in Orlando, Fla., doesn't directly call for getting rid of the public school system. But it does say, "Education is best provided by the free market, achieving greater quality, accountability and efficiency with more diversity of choice. Recognizing that the education of children is a parental responsibility, we would restore authority to parents to determine the education of their children, without interference from government. Parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children’s education." In short, public education is not one of the roles government should play. Johnson's stance As for Johnson's philosophy, both the Clinton campaign and the Johnson campaign referred us to a Sept. 14, 2016, entry in Politico's education blog. It states that Johnson wants to eliminate the U.S. Education Department, a proposal that has been popular with Republican candidates in recent years. When Politico asked Johnson what the federal role should be in public education, he responded, "I don't see one." It's important to note here that the federal government doesn't run America's public school systems. That's done by state and local governments. The Politico piece notes that Johnson has been an advocate for universal vouchers as a way to improve educational performance through competition. The candidate told the website, "I do think ultimately it would be the end of traditional public schools, and that would be for the better. Public schools are not going to go away, but they are going to embrace the innovation that would occur if students had a choice." To say that "public schools are not going to go away" at the same time you say this "would be the end of traditional public schools" seems to amount to doublespeak, so we asked the Johnson campaign for some clarification how this would be handled on a state and local level, where the real education work is done. We didn't hear back. On his website, Johnson says that "state and local governments should have more control over education policy" and calls for the elimination of "attempts to impose national standards and requirements on local schools (that) are costly, overly bureaucratic, and actually compromise our ability to provide our children with a good education." Meanwhile, we found a May 30, 2016, Forbes article reporting how Johnson initially raised education spending when he was governor of New Mexico but then decided to push a voucher system. The plan was to let each student have a voucher valued at about $4,000 at a time when the public school system cost was roughly $6,000 per pupil. If a student spent that voucher on a private school, that would mean more money left behind to educate a public school child, Johnson argued. Parents would pull their children out of the bad schools — public or private — and they would have to close. Our ruling Clinton said, "Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party want to get rid of the public school system." The Libertarian platform calls for a free market educational system that puts the responsibility on the parents. Johnson clearly wants to get the federal government out of the education business, but public schools are run by the states and local communities, and there Johnson is giving mixed signals about the degree to which he wants to fully privatize public education. Because Clinton's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/290b228f-0400-4d2e-be9d-9bb130fe5510	None	Chelsea Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-29T17:29:32	2016-09-28	['None']

pomt-01099	"After World War II, we tried, convicted, and, in some cases, executed Japanese soldiers for war crimes that included charges of waterboarding."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/12/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-after-wwii-us-executed-japanese-war-cr/	Rep. Bobby Scott was appalled by the findings of a Senate report detailing the enhanced interrogation methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Senate report detailed many instances when the U.S. waterboarded suspected terrorists, a drowning-like procedure in which interrogators covered detainees’ faces with a cloth and doused them with water, sometimes until they fell unconscious. Scott, D-3rd, denounced the waterboarding as a torture method inconsistent with the United States’ image as a "moral authority" and said the report shows the country "failed to lead by example." "After World War II, we tried, convicted, and in some cases, executed Japanese soldiers for war crimes that included charges of waterboarding," Scott said in a Dec. 9 news release. We wondered if Scott’s war history is correct. His spokesman, Dave Dailey, supported Scott’s statement by pointing to previous fact checks of similar claims, including one by PolitiFact National of a statement that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,made in 2007 and another claim that former Vice President Dick Cheney made last year. The claims harken back to the mid to late 1940s when officials of the Axis powers were tried and convicted, and some executed, for a wide range of war crimes. The term "waterboarding" didn’t exist then, but the allegations levelled by prosecutors and U.S. POWs against Japanese military officials referred to techniques called "water torture," "water treatments" and "water cure." The procedures were described in a 2007 essay by Evan Wallach, an attorney who specialized in the laws of war and later was appointed by President Barack Obama as a federal appeals court judge. Wallach wrote his essay in response to a 2002 Justice Department memo that said CIA waterboarding didn’t constitute torture. Wallach noted that at one of the most well-known Pacific theater post-war trials -- The Tokyo War Crimes Trials by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East -- the records show water torture was generally inflicted in two ways. In one method, the victim was restrained on his back and water was poured on a cloth that had been placed over his nose and mouth. In other cases, a prisoner would be tied to a ladder and slid into a tub of water until he almost drowned. During a 1947 war crimes trial in Yokohama, Wallach wrote that several officials of a Japanese prison camp were convicted of two incidents of strapping down U.S. prisoners and forcing water up their noses and in their mouths. Supporters of the President George W. Bush-era interrogation techniques have said that the CIA’s waterboarding was not as harsh as the torture used by Japanese soldiers. Bush adviser Karl Rove said in a Dec. 14 Fox News interview that in Japan’s case, the method was used to drown the person. Rove said the CIA version was merely done to inflict panic and fear rather than pain and suffering. Wallach, in his essay, saw little difference between Imperial Japan’s use of the procedure and its modern iteration under former president Bush. The judge took issue with media reports that the technique merely simulates drowning saying "waterboarding is real drowning that simulates death." We contacted three other war crimes analysts who echoed Wallach’s finding that the U.S. prosecuted Japanese soldiers for offenses that included waterboarding. The next step, in evaluating Scott’s claim, is determining whether the U.S. executed any Japanese soldiers who waterboarded prisoners. David J. Cohen, the founder of the War Crimes Studies Center at the University of California at Berkeley, said the U.S. military convicted Japanese POW camp officials for a wide range of offenses from severe beatings, to exposing prisoners to extreme temperatures. "There were death sentences for torture, and that torture typically consisted of multiple forms of mistreatment, of which water torture was considered one of the most severe," Cohen said in an email. Wallach, in his essay, wrote that six Japanese generals who ordered and permitted water torture were sentenced to death. He added, however, that those generals were also convicted of many other war crimes -- including conspiracy, aggression and crimes against the peace. Yuma Totani, a history professor at the University of Hawaii, said she knows of two additional Japanese officers who were executed after U.S. military trials conducted from 1944 to 1946. "Both accused were found guilty on grounds that they disregarded their duty to take control of subordinate army units, which included kenpeitai (Japanese secret police) that was known to have used various torture methods against detainees at Fort Santiago, the kenpeitai interrogation center at Manila," Totani said in an email. "Waterboarding being one of the commonplace torture methods of kenpeitai, one could argue that these accused were convicted of a charge that included waterboarding as one of the torture methods, commonly applied by the members of their subordinate army units." Our ruling Scott said that after World War II, the U.S. tried, convicted, and in some cases executed Japanese soldiers for war crimes that included waterboarding. There’s little doubt that the U.S. tried and convicted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding. Six Japanese generals who allowed water torture were executed, although we note they faced a long list of additional charges. Scott qualified his statement to make clear he was referring to executed Japanese military members who faced a variety of war crime charges, including waterboarding, not that they were sentenced to death solely for that offense. We rate his statement True.	None	Bobby Scott	None	None	None	2015-01-12T00:10:00	2014-12-09	['Japan', 'World_War_II']
pomt-07456	(Dennis) Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/19/our-oregon/group-says-republican-senator-behind-call-drastic-/	It’s not even election season, but a recent political ad has generated quite a bit of buzz. Our Oregon, an organization backed by several unions and other progressive groups, released an ad attacking Rep. Dennis Richardson. The Central Point Republican has a target on his back because he sits on the Legislature's budget committee. In the ad, titled ‘Priorities,’ Our Oregon rips into Richardson for ignoring seniors and children. Here’s the ad’s text in full: "It's tough out there for middle class families. But Dennis Richardson and the Republicans voted to give tax breaks to corporations. Now Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities. But what could be more important than the health and safety of seniors and our children's future. call your legislators. tell them to get their priorities straight." There’s a lot in there -- most all of it the House Republicans find objectionable -- but, per our methods, we have to pick one statement. We’ll go with "Now Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities." The ad is referencing the proposed budget put forth by the Legislature’s budget committee, so let’s start there. First some background: The Legislature’s budget writing committee is composed of both representatives and senators. Generally, it’s led by two co-chairs, one from each chamber. This year, though, with an evenly divided House, there are three co-chairs: one from the Senate, two from the House. Richardson is the only Republican of the three men who control the committee. The two others are Democratic Sen. Richard Devlin from Tualatin and Rep. Peter Buckley from Ashland. Generally, after the Oregon governor releases a proposed budget, the co-chairs set to work crafting their own. The Legislature then spends time adjusting the proposals to create something that will pass both chambers and win the governor’s signature. This time around, the co-chairs -- after considerable negotiation -- presented a framework budget of about $14.6 billion. The budget actually offers schools some $140 million more than what Gov. John Kitzhaber suggested in his own proposal. (All told, school funding will remain flat -- it’s not being cut. Of course, the cost of education rises each year, meaning Oregon won’t get the same amount of services for the same amount of money in the next biennium as it did in the current. Human services, meanwhile, will face a shortfall as a result of lost stimulus money.) Somewhat controversially, the co-chairs decided to leave $444 million in reserve funds alone. Unions, and many Democratic lawmakers, feel that cash should be used now. The funds, they say, were meant to help out in bad times; these are bad times. Others believe it offers a cushion. If the burgeoning economic recovery stalls, the state will have some money to fall back on. Without the cash on hand, the state would need to reduce services. Any guess where Our Oregon stands on the issue? Yep, they think the co-chairs should be tapping into that reserve. Hence the ad. With that in mind, there are a few things wrong with the ad. Most important: This is not just Richardson's doing. Sure, he had a seat at the negotiating table. But the ultimate proposal was a bipartisan effort. To single him out isn’t accurate. At least two others ultimately decided that, for the purposes of compromise, the Legislature should set aside some cash for an even rainier day. As Harry Esteve recently reported in The Oregonian: "He and his fellow co- chairs, Sen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, and Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, argued for a hefty cushion of reserves, worried that recent hikes in oil prices could spur another recession. If the economy improves, dollars could be added to the budget when the Legislature meets again next year, they said during a Capitol news conference." That’s right, all three men -- two Democrats, one Republican -- were there selling the legislation. We called Our Oregon to ask about the discrepancy here. Scott Moore, the spokesman for the organization, said the co-chair proposal "was an agreement signed by the Democratic co-chairs basically under duress." He pointed to a House Democrats press releasewhen the budget proposal was unveiled that begins by pledging to "advocate for using a greater share of the $444 million in reserves" and then a Senate Republican releasethat says they are "generally positive about the new direction and tone set by the state budget proposal." (Two House Democrats have since introduced two bills that would tap into those reserves giving an addition $100 million to schools from the Education Stability Fund and $75 million to health care and public safety from the Rainy Day Fund.) "There's clearly a great deal of support among the Republican caucus," Moore said. House Democrats seem to think funding needs to be higher. While that may be true, it still doesn’t make this proposal any more Dennis Richardson’s than it does Peter Buckley’s or Richard Devlin’s. What’s more the Senate Democrats recently voted unanimously in favor of the education spending bill that mirrored the co-chairs’ proposal. As the House Republican spokesman Nick Smith says, "The levels of spending in the education budget, human services, public safety, each of the areas that are pointed out in this television ad, were all the result of bipartisan negotiation and compromise." We agree. Sure, these next two years will be harder for social services and public education -- but that’s a result of an anemic economy not a cut-happy Republican. Moreover, this budget represents a consensus, not one man’s vision. We find the claim that "Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities" to be False.

pomt-13376	Maggie Hassan "missed nearly every university system board meeting."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/sep/28/national-republican-senatorial-committee/has-maggie-hassan-missed-nearly-every-trustee-meet/	With New Hampshire students perennially saddled with one of the highest tuition rates in the country, Republicans are using higher education to attack Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat who is challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte for her Senate seat this November. An ad put out by the National Republican Senatorial Committee reminds viewers that Granite State students attending New Hampshire’s public colleges will pay more than in-state students in basically every other state in the country. "Hassan raised college tuition making New Hampshire the highest in America," the narrator says, "Today, New Hampshire students are leaving to find affordable education, taking jobs with them." The ad suggests that Hassan has been oblivious as the situation reaches a crisis point. "Hassan missed nearly every University system board meeting. Maggie Hassan failed our students. She just hasn’t done her job," the ad concludes. The line was repeated again by New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Jennifer Horn on Sept. 16, after Hassan publicly criticized the University of New Hampshire for spending $1 million that a former librarian donated to the school to fund a video scoreboard for their football stadium. "Just like a typical Washington politician, Hassan issues indignant statements when it's politically convenient, but doesn't bother to show up when it actually matters," Horn said in a statement which blasted Hassan for her "excessive absences." PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check out Hassan’s attendance record for the university system board meetings. As governor, Hassan is an ex-officio member of the 27-member board of trustees that oversees the University System of New Hampshire. She can make motions and vote at meetings. The USNH oversees the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Granite State College and Keene State College. The board of trustees is responsible for strategic planning, setting policies, and ensuring the system’s financial health. It usually meets about four times a year, excepting special meetings. Looking back at the minutes, the Republicans are correct: Hassan has missed every single USNH board meeting since she took office, except one on June 28, 2013, when she briefly called in and made a motion to freeze tuition, according to meeting minutes provided by a USNH official. On the other hand, skipping trustee meetings isn’t unusual for a New Hampshire governor. Hassan’s predecessor, former Gov. John Lynch, a fellow Democrat, also made it to a single meeting -- on February 16, 2006 -- during his eight-year tenure as governor. Former Gov. Craig Benson, a Republican who served a single two-year term before Lynch, doesn’t appear to have attended a meeting at all, although meeting minutes for 2004, his second year in office, appear to be partially missing. None of these governors were necessarily shirking their responsibilities. Former USNH Chancellor Edward MacKay said he recalled governors going back to Hugh Gallen -- a Democrat who served from 1979 to 1982 -- attending "at least one" meeting during their tenure, but added that they "focused their time on broader issues facing the state and the associated management duties." The governor’s job is a big one, MacKay said, adding that it’s commonly believed that the day-to-day running of the USNH is better left to those with the time to focus on it. "In New Hampshire, the governor has very limited staff and has many more operational responsibilities than is the case in many states," said MacKay, who is currently the Higher Education Division Director at the New Hampshire Department of Education. "There is an expectation the governor will need to focus on those duties and the chair of the USNH and/or the chancellor will inform the governor of critical policy issues." Our ruling The National Republican Senatorial Committee says Maggie Hassan "missed nearly every university system board meeting." The governor is a sitting member of the University System of New Hampshire’s board of trustees, which gives her the power to make motions and vote. Hassan missed all but one meeting during her tenure as governor, and even the meeting she participated in came via phone call. That said, Hassan’s behavior is not out of place -- previous governors’ attendance has been similarly sparse, producing little expectation that the state’s chief executive will attend the meetings as a rule. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	National Republican Senatorial Committee	None	None	None	2016-09-28T11:49:38	2016-09-08	['None']
pomt-02474	Says Alex Sink "supported higher sales taxes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/feb/21/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-alex-sink-supported-higher-sales-/	U.S. House candidate David Jolly is largely refraining from direct attacks against Alex Sink’s background as a banker, state chief financial officer and gubernatorial candidate. His supporters from the Republican Party of Florida, however, have had no such qualms. In a slew of campaign fliers and TV commercials, the GOP have hammered at the former CFO’s record, particularly on taxes. In a mailer that showed up in Pinellas County mailboxes around Feb. 17, 2014, the party said Sink "supported higher sales taxes, property taxes, water taxes and taxes on cable TV." We’ve already covered the claim about water and cable taxes, finding it Mostly True. But what about sales taxes? Give us a minute, and we’ll ring that one up, too. A taxing claim Republicans turned to Sink’s one term as Florida’s CFO, from 2007 to 2010, to find the basis for this attack. The mailer cites a Dec. 16, 2008, story from the Palm Beach Post about state lawmakers calling a special session to deal with an expected $2.3 billion budget shortfall as the Great Recession took hold of the state. The story said, "Democrats including Sink have asked GOP leaders to consider raising taxes, consider repealing sales tax exemptions and reinstitute the intangibles tax." The Republican-led Legislature announced the two-week January session to deal with precipitously declining state revenues, which had already led to $7.4 billion in budget cuts from 2006. Even plugging the $2.3 billion hole during the special session would have left the state more than $5 billion in the hole the following year. When announcing the session, GOP lawmakers refused to address the deficit with tax or fee increases or the ratification of the gambling compact with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and wanted to deal with the problem by cutting state services and transferring trust fund dollars. Sink, the state’s CFO, said the state’s tax system should be overhauled when legislators convened. "Every sales tax exemption ought to be back on the table, ought to have to see the light of day," Sink said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. "Somebody ought to stand up and defend why an exemption is fair and legitimate or it's not." Among the items that enjoyed sales tax exemptions at the time: fitness club memberships for hospitals, bottled water, magazines and newspapers ordered through the mail, charter boat fishing, high school and college sports team skyboxes, valet parking, photo finishing, pet grooming, lawn & landscaping services, racing dogs, Super Bowl tickets and ostrich feed. Ending exemptions on catalog and Internet orders were also part of the discussion. Sink had suggested ending some exemptions since at least 2007, but we didn’t find any particular item she singled out. Instead, Sink simply wanted legislators to consider the potential revenue streams that ending exemptions could bring. One bipartisan poll showed the state could have raised some $560 million in new revenues by closing exemptions. Legislators eschewed examining the tax system, opting instead to appropriate $700 million from a tobacco settlement endowment fund that paid for health care programs for children and the elderly. They also postponed $300 million in bonds for the Florida Forever land purchase program and cut about $600 million from public education and health care, among other actions, before the regular session dealt with an even larger deficit in March. We should note that closing tax loopholes is not only a Democratic idea in Florida. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, the head of the Republican Party in Florida, has said he is willing to support a move to start collecting sales tax on online purchases, so long as it is accompanied by equal tax cuts. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida accused Sink of having "supported higher sales taxes." They pointed specifically to her stance on discussing the repeal of some sales tax exemptions in the wake of falling tax revenues in 2008. The way the GOP words it, however, makes it seem as if Sink were seeking to make a broad-based tax hike. Actually, Sink was supporting a review of sales tax exemptions. While that is not exactly raising the sales tax, it does have the same repercussions as a higher tax on those groups and industries. Overall, though, Sink was asking the Legislature to consider ending sales tax exemptions for a host of interest groups, not supporting raising sales taxes for everyone. Without that context, the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08572	The GOP's "Pledge to America" includes "a 20 percent cut ... for education. ... Eight million kids would have their college aid slashed under this budget."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/27/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-gop-pledge-would-cut-education-/	Just days after House Republicans released a governing blueprint called "A Pledge to America," the White House took aim at the GOP platform. Speaking on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Sept. 26, 2010, David Axelrod, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, zeroed in on the Republican plan for education. "When you look at that Pledge to America, it is a complete echo of what was done before," Axelrod said. "It would borrow $700 billion to cut taxes for the very wealthy, add trillions of dollars to the deficits. It would unleash the special interests to be writing rules here on Capitol Hill again. And it would cut things like -- there's a 20 percent cut in there for education. We're talking about our economy. Education is the defense budget of the -- economic defense budget of the 21st century, and they're basically talking about disarmament. Eight million kids would have their college aid slashed under this budget. This isn't a prescription for economic growth; this is a prescription for surrender. We can't do that." We thought we'd check whether the House GOP really intends to cut education funding by 20 percent and whether 8 million students would see their aid "slashed." First, Axelrod wrongly said on This Week that the 20 percent cut comes from the GOP's "Pledge" document. Actually, that document doesn't address education policy -- there's not a single word in the 48-page document about education. When we mentioned this to the White House, a spokeswoman clarified that Axelrod's argument stemmed instead from a Sept. 8, 2010, proposal by House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, that Congress cut non-security-related discretionary spending to its fiscal year 2008 level. Boehner stood behind both the Pledge and the proposed discretionary spending cut, so we don't think it's misleading for Axelrod to link House Republicans to the discretionary spending cut. The White House also told us that Axelrod relied on an analysis of the Boehner proposal produced by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. This report said the Boehner proposal would result in a "21 percent cut in K-12 education funding would take more than $8 billion out of this area in fiscal year 2011." So let's look at how the Education Department budget would look if the Republican proposal took effect. Axelrod wasn't specific about which budget years he was comparing, so we'll offer three figures for the Education Department's proposed discretionary budget: Fiscal year 2011 (estimated): $49.7 million Fiscal year 2010 (estimated): $46.8 million Fiscal year 2008 (enacted): $37.9 million So, the Republican plan would cut the budget by 19 percent from its 2010 level and by 24 percent from its proposed 2011 level. So, Axelrod is in the correct range. We're prepared to offer him some leeway because the math is complicated by quirks in how budget items are categorized and by inconsistencies in how budget tables over the period are constructed. When we ran the White House's approach by Boehner's office, a spokesman said that they're based on a faulty assumption -- that the Boehner proposal would institute identical, across-the-board cuts for every department and program. In fact, the spokesman said, the proposal would be to set the entire discretionary budget to 2008 levels and then negotiate cuts in each program to meet that target. That's all well and good, but the fact is that Boehner's news release doesn't explain exactly how its cuts would be made. So, given the information available, we think it's reasonable for Axelrod to have based his claim on an across-the-board cut. Moreover, if Boehner's office is suggesting that under his proposal, the cuts in education could in fact be less than 20 percent, then by the same logic they could also end up higher than 20 percent. Ultimately, Axelrod wrongly attributes that to the Pledge, but he is right that Boehner has made such a proposal, and Axelrod's assumptions are reasonable. Now, on to the second claim -- that "eight million kids would have their college aid slashed under this budget." This claim is also tricky to evaluate, since there are several types of student loans and grants under the Education Department budget, some of which are considered discretionary spending (meaning they'd be subject to Boehner's proposed cut) and some of which are considered mandatory spending (which would not be subject to his cut). But we'll try our best to sort it out. There are four major types of discretionary student aid: Pell grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants, federal work-study grants and federal Perkins loans. If you add together the recipients of these four grants, the total is 10.9 million for fiscal year 2010 and 12 million for 2011. That would actually be more students than Axelrod suggests, but experts told us that these numbers could be inflated by students whose aid packages include funds from two or more of these programs. So Axelrod's 8,000 figure -- which happens to be the ballpark number of Pell grants, the largest of the four programs -- seems reasonable to us. One final question is whether it's fair to use the word "slashed" to describe a roughly 20 percent cut. We think a 20 percent cut is deep enough to justify that term. So where does this leave us? We'll grant that Boehner's camp has a right to dispute Axelrod's suggestion that the Pledge outlined a 20 percent cut. That document itself didn't mention education, but Boehner outlined a 20 percent cut. He never specified that it would be other than across the board until we contacted his office, so we think it's reasonable for Axelrod to conclude that education would be cut in line with the rest of federal agencies. Meanwhile, the percentage cut and the student aid recipient numbers that Axelrod cited strike us as fair estimates, given the complexities of calculating year-to-year budgetary numbers for federal agencies. On balance, we rate Axelrod's comment Half True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2010-09-27T18:16:55	2010-09-26	['United_States', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09315	The passage of the teacher tenure bill in the Fla. Legislature was like the health care bill in Congress because one party jammed it through.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/16/charlie-crist/SB6-Crist-veto-health-care/	In remarks shortly after vetoing Senate Bill 6, Gov. Charlie Crist admonished Republicans for pushing through the controversial teacher tenure bill without allowing amendments or a full and open debate. "This thing was rushed through," Crist said during a news conference announcing his veto April 15, 2010. "Quite frankly, it reminds me of what happened with the health care bill in Washington -- where members of my party criticized the Democrats for sort of jamming something down their throat. And then here about a month later after that happens, you know, the very same thing happens here in education. So it's the wrong process. It had laudable goals. It can be done right. And we have a duty to make sure it is done right." Crist said the passage of SB 6 reminded him of how the health care bill played out in Washington. We decided to check whether or not his memory betrayed him. Republicans argued during the final weeks of the health care debate that President Barack Obama's reforms were being pushed without regard for the concerns of the American people, or without input from Republicans, while criticizing Democrats for using a parliamentary tactic called reconciliation to avoid a potential filibuster in the U.S. Senate. Republicans offered last-minute amendments to either attempt to slow approval down, or force Democrats to take votes against measures that could be used against them in upcoming elections. Democrats rejected all of the amendments, and Congress ultimately approved health care reform without the vote of one Republican. In Florida, some of the same arguments have been made by Democrats, the state's largest teachers union and Crist. They said Republicans quashed debate and blocked amendments to ram the bill through the Legislature without the vote of one Democrat. To best dissect the claim, we decided to analyze apples-to-apples comparisons between the two pieces of legislation, inlcuding the length of the process, opportunities for public comment, opportunities for input and the level of bipartisan support. The health care bill that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, is actually a combination of different proposals passed by the House and Senate. The U.S. House of Representatives filed its original version of the health care bill, HR 3200, on July 14, 2009, and a second version, HR 3962, on Oct. 29, 2009. That bill passed 220-215 on Nov. 7. One Republican, Joseph Cao of Louisiana, voted with Democrats to approve the bill. Over in the Senate, a third incarnation of the health care bill, HR 3590, passed on Christmas Eve 2009 without a Republican vote. The two bills were eventually merged -- without any GOP support -- and signed into law by President Obama. The total process from bill filing to bill signing took more than eight months -- not necessarily quick. Compare that with the state teacher tenure bill. SB 6 was filed in the state Senate on March 1, 2010, and passed on March 24, by a vote of 21-17. All 13 Senate Democrats voted against the bill, along with four Republicans. The state House took up SB 6 on March 25 and passed it 15 days later by a vote of 64-55 (11 Republicans joined the state's 44 Democrats in opposition). Crist vetoed the bill on April 15, 2010. Total Democrats in support --- zero. Total time in the hopper -- 45 days. Opportunities for public comment People for and against SB 6 had four opportunities to directly address legislators. Public comment was allowed during Senate committee meetings March 10 and March 19, and two House committee meetings March 25 and April 19. The state teacher's union argued that the public hearings coincided with FCAT testing and then, spring break. Congress, meanwhile, held at least 100 town hall meetings across the country to discuss health care in the summer of 2009. The conservative Web site Newsmax published a list of the hearings scheduled as of Aug. 12, 2009. They counted more than 140 all together. President Obama and members of his administration also held town hall meetings to discuss health care reform. The White House held regional forums in five states in March and April 2009. Obama participated in a health care town hall in Wisconsin in June 2009, a tele-town hall with AARP in July and a forum in New Hampshire in August 2009. Then there were health care rallies in Ohio and Virginia in March 2010. Opportunities for input The federal health care bill included lengthy debate in both the House and Senate, with each chamber passing a bill incorporating that body's priorities. Concessions were made for U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., to ensure there would be no public funding of abortion. And though maybe not significant, Republican amendments were added to the bill. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions adopted 159 amendments offered by Republicans. Only two of them, however, were significant or controversial enough to merit roll call votes. One of those two affected the manufacture of biologics medication and another required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option (which was ultimately scrapped). Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, told PolitiFact that 132 of the 159 were for "technical amendments" and that it was a misnomer to call them proof of bipartisanship. In the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 16 Republican amendments were adopted. But Republicans said only one amendment was major, and none changed the core of the legislation. In the Education and Labor Committee, six of the 17 amendments offered by Republicans were adopted. Again, Republicans said the amendments were largely technical. White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said 170 GOP amendments were accepted into the final bill that passed. Conversely, the passage of SB 6 was orchestrated -- particularly by the Florida House -- to prevent alterations to the bill. Republicans in the House waited until the Senate passed SB 6 before filing identical bill language. (The Senate version included an amendment allowing principals to factor in advanced degrees in their performance reviews.) Florida House Speaker Larry Cretul said he hoped there would be no amendments to the House bill. The reason? If the House changed the bill, it would have to return to the Senate for a second vote. "We hope that there won't be any amendments,'' Cretul told the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald. "What the Senate sent us was a pretty good work product.'' A majority of Republicans in the House rejected 19 amendments before passing SB 6. The amendments would have required school districts to set salaries at or higher than the national average, allowed school districts to use years of service or advanced degrees as a factor in setting pay, and force members of the Florida Legislature to teach nine weeks in a public school before the teacher pay plan could become effective. Republicans said the bill wasn't perfect, but wanted Crist to sign it anyway. "I understand it wasn't a perfect bill," said Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. "But I thought it laid a good foundation." And Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said: “This is not a perfect bill; there are things in this bill that will change. It is a framework for going forward.” State Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, also suggested the Legislature could write a follow-up "glitch bill," if Crist had particular problems with provisions of SB 6. Our ruling Back to Crist's original statement. In vetoing SB 6, he said the process in the Legislature was similiar to the one Republicans criticized Democrats for using in Washington to pass the health care bill. In particular, Crist said both bills were sort of "jamming something down (people's) throat." He's right that neither the federal health care bill or SB 6 passed with a single vote from the party out of power. But turns out there actually was more debate in Washington about the health care bill, than there was in Tallahassee about SB 6. Congress and the president held more than 100 town halls to discuss health care with voters while Florida legislators had four public hearings. And while the White House says 170 GOP amendments were included in the final health care bill, albeit largely technical in nature, Republicans in the Florida House blocked every amendment offered by Democrats when considering SB 6. State GOP leaders also orchestrated a plan to avoid having to send the bill back to the Senate for a second vote or even conference over different bills. SB 6 meets our definition of jamming a bill through, which is good for Crist. What's bad for him, however, is that the debate over the federal health care bill was actually more collegial.

pomt-14200	The Human Rights Campaign is "more powerful than the NRA."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/21/pat-mccrory/nc-gov-pat-mccrory-under-fire-hb2-says-human-right/	When one thinks of the country’s most powerful lobbying groups, acronyms like NRA, AIPAC and AARP spring to mind. So do phrases like Big Pharma, Big Oil and Wall Street. During an appearance April 17 on NBC’s "Meet The Press," North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory made the argument that the Human Rights Campaign is also among the most powerful lobbies in the United States. "The Human Rights Council, my gosh, they’re more powerful than the NRA," McCrory said, meaning the Human Rights Campaign and the National Rifle Association. The Human Rights Campaign, or HRC, is a major player in the opposition to North Carolina’s controversial new law, House Bill 2, which limits LGBT rights in public accommodations — and which McCrory was on national television to defend. "They are putting on a lot of pressure instead of having good dialogue," McCrory said. The HRC is the country’s largest gay rights group. It has led the charge for gay marriage and for the types of LGBT discrimination protections that HB2 prohibited cities in North Carolina from making. But has the group really eclipsed the NRA, an oft-cited stereotype of a powerful lobbying group that can shape public policy and opinion? McCrory says it has. And in the last few days, that claim has been picked up as a talking point by supporters of HB2. Measuring political power It would be big news if McCrory was right. Debates over gay rights, as with gun rights, are a large part of modern political discourse. We don’t know what criteria McCrory was using, if any, to make his claim. "Meet The Press" host Chuck Todd didn’t ask him to elaborate. When we asked McCrory’s campaign about his rationale, spokesman Ricky Diaz called it a "ridiculous question" and declined to answer. We also asked both the HRC and the NRA whether they agreed with McCrory. The NRA did not respond, and the HRC declined to answer. There are many ways to measure a group’s strength. We asked an expert, UNC-Chapel Hill political science professor Frank Baumgartner, who has written multiple books on special interest groups and lobbying. He listed three main ways to measure influence: Money and resources, "cultural resonance" and record of success or failure. Baumgartner said he believes McCrory’s comparison is "false or substantially exaggerated." But let’s look into the numbers to see if they back that up. Money Money is especially important in modern politics because of the Citizens United ruling that McCrory mentioned, which allows for unlimited political spending. In 2014, according to federal tax filings, the NRA and its foundation had revenue of $356.1 million, compared with $51.2 million for the HRC and its foundation. Money allows interest groups to hire lobbyists, contribute directly to politicians and political groups or take part in what’s known as outside spending – TV ads, mailers and other political initiatives. In the 2014 election cycle, according to the Center For Responsive Politics, the NRA’s political spending was 7.5 times greater than the HRC’s ($36.8 million to $4.8 million). In the 2012 cycle, the NRA spent five times as much ($26.9 million to $5.1 million). In both cycles, the NRA spent more on lobbying than the HRC spent on lobbying, contributions and outside spending combined. For outside spending in particular, the NRA spent about $350 for every $1 the HRC spent. "Cultural resonance" How do you measure this? It sounds intangible, but there are ways to break it into specific, quantifiable pieces. And in everything we looked at, the NRA came out on top. Membership, magazine subscriptions, Google searches, social media following and official government mentions all show the NRA’s presence is anywhere from 2 to 10 times larger than the HRC’s. Both groups have magazines. The HRC’s goes to more than 350,000 homes, according to a group spokesman this week. According to the publishing group Alliance for Audited Media, the NRA’s three magazines had a combined circulation in 2015 of more than 3.5 million. As for membership, both have been accused in the past of inflating their numbers. Take it with a grain of salt, but the NRA claims 4.5 million members compared with 1.5 million for the HRC. The NRA also has a larger audience on social media – 4.8 million Facebook likes and 345,000 Twitter followers, compared with 2.3 million Facebook likes and 529,000 Twitter followers for the HRC. We also compared online searches, which indicate how interested people are in learning about the groups. When their Google searches over the last 12 years are graphed against each other, the HRC’s results show up as an almost flat line hovering just above 0. We used Google Trends to aggregate numerous terms related to both groups and map their relative popularity as compared with all other searches each month. The NRA is in red and the HRC is in blue. Even the HRC’s best month didn’t surpass the NRA’s worst month. We also counted how often they’re mentioned in congressional hearing transcripts and other documents listed by the U.S. Government Publishing Office search engine –1,408 results for "National Rifle Association" and 393 for "Human Rights Campaign." Reputation and success Baumgartner said he thinks this was the point McCrory was trying to make – on a group’s "ability to push public policy in a direction the group prefers." And again, Baumgartner said, the HRC doesn’t quite stack up. "I'd say Human Rights Campaign has had some success," he said. "But no, they would not compare to the long-run success of groups such as the NRA, the Realtors, the petroleum industry, the Chamber of Commerce and many others." The NRA is famous for its clout and success in Congress. The HRC, on the other hand, has achieved most of its biggest victories – gay marriage, gay adoption rights and the invalidation of anti-sodomy laws – at the Supreme Court. The HRC has existed since 1980. For most of that time, one of its top priorities has been a federal LGBT anti-discrimination law. Efforts to pass such laws state-by-state have been mostly unsuccessful, as we explored in a previous fact check. On the national level, friendly legislators have introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA, in nearly every Congress since 1994. It has failed each time, despite polling that shows about three quarters of Americans support such laws. The NRA has done the opposite, persuading Congress to repeatedly kill legislation that has even broader public support than ENDA does. Even though about 90 percent of Americans support background checks on gun buyers – previous PolitiFact rulings have found a range of 85 to 93 percent – the federal Fix Gun Checks Act has been voted down several times since 2011. It would allow for universal background checks, and the NRA is strongly opposed to it. As for the HRC, it hasn’t been totally unsuccessful in Congress. The group successfully pushed for a 2009 law that expanded federal hate crime definitions to include LGBT status. And what about outside of government, in the corporate world? It’s undeniable that the HRC’s influence there is growing. The group started ranking how "LGBT friendly" companies were in 2002 in what it calls its Corporate Equality Index. About a dozen received a perfect score that year. In 2016, more than 400 companies did. And many businesses have followed the HRC in criticizing North Carolina over HB2. But that hasn’t meant much so far. Key legislators have said they have no plans to repeal HB2 or make major changes to it, despite the pressure. On the other hand, the NRA has seen many of its initiatives passed in North Carolina, like 2013 law that loosened restrictions on concealed carry. Our ruling McCrory said the main group against HB2, the Human Rights Campaign, is "more powerful than the NRA." It’s a strong claim, given the NRA’s reputation for power and influence, and even the HRC spokesman was unwilling to embrace it. That’s not to say the HRC isn’t powerful. It’s a multimillion-dollar organization and the country’s largest gay rights group. But it doesn’t have the resources, adherents or success rate that the NRA does. In every way we tried to define influence, the HRC doesn’t even come close to the NRA’s level of power. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1af1e68-c8d1-4ecb-a7d5-36cb928ae38a	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-04-21T18:37:24	2016-04-17	['None']
pomt-02207	"In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every $1 a man earns."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/23/mary-burke/scott-walker-opponent-mary-burke-says-working-wisc/	Marking what President Barack Obama proclaimed as National Equal Pay Day, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke uttered a claim that many politicians have made in one form another at the state or national level. "Women deserve equal pay for equal work. It's just that simple," Burke, a Madison School Board member, said in an April 8, 2014 news release. "In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every dollar a man earns -- and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families, it hurts our economies, too." Let's take a look. Similar claims In rating a number of pay-gap claims, we and our PolitiFact colleagues have found that wording is crucial. Two of those fact-checks help put Burke's claim into perspective. Former Dane County executive Kathleen Falk, while campaigning for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination to challenge Walker in the 2012 recall election, said Wisconsin women "are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job." The key phrase was "same job." We rated the statement False, finding that Falk misquoted the very report she relied on. The report said that -- among all men and women in Wisconsin working all sorts of jobs -- women earned 81 cents for every dollar earned by men. Burke's claim, in contrast, is more similar to one made by Obama. "You know, today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns," Obama said in his January 2014 State of the Union speech. "That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work." PolitiFact National rated Obama's statement Mostly True. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our colleagues found, women who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 made 77 cents for every $1 men earned across the country. The comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation. Our colleagues noted, however, the existence of a pay gap doesn’t necessarily mean the gap is caused by discrimination. Work by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, for example, found that one factor is that women more often choose lower-paying jobs such as receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men more often pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers. Wisconsin figures So what's the situation in Wisconsin? Three organizations -- the Institute for Women's Policy Research, the National Partnership for Women & Families and the American Association of University Women -- also cited 2012 census data as the latest available. Those figures show Wisconsin women earned 78 cents per $1 earned by men. The American Association of University Women said in a March 2014 report that the median annual earnings for Wisconsin women working full time year round was $36,535 -- 78 percent of the $46,898 earned by men. (The median is the middle number -- in other words, half of the workers earned more than that amount and half earned less.) Commenting on the pay gap at the national level, the association said career choices explain some of the pay gap. But even after accounting for college major, occupation, hours worked and other factors, the association said, 7 percent of the gap nationally between men and women college graduates remained unexplained one year after graduation. So, there is evidence that Wisconsin women earn 78 cents per $1 of what men earn, although the role discrimination might play is not clear. Our rating Burke said: "In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every $1 a man earns." Her claim is slightly conservative, in that census data put the figure at 78 cents. It's worth noting that the gap is not necessarily due to discrimination -- a conclusion some might have drawn because Burke's statement made reference to pay discrimination. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2014-04-23T05:00:00	2014-04-08	['Wisconsin']

pomt-11130	Republican "sabotage" cost 3.2 million people coverage in 2017.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/01/protect-our-care/did-republican-sabotage-cost-32-million-their-heal/	Just in time for the midterms, an image is circulating on social media about a massive rise in the uninsured under Republican leadership. A tweet from Health Care Voters of Nevada featured a graphic with the title, "The cost of sabotage." "3.2 million Americans lost coverage in the first year of the Republican war on health care," the image said. The web graphic is part of a project called Protect Our Care, a coaltion of groups that aims to preserve the Affordable Care Act. We looked into that 3.2 million number and found it falls at the high end of estimates. In addition, while Republican efforts to repeal and undermine the Affordable Care Act did the law no favors, their impact in 2017 is difficult to gauge. A question of statistical significance The number comes from the polling firm Gallup. In January, Gallup found that 12.2 percent of the population said they were uninsured during the last quarter of 2017. That was 1.3 percentage points higher than the same period in the year before. The survey group was people age 18 and older. "That 1.3 point increase represents an estimated 3.2 million Americans who entered the ranks of the uninsured in 2017," Gallup wrote. So there’s hard data behind the figure. However, there are other estimates out there, and they raise questions about the 3.2 million figure. The strongest counterweight to the Gallup result comes from the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest government study showed a rise in the number of uninsured of 700,000. But the report said that was "not significantly different from 2016." That was for all ages. The picture for 18- to 64-year-olds was more complicated. The fraction of uninsured went from 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent. But taking into account the study’s margin of error (about .3 percent), the results were a statistical dead-heat. One other survey puts the Gallup figure on the high end. The New York-based Commonwealth Fund, a private health policy group, also measures insurance coverage. For its survey group of 19- to 64-year-olds, it reported that, "an estimated 4 million people lost coverage." However, that change took place over a longer period than the other studies, from early 2016 to March 2018, effectively a full two years. Republicans were in charge in Washington for only about half of that span. Looking at past Commonwealth Fund surveys, about half, or 2 million people, were added to the ranks of the uninsured on the Republicans’ watch. Sorting out the results When it comes to precision, researchers give the nod to the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey. Praise comes from many quarters, including Sara Collins, the head of the Commonwealth Fund’s work on health care coverage. She said her group can give an early view of trends, but the greatest accuracy lies with the CDC. "The large sample size of CDC’s National Health Interview Survey yields an estimate of change with smaller margins of error, and thus more definitive point estimates," Collins told us. The CDC reached over 78,000 people. By comparison, the Commonwealth Fund based its results on about 2,400 responses and Gallup’s was about 25,000. Collins added that within the limits of the Commonwealth Fund’s survey, they did not find statistically significant differences either between 2016 and 2017 or between 2017 and 2018. So in that respect, their results track with the government findings. Why do the results vary? For several reasons, the experts say. There are differences in the studies’ age groups and their response rates. Perhaps the biggest wild card is the timing of the surveys. Gallup calls people during each quarter, while the government collects data throughout the year. RAND analyst Christine Eibner put together this table with the uninsured rates for working age adults over the past two years from the three groups. (Commonwealth covers two years.) Gallup CDC Commonwealth 2016 10.9% 12.4% 12.7% 2017 12.2% 12.8% 15.5% Eibner said the key to Gallup’s estimated 3.2 million more people without insurance in 2017 lies in its 2016 figure. That’s when it’s markedly lower than the other surveys that year. But Eibner said that could be an artifact of people rushing to get insurance at the end of the year after the election. Gallup’s lower rate in 2016 would translate into a bigger jump in the uninsured when it gathered data in 2017. Eliot Fishman, director of health policy at Families USA, a partner in the Protect Our Care coalition, said given that all three surveys show a rise in the uninsured, the overall trend is well supported by the data. Republican actions The presumption in the claim is that Republicans are responsible. There’s no question that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans worked hard and nearly repealed Obamacare. Trump canceled about $10 billion in reimbursements to insurance companies, a move that drove up premiums. And the Republican tax law did away with the individual mandate penalty, which further roiled insurance markets. But insurance analyst Cynthia Cox at the Kaiser Family Foundation said the country has yet to see the full impact of all of that. "It’s worth keeping in mind that the year in question -- 2017 -- was before most of the changes from the Trump administration and Congress went into effect," Cox said. Jean Abraham at the University of Minnesota also urged caution. "I don't believe it is possible to causally attribute the increase in uninsurance to the actions of the GOP in a specific or direct way, given the large number of factors and changes occurring simultaneously," Abraham said. She noted that rising premiums were in play before Republicans took power. That made health insurance in the individual market harder to afford for about the 8 million people who received no subsidy. On the other hand, Abraham said Republican actions made the markets less affordable. Our ruling A graphic from the coalition Protect Our Care said that Republican sabotage had led to a rise of 3.2 million in the ranks of the uninsured. That specific figure is far from certain. A Gallup estimate backs up that figure, and a study by the Commonwealth Fund found an increase, but a somewhat smaller one. The government assessment deemed most reliable by health analysts found a small increase, but not one that was significantly different from the year before. On net, an increase is plausible, but the scale is hard to determine right now. As for Republican responsibility, they did make insurance less affordable in the individual market, but the full impact of their policies did not come in 2017. Given the complexity of health insurance, they bear some responsibility but not all of it. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: A previous version of this article described the web graphic as the work of Families USA. The actual creator was the coaltion that Families USA belongs to.

pomt-05109	Says U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson said he wants to "do away with Medicare."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/28/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-wants-do-away-medicare/	U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic congresswoman from Madison, painted Republicans as enemies of the elderly in a red-meat speech at a convention of liberal bloggers and activists. "As progressives let’s be clear -- on Social Security we are committed to protecting it, not privatizing it," Baldwin told Netroots Nation during its June 7, 2012, meeting in Providence, R.I. "And on Medicare we are committed to strengthening it, not ending it as we know it." She slammed former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the frontrunner among four GOP Senate contenders, for his work on behalf of drug and insurance companies after leaving the cabinet of President George W. Bush. And Baldwin dropped a stunner into her remarks about the ex-guv: "Just this week, one of my prospective opponents, Tommy Thompson, went to a tea party event and compared Medicare to welfare, and said he wanted, quote, to do away with Medicare," Baldwin said. She added, with a touch of outrage: "Do away with something the middle class has worked for, has paid for and has earned." That will get your attention -- whether you’re in Medicare, nearing eligibility or even years away. Did Thompson really express a desire to end Medicare, the long-running government-run health care program for seniors funded by taxes that come out of workers’ paychecks? Thompson’s comments As backup, Baldwin’s campaign cited Thompson’s remarks at a June 4, 2012, gathering of the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty. The Oconomowoc-based group decries excessive government and has a stated goal of "demolishing the growing, socialist ‘nanny state’ and its programs and legislation, re-instituting personal responsibility and the traditional values of work, merit, integrity, honesty, innovation, accountability, civic participation and civility." The Democratic Party filmed the speech and Baldwin’s campaign provided a copy to us. A brief portion of the speech is linked on the website of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. At the event, Thompson said Medicare will be broke within a decade and the only way to save it is to give people who turn 55 starting in 2022 a choice of traditional Medicare or purchasing health insurance with a subsidy from the federal government. If that sounds a lot like the plan from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, to reform Medicare, it should. Thompson has endorsed Ryan’s plan. Baldwin used cautious words when she described the Ryan plan, saying it would end Medicare "as we know it." Others have claimed it would simply "end" Medicare, which PolitiFact National named the 2011 Lie of the Year. So, Thompson’s remarks -- in a way -- turn the claim on its head. It’s a Republican suggesting he would end Medicare. There is another piece of background: Thompson didn’t say it at the event, but he told the Journal Sentinel in 2011 he firmly believes seniors will choose the private insurance option under Ryan’s plan over government-run care. Of government-run healthcare, he said he’s "always opposed" it. Back to the speech. Thompson did, as Baldwin claimed, wrap his argument for Medicare reform in the language of wiping it away and starting fresh. First, he harkened back to his days as Wisconsin governor, and his first-in-the-nation move to replace welfare with a work requirement. He told the audience the United States should "change Medicare and Medicaid like I did welfare." (We previously rated as Mostly True Thompson’s claim that he "ended welfare" in Wisconsin). Then there was this line, the one Baldwin latched onto: "Who better than me, (who’s) already finished one of the entitlement programs and come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare." We asked the Thompson campaign about the claim and they said it was not a misstatement by the candidate. But campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir offered this somewhat contradictory explanation: Thompson used the phrase "doing away with" in the context of "changing" Medicare, not eliminating it, he said. The speech itself is hard to decipher. Was Thompson describing his position in support of Ryan’s plan as a way of fundamentally changing Medicare? Was his characterization meant to apply to changes he helped make in Medicare when he was the U.S. secretary of health and human services? In his 2011 remarks, Thompson said government-run Medicare could disappear if people are allowed to opt out of it. Is that what he meant? Whatever his meaning, it’s clear that Thompson was comfortable uttering the phrase "doing away with Medicare" in the middle of a recitation of his views on transforming the program. At the same time, it’s clear that further into the speech, after the statement in question, Thompson said he was interested in "saving" it from fiscal extinction. He also framed his views as wanting to "change" Medicare, though in the context of his elimination of welfare in Wisconsin. Baldwin doesn’t provide those facts. Her comment that Thompson would "do away with something the middle class has worked for, has paid for and has earned" suggests Medicare will be taken away without any option. Our rating Baldwin claimed that Thompson "said he wanted, quote, to do away with Medicare." He did say it, acknowledges he did not misspeak, and Baldwin accurately repeats the phrase. Still, Baldwin leaves out evidence from Thompson’s own mouth that Thompson is talking about a dramatic transformation of Medicare in order to save government health care assistance to seniors, not end it outright. The Truth-O-Meter definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We think that fits Baldwin’s claim.

pomt-00270	Says Jacky Rosen "voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the United States."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/02/senate-leadership-fund/gop-super-pac-ad-skips-over-jacky-rosens-yes-vote-/	A Republican super PAC ad faults Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen for failing to take a tough line on criminals who try to sneak across the border. The $1.3 million ad buy from the Senate Leadership Fund is on the air and on the web statewide in Nevada’s U.S. Senate race. The ad opens with images of MS-13 gang members. The violent criminal organization runs rampant in El Salvador and is a threat in communities across the United States. "MS-13 violent gang members," a narrator says. "They exploit immigration loopholes and commit vicious crimes in the U.S. Jacky Rosen, she voted against Kate’s Law, which would close immigration loopholes and help stop criminal illegal immigrants from re-entering the U.S." The words "Rosen voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the U.S.," play across the screen. We gave it a fact-check. Understanding Kate’s Law Kate’s Law came after 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle died in San Francisco from a shot by a Mexican national with seven felony convictions who had been deported five times. The tragic death in 2015 inflamed the debate over immigration and sanctuary cities. In June 2017, a group of four House members introduced Kate’s Law. The bill imposed stricter penalties on people who had been deported or sent back before and tried to sneak back. Someone with three misdemeanors on their record, or a felony, could face up to 10 years behind bars. Those who had served time in an American jail faced ever increasing penalties, depending on the length of the original sentence. For a two-and-half year sentence, the maximum was 15 years. For a five-year sentence, the maximum was 20 years. And for the worst crimes, such as murder or rape, the maximum went to 25 years. "It is already a federal crime to enter the United States without the federal government’s permission," said César Hernández, associate professor of law at the University of Denver. "Right now, the maximum prison sentence is 20 years. Kate’s Law would increase that to 25 years, but only for people with prior convictions for a small set of serious crimes." Kate’s Law passed the House by a 257-167 vote in June 2017 but died in the Senate. Rosen voted against it. Kate’s Law targeted repeat immigration offenders and created ever more stringent penalties based on an offender’s past felony sentences. Under current law, the maximum penalty for any re-entry attempt is two years. Under Kate’s Law, after three attempts, the maximum rose to 10 years. It also expanded the universe of misdemeanors from drug-related under current law, to any misdemeanor, which could include offenses as common as traffic violations. "It will discourage people from entering the United States illegally, particularly when they have already entered illegally earlier and have been convicted of a crime for doing so," said the bill’s main sponsor, Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., in 2017. The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act Although Rosen voted against Kate’s Law, she was one of 11 Democrats who voted for the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act in September 2017. That bill made it easier for federal officials to detain and remove gang members. Under the bill, an official could act if he or she "knows or has reason to believe that such person is or has been a member of a criminal gang or has participated in criminal gang activities." The measure provided broad latitude in defining gangs and if officials had any suspicions, the person would be ineligible for asylum, temporary protected status, or special treatment because they are under 18. The bill passed in the House in September 2017, but has yet to win Senate approval. Assessing Kate’s Law and gangs In White House press briefing, U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber said Kate’s Law would help prosecutors keep gang members off the streets. "What Kate's Law does is give us one more tool that is fairly easy to use, because we're not reliant upon witnesses who may be intimidated by the gangs or victimized by the gangs," Huber said. "This enables us to, based on a person's status and their criminal record and their deportation record, to simply prosecute them in federal court, obtain a prison sentence, and get them out of here." But gang expert Robert Bunker at the University of Southern California’s Safe Communities Institute said MS-13 gang members are a special case. Imprisonment is part of initiation. "Being in prison for a gang member is considered part of ‘making one's bones’ to gain street cred and status within the gang," Bunker told us. "So, unlike cartel members who may be deterred by facing a prison sentence, a gang member — such as an MS-13 one — is not going to be deterred by it. Further, if an MS-13 gang member from Central America was ordered by his clique leader or a higher up shot-caller, to journey to the United States, they would do so. Not following orders would get them severely beaten if not killed outright." Before Kate’s Law emerged, while deportations in general more or less held steady, people deported because of their criminal history declined. This chart comes from deportation proceedings gathered by Syracuse University’s TRAC project. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com There are two ways to read the numbers. It’s possible that immigrants with felonies drew less attention over the years (although during most of the period, Washington put more focus on them). But it’s also possible that current law has been effective, without the threat of Kate’s Law. Hernandez at the University of Denver said he’s not seen any study that shows a connection between increased penalties and reduced border crossings. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said Rosen "voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the United States," citing Kate’s Law. Rosen did vote against Kate’s Law, which increased penalties for those trying to re-enter the country. However, the ad leaves out that Rosen voted in favor of another bill that specifically targeted the sort of gang members presented in the ad. The measure gave federal officers wide latitude in defining gang membership and empowered them to detain and remove any person they had reason to believe was involved with a gang. Rosen’s voting record undercuts the ad’s claim. We rate it Mostly False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Senate Leadership Fund	None	None	None	2018-10-02T15:09:44	2018-09-25	['United_States']

pomt-07661	"A new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/11/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-epa-treats-milk-spills-same-w/	U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop. The Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and "fight to rein in the EPA." Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements. In a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter "Crying over spilt milk." "What do spilt milk and oil have in common?" he wrote. "Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPA’s reasoning is that milk contains ‘a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil.’ It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill." With visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim. Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, said her boss’s information came from the EPA’s website. So we went there. Right away, we found problems with Griffith’s claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a "new ruling," as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years. The EPA site says "since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of ‘oil’ from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress." The website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk. So what’s new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month. The simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. That’s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Here’s what the regulation says: "EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade "A" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance," or similar state laws. Translated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPA’s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell "raw," or unpasteurized, milk, so the state’s dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards. Raw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk. Baffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms. Let’s review our findings. Griffith claimed a "new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply" with strict regulations for spills and leaks.

pomt-00784	Says Ted Cruz said, "There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our Constitution makes that clear."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/apr/08/facebook-posts/meme-facebook-says-ted-cruz-declared-no-place-gays/	Here we go again: A reader just pointed out a Facebook meme suggesting Texan Ted Cruz declared America constitutionally off limits to gays and atheists last month when he declared his candidacy for president. We recently found Pants on Fire a Facebook post saying the Canada-born Cruz, the Republican U.S. senator who announced his presidential candidacy at Liberty University in Virginia, had conveniently flip-flopped on each president needing to be born in the United States. Did not happen. The ‘no place’ Facebook post Now let’s turn to the Facebook post brought to our attention most recently: SOURCE: Facebook post, March 25, 2015 (noted by a PolitiFact reader April 2, 2015) The image had a tagline mentioning a Facebook page titled "Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want Off." Off we clicked, learning that Facebook page includes this disclaimer about its posts: "This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages." The afternoon we scrolled the page, we didn’t spot the Cruz meme. But the image and purported Cruz statement had been sent out by the group in this March 25, 2015, tweet: SOURCE: Twitter post, @StopTeabaggers, March 25, 2015 No confirmation in news stories The image did not put the statement in quotation marks. Still, the meme as a whole struck us as leaving the impression that Cruz said it. And it doesn’t look like he did. In fact, online searches and a check of the Nexis news database yielded no evidence Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, has ever made a comment about the Constitution leaving no place for gays or atheists in his America. To our inquiry about the presented quotation, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said by email it’s "obviously false." Cruz’s speech declaring for president Next, we scrutinized a Washington Post transcript of Cruz’s March 23, 2015 speech declaring for president. In the speech, Cruz mentioned marriage once, gays and atheists not at all. On marriage, he said: "Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage." Cruz didn’t mention atheists, but he emphasized religious faith before students at the university founded by the late Jerry Falwell, an evangelist. For instance, Cruz referred to "the God-given liberty of every American." He also said: "God’s blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation, and I believe God isn’t done with America yet." He closed: "I am honored to stand with each and every one of you courageous conservatives as we come together to reclaim the promise of America, to reclaim the mandate, the hope and opportunity for our children and our children’s children. We stand together for liberty. "This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington. It will come only from the men and women across this country, from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution. "It will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country, when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great. We will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America." Other Cruz comments Finally, we looked into whether the meme’s quotations reflected on past Cruz comments. Cruz has repeatedly said he doesn’t want gay marriages to be legal, as the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, spells out in its "Republican Facts" web page titled: "Ted Cruz: Not a Fan of Pride Parades." In March 2012, Cruz was quoted by Peggy Fikac of the San Antonio Express-News saying: "I believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is a choice, and I do not believe that unelected judges should force states to adopt gay marriage, against the wishes of the people. Marriage is a fundamental building block of our society, and I have a proven record of standing and fighting to protect traditional marriage between one man and one woman." Cruz also has stressed his religious faith; he’s a Baptist, Tyler told us. And in spring 2014, Cruz made a public jab about atheists, as recapped April 2, 2014, by the National Journal. Mentioning an Air Force chaplain ordered by his supervisor to take down a religious blog post he'd written, deeming it insensitive to atheists, Cruz said: "I sort of thought the job of a chaplain is to be insensitive to atheists." By telephone, Danielle Muscato of American Atheists, which says it’s a "nonprofit, nonpolitical, educational organization dedicated to the complete and absolute separation of state and church," told us she couldn’t confirm Cruz making the "my America" claim. Our ruling A Facebook post suggests Cruz said the day he declared for president, "There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our Constitution makes that clear." Cruz has been clear about his belief in God and opposition to legalizing gay marriages. However, there is no record of him saying the Constitution leaves no place for gays or atheists in "my America." Pants on Fire!

pomt-04128	U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss votes more with Democrats than with conservatives.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/08/amy-kremer/chambliss-not-true-conservative-critic-says/	Is U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss actually down with the Democrats? A Georgia-based tea party leader made the assertion about the veteran Republican lawmaker during a recent segment on CNN. Amy Kremer, chair of the Tea Party Express, was angry with Chambliss for voting for a bill to avert the so-called "fiscal cliff." Many conservatives have complained the deal does little to slow spending, but raises income taxes on the wealthiest Americans. "I live in the state of Georgia and Saxby Chambliss is going to be primaried, our own senator. It's unacceptable to have somebody that votes with the Democrats more than they do with the conservatives," Kremer said. "And he has proven time and time again, he's all about the spending, and we're a red state, we deserve a conservative senator." PolitiFact Georgia was curious about the claim that Chambliss "votes with the Democrats" more than conservatives. Is there any truth to that in this age of partisan Washington politics or were Kremer’s remarks an exaggeration? Chambliss was a charter member of a group of a bipartisan senators that has tried in recent years to come up with solutions to the federal government’s fiscal challenges. His work with the group has drawn the suspicious eye of budget hawks and conservatives, a shift from the days he was viewed as a hero of the right after defeating DeKalb County Democrat Max Cleland for the U.S. Senate seat that Chambliss has now held since 2003. There’s been talk of Chambliss facing a Republican primary challenger when he’s up for re-election in 2014. Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint suspects that critics are using such vitriol in hopes of lining up opposition to Chambliss in 2014. "Somebody saying that is someone who wants a very conservative or right-wing alternative," Swint told us. So what about the accuracy of Kremer’s claim? We couldn’t find any statistics that specifically show whether Chambliss has voted more frequently with Democrats than conservatives. There is some research that has examined how often he’s voted with Republicans. What we found shows Chambliss hasn’t strayed too far from Republicans on most issues. Chambliss voted with fellow Republicans 91 percent of the time in 2011 and 2012, according to a Washington Post analysis. Only two Republican senators, John Cornyn of Texas and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, exceeded that percentage. And that was barely higher, at 92 percent. Chambliss voted with Republicans 95 percent of the time in 2009 and 2010, the Post reported. Another website, Open Congress, says Chambliss votes with his party 92 percent of the time. Again, Cornyn and McConnell were the only Republicans currently serving in the U.S. Senate who voted with their party with greater frequency (93 percent) than Chambliss. The Tea Party Express sent us a statement from Kremer that explained she was referring to key votes Chambliss has taken in recent years that she said "have separated him from the true fiscal conservatives." "In addition to the fiscal cliff legislation that has just passed, Chambliss has repeatedly voted for big government solutions favored by Democrats … Chambliss has been on the wrong side of every one of these votes," Kremer wrote. Kremer also complained in her statement that Chambliss added pork to bills in 2009 and 2010 and supported T-SPLOST, a proposed 1 percent sales tax increase to fund transportation projects in Georgia. Voters in most parts of the state overwhelmingly rejected the tax. Some of the legislation Kremer cited that Chambliss voted in favor of, such as the 2008 Wall Street bailout, a 2008 stimulus package and Medicare Part D, were supported by then-President George W. Bush, a Republican. Some of those bills had more support from Democrats. As for T-SPLOST, Chambliss said he was going to vote for it in the referendum because he thought it would create jobs in his hometown, Moultrie, and the surrounding area. Chambliss said his vote was not an endorsement and urged voters statewide to make up their own minds about T-SPLOST. Chambliss has voted with Republicans against Democrats on prominent bills such as Obama administration appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court, the federal health care law, the DREAM Act for illegal immigrants, extending the Bush administration tax cuts and an audit of the Federal Reserve. The American Conservative Union has conducted annual ratings of Congress since 1971, measuring how aligned the lawmaker is to the organization’s stance on legislation it says was important. In 2011, the most recent year available, Chambliss received a score of 80 on a scale of 100. That was lower than 27 Republican senators and tied him with three others. Chambliss’ lifetime average is 92.5, which is higher than most Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Chambliss said via email that some of Kremer’s claims were inaccurate. The senator defended some of his past votes, arguing he was "voting with my Republican president and a majority of the Republican caucus." "The tea party and I agree on the cause of America’s fiscal problems, and that much more needs to be done to address our country’s overspending," Chambliss said. To sum up, Kremer said Chambliss votes with Democrats more than conservatives. Her point was that the senator doesn’t vote along with fiscal conservatives on key issues. There are votes by Chambliss that differed from some senators considered conservative. Chambliss, though, has voted along with conservatives on some big issues as well. His voting record shows the senator votes with his GOP colleagues more than 90 percent of the time and his lifetime average with the ACU is better than most Republicans currently serving in the Senate.

pomt-01497	Says Scott Walker cut "taxes for the wealthiest" and raised taxes "on 140,000 Wisconsin families."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/25/mary-burke/scott-walker-cut-taxes-rich-raised-them-families-m/	In a TV ad released Sept. 11, 2014, Democrat Mary Burke looked into the camera and showed a bit of a whimsical side. "You know who had a really good idea about taxes?" she asked. "Ronald Reagan. Surprised you, didn't I?" Burke praised the late Republican president’s 1986 expansion of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit. It reduces the income taxes owed by low- and moderate-income workers, or enables them to collect a tax refund. Burke then pivoted to GOP Gov. Scott Walker. "You know who had a really bad idea? Governor Walker," she said. "He did just the opposite, cutting taxes for the wealthiest and raising them on 140,000 Wisconsin families." Is that Walker’s record on taxes? Tax cuts ‘for the wealthiest" Let’s start with "cutting taxes for the wealthiest," the first part of Burke’s claim. Has Walker helped richer folks? Sure. His first state budget, for 2011-’13, plus other measures adopted in 2011, provided tax cuts to corporations, businesses, manufacturers and investors, among other groups. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the nonpartisan scorekeeper on state budget matters, estimated their value at $2.33 billion over 10 years. The largest tax cut, done through tax credits for production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses, helps not only corporations but also individual owners of smaller businesses. Indeed, we rated Mostly True a claim that the credits would enable a factory owner -- in some scenarios -- to pay less in state income tax on those production earnings than a minimum-wage fast-food worker. But Walker has also cut income taxes across every income bracket. His second budget, for 2013-’15, lowered rates (while reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four) And later, in 2014, Walker signed legislation that dropped the lowest rate again (from 4.4 percent to 4 percent). Here are examples are for married couples filing jointly. Taxable income Tax rate/Previous law Tax rate/Current law Up to $14,540 4.6% 4% $14,540 to $29,090 6.15% 5.84% $29,090 to $215,000 6.5% 6.27% $215,000 to $320,250 6.75% 6.27% $320,250 and over 7.75% 7.65% *Taxable income levels shown are current. The income levels were slightly lower under the previous law. For example, the first tax bracket was up to $14,000 income, rather than $14,540. A few points on the table: The lowest bracket applies to all taxpayers. In other words, all tax filers are subject to the 4 percent tax rate on their first $14,500 of income, then the rates go up as taxable income reaches higher levels. Reduced tax rates don’t help if your income is so low that you don’t owe any income tax. In that vein, some groups advocate for expanding the state Earned Income Tax Credit, which can result in more taxpayers receiving income tax refunds after their returns are filed. Burke’s campaign pointed out that couples earning $29,090 got a tax rate reduction from 6.15 percent to 5.84 percent, but couples earning up to $320,250 got a larger reduction, from 6.75 percent to 6.27 percent. In addition, the income tax changes enacted under Walker include other breaks for people across many income levels, including those with health savings accounts and those who send their children to private schools. So, Walker cut taxes for the wealthy, but for a broad cross-section of taxpayers, as well. Tax increases Now to the other part of Burke’s claim -- that Walker raised taxes on 140,000 families. Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, contained what the Legislative Fiscal Bureau classified as $49 million in tax increases. The largest change was a reduction in the state Earned Income Tax Credit which, as we’ve noted, reduces the amount of income taxes a person owes or enables the person to get a tax refund. The fiscal bureau calculated that about 140,000 recipients would see their credits reduced. In other words, they would pay more in taxes or get a smaller tax refund. Here’s how the maximum credits were reduced for families with two or more children: Family size Maximum EITC/Previous Law Maximum EITC/Current Law One child $124 $124 Two children $716 $562 Three or more children $2,473 $1,955 So, 140,000 fewer lower-income people received the state Earned Income Tax Credit. About three-fourths of the money in the state Earned Income Tax Credit program pays for income tax refunds for those lower-income people, rather than reducing any state income tax they owe. Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the Wisconsin Budget Project, which is part of the liberal advocacy group Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said most of the 140,000 who lost their credits would not save enough from the reduction in income tax rates to make up for that loss. In other words, they’d be paying more in income taxes or be getting a smaller refund. Dale Knapp, research director of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said he believes most of the 140,000 would benefit to some extent from the tax rate cuts, but that he didn’t know whether that savings would offset the lost tax credit. Our rating Burke said Walker cut "taxes for the wealthiest" and raised taxes "on 140,000 Wisconsin families." Walker cut taxes for wealthier residents and raised taxes for people on the lower end of the scale. But he also made tax cuts that applied across the board.

pomt-05599	Says Gloria Steinem once called Kay Bailey Hutchison a "female impersonator."	true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/29/michelle-malkin/gloria-steinem-once-called-kay-bailey-hutchison-fe/	As right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh took flak for terming law student Sandra Fluke a "slut" over her claim that contraceptives can cost $3,000 a year, another pundit argued that conservative women are frequently targets of liberal vitriol. Syndicated writer and Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin listed such epithets in her March 7, 2012 column, including a Texas example: "It was feminist godmother Gloria Steinem who called Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison a ‘female impersonator.’ " Did women’s rights icon Steinem really belittle the femininity of Texas’ first female U.S. senator? Yes. The comment made national news in 1993 as Hutchison, then state treasurer, ran for U.S. Senate in a special election runoff against interim Democratic appointee Bob Krueger. Hutchison won the seat and has held it ever since; she is expected to retire from Congress in January 2013. USA Today, Time and NPR all ran 1993 news stories or opinion pieces describing gender-based attacks on Hutchison that included the "female impersonator" comment from Steinem. A June 25, 1993, opinion column in the Orange County Register gives this fuller version of the quotation: "a female impersonator … someone who looks like us but thinks like them." The longer quotation helped us pin down a probable date for Steinem’s remark, and Dallas Morning News senior political writer Wayne Slater searched his paper’s archives and sent us a May 23, 1993, news story that reads, in part: "Ms. Steinem, the founder of Ms. magazine, attacked Ms. Hutchison's stands on abortion and family-leave policies during a visit Friday in Dallas on behalf of Mr. Krueger. Ms. Steinem called Ms. Hutchison ‘a female impersonator.' " A May 22, 1993, Austin American-Statesman news story gives context for the "impersonator" remark: "Steinem said she was endorsing Krueger because of his support for abortion rights. She said Hutchison ‘has vacillated between a pro-choice and an anti-choice position for the last three years, after having been solidly anti-choice for 20 years.’ "Hutchison has said she favors abortion rights but would allow states to impose some restrictions, such as requiring minors to get parental consent." National news outlets picked up on the irony of a feminist saying that a female politician’s views disqualified her from being a real woman. Time magazine used the quotation to start its June 14, 1993, story on Hutchison’s win: "Gloria Steinem flew to Texas all the way from New York City to call Senate candidate Kay Bailey Hutchison a ‘female impersonator.’ Actress Annie Potts of ‘Designing Women’ pooh-poohed the Republican's vague stance on abortion rights, saying, ‘She's just the same old thing in a skirt.’ Columnist Molly Ivins hung the epithet ‘Breck girl’ on her, comparing the way the candidate tossed her blond hair to the slow-motion antics of models in the shampoo commercial. But Hutchison, the Texas state treasurer, survived those and many other attacks." For decades, Steinem has used the term "female impersonator" to describe women, including herself, who she said stopped being authentically female as they fit themselves into patriarchal society. She reportedly quipped in 1973, about men dressing as women, "I don’t mind drag -- women have been female impersonators for years." In a December 10, 1989, Los Angeles Times feature story, she said, "I was trained to be a female impersonator, to giggle and laugh, and to say, 'How clever of you to know what time it is.' " In her 1992 book, "Revolution From Within," she used the term to describe pre-teen girls forced into false role-playing as they move into adolescence. Malkin cited Steinem’s use of the term against Hutchison to rebut claims that attacks on conservative women come from extremists or entertainers rather than mainstream liberals. Malkin also pointed to comments from a National Organization for Women leader, MSNBC TV hosts and an Al Gore political consultant, among others. Our ruling Steinem referred to Hutchison as a female impersonator. Malkin’s statement rates True.

pomt-08929	In New Mexico, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish "spent federal stimulus funds on campaign Christmas cards."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/26/susana-martinez/new-mexico-gubernatorial-race-susana-martinez-accu/	With New Mexico's two-term Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson leaving office later this year, a lively contest to succeed him has broken out between Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish and Republican challenger Susana Martinez. In a recent ad, Martinez charged, "As jobs were lost, Richardson-Denish wasted millions. ... Denish even spent federal stimulus funds on campaign Christmas cards." We wondered whether the charge was accurate, and how serious a breach it would be. The expenditures came to light on Nov. 4, 2009, when the New Mexico Watchdog -- a blog sponsored by the libertarian Rio Grande Foundation -- published an investigation of expenditures from 2003 and 2004, when Denish was lieutenant governor. The blog alleged, and documents from Denish confirm, that Denish used some federal stimulus funds to pay a contract employee. It's worth noting that the stimulus funds in question were not from the bill signed by President Barack Obama in February 2009 but rather from a 2003 bill signed by President George W. Bush. Here's what the Watchdog wrote: "Lt. Governor Diane Denish used $225,000 in federal funds to pay for a driver to shuttle her to meetings and press events, a contractor to take Christmas pictures and write Christmas cards, a lawyer to make hotel reservations, opinion polling, and public relations services. The money was given to her for 'various projects' by Governor Bill Richardson. The money came from unallocated federal fiscal stimulus funds transferred to the New Mexico treasury under the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act." Of these expenditures, the most widely noted became the Christmas cards, and we'll focus on that alone, since that's what the ad talks about. (A detailed discussion of the controversy by journalist Heath Haussamen in the New Mexico Independent, including links to original documents, can be found here.) The Watchdog blog post said that Lauran Cowdrey, one of the contractors who had been paid using the excess federal funds, had filed an invoice, which was eventually paid, for "6 hours at $23.50 per hour on November 22, 2004, detailed in her time sheet as 'taking Christmas pictures, removing decorations, setting up pre-K interviews, organizing speeches and releases for website. On November 24, 2004, Cowdrey billed 8 hours described as 'work on Christmas card, work on history book request.'" With jockeying for the 2010 gubernatorial election already well under way, several GOP hopefuls, including Martinez, jumped on the allegations. Denish's office immediately responded by providing a bill and canceled check for the Christmas cards, which totaled $3,666.90. The check, dated Dec. 28, 2004, was written on a campaign account rather than using federal funds routed through the state government. So that clears the actual purchase of the cards from any potential federal violation. But that doesn't account for the money paid to Cowdrey to handle the Christmas card project. Because many public officials are allowed to use taxpayer funds for items such as Christmas cards, we asked the Denish campaign whether these particular cards were considered official business or a campaign project. They said that it was considered a campaign project. Because of that, it was improper to bill the state for it, ethics experts told PolitiFact. Instead, the campaign should have paid for Cowdrey's efforts or else she could have volunteered her time. But how big a deal was it that the taxpayers paid for Cowdrey's time working on the project? Our sources agreed: Not big at all. We estimate that the misallocated fedral funds would have been, at most, $141, or six hours times her $23.50 per hour pay rate. We asked government ethics experts what they thought of such a violation. "As a practical matter, because the use of the employee's time was essentially incidental, no enforcement authority is likely to get interested this," said Kenneth A. Gross, a former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission who is now an attorney with the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. "If there is a way to reimburse the government, it may be prudent to do so as a political matter." Holman, of Public Citizen, called the violation "so minor that I would not expect significant penalties, if any. It sounds like a small, careless action. A warning would probably be sufficient." We should remind readers that there were many allegations in the original Watchdog report that came with bigger pricetags, but we aren't ruling on them in this item. Haussamen noted one case in which Denish decided to reimburse her state office after he published evidence that some of the stimulus funds had been spent on putting out political news releases. All told, we think the documentation makes clear that Denish spent federal stimulus funds to prepare Christmas cards, and the canceled campaign check justifies the ad calling them "campaign Christmas cards." Even so, our experts agreed that these actions would have produced a monetary loss so small that they would be unlikely to trigger anything beyond a warning and a request for repayment, if that. So we rate the ad Half True.	None	Susana Martinez	None	None	None	2010-07-26T14:58:49	2010-07-22	['New_Mexico', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06423	Herman Cain is a "pro-choice candidate."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/24/iowans-some-semblance-christian-decency/herman-cain-decidedly-anti-abortion/	Republican presidential contender Herman Cain is "pro-choice"? That’s the thrust of a flier that appeared on car windshields outside the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition’s fall banquet in Des Moines on Oct. 22, 2011. It was put out by two groups, Iowans for Some Semblance of Christian Decency and Iowans For Truth and Honest Government, neither of which appears to have a website. The leaflet declared, "When it came time to stand and defend the most helpless citizens in our country, presidential candidate Herman Cain threw the babies under the bus." As evidence, sandwiched between a picture of the smiling candidate and another of an aborted fetus, the flier provided a quote from Cain saying, "It ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make." Cain, former head of Godfather’s Pizza, is known to be an across-the-board conservative, so we decided to see what his position has been. The quote on the flier comes from an interview Cain did with CNN’s Piers Morgan on Oct. 19, 2011. Here’s a transcript of their exchange about abortion: Morgan: Abortion. What's your view of abortion? Cain: I believe that life begins at conception. And abortion under no circumstances. And here's why -- Morgan: No circumstances? Cain: No circumstances. Morgan: Because many of your fellow candidates -- some of them qualify that. Cain: They qualify but -- Morgan: Rape and incest. Cain: Rape and incest. Morgan: Are you honestly saying -- again, it's a tricky question, I know. Cain: Ask the tricky question. Morgan: But you've had children, grandchildren. If one of your female children, grandchildren was raped, you would honestly want her to bring up that baby as her own? Cain: You're mixing two things here, Piers? Morgan: Why? Cain: You're mixing -- Morgan: That's what it comes down to. Cain: No, it comes down to it's not the government's role or anybody else's role to make that decision. Secondly, if you look at the statistical incidents, you're not talking about that big a number. So what I'm saying is it ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make. Not me as president, not some politician, not a bureaucrat. It gets down to that family. And whatever they decide, they decide. I shouldn't have to tell them what decision to make for such a sensitive issue. So first Cain said abortion is allowable under "no circumstances," but then he seemed to be arguing it wasn’t a decision for the government to make, which sounds pretty pro-abortion rights to us. The next day, Cain’s campaign issued a statement attempting to clarify the point. Cain said he "understood the thrust of the question to ask whether that I, as president, would simply 'order' people to not seek an abortion. "My answer was focused on the role of the president. The president has no constitutional authority to order any such action by anyone. That was the point I was trying to convey. As to my political policy view on abortion, I am 100% pro-life. End of story." He went on to specify that he would appoint anti-abortion judges and oppose any government funding of abortion, including defunding Planned Parenthood. "I will do everything that a president can do, consistent with his constitutional role, to advance the culture of life," the statement said. Even if his explanation was a little clumsy, and did little to quell the controversy that erupted over what he said to Morgan, Cain's political history supports his anti-abortion stance. In 2003 and 2004, when he was running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Georgia, news stories consistently portrayed him as anti-abortion. "An associate pastor of Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta, Cain opposes abortion unless it is to save the life of the mother," the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote on Aug. 10, 2003. In May 2004, the paper ran a story about his radio ads attacking his primary opponents, one of whom was accused of flip-flopping on the issue. "He had the opportunity to protect innocent life and he didn't. He has been touting that he is pro-life, yet he votes for pro-choice legislation. If he is pro-life, he needs to vote pro-life," the Cain ad stated, according to the AJC. Later, in 2007, when Cain was working in talk radio, the L.A. Times wrote a story about abortion opponents reaching out to African-American voters. The story said "a political action committee run by black radio talk show host Herman Cain poured $1 million into edgy ads on urban radio. One spot contended that Democratic support for abortion laws is "decimating our people." It concluded: "Democrats say they want our vote. Why don't they want our lives?" Throughout this year’s presidential campaign Cain has said he’s opposed to the procedure, although he prompted controversy once before when he refused to sign a pledge from a conservative group to promise to end all abortion funding. A June 21, 2011, Boston Globe story said he refused to sign it "because of concern about separation of executive and congressional powers." We checked with a couple of outside groups -- one on each side of the abortion issue -- to see how they sized up Cain’s record. The National Right to Life Committee posted this chart indicating Cain has promised to end taxpayer funding of abortions and is opposed to Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. And NARAL Pro-Choice America cites four examples on its website that portray Cain opposing abortion rights. "Herman Cain is anti-choice. Any claim to the contrary is wrong," NARAL communications director Ted Miller said in an e-mail. Our ruling The flier in Iowa called Cain a "pro-choice candidate" who "threw the babies under the bus" by making a statement about abortion being a personal choice. He explained himself by saying he was answering a question about presidential powers, not how he feels about the morality or legality of abortion. On that, Cain has been consistent for years -- consistently anti-abortion. We rate the claim on the flier False.

pomt-03603	U.S. Rep. John Barrow of Georgia has helped support the implementation of "Obamacare."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/may/10/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-attacks-barrow-obamacare-votes/	Call it a pre-emptive strike, guilt by association or just good ol’ fashioned partisan politics. The National Republican Senatorial Committee sent out a news release shortly after the April 29 debate between the candidates running for a vacant congressional seat in South Carolina. Former Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, won the seat Tuesday. The committee claimed in its release that Sanford’s opponent, Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, was attempting to distance herself from the federal health care law, commonly called "Obamacare." Here’s the paragraph that drew our interest because of its Georgia connection: "ObamaCare has gone from being an ‘abstract’ discussion to a real life pain for families and businesses which has Democrats who supported this costly agenda like Bruce Braley, Mark Pryor, Mark Begich, Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, Jeanne Shaheen, John Barrow, Mark Udall, Gary Peters, Al Franken, Mark Warner, Tom Udall, Dick Durbin and Jeff Merkley in a tailspin," it stated. Barrow, from Augusta, is in his fifth term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans have tried hard in recent years to unseat Barrow, who has fashioned himself as a moderate. We wondered about the accuracy of this claim because Barrow voted in 2010 against the creation of the health care law. "I am strongly in favor of reforming the health care system, but I don’t think this bill is going to do it, and therefore I can’t support it," Barrow said before the vote. "It puts too much of the burden of paying for it on working folks who are already being overcharged, and that’s not fair. It threatens to overwhelm Medicaid in Georgia, and that's not right. And it barely touches the insurance companies, and that's not smart. We can do better and I’m ready to start." NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen said the claim is accurate, citing two votes Barrow cast against repealing the entire health care law. Those votes came in January 2011 and last July. The repeal measure passed in the Republican-controlled House, but repeal efforts consistently failed in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats held a slim majority. "He voted against ObamaCare before voting twice to keep the costly health care overhaul in place," Hougesen said via email. Hougesen concluded by saying: "Facts are a stubborn thing, and no matter how hard Barrow or Obama attempt to cast blame on Republicans for their disastrous law, it’s theirs to own." Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo said the NRSC’s accusations against his boss are "the same song and dance from these folks who don’t necessarily understand how the process works." Carbo said there are pieces of the health care law that Barrow wants to keep in place, such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying care because of pre-existing conditions. Barrow also supports the provision that allows children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26 years old. Carbo said Barrow wants to remove some of the most controversial pieces of the health care law, such as: The Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is designed to examine quality and access to care under the law, the effects of changes in payments to providers. The individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or face a tax penalty. An employer mandate that businesses with more than 50 full-time employees offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker above 30 employees. Bill Custer, the director of Georgia State University’s Center for Health Services Research, said the health care law is complicated and blanket statements about its impact on businesses and people "are wrong on either side." Custer said the law will help some small businesses that were previously unable to hire more workers because they can now offer health insurance or the worker can buy it through a health insurance exchange. Some larger businesses, he said, may be hurt by the law because of its potential penalties. "The overarching answer is adding and removing some provisions will help and hurt some individuals and businesses. It’s not an easy divide," said Custer, an associate professor who previously was an economist in a division of the American Medical Association and has written several papers on health insurance. Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the Washington-based America's Health Insurance Plans, sent us a chart showing information from five different organizations that concluded removing the individual mandate would result in millions of additional uninsured Americans and an increase in private health insurance premiums. "If you remove just the mandates and leave everything else in place, the cost of coverage would increase quite dramatically," he said. AHIP, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry, supports bipartisan legislation introduced in February that would remove the health insurance tax scheduled to take effect in 2014. Zirkelbach noted Barrow is one of the bill’s sponsors. "Unless this tax is repealed, next year an average family will pay over $300 in higher premiums, seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage will face $220 in reduced benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs, and state Medicaid managed care plans will incur an additional $80 in costs for each person covered," AHIP wrote after the bill was introduced. Zirkelbach sent us a chart showing the tax will result in an increase in premiums of between $5,539 and $6,777 for the average Georgia family over a 10-year stretch. So where does this leave us? The NRSC says Barrow’s unwillingness to vote for repealing the health care law is a "real life pain" for people and businesses because of its costs. An argument can be made that Barrow’s votes against repeal are tantamount to indirect support of its implementation. In other words, the NRSC says, Barrow owns it. Barrow, however, voted against the original Obamacare legislation and wants to repeal various parts of the law. The GOP cherry-picked a few votes to stretch a point here on a lawmaker it wants to defeat, Our rating: Mostly False.

pomt-07600	On the president unilaterally authorizing a military attack "that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation."	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/23/barack-obama/barack-obamas-libya-intervention-flip-flop-what-he/	In the wake of U.S. participation in military operations against targets in Libya, commentators on the left and the right have raised questions about whether President Barack Obama had the required authority to launch operations without specific authorization from Congress. A reader pointed out to us that Obama himself had made a notable comment during a 2007 interview with Charlie Savage, then a journalist with the Boston Globe. Savage asked Obama, "In what circumstances, if any, would the president have constitutional authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use-of-force authorization from Congress? (Specifically, what about the strategic bombing of suspected nuclear sites -- a situation that does not involve stopping an IMMINENT threat?)" While the specific context of Savage’s question concerned Iranian nuclear plants, we think Obama’s answer raised some points that are relevant for assessing the justification for the Libyan operation three years later. Obama said, "The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation." He added, "As commander-in-chief, the president does have a duty to protect and defend the United States. In instances of self-defense, the president would be within his constitutional authority to act before advising Congress or seeking its consent. History has shown us time and again, however, that military action is most successful when it is authorized and supported by the legislative branch. It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action." We wondered whether Obama’s initiation of military operations in Libya represented a flip-flop on his stated principle that "the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation." First, some background on presidential and congressional war powers. The Constitution (Article I, Section 8) assigns the right to declare war to Congress. But the last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II. In subsequent wars, the president has generally initiated military activities using his constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief. Walter Dellinger -- former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton -- wrote recently that "presidential administrations of both political parties have recognized a long tradition that supports this use of force. And Congress has acknowledged its legitimacy as well." Specifically, Dellinger cited a pair of opinions by his office -- one from 1994 and one from 1995 -- that relied in large part on the War Powers Resolution, which was passed by Congress in 1973 and enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon. The resolution grew out of concern by lawmakers and other critics that U.S. involvement in Vietnam had never received the necessary approval from Congress. "The resolution requires that, in the absence of a declaration of war, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into such circumstances and must terminate the use of U.S. armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise," Dellinger writes. By regulating the principle "that the president may introduce troops into hostilities or potential hostilities without prior authorization by the Congress," the War Powers Resolution effectively confirms that principle, Dellinger argues. The experts we asked generally agreed with this line of argument. In fact, some went so far as to say that the president’s powers to initiate military activities without specific congressional consent are by now so deeply ingrained that Obama’s 2007 comment to Savage was factually inaccurate. "The 2007 statement materially omitted key information -- I would charitably call it a ‘misrepresentation’ -- that would lead the average voter to believe that then-presidential candidate Obama was a champion of the Constitution’s restraints on executive power, as opposed to (George W. Bush) the cowboy," said Steven Groves, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. However, in this item, we’re not rating Obama’s 2007 comment on the Truth-O-Meter. Instead, we’re trying to judge whether Obama has changed his standards for initiating military action between then and now. That requires taking a look the president’s justification of military operations in Libya. In a March 21, 2011, letter to congressional leaders, Obama wrote that "as part of the multilateral response authorized under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, U.S. military forces, under the command of Commander, U.S. Africa Command, began a series of strikes against air defense systems and military airfields for the purposes of preparing a no-fly zone. These strikes will be limited in their nature, duration, and scope. Their purpose is to support an international coalition as it takes all necessary measures to enforce the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. These limited U.S. actions will set the stage for further action by other coalition partners." Obama went on to say that the U.N. resolution authorized "all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya. … (Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's) continued attacks and threats against civilians and civilian populated areas are of grave concern to neighboring Arab nations and, as expressly stated in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, constitute a threat to the region and to international peace and security. His illegitimate use of force not only is causing the deaths of substantial numbers of civilians among his own people, but also is forcing many others to flee to neighboring countries, thereby destabilizing the peace and security of the region. Left unaddressed, the growing instability in Libya could ignite wider instability in the Middle East, with dangerous consequences to the national security interests of the United States." So, how well does this match up with Obama’s 2007 statement that "the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation"? We think the question boils down to whether the actions being taken in Libya "involve stopping an actual or imminent threat" to the United States. Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said he doesn’t perceive a strong argument that Libya represents "an actual or imminent threat to the nation." To him, that phrase suggests "a circumstance where the other state was engaging in or was about to engage in something tantamount to an armed attack against the United States (or, presumably, its allies). In the Libyan case, there is no such threat -- actual or imminent -- to the United States or its allies." Temple University law professor Peter J. Spiro said the administration could argue that the threat of a widespread humanitarian disaster in a sensitive region would be tantamount to "an imminent threat to the nation," thus justifying Obama’s actions under his 2007 principle. Indeed, that seems to be the argument Obama made when he said that "left unaddressed, the growing instability in Libya could ignite wider instability in the Middle East, with dangerous consequences to the national security interests of the United States." Most of our experts, however, saw that as a stretch. Kal Raustiala, a University of California at Los Angeles law professor, said that, "on the merits, he is right now and was wrong then." Legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. said he sees "no plausible loophole. He may possibly be right now ... but if so, he was wrong then." Raustiala points out that Savage specifically referenced Iran’s nuclear program in his question to Obama. But we think that Obama’s answer was sufficiently broad that it would be incorrect to assume that he was only talking about the scenario of attacking Iran over its pursuit of nuclear weapons. So where does this leave us? In 2007, Obama was adamant that the president did not have the power to authorize an attack if there was no imminent threat to the U.S. But now he has authorized just such an action. Full Flop.

pomt-00036	"Nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked Claire one of the most independent senators — right in the middle."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2018/nov/05/claire-mccaskill/sen-claire-mccaskill-one-americas-most-independent/	Trying to maintain her Senate seat in a historically red state, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has touted her voting record and bipartisan work as examples of her independence in one of her campaign ads. "Nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked Claire one of the most independent senators — right in the middle," her campaign said in a TV ad. Her Republican challenger, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is critical of her for often voting along party lines. Does McCaskill follow party precedent, or does she often stray from the left side of the aisle when making her decisions? Report cards, records, and rankings McCaskill’s ad cited Congressional Quarterly, her GovTrack Analysis records and National Journal ideology rankings to back up the claimed independent streak. Here’s what they said: • Congressional Quarterly: The publication’s analysis showed McCaskill was one of the least likely to vote in line with her own party, doing so 82 percent of the time in 2017. Only three senators, Angus King (81 percent), Joe Donnelly (74 percent) and Joe Manchin (64 percent), broke from their party during votes more often than McCaskill. • GovTrack: GovTrack is a small, four-member organization that regularly publishes the status of federal legislation and information about representatives and senators in Congress. On the site’s analytics page for McCaskill, the first metric displayed is her ideology chart. She is one of approximately 10 senators that rests ideologically close to the middle. GovTrack’s report card for her 2017 legislative year ranked her the sixth most conservative Senate Democrat. She joined bipartisan bills the seventh most often of all senators. • National Journal: Since 2007, her first year in office, McCaskill was ranked by National Journal as the 43rd, 52nd, 53rd, 48th, 51st, 57th and 50th most conservative member of the Senate, respectively, of the 100 members. National Journal stopped creating its ideology rankings in 2013, according to McCaskill’s team. Independent vs. moderate We reached out to six political science experts to shed some light on what factors might qualify a senator as independent. All but one of our experts noted that the wording of the claim is odd. As Cato Institute research fellow and editor Jason Kuznicki noted, "‘Moderate’ and ‘independent’ are not synonyms." Only two senators are currently registered as independent — Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Angus King (I-Me.). University of Missouri professor of American politics Marvin Overby said the claim was an exaggeration. "We live in an epoch where politics is very partisan and independent politicians are extraordinarily rare," he said. "But, comparatively speaking, it is fair to say that — in a hyper-partisan age — McCaskill shows more independence than most." Our ruling McCaskill said "nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked (her) one of the most independent senators — right in the middle." It’s difficult if not impossible to define independence. Multiple studies show McCaskill voted against her party more so than mostother Democrats. However, experts cautioned that a moderate or centrist voting record does not necessarily equate to being independent. For those reasons we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07929	"Six institutions in our country now control two thirds of the capital."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/28/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-critical-power-hands-few-banks/	Whether she’s blasting Wall Street greed in Michael Moore’s 2009 movie "Capitalism, a Love Story," or urging homeowners who face foreclosure to squat in their own homes, Rep. Marcy Kaptur has emerged as one of Congress’ most vocal critics of large financial institutions. The Toledo Democrat repeated many of her criticisms in an interview on MSNBC’S Dylan Ratigan show, where she criticized the nation’s biggest banks for "reckless" conduct that led to the nation’s foreclosure crisis. "Six institutions in our country now control two thirds of the capital," Kaptur said, who contends financial power should be returned to community banks and credit unions with ties to the areas where they do business. "That’s too much. It’s too much power in too few hands." The statistic Kaptur cited sounded like a big chunk of change for a few institutions to control, so we asked where her numbers came from. Her office cited a book called "13 Bankers" by MIT economist Simon Johnson and James Kwak which contains a table that examines the growth of the nation’s six biggest banks: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. According to the chart, the assets of those banks grew from less than 20 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product in 1995, to roughly 60 percent today. The book argues that these "too big to fail" institutions harm the economy because they stifle competition and take excessive risks because they know the government will bail them out of a disaster. Federal Reserve data backs up Johnson’s contention that the six large banks control assets that are roughly 60 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. The statistic that inspired Kaptur’s remarks checks out, but there’s a problem with her statement. The chart refers to bank assets, not bank capital, as Kaptur said. And there’s a big difference between the two. Assets encompass everything a bank owns, including buildings and loans to customers. Capital is what’s left on a bank’s balance sheet after its liabilities – like customer deposits that can be withdrawn at any time – are subtracted from assets. The federal reserve considers banks to be adequately capitalized if their capital is more than eight percent of its assets, says Emre Ergungor, a senior research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Johnson said Kaptur’s underlying point about the concentration of power in the hands of a few banks was correct. "My overall assessment - Rep. Kaptur should have said ‘six institutions in our country now have assets worth over 60 percent of GDP’ (or less technical words to that effect)," Johnson said in an e-mail. "But she is right that (a) the size of assets controlled by our largest institutions has gone up a lot in recent years, including after the financial crisis, and (b) this is an economic problem of first order importance for the United States -- this is the point of 13 Bankers." We agree with Johnson. And had Kaptur said something like that, she would have rated higher on the Truth-O-Meter. A basic tenet PolitiFact uses to evaluate statements is that words matter. In this case, by using the word "capital," rather than "assets," she turned the accuracy of her statement upside down. That’s why we rate her statement as False.

pomt-05437	Under a new law, doctors performing drug-induced abortions could be charged if women don’t return to them for follow-up care	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/27/wisconsin-medical-society/wisconsin-medical-society-president-says-doctors-c/	The debate over a Republican-sponsored measure that requires new medical protocols in abortions has spawned confusion -- and its own debate -- over liability for doctors. The law, signed by Gov. Scott Walker in April, added penalties if physicians perform medication-induced abortions without an in-person exam before the procedure -- a move aimed at blocking the potential use of so-called "webcam abortions" in Wisconsin. Medication-induced abortions are limited to the first nine weeks of pregnancy. The law also required that doctors tell patients they "must return" for a post-abortion follow-up appointment at the same facility within 12 to 18 days instead of, for example, seeing their primary care doctor where they live. Critics, such as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, say this places an undue burden on women, especially in rural areas. Indeed, in the wake of the law, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said April 20, 2012 it would stop providing medication-induced abortions, citing legal uncertainty for doctors. The bill’s passage also drew a strong reaction from the Wisconsin Medical Society, which said the law intruded on the patient-doctor relationship. In an April 19 interview with the Wisconsin State Journal, the society’s new physician-president, Tosha Wetterneck of Madison, spoke about the mandate that women return to the same facility for follow-up care. The story paraphrased Wetterneck’s remark this way: "If she refuses, or prefers to see her personal physician, the patient would face no penalty but the doctor could be charged, Wetterneck said." The remark prompting a reproductive rights group, RH Reality Check, to say that doctors could face a Class I felony and up to 42 months in jail if the patient does not return for the recommended visit. Its Web posting cited Wetterneck’s comment. Meanwhile, state Sen. Mary Lazich, R-New Berlin, author of the original bill, denounced critics’ descriptions of it as "grossly misstated," and the claim about criminal charges when patients no-show as "patently false." So, who’s right? Can doctors be charged if a patient fails to do something? While debate rages on about the broad impact of the law -- critics say it limits access to the procedure, proponents say it protects women from substandard care -- we found wide agreement on this narrow question. The consensus: Doctors could face a fine of up to $10,000 if they don’t advise women to return in 12 to 18 days -- but not criminal liability. And the forfeiture only applies if the doctor fails to inform -- it’s not dependent on what a patient does later. We heard that from Lazich and Wisconsin Right to Life, but also the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, a state government agency that analyzed the bill -- and even the Medical Society itself. They all said that even though the bill says patients have to be told they "must return," there is no accountability built into the law for either the woman or the physician if the woman does not come back. So why was Wetterneck of the Medical Society quoted as saying doctors could be charged? Medical Society lobbyist Mark Grapentine told us Wetterneck is not a lawyer and likely thought "charged" was an appropriate description even for forfeitures. He said she and the Medical Society understood the lack of criminal penalties for the no-return scenario, while strongly objecting to felony liability for other aspects of drug abortion protocols. We think the term "charged" would be heard by most listeners as a reference to criminal liability -- as evidenced by the reaction from RH Reality Check. Perhaps confusion on the issue was inevitable. The law does create a criminal felony penalty for failing to follow certain procedures related to a medication-induced abortion. Just not the protocol on the post-abortion follow-up. Specifically, Act 217 requires that the same doctor who prescribes the drugs do the pre-procedure exam and be physically present when the drug is given. Bill authors say those rules were aimed to block use of Web cameras to consult with women about the drugs, as is done in some states to make abortions more possible in rural areas. By law, at least 24 hours must pass between the patient’s voluntary consent and an abortion. The potential criminal penalty on that point, for the person who provides the drugs, is up to 42 months imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. Our conclusion The president of the Medical Society said a new abortion law means doctors could be charged if patients don’t return for a follow-up appointment after a drug-induced abortion. On that specific portion of the law, no criminal liability was inserted, and doctors’ duty is limited to orally informing the patient she must return. There is a new criminal penalty for failing to personally supervise such abortions, but Wetterneck clearly was referring to the follow-up care section of the bill. We rate her statement False.

pomt-05170	Decriminalizing marijuana "will save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/17/john-g-edwards/rep-john-edwards-says-decriminalizing-marijuana-wo/	On June 13, 2012, Governor Lincoln Chafee signed into law legislation that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana. As of April 1, 2013, having 1 ounce or less will be a civil offense, punishable by a $150 fine. Rep. John Edwards, D-Tiverton, was the bill’s prime sponsor as it moved through the Assembly for the third consecutive year. During a June 5 House debate, he told the story of how, as a construction manager, he employed two skilled carpenters in their 50s who were barred from working on federal projects because "they had a stupid arrest when they were young for simple possession" of marijuana. Most people don’t go to prison for having a small amount of marijuana, Edwards said, "but they do get arrested and the arrest never goes away." Not only would his bill curtail those arrests, said Edwards, "it will save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars and it will also allow our police to do what they do best and that’s catch criminals." We were curious where Edwards got his cost saving figures; $4 million to $11 million is a pretty wide window. Edwards told us he got his information from Wallace B. Gernt Jr. and Christopher Reilly, the president and vice president respectively of The Bradford Group, the Rhode Island public relations firm. One of its clients is the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C., group trying to change marijuana laws around the country. The facts When we contacted Reilly, he acknowledged a certain haziness hovering over the figures: "There’s a lot of different thoughts of where those numbers come from." Ah, OK. Then he sent us two reports and had the Marijuana Policy Project forward a memo that a Harvard University economist sent Rhode Island lawmakers earlier this year. One report was from the Special Senate Commission to Study the Prohibition of Marijuana, issued in March 2010. It notes that in 2009, Rhode Island police made 2,546 arrests for marijuana possession, first offense. (It doesn’t say how much pot each suspect had.) But the report does not say how much money Rhode Island could save by decriminalizing marijuana. It defines the savings only as "significant". The second report was "The Criminal Justice Costs of Marijuana Prohibition in Rhode Island," issued in 2010 by the Rhode Island nonprofit group OpenDoors, which helps people released from prison. That report, supported by the Marijuana Policy Project, says Rhode Island stands to save a whopping $12.7 million a year by decriminalizing possession of an ounce or less of marijuana. We contacted the main author of that report, Nick Horton, who told us that most of the purported savings -- $11.2 million -- wasn’t calculated by OpenDoors at all. "That figure is not mine," said Horton. It turns out that number came from Jeffrey Miron, the Harvard economist, and his 2010 report that studied how much money the United States would save if it legalized all drugs. In his one-page memo to Rhode Island lawmakers this spring, Miron provided the general equation he used to reach his $11.2 million figure but never plugged in any actual numbers: "I guess when you are a Harvard professor, you no longer have to "show your work,’’ Robert Capecchi, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, wrote in an email when Politifact asked for the details. When we called Miron, he said his estimate -- which related exclusively to police enforcement savings -- came from a 2010 report he did for the libertarian Cato Institute: The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition. The study found that by legalizing all drugs, the United States could save $41.3 billion a year. The study includes a state by state analysis of drug arrests that Miron used. For instance, 2007 data from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Reports shows that in Rhode Island that year the police made 26,966 drug arrests. Of those, 1,922 were for marijuana possession. (Again, the data don’t say how much marijuana each suspect had.) By dividing 1,922 by 26,966, Miron determined that 7 percent of all arrests that year were for marijuana possession. He then used other data from state government and the U.S. census -- some coming from 2008 -- to conclude that the total police expenditure in Rhode Island was $287 million. Seven percent of that is $20.1 million. Then he estimated that half of the marijuana arrests were incidental to other more serious charges. Kicking those out, he calculated the annual police savings would be $10.5 million. That’s not the $11.2 million cited by OpenDoors, but Miron says the $700,000 difference is likely because the data he used was several years old. In a follow-up conversation, Edwards conceded that he never thought the savings would total the $11 million he cited on the House floor. "It’s more on the lower end of $4 million," he said. He based that, in part, on some of his own calculations of prison savings -- a point that Miron, the Harvard economist, said he was surprised to hear Edwards talking about because "almost no one is in prison for [minor] possession." But Edwards says he asked Corrections officials for a one-day snapshot of the prison population about a year or so ago. On that day, 42 people were being held for marijuana possession. He multiplied that by the average cost of holding one person at the ACI for a year ($44,000) and came up with a quick $1.8 million savings. Corrections Department officials told us Edwards’ methodology is wrong because those inmates are scattered among many different units, so their absence would not lead to any staff reductions. They did say there would be some savings by having those 42 beds empty -- about $154,602. That’s a long way from $1.8 million, let alone $4 million to $11 million. Our ruling State Rep. John Edwards was specific in his claim that decriminalizing marijuana will "save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars." Edwards later backed away from the $11 million figure. Yet neither he nor any of the advocates he worked with to get the legislation passed could substantiate even the lesser amount. Therefore we rate his statement a smoldering False.

pomt-02716	To comply with non-discrimination laws, the government is "forcing people in business to make wedding cakes" for anyone.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/22/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-talks-duck-dynasty-wedding-vendors/	The airwaves are roaring with chatter about Phil Robertson of A&E’s popular show Duck Dynasty for comments he made about homosexuality in a GQ interview. With the future of the show in question, talking heads are either criticizing Robertson’s remarks as deeply offensive or, like radio host Glenn Beck, defending him on grounds of freedom of speech. If the country truly valued "equality and diversity," Beck argued, Robertson would be allowed to express his opinion without being punished for it. He urged Robertson’s family not to back down and said his network, TheBlaze, would welcome them into the fold because they want "diversity of thought." "If you think that it isn’t about anything but marriage and equality, you’re mistaken. It’s not about equality," Beck said. "If it’s about equality and it’s about diversity, then you would allow people a different opinion. A different opinion. No, no, no, we don’t have different opinions now. "You are forcing people in business to make wedding cakes," he said. "If they say I don't want to serve you, I don't want to make a wedding cake for you, you must make a wedding cake. There's no diversity in that. That's fascism." (this was all the same sequence) Beck’s wording is not explicit, but we think we know what he was referencing (his people did not get back to us). There have been a few recent legal battles involving wedding vendors who refuse to provide their services to same-sex couples on religious grounds. We wanted to investigate if people are forced to make wedding cakes against their will and what those cases mean more broadly. Colorado cake conundrum There are two high-profile cases of bakers citing Christian beliefs when they refused to provide wedding cakes for a gay couple who wanted to celebrate their marriage. We’ll focus on the one with a recent judge’s order. One summer day in 2012, a gay couple stopped inside Masterpiece Cakeshop in the Denver area seeking a wedding cake to celebrate their wedding in Massachusetts. The mom of one of the newlyweds joined the baker and the couple at a table to discuss their vision, though they never got a chance to bring it up. Once the owner learned what the wedding cake would be for, he told the would-be customers that preparing a cake for them would go against his Christian beliefs, according to court documents. He said, "I’ll make you birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same-sex weddings." The American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission on the couple’s behalf. A year and a half later on Dec. 6, 2013, administrative law judge Robert Spencer ruled in favor of the couple. Coloradans passed a constitutional ban on gay marriage but recently allowed civil unions. The civil union law allows religious groups and leaders to opt out of performing those ceremonies but does not include religious protections for business. More pertinent here, an administrative law judge noted, the state amended its public accommodation law to add "sexual orientation" as a protected class that cannot be discriminated against by businesses that are open to the public. Spencer said the cakeshop must "cease and desist from discriminating" against gay couples or face financial penalties for refusing to make wedding cakes for gay couples in the future. "At first blush, it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses," he wrote. "This view, however, fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are." The judge rejected the cakeshop’s argument that providing a cake for the couple would have conveyed support for their marriage, pointing out that he refused to serve them before they could dive into the details of what the cake would look like. The couple "might have wanted a nondescript cake that would have been suitable for consumption at any wedding. ... The act of preparing a cake is simply not ‘speech’ warranting First Amendment protection," he wrote. If the cake shop defies the judge’s order, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission could seek court action that could include "issuance of contempt citation, potential fines and imprisonment for offending the dignity of the court," a spokeswoman said. A spokesman for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit that defended the baker in court and has taken up similar cases, said it would appeal the order but has not filed one (the 30-day window for an appeal closes in early January 2014). Other cases of religious liberty vs. public accommodation ADF spokesman Greg Scott said there are many more examples than just Masterpiece Cakeshop of "government intrusion on conscience, in which an arm of the state tells you comply with the government-decreed morality or face the consequences." Scott provided examples that go beyond wedding services, such as a Mennonite family that runs a manufacturing company and sued the Obama administration over its rules requiring employers to cover contraceptive care, including the morning-after pill. "There’s more, but I think you get the idea," he said. "It is becoming a nationwide problem." In Oregon, a state investigation into a bakery refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple remains open. Elsewhere, a Washington wedding florist was sued for refusing to provide floral arrangements for a gay couple’s wedding. The U.S. Supreme Court could decide on a discrimination complaint against a New Mexico-based wedding photographer who declined to photograph a lesbian couple’s commitment ceremony. The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled against the photographer, saying artistic services offered to the public are regulated by discrimination laws. Eugene Volokh, a UCLA School of Law professor who co-authored a brief in support of the photographer, said he does not think the Constitution permits the government to require photographers, painters or writers to "create constitutionally protected speech." (He said he does not think bakers have as strong a case because they are not as involved in the ceremony.) Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia professor of law and religious studies, said he would be surprised if the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the photographer’s case. So what does it mean? Laws that protect customers from being discriminated against because of sexual orientation do not exist for the whole country. The ruling by the Colorado administrative law judge was limited to Colorado, and the same goes for other cases in other states so far. "But really, I would say that the (Colorado) decision is just affirming a much broader, long-standing legal principle that religion doesn't give anyone a reason to discriminate," said Amanda Goad, an ACLU attorney involved in the Colorado baker’s case. Twenty-one states have public accommodation laws similar to the one in Colorado, including California, New York and Oregon, according to the Human Rights Campaign. That means clear protections do not exist in 29 states, such as Florida and Texas, though some cities have implemented their own ordinances, Goad said. The judicial decisions in New Mexico and Colorado show why those laws are important to supporters of gay rights, she said. "If there’s no public accommodation law that covers sexual orientation, then no one has any obligation, religious or not, to serve anybody," Laycock said. "The gay couples only have a claim if there is a law in place that gives them a claim." Just because it isn’t happening in every state does not mean it is not happening, Volokh argued. "You might say, well it is good that cake bakers are being required to prepare cakes for same-sex commitment ceremonies," he said. "But if the claim is that cake bakers are being required to do this, that claim seems to be correct. And it seems likely that if more anti-discrimination laws are enacted, this will happen in more and more states." Our ruling Incensed by A&E’s response to its opinionated Duck Dynasty star, Beck lamented the country’s lack of appreciation for "diversity of thought," saying Robertson is entitled to say what he wants in accordance with his freedoms of speech and religion. Even wedding cake-makers are feeling the same pressure. "If they say I don't want to serve you, I don't want to make a wedding cake for you, you must make a wedding cake," he said, just weeks after a Colorado administrative law judge said a Denver-area baker must "cease and desist" discriminating against gay couples who want wedding cakes or face fines. Indeed, that happened. Another investigation into a bakery that withheld a wedding cake is pending in Oregon. Beck did not get into details about either case on his show. But he should have clarified that many states do not have the same protections for sexual orientation in their public accommodation laws, so it’s less clear if businesses in those states could be compelled to make cake if they had personal objections. We rate this claim Mostly True. Correction: Douglas Laycock said the New Mexico case would be binding nationwide if it was taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. An earlier version of this story was incorrect on this point.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2013-12-22T16:07:38	2013-12-19	['None']

pomt-00885	"Thomas Paine wrote that ‘the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government.’"	false	/virginia/statements/2015/mar/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-errs-tying-patriotism-quote-thomas-pain/	Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry drew inspiration from one of the nation’s founding fathers during a speech at a recent fundraising dinner for the Republican Party of Virginia. "Thomas Paine wrote that ‘the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government,’" Perry said, drawing applause from the crowd during his Feb. 24 event at the Richmond Marriott. Paine, a prolific pamphleteer during the Revolutionary War, authored essays such as "Common Sense" and "The American Crisis" that took aim at British rule of the colonies. His words remain widely cited by conservatives to support their calls for limited government. We wondered whether Perry had quoted Paine correctly. We turned to the National Thomas Paine Historical Association in New Rochelle, N.Y., which posts Paine’s major writings. You can find plenty of patriotic passages there, some of them published while Gen. George Washington suffered battlefield losses in 1776. "These are the times that try men’s souls," Paine wrote. "The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country. But he that stands now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered." But many quotes have been mistakenly attributed to Paine, and the association also notes on its website what its hero did not write. Among them is a virtually identical phrase the former Texas governor attributed to Paine: "The duty of a patriot is to protect his country from its government." Gary Berton, secretary of the association, told us, "I’ve read every word of Paine’s several times. It’s definitely not Paine." Berton, who has studied Paine’s writings for decades, said the phrase doesn’t even sound like a thought the founding father would convey. Paine was certainly critical of Britiain’s rule of the colonies and hoped society would one day become so advanced that it wouldn’t need government, Berton said. "But in the meantime, he was for a strong central government with redistribution of wealth," added Berton, who is also the coordinator of the Institute of Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College in New Rochelle. Harvey Kaye, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay who wrote a 2006 book about Paine, also told us the quote didn’t come from the pamphleteer. Many conservatives in recent decades have tried to turn Paine into an "anti-statist prophet," Kaye said in an email. "But Paine was a radical, small-d democratic patriot who opposed monarchical & aristocratic government and called for independence and the making of democratic republic (Common Sense, 1776), proposed a social security system (Rights of Man, 1792), and argued for taxing the propertied because God intended the earth for all to share and the concentration of power and wealth produced poverty for working people (see Agrarian Justice, 1797)," Kaye wrote. So where did Perry’s misattributed quote come from? Berton said it appears to have been penned by Edward Abbey, an American anarchist, environmentalist and novelist. Two weeks before Abbey died in 1989, he published "A Voice Crying in the Wilderness," a collection of sayings and quotes that came from a private journal he kept for 21 years. "A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government," Abbey wrote in his book. Berton said the attribution to Paine appears to have spread through the Internet. We can’t swear that Abbey coined the saying. In a humorous introduction to his book, Abbey noted that many of the collected sayings came from his earlier writings. "Others may be unconscious plagiarisms from the great and the dead (never steal from the living and mediocre), ideas absorbed in my reading so long ago that I’ve made them mine and forgotten the source," Abbey wrote. "If so, the author would appreciate hearing from readers on this point. (Be kind.)" Finally, we should note that we reached out to the Perry camp several times while researching this article and did not get a response. Our ruling Perry says Paine wrote that ‘the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government.’" He offers no proof or citation of where Paine wrote that phrase. Two Paine scholars tell us the quote didn’t originate with the founding father and that the saying doesn’t appear in any of Paine’s writings. We rate Perry’s claim False.

pomt-06958	"By any measure, New Jersey has one of the most segregated school systems in the country."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/17/david-sciarra/new-jersey-education-law-center-director-says-stat/	New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country and certainly one of the most ethnically diverse. But the state’s school systems aren’t exactly a model of racial diversity, according to David Sciarra, executive director of the New Jersey Education Law Center, based in Newark. "By any measure, New Jersey has one of the most segregated school systems in the country," Sciarra said in a May 19 Bob Braun column in The Star-Ledger. Sciarra made the comment during an event days before the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered that $500 million be pumped into the state’s low-income schools, known as Abbott districts. New Jersey schools are segregated, Sciarra said, because the state has hundreds of school districts that track municipal boundaries. The cities typically have large concentrations of black and Latino students, while the suburbs are overwhelmingly white. Kentucky and other southern, or more rural states, are among the most integrated because those states have countywide or regional school districts that tend to draw a more diverse student population. Still, segregation is a strong claim to make in 2011 -- and one that might be in the eye of the beholder, since many consider it a forced separation of the races. Some education experts see things differently, however, and agree with Sciarra’s statement. Segregation isn’t just about about the forced separation of racial groups, according to Sciarra and to Gary Orfield, professor of Education, Law, Political Science and Urban Planning, and co-director of the Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles at the University of California, Los Angeles. To be clear, New Jersey’s Constitution prohibits racial segregation in public schools and strict constitutional law requires that schools have racial balance, Sciarra said. "In terms of racial minorities, African-Americans and Latinos, we have a very segregated system," Sciarra told us. "In the United States, we’re (New Jersey) usually third, fourth or fifth." For 2001-02, New Jersey ranked in the top 10 of states as being among the most segregated, according to the report "Brown At 50: King’s Dream or Plessy’s Nightmare?" The report was authored by Orfield and Chungmei Lee in January 2004, when The Civil Rights Project was based at Harvard University. The report shows that New Jersey ranked ninth highest in the nation for the percentage of blacks in majority white schools; fifth nationwide for the percentage of blacks attending mostly minority schools; and sixth overall for the number of white students enrolled in majority black schools. The state’s rank in each of those categories, but for Latino students, was slightly higher: seventh, fourth and fifth for the respective categories. Ranking that high on the report is indicative of more segregation, while states much lower on the list are indicative of having more integrated schools. For the 2009-10 school year, data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that 66 percent of either whites or blacks in New Jersey would have to move to another district in order to achieve racial balance in schools. That figure drops to 64 percent for racial balance between Latinos and whites, according to the statistics. The same statistics also show that the average black or Latino student in New Jersey attends a school that is 28 percent white. As a result of those figures, New Jersey ranks in the top 10 of most segregated states when looking at all U.S. states and the District of Columbia. John Logan, a professor of Sociology at Brown University and director of the US2010 Project, a research program on changes in American society in the recent past, looked at the racial divide for elementary school children in 2000, in major metropolitan areas. He found that in the Newark area, 72 percent of Hispanics or whites would have to move to another district to achieve racial balance in schools. For blacks, it was 82 percent. The figures were even higher for the Bergen-Passaic area. The Orfield and Lee study looked at a decade of resegregation after the Supreme Court’s 1991 decision in Dowell v. Oklahoma City, which allowed school districts to declare themselves unitary, end desegregation plans and return to neighborhood schools. As part of their study, Orfield and Lee examined enrollment in U.S. schools, patterns of segregation and desegregation of various groups, regions and community types. Among the study’s findings: a major increase in segregation in many districts where court-ordered desegregation was ended; rural and small town school districts, on average, are the most integrated schools in the nation for blacks and Latinos, but segregation is severe in smaller central cities and in the suburbs of large metropolises; poverty found in the most intensely segregated minority schools can be connected to unequaled educational opportunity. Some say a legacy of past housing decisions contribute to segregation. "For decades, U.S. and local housing policy encouraged segregation by race and class through decisions about where public housing would or would not be built and how it would be administered," said Ansley T. Erickson, an assistant professor of History and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. "Simultaneously, both mortgage finance policies and local real estate practices produced suburbs that were predominantly white. Thus society did not simply cluster itself. Individuals did make choices about where they would prefer to live or send their children to school, but they did so influenced by incentives, disincentives, and restrictions set out in policy and practice." Let’s review. Sciarra and several other experts say the state’s school system is among the most segregated in the nation, primarily because of a history of housing patterns and other demographic factors. Data from a 2004 report on segregation, as well as 2009-10 statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that New Jersey is in the top 10 of states for having segregated schools. Sciarra said New Jersey typically ranks in the top five for being the most segregated, but our research puts New Jersey more in the top 10. For those reasons, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11145	It is a "myth" that "per-student funding only rose by 47 cents this year."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/may/30/florida-house-majority/did-florida-students-see-increase-47-cents-or-it-m/	Florida House Republicans are playing mythbusters on claims of stagnant school spending. The House Majority Office, which is overseen by Speaker Richard Corcoran, released a five-minute video May 17 that takes aim at teachers’ unions and state educators (and unnamed "media allies") who say the 2018-19 education budget isn’t enough to cover the costs of running a school district. Back in March, superintendents of some of Florida’s largest districts wrote a column saying, "The 47 cents per student increase in the base student allocation — the only funds school districts can use for student programs, teacher salaries and other costs — will force us to make cuts in critical areas of our operations." The House Republicans’ released their video on the same day 35 Democrats called on the Legislature to hold a special session to reconsider education funding for the next school year (a motion that failed). It offers a defense of education spending (using phrases like "sparsity supplement" and "millage compression") to argue that approved spending is really closer to $100 per student, at least. "Have you heard the ‘47 cents’ myth?" the Florida House asked in the description of the video. "The rumor goes ‘per-student funding only rose by $0.47 this year.’ Nothing could be further from the truth." The number isn’t a myth; it just isn’t the number that House Republicans want to highlight as inaccurate. House leaders and district officials are using two different ways to measure per-student funding, based on different funding sources. There’s some truth to both claims, but using either amount requires more context. Calling one a "myth" is too dismissive. What to know about the House Majority argument The House Majority Office argues that per-pupil spending increased by $101, not 47 cents. The $101 figure is accurate if you consider every facet of education funding. The state’s 2018-19 education budget increased public school spending by more than $485 million. In 2017-18, per-pupil funding was $7,307. In 2018-19, it increased slightly to $7,408 per student (an increase of $101.50). It’s worth noting that the $101 increase is an average of what school districts will receive, so the actual amount of per-pupil funding really depends on the county. For example, it’s possible that the largest districts won’t receive all of the $101 after taking into account new state mandates and an expected student decrease. According to the Florida Department of Education documents, total per-pupil funding will increase by $65 in Miami-Dade; $52 in Broward County; $73 in Pinellas County; and $85 in Hillsborough County. That said, other counties, particularly smaller ones like Calhoun County, will receive $263. More importantly, the $101 increase in student spending includes every source of education funding. Some sources of funding have to be used for specific purposes. To name a few, there’s the Exceptional Student Education allocation reserved for people who are disabled or gifted; the Teacher Classroom Supply Assistance Program, which allows teachers to purchase materials and supplies for the public school students assigned to them; and the digital classroom allocation, which provides money for devices. It also includes the money set aside to hire additional school resource officers and money to increase mental health facilities. So, while it’s accurate to say per-student funding rose by $101, it’s important to know that school districts don’t have a lot of flexibility in how that money can be used. That’s why state educators and unions have used the increase in the base student allocation (47 cents) to demonstrate how little money is left for districts to pay for day-to-day operating costs. Tracing the origins of 47 cents Labeling the 47-cent claim "a myth" is misleading. After all, it appears in the Florida Department of Education’s own 2018-19 document about education financing. This amount refers to the budget’s base student allocation, the amount of money allocated for each student. The money is unrestricted, which means districts have the most freedom in how that portion of the education budget is used. The base student allocation is one of the only pieces of the budget that goes toward teachers’ salaries and raises, electricity, fuel for buses, health care for faculty and administrators, and other operational costs. In 2017-18, the base student allocation was $4,203.95. In 2018-19, it increased slightly to $4,204.42 per student (an increase of 47 cents, if you haven’t caught on by now). The base student allocation fell during the recession from 2007 to 2012. Funding has increased each year starting in 2012-13, though those year-over-year hikes have been bigger than in this year’s budget. Fiscal year Base Student Allocation 2007-08 $4,079.74 2008-09 $3,886.14 2009-10 $3,630.62 2010-11 $3,623.76 2011-12 $3,479.22 2012-13 $3,582.98 (+$103) 2013-14 $3,752.30 (+$169.32) 2014-15 $4,031.77 (+279.47) 2015-16 $4,154.45 (+$122.68) 2016-17 $4,160.71 (+$6.26) 2017-18 $4,203.95 (+$43.24) 2018-19 $4,204.42 (+$0.47) The 47-cent increase wasn’t always the plan. In January, before the Parkland shooting, the House’s original education budget included increasing the base student allocation by $75. School districts receive more than just the base student allocation for education-related expenses. But the issue is that a good chunk of the overall funding is tied to specific purposes. For example, more than $161 billion of the $500 million increase is for the safe school allocation and can only be used on certain purposes such as paying for school resource officers. Another good chunk — $69 million — has to go toward mental health services. In both of those cases, the money is restricted and can only be used for its intended purpose. So, unlike the base student allocation, it can’t be used on teacher raises. "While money has been poured into special legislative projects such as best and brightest, safe schools and mental health, it is the core funding beginning with the base student allocation that enables districts to do the vast majority of the work they do with students throughout the year," said Tracey Pierce, the Duval schools chief of public relations and marketing. Our ruling The Florida House Majority Office said that it’s "a myth" that per-student funding only rose by 47 cents this year. The claim that per-student funding only rose by 47 cents definitely needs context. But calling it a myth goes too far, as does the Republicans’ claim that per-pupil spending is really closer to $100. Moreover, not every district will get that per-pupil amount. An amount that high is only possible once you factor in all education-related spending. That includes a good chunk of money that has to be spent on specific purposes like school security and mental health. The increase in the base student allocation (47 cents) represents the amount of money left over for flexible spending, which districts can use for student programs, teacher salaries and other operational costs. The office's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01923	An average of nine children a day in the U.S. die of gunshot wounds.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2014/jun/27/brady-campaign-prevent-gun-violence/do-average-nine-children-day-die-united-states-gun/	Editor’s Note: We rarely find it necessary to re-examine a PolitiFact Oregon fact-check, but this was an exception. Our original fact-check, based largely on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that a claim by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was Mostly True. However, readers brought significant new information to light that we thought warranted a new analysis -- and ultimately a new ruling. We are committed to finding the facts even if they emerge after we’ve published. In the wake of the Reynolds High School shooting in Troutdale that left two students dead June 10, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation’s leading gun control advocacy groups, has once again been urging parents to lock up guns and ammunition in separate gun lockers. The claim: At a June 17, 2014, rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children’s shoes and a chalkboard that read: "9 kids every day will never have another birthday." Were Emilio Hoffman, the victim at Reynolds, and Jared Padgett, the shooter, just two of nine children who die from gun violence on any given day? PolitiFact Oregon wanted to find out. The analysis: In an email, Brady Campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Fuson said the number is based on a five-year average of government data recording children who died from gunshot wounds. The ages range from infants to 19. Using the same age range, we obtained the same numbers from an online database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2007 to 2011, the most recent data available, 14,258 children died as a result of gunshot wounds. The circumstances range widely: accidental shootings by adults, kids who gained access to unsecured guns, gang violence, suicide and planned shootings like the incident at Reynolds High School on June 10, 2014. The numbers work out to 7.81 deaths a day, about one fewer than the Brady Campaign claimed. We presented this information to Heidi Yewman, a member of the national Brady Campaign board, who organized the rally. She acknowledged that the number presented at the rally was incorrect. A volunteer accidentally wrote the wrong number on the chalkboard display, she said. Nine children are unintentionally shot and survive every day, she said, but those children are in addition to the eight who are shot — intentionally and unintentionally — and die. "It’s really important we don’t exaggerate the number, because it undermines what we’re saying," Yewman said in a phone interview. "That was unfortunate and somewhat misleading." She added: "Certainly there was no conspiracy to mislead the public." The national Brady Campaign spokeswoman confirmed the figure. "It is correct to say that 8 children and teens die from gun violence every day," Fuson said in an email. "It is also correct to say that 9 children and teens are shot unintentionally." We checked the nonfatal number as well and found that 8.86 children are unintentionally shot each day and survive, according to the CDC’s nonfatal injuries database. But those two numbers — eight gun-related deaths and nine injuries per day — do not show the whole picture. PolitiFact Oregon obtained a breakdown by age from the CDC’s online database and found that about half of all youth gun deaths — 7,223 of 14,258 — are 18- and 19-year-olds. The same goes for unintentional injuries, roughly 46 percent of which — 7,479 of 16,172 — are 18- and 19-year-olds. Remove those two years from the calculation, and there are an average of 4.76 unintentional injuries each day and 3.85 deaths. That is significant given the use of the word "children" in the Brady Campaign’s display, along with a chalkboard and shoes suited to children younger than 12. In addition, people 18 and older are legally considered adults. They are allowed to buy guns and ammunition without parental consent, and are solely responsible for crimes they commit using those weapons. We asked Fuson, the Brady Campaign spokeswoman, to find out why the campaign includes 18- and 19-year-olds in its calculation. In an email, she said the campaign used the CDC’s own metrics for measuring unintentional injuries. She pointed us to a report published by the center examining childhood injuries from 2000-06. The CDC did use data for ages 0-19, including injuries. The center uses the same age range in The National Action Plan for Child Injury Prevention. The CDC is the nation’s leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. The federal database includes information on thousands of death and emergency room records, and is regularly cited by lawmakers and activist groups. Data is categorized by four-year age ranges — 15-19 year olds, for example — in addition to many other metrics such as year, race and sex of victims. Users can also search the CDC website for statistics by any age or range. It is important to note, however, that the CDC says its data for unintentional gun injuries among children 16 and younger is shaky because the samples sizes are small. Another wrinkle: The agency has been caught in political cross-fire, with right-wing critics saying it collects and presents data in a way that supports gun-control efforts. Liberal supporters, meanwhile, say that criticism has had a chilling effect on CDC research into gun injuries and deaths. In short, not everyone agrees CDC data are unassailable. Last year, President Barack Obama ordered the CDC, in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings, to begin studying the causes of gun violence. That information is not yet available. The ruling: At a rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children’s shoes and a chalkboard that read: "9 kids every day will never have another birthday." PolitiFact Oregon checked that claim against government data using the Brady Campaign’s age range of 0-19, and found that about 7.81 children and teens die each day from gun violence, based on the most recent five-year average available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heidi Yewman, who organized the rally in Vancouver, said the incorrect number was a volunteer’s mistake. We found the difference between eight and nine not hugely significant. It’s horrible that children are dying of gunshot wounds, of course, but the difference in the two numbers is unlikely to materially change the debate about gun control. But including 18- and 19-year-olds, who are not "children" under legal and other definitions, significantly skews the numbers, making the problem seem much worse than it is. Because the group’s claim contained an element of truth but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12647	"Under the Republican health care repeal proposal North Carolina faces the 2nd highest premium increase in the nation. North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/mar/24/david-price/price-right-north-carolina-would-have-nations-seco/	As the U.S. House of Representatives prepares to vote on a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, North Carolina Rep. David Price said few people in the country will fare worse than North Carolinians if the repeal plan passes. "Under the Republican health care repeal proposal: North Carolina faces the 2nd highest premium increase in the nation," according to a report released by Price’s office. "North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500." The Republicans’ American Health Care Act would repeal the ACA (also known as Obamacare) and would, among many other changes, replace Obamacare’s income-based tax credits for health insurance with flat tax credits. More on all that later. It’s no surprise that Price, a Democrat who represents a liberal area of the Triangle, is against the AHCA. But the numbers he threw out were a bit surprising. They could also have big political consequences for the state’s 10 Republican members of the House of Representatives – if Price’s price is right. Price’s office repeated the claim nearly verbatim in a press release and took to social media urging people to read the report. Which version of the bill is Price talking about? Price made this claim Wednesday, when he shared his office’s report on social media, calling the bill, "devastating for lower-income and older North Carolinians." Note: We’re fact checking Price’s claim based on the original GOP legislation, since that was what his claim referred to. Shortly after Price made this claim, the GOP canceled a planned vote on the AHCA and re-wrote some parts of it; those changes have yet to be studied in-depth. For a breakdown of the AHCA’s proposed tax credits and other changes, see this primer from PolitiFact or this fact-check on how it affects different income levels. Price is talking about the effects on the more than half a million North Carolinians who buy their health insurance individually – not people who get it through their work or through government programs, like the VA or Medicaid. Those people on the individual marketplace are about 5 percent of the state’s population. So when Price says "North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500," that’s a bit misleading. The numbers are right – as we’ll explain shortly – but they don’t really apply to the average person, as Price insinuates. People who are insured through work or through government programs would see different effects than the average person buying insurance individually. Average cost increase Now let’s take a look at that "more than $7,500" average increase in costs under the AHCA. Price said that includes increases in both out-of-pocket expenses (by $5,921 on average) and insurance premiums (an average of $1,628 more). A premium is the cost of health insurance. Out-of-pocket expenses include copays, coinsurance and deductibles. And Price's math is solid. It’s been backed up by research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care think tank, and by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "Kaiser tends to be mechanically very sound," said David Anderson, a researcher at Duke University’s Health Policy Evidence Hub. "So if you see something from Kaiser, you can trust it." Anderson said the number Price cited on premium increases checks out, and the out-of-pocket expense figure is either correct or maybe slightly high. He said it’s "in the ballpark … maybe a little aggressive." Price is also correct that North Carolina’s increase would be the second-highest in the country. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Alaska is first by a long shot, but North Carolina’s average cost increase would be about $1,000 more than in the next state, which is Oklahoma. Alaska and North Carolina are No. 1 and 2 in both average increases and average total costs, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found. Why is North Carolina’s cost so high? North Carolina also has some of the highest costs under Obamacare. Part of the reason is that it has the country’s second-largest total rural population, as well as the highest percentage of rural residents among the 10 largest states. In rural areas where there tend to be fewer hospitals, Anderson said, insurance costs are higher. Urban areas, with more competition among hospitals, have lower health care costs. Obamacare controls for variations like that with tax credits based on income levels and local health care costs. The AHCA would instead give flat tax credits, which would cause wide variations everywhere – especially in North Carolina. So it’s hard to describe what would happen to a "typical" person if the bill becomes law. But here are a few examples of what could happen, as of 2020, if Obamacare is replaced by the AHCA, according to the Kaiser report. The figures include the final costs, after tax credits, for both health plans. A 60-year-old living in Cumberland County making $20,000 would see his premiums increase $19,750 – that’s not a typo – to $20,710 a year. A 27-year-old in Harnett County making $30,000 a year would see her premiums increase $1,260, to $3,740 a year. A 27-year-old in Johnston County making $50,000 would see her premiums decrease $1,860, to $3,240 a year. A 40-year-old making $50,000 a year would see his premiums… Decrease by $1,180 (to $3,920) in Wake County. Decrease by $20 (to $5,080) in Mecklenburg County. Increase by $560 (to $5,660) in Robeson County. In Durham County, a 40-year-old making $100,000 would pay $500 less ($6,640). A 60-year-old making $100,000 would pay $3,710 more ($18,880). A 60-year-old making $30,000 would pay $13,900 more ($16,380). Those findings are in line with research from Avik Roy, a conservative health care analyst. Roy was a health care policy advisor to the Republican presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney in 2012 and Rick Perry in 2016. Last week he wrote that "the AHCA’s approach, if left unchanged, would lead to significant spikes in net insurance premiums for lower-income participants in the individual insurance market, with particular problems for those in their fifties and sixties." He added that North Carolina is one of seven states where customers will fare the worst under the AHCA, due to its switch from an income-based tax credit to a flat tax credit. "A means-tested credit ... has one additional advantage over the method used currently in the AHCA," he wrote. "It does a better job of protecting those who live in high-cost states … like Alaska, Nebraska, Arizona, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Wyoming, and Louisiana." Future changes The studies we’ve examined so far evaluate what would happen between now and 2020. That year is the turning point, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for when nationwide premiums might start to become lower on average. And why would premiums, on average, go down after 2020? The Congressional Budget Office estimated 14 million people will drop their health insurance next year if the AHCA passes, and there will be 21 million fewer insured people by 2020. Many of them would be older people with high costs, so their dropping insurance would drive average costs down. But those are national estimates. We wondered what would happen specifically in North Carolina after 2020. Unfortunately, we don’t really know. The bulk of state-specific research into the AHCA so far has focused on its immediate impact, pre-2020. Our ruling David Price said that if the AHCA passes in its current form, "North Carolina faces the 2nd highest premium increase in the nation. North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500." Price’s numbers are accurate, at least in the short term as it applies to people buying insurance on the individual market. However, we don’t know what might happen after 2020. And the wording of Price’s claim is misleading in describing average "North Carolina residents" with no qualifier. In reality, the changes apply only to the 5 percent of people buying health insurance on the individual market. For those reasons, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09890	"The government is going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/22/house-republicans/house-republicans-say-government-will-take-old-woo/	House Republicans are playing truth-squad with the cap-and-trade bill. Every day they post one claim about the bill on their Web site in an effort to demonstrate why cap-and-trade, which is intended to slow climate change by limiting carbon dioxide emissions, is bad for consumers. Most Republicans oppose the bill. "Daily Truth" No. 14, which deals with a government program on wood stoves, caught our eye: "The government is going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so. The Democrats’ national energy tax is just more government intrusion and more taxpayer dollars used for government-imposed mandates." From the sound of this claim, it seems like the government would demand all wood stoves be replaced (we imagine packs of bureaucrats knocking down doors and tearing wood stoves out of walls). We wondered whether the cap-and-trade bill really contains such a requirement. Indeed, the bill does set aside about $20 million to replace old wood or pellet stoves — specifically, stoves manufactured before July 1, 1990 — with newer, more efficient models. The money would help consumers pay for the upgrade. They would receive a 30 percent tax credit for costs incurred, up to $1,500. As it does with most appliances, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets efficiency standards for wood stoves, and to get the tax credit, consumers would have to buy one that bears the "EPA certified" label. Supporters of the stove swap initiative say it could help reduce air pollution. According to the EPA, certified stoves emit about three-fourths less pollution than do older models. In some parts of the United States, consumers have already taken advantage of a pilot program encouraging people to buy new stoves, and the bill simply expands that to stove owners throughout the country. Republicans have it partly right about how the program would work. It would use taxpayer money to help consumers upgrade their older, dirtier stoves. And to get the rebate, consumers would have to buy an EPA-approved stove. However, the government is not forcing them to replace the stoves. "This is not a mandatory program," said Paul Heintz, communications director for Rep. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who helped come up with the plan. "Those who own stoves that are either not certified by the EPA or were built before 1990 simply have the opportunity to take advantage of this program. They are under no obligation to do so." So Republicans are right that taxpayer money is being used to subsidize upgraded stoves but they are distorting how the program works. The government is not "going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves." The government is merely offering an incentive to replace them. So we find the Republican claim Half True.

pomt-11518	"I never said Russia did not meddle in the election."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-denies-he-denied-russian-medd/	The indictments of 13 Russians detailing how they used Facebook and Twitter to undercut Hillary Clinton and promote President Donald Trump spurred a flurry of tweets from Trump over the weekend. "I never said Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump wrote Feb. 18. "I said ‘it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.’ The Russian ‘hoax’ was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump might want to focus on collusion, but his blanket denial that he ever questioned Russian meddling runs up against his own words. Early on, Trump treated any mention of Russian interference as an attack on the legitimacy of his victory. In a May 2017 interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, Trump said "this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story." Trump continued in that interview to say, "It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won." That statement earned him PolitiFact’s 2017 Lie of the Year. In September 2017, when reports of Russian-backed Facebook ads came out, Trump tweeted, "The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com When the Washington Post reported in December 2016 that the CIA had concluded that the Russians wanted to boost Trump’s chances, Trump rejected it. "We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College," he said on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, 2016. "I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She’s down to a very low number. No, I don’t believe that at all." In a December 2016 interview with Time, Trump said two things: He didn’t think Russia meddled, and that it might have. "I don’t believe they interfered," Trump said. "That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say ‘oh, Russia interfered.’" But a moment later he said, "I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals." During an overseas trip to Asia in November 2017, Trump spoke of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A reporter asked how Trump brought up the issue of Russian meddling in the U.S. election. "Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn't do that,’ " Trump said. "And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it." Asked again if he believed Putin, Trump called several top U.S. intelligence officials "political hacks," and argued that other matters were more important. "You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that," Trump said. "Now, you’re not going to get into an argument. You’re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine." So there are any number of occasions when Trump has denied Russian meddling across the board. But at other moments, he has acknowledged that it is possible. In the same interview with NBC’s Holt where he called the Russian thing "a made-up story," Trump also suggested that Russia might try to shape U.S. elections. "If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it’s a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it," Trump said. "And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen." At a January 2017 news conference, he said he thought Russia did hack into the DNC, but he blurred the picture. "As far as hacking, I think it was Russia," he said. "But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people." Pressed on his apparent acceptance of the intelligence agencies’ findings, Trump backpedaled. "All right, but you know what, it could have been others also," Trump said. Our ruling Trump said that he "never said that Russia did not meddle in the election." In reality, he called the matter a "made-up story," and a "hoax." He has said that he believes Russian President Putin’s denial of any Russian involvement. He told Time, "I don’t believe they (Russia) interfered." Even when he has acknowledged the possibility that the Russians interfered, he has added that it could have been other countries or even individuals. Trump’s denial doesn’t match what he has actually said. We rate this claim Pants on Fire! See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-02-19T14:12:24	2018-02-18	['Russia']
pomt-14168	Says LeBron James "stops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/28/alan-grayson/lebron-james-pays-social-security-taxes-halftime-f/	Not only has U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson endorsed presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, he also has echoed one of the senator’s main platform planks that the rich should help shore up Social Security. At a Senate campaign debate with U.S. Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, in Orlando on April 25, 2016, Grayson said the Social Security payroll tax cap on earnings needs to be lifted in order to make the program solvent. He used the mind-boggling salary of professional basketball superstar LeBron James to illustrate his point. "Let's talk about LeBron James. Do you know when he stops paying his Social Security taxes? He stops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season," Grayson said. "Rest of the game, pays nothing. Rest of the 81 games of the season, pays nothing. The offseason, still pays nothing. That's ridiculous." The Cleveland Cavaliers forward rakes in an average of $23.5 million per year as part of his current two-year contract, so it’s not like he’s going to depend on Social Security in his twilight years. But is Grayson right that James is done paying into the program before halftime of the first game of the season? It’s not a slam dunk, but the Orlando Democrat does score points with this one. Tax tip-off Let’s start by reviewing what Grayson is talking about. The federal government imposes a payroll tax of 6.2 percent on wages to pay into the Social Security fund. But there’s a limit of how much income can be taxed. This maximum amount, which is periodically adjusted upward, was $118,500 in 2016. That means the most any employed person pays into Social Security annually is $7,347 (6.2 percent of $118,500). If you make less than $118,500, you obviously are taxed on that amount and pay less. Employers match that amount, so a single worker’s total contribution to Social Security is essentially a maximum of $14,694 per year. Benefits, for the record, also are capped. In the case of self-employment, the person pays both halves of the $14,694 contribution, or 12.4 percent of $118,500. We’ll come back to this in a moment. If you make more than $118,500 in salary from an employer — say, $23.5 million or so — you’re still only on the hook for taxes on the maximum of $118,500. That’s the highest amount on which the government can tax anyone, LeBron James or otherwise. Grayson has said that this limit is exacerbating projected Social Security deficits as more people retire. Not only would lifting this cap keep the program solvent, it would allow the government to increase benefits for seniors. President Barack Obama also has proposed lifting this cap, which has rated a Promise Broken on our Obameter. Some argue that raising the maximum taxable wage base wouldn’t fix the system on its own. For his James example, Grayson broke down the NBA 82 regular-season games into their 328 respective quarters, then divided that against James’ $23.5 million average salary. That amounts to $71,646.34 per quarter, which is almost $6,000 per minute, with 12-minute quarters. Not bad for a night’s work. Using that math, James hits the $118,500 taxable earnings cap somewhere before the eighth minute of the second quarter of the first game of the season. You’re probably only on your second (maybe third) $11 beer by then. Now, this interpretation is obviously just to make Grayson’s point easier to understand. It’s kind of like Tax Freedom Day, ostensibly the day people earn enough to pay their total tax bill. How James gets paid depends on the structure of his contract. We'll also note that the NBA season starts in October, with the playoffs running through June. The tax year starts Jan. 1 and runs the calendar year. That makes the actual timing of when taxes are deducted from James' pay different than what Grayson said — a minor detail in a broad example. The Cavaliers' first game of 2016 was on Jan. 2, and was their 31st contest of the 2015-16 season. They beat the Orlando Magic, 104-79, by the way. It may sound minor to those of us not making millions annually, but while Grayson is sticking to the game clock, he understates James’ time commitment. This example doesn’t include the hours James spends practicing, traveling, giving interviews, attending team events or anything else that goes along with a superstar athlete’s life. It also doesn’t include preseason games, overtime, playoff games (which bring in more money) or the value of his endorsements, which Forbes estimated at $48 million. PKF O’Connor Davies sports accountant Robert Raiola also cautions that Grayson’s example doesn’t mention other taxes James must pay. Raiola pointed out James faces a 1.45 percent Medicare tax that includes no cap, plus a 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge on all the income he makes over $250,000. Which is a lot. And don’t forget that self-employment tax. James possibly also must pay that in some form, depending on how his income is structured, Raiola said. How that affects James depends on how he conducts his finances, so it’s not really possible to say without getting a peek into his books. (LeBron, if you’re reading, email us and we’ll talk.) But Grayson’s talking point — that no matter how much the mega-rich earn, they are only taxed on the maximum of $118,500 in income — holds up. If you make less than that, you pay less, but James isn’t required to pay Social Security payroll taxes on his income beyond $118,500. Our ruling Grayson said James "stops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season." That’s a broad statement meant to draw attention to the fact that Social Security taxes are capped at $118,500 of a person’s income, no matter how much they make. There are a lot of factors that go into how much James is paid, and how much of that goes to various taxes. But the bottom line is that the athlete only faces Social Security taxes for a relative sliver of his income. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7010f3db-ddad-4d0d-98a5-197ed37eab1a UPDATE, April 28: An astute reader pointed out a minor flaw in Grayson's specific talking point. The NBA season starts in the fall, while the tax year begins Jan. 1. As such, James hypothetically would hit the threshold in the second quarter of the first game he played in the new calendar year, not the first game of the season. We've added that information to this story. But Grayson's point that the uber-wealthy quickly hit the Social Security tax cap remains just as valid.

pomt-14276	"The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/apr/06/hillary-clinton/does-economy-always-do-better-under-democratic-pre/	Hillary Clinton talked big about the economy, including raising the minimum wage and equal pay for women, at a rally ahead of Arizona’s Presidential Preference Election. "The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House," Clinton said March 21 at Carl Hayden Community High School in Phoenix. The Clinton family love these comparisons, by the way. In 2015, PolitiFact ruled Mostly True claims from Hillary Clinton a claim that ,"Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats," and another that, "The stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House." At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton had this statement rated True: "Since 1961 … our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)." The score, however, isn’t as good for this particular Clinton claim. Other factors involved Clinton’s Arizona spokesman, Tim Hogan, pointed us to a July 2014 study on the topic from Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. The study concludes that Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947, when the data was first tracked. However, the economists point out that there are other factors, such as better oil prices and international conditions, that could be driving these better numbers for Democratic presidents. In short, Democrats occupying the Oval Office tend to have a little better luck. Experts we spoke with largely held the same views. Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the statistics, from GDP to the unemployment rate, are striking, but noted that the president does not have "all that control." "That doesn’t prove what the cause is," Frankel said. (Update: After this item published, we heard from Frankel who said he believed Clinton's statement was accurate because Clinton did not say that Democrats caused the gap in performance. You can read more on his views here.) Robert Shapiro, chairman of Washington D.C. economic advisory firm Sonecon, said Clinton is right, but with the same caveat. "The details, of course, depend on how and what you compare, since the economy performs better in certain periods than others," Shapiro said. Christian Weller, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, did his own math on the GDP data since 1947. He found that the economy, through the last quarter of 2015 and after inflation, grew 3.8 percent under Democrats and 2.4 percent under Republicans. For President Barack Obama, the growth rate in his first term was 1.8 percent. His current growth rate is 2 percent, but that’s still higher than his predecessor, George W. Bush. And his second term hasn’t ended yet. Based on estimates, Weller said Obama should hit the 2.4 percent Republican average. Still, Ronald Reagan’s 3.4 percent growth rate is well ahead of the economy right now under Obama. "Other than Obama, every Democrat had a faster growth rate, even (Jimmy) Carter had a slightly higher growth rate than Reagan," Weller said. "This is one of the safest talking points for a Democratic contender." However, the asterisks bother Arizona State University presidential historian Brooks Simpson. "Secretary Clinton is not exactly telling the whole truth,’" Simpson said. Simpson referenced Bill Clinton’s administration, noting that he benefited from some of the economic policies of his predecessor, Republican George H.W. Bush. A 2011 report from the right-leaning Heritage Foundation notes that the economy was already in its "22nd month of expansion" when Bill Clinton took office in January 1993. Our ruling Hillary Clinton said, "the economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House." Yes, Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947. But Clinton's comments require several caveats. The current growth in the economy under Obama is lower than the Republican average. Factors such as oil prices also reflect the higher GDP growth under Democratic presidents. On top of that, comparing one period of time to another or one president to another can be problematic. On balance, we rate Clinton's claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5799cbf2-451d-4bea-bb10-cd4dd1203e8b	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-06T18:00:00	2016-03-21	['White_House', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-00574	"Former Gov. Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-rick-perry-signed-law-intended-dis/	In a speech at Texas Southern University, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton had no qualms condemning GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry in his home state. "Former Gov, Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters," she said on June 4, 2015. Perry called Clinton’s claim "way outside the norm of ridiculous" on CNN’s State of the Union a few days later. "I could probably find a federal judge to say just about anything," he stated. We did not hear back from the Perry campaign, so we delved into the law’s mired legal history. Senate Bill 14 is the law Clinton is referring to. It requires Texas voters to present a limited number of acceptable government-issued photo IDs at the ballot box; gun licenses count while student IDs don’t. The Texas Legislature passed the bill in March 2011, and Perry signed it into law on May 27. The law was in limbo for two years, until the Supreme Court struck down a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on June 23, 2013. The section had mandated federal pre-approval of election laws in Texas and eight other states that historically discriminated against minority voters. With the court ruling, states could move ahead with changes. That same day, then-Texas Attorney General and current Gov. Greg Abbott announced the law would "take effect immediately." A few months later, in October 2013, federal Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos struck down the voter ID law in a consolidated suit filed against the state by U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, the NAACP, and the Mexican American Legislative Council. "The court holds that SB 14 creates a substantial burden on the fundamental right to vote, has a discriminatory effect and purpose, and constitutes a poll tax," Ramos wrote in her ruling. "The evidence in the record demonstrates that proponents of SB 14 … were motivated, at the very least in part, because of and not merely in spite of the voter ID law’s detrimental effects on the African-American and Hispanic electorate." Ramos’ injunction against the voter ID law was temporarily stayed by the Fifth Circuit of Appeals, which permitted the law to remain in place in Texas for the 2014 midterm elections. That ruling was backed by the Supreme Court. The case is now back at the Fifth Circuit, which heard oral arguments in April 2015. So the law’s ultimate fate is still unknown. Our ruling Clinton said, "Former Gov. Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters." The law in question requires a photo ID from Texas voters and was greenlit by Perry in 2011. Federal judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos struck the law down in 2013. While that ruling was stayed by two higher courts, Ramos clearly described the law as discriminatory in her ruling. However, it's important to note that courts are still considering whether or not the law will be allowed to stand. Clinton’s carefully worded statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Clarification, June 10, 2015: We revised the wording of the decisions from the Fifth Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court to clarify that the two higher courts did not overturn Ramos' ruling. They temporarily stayed Ramos' injunction against Texas' voter ID law.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-06-09T12:15:28	2015-06-04	['Rick_Perry']

pomt-14294	"We’ve rebuilt China."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-chinas-economic-growth-thanks-un/	China is doing all the winning as the United States continue to lose in global trade, says Donald Trump, and it’s all thanks to us. Trump, who admires China’s GDP growth and Great Wall but considers it a master manipulator of the world, railed against the country that’s become one of his favorite targets in an interview with the New York Times. "You know, we’ve rebuilt China," Trump said. "The money they’ve drained out of the United States has rebuilt China. And they’ve done it through monetary manipulation, by devaluations. And very sophisticated. I mean, they’re grand chess players at devaluation." We were curious about Trump’s claim that the United States is responsible for China’s rapid economic growth. He made the point several times in the New York Times interview alone. (We also fact-checked two others claim from the interview about China’s import tax and its activity in the South China Sea.) According to Trump in the New York Times, China’s transition from one of the poorest countries in the world to its second-largest economy was possible through "bad trade deals" with the United States. This is an overly simplistic casting of the economic relationship between the two countries. Experts disagree over the extent of the United State’s impact in the Chinese economy, but they say Trump’s claim ignores many other factors at play. "In one tiny sense, Trump is correct," said Scott Lincicome, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute who specializes in international trade politics. "Trade with all countries, including the United States, has been part of a major market reform that’s lifted millions out of poverty in China. Reforms to property and taxation have been much more fundamental." Economists point to the opening up of China in the late 1970s and early 1980s as the beginning of its meteoric growth. Following the death of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping introduced economic reforms and open trade with the West in 1979. From then to 2014, China saw double-digit growth in GDP every year, effectively doubling its economy every eight years, according to the Congressional Research Service. Arguably, China’s economic liberalization, and subsequent prosperity, was prompted by years of U.S. efforts at rapprochement through Henry Kissinger’s secret visits, Richard Nixon’s historic trip and, of course, ping pong. In 2000, the United States also lobbied for China’s inclusion in the World Trade Organization (as Trump mentions on his website), further embedding Beijing in the world economy. Today, the United States and China are each other’s largest trading partners. Trump has argued that the United States is "losing" given the trade imbalance between the two countries, but whether this benefits or hurts the United States is up for debate. "I would not say that American deficits rebuilt China, but they probably allowed China to rebuild itself at a much lower domestic political cost than otherwise," said Michael Pettis, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and professor at Peking University. "Our consumption has benefitted the Chinese people, just like how the consumption of Europe and everyone has," said Lincicome. "American demand has helped Chinese companies, so there’s a nugget of truth to that, but we’re not the only ones." By Trump’s logic, you could argue that China has also rebuilt America by providing America with cheaper goods and thus more savings, pointed out Zhiwu Chen, a Yale University economics and finance professor who specializes in the Chinese economy. "Without those savings or Chinese financing of American government debt and corporate investments, the U.S. would not have been able to sustain the kind of growth in real estate, defense and business for so many years," Chen said. "In an interlinked globalized world, it is really hard to say who is rebuilding whom." Our ruling Trump said, "We’ve rebuilt China." China’s economic growth can largely be attributed to its in-house reforms and inclusion in global trade. The United States can take some, but certainly not all, of the credit for the latter. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-04-04T14:34:13	2016-03-27	['None']
pomt-08282	"Discretionary spending went up 84 percent in the last two years"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/07/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-us-discretionary-spending-increased/	U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican, and incoming chairman of the House Budget Committee, is known for his mastery of math and fondness for figures. In one notable episode, Ryan directly confronted President Barack Obama at an open meeting of House Republicans in Baltimore in January 2010. . "The spending bills that you have signed into law, the domestic discretionary spending has been increased by 84 percent," Ryan told the president, in the televised exchange. Obama pushed back on the number, and the wonky episode might otherwise have been forgotten, but Republican candidates and incoming House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio repeated similar claims through the fall election. Most recently, Ryan was again quoted as saying it by the Racine Journal Times in the wake of the Nov. 2 election: "Discretionary spending went up 84 percent in the last two years." That’s a big increase. And, with Ryan set to take over the House Budget Committee, one worth sorting out. The backup for his claim can be found in a June 4, 2010 news release issued in the name of the budget committee’s Republican caucus. In it, Ryan makes clear he is talking about non-defense discretionary spending. Discretionary spending goes for such things as education, health and housing -- in contrast to mandatory expenditures such as Social Security and Medicare "entitlements." Outside experts that PolitiFact Wisconsin spoke with quibble a bit about the annual budget figures Ryan uses, but the numbers are not really in dispute. And they do show a big jump -- from $434 billion in 2008 to $537 billion in 2010. But that’s a 24 percent increase, not the 84 percent claimed by Ryan and his colleagues. Is someone’s math fuzzy? Let’s dig in to find out. Ryan’s calculations also include another number -- the discretionary spending portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the economic stimulus package. That adds another $259 million to the total, which brings it to $797 billion (with rounding) and the 84 percent. One problem, and it’s a significant one in terms of Ryan’s statement: The stimulus package was approved in February 2009. Ryan includes it in the 2010 totals, so the two-year trend under Obama looks like a rocket headed straight up. If you put it in 2009 -- when it was passed -- the two-year trend under Obama looks more like a roller-coaster ride: Up a lot, and then down some but not all the way. Let’s turn to some budget watchdog groups to assess the approach. First, not everyone agrees it’s appropriate to even include the stimulus money in the calculation, since it could be considered one-time emergency spending -- not part of the underlying base. The annual figures that are the basis of Ryan’s chart do not include emergency spending, such as for natural disasters or unforeseen war costs. Obama and Democrats argue the stimulus package -- which tallied $862 billion in all --- was the ultimate "emergency" allocation aimed at preventing another Great Depression. Most experts told PolitiFact Wisconsin it’s fine to include it, as long as it appears as a one-time blip -- creating that roller-coaster rise and fall. "The discretionary spending in the stimulus bill has already begun to fade and no one assumes stimulus bill levels of spending will continue every year into the future," said Joshua Gordon, policy director at The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that advocates for fiscal responsibility. His group and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agree the stimulus funding should be placed in 2009. That’s when the vote occurred, when the spending authority for nearly all of it was granted, and that’s how the Congressional Budget Office records it. And Ryan’s own press release, in the fine print, refers to the stimulus funds as 2009 spending. Putting them in 2010 may make a stronger rhetorical point, but a shaky mathematical one. Why did Ryan do it that way? In response, Ryan’s office said in an e-mail he presents the budget figure on the chart with and without stimulus funding "so readers can separate the two if they wish." But in his public statements about the increase, he doesn’t separate them at all. He uses the higher, skewed number. Ryan’s office also says the cumulative view, not the year to year, is what’s important in the spending trend. They say if you just look at 2008 and 2010, it’s as if the stimulus never occurred. But the stimulus money was a one time authorization. It is not part of the annual base, so following past Washington accounting practice it belongs in the year it was approved. Finally, Ryan’s office argues his analysis does not include the vast majority of the stimulus spending. That’s certainly true. But it’s Ryan who limits the statement -- and the discussion of it -- to discretionary spending and when budget authority was granted. Ryan aides said the congressman is not using the figures to make Obama look bad -- he blames the long-term increase in spending on both parties.. "He is making a policy argument that we should return to sustainable levels of government spending," said spokesman Conor Sweeney. To be sure, no matter what year you stick it in, that $259 billion in discretionary stimulus funding -- and the massive overall package -- represents a dramatic spending leap. But if you put it in 2009 -- where evidence says it belongs -- you get a different picture than the one presented by Ryan. If it is there, the change in discretionary spending under Obama was a 70 percent increase in the first year, followed by a 27 percent drop in the second. That second year is still higher than the starting point, because non-stimulus spending also rose. That brings us back to the 24 percent overall increase between 2008 and 2010, which is where we began. And that’s where we will end. In illustrating his point about spending increases under President Obama, Ryan says non-defense discretionary spending has risen 84 percent. There is no doubt that spending is up, or that the one-time stimulus package was a major driver. But sliding the stimulus money from 2009 to 2010 -- whether on a chart or in an interview -- skews the picture. It’s a nifty accounting maneuver. But still a maneuver. We rate Ryan’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08421	Under the new health care law, "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/19/john-raese/john-raese-says-health-care-law-forces-patients-go/	During the West Virginia Senate debate on Oct. 18, 2010, Democratic Gov. Joe Manchin and Republican businessman John Raese sparred over a number of topics, including the Democratic-backed health care law passed earlier this year. We were especially intrigued by one criticism raised against the law by Raese. A questioner asked Raese: "You have said you want to repeal the health care legislation Congress passed earlier this year. What is it about this new law specifically that you do not like?" Raese jumped right in. "Well, I don't like socialism, to tell you the truth, and when you have a doctor-patient relationship -- that's the way it's supposed to be, and that's the way we have the greatest health care system in the world, and that's the way it is right now," Raese said. "That's all going to change because from here on out under Obamacare, something Gov. Manchin has always supported, you're going to have a patient-bureaucrat relationship, because the first person that patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel. I disagree with it. ... I'd like to repeal every part of it, because it is pure, unadulterated socialism. It is the worst bill ever to come out of the U.S. Senate and House." We decided to check one specific part of Raese's statement -- that under the new health care law, "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel." First, some background on the law. The goal is to expand coverage and reduce costs while leaving employer-provided insurance largely in place. To help people who have to buy insurance on their own, the law creates state-based exchanges, which are virtual marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can comparison shop. People of modest means would receive tax credits to buy insurance on these insurance exchanges. Employers are not required to offer insurance, but large companies must pay penalties if they don't offer insurance and if their employees qualify for new health insurance tax credits. The plan also expands eligibility for insurance programs like Medicaid. People who don't buy insurance and who don't qualify for programs like Medicaid would have to pay a penalty on their taxes. When we first saw Raese's comment, we were a bit flummoxed, because after roughly two years of fact-checking dozens of claims on the health care bill, we didn't recall any requirement that patients go through "bureaucrats" to reach their doctor. When we contacted the Raese campaign, they pointed us to a July 27, 2010, news release by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. It touts the "Health Care Bureaucrats Elimination Act," co-sponsored with four other Republican senators. The bill would repeal one element of the health care law called the Independent Payment Advisory Board. In the release, Cornyn called the IPAB "the definition of a government takeover. America’s seniors deserve the ability to hold elected officials accountable for the decisions that affect their Medicare, but IPAB would take that away from seniors and put power in the hands of politically-appointed Washington bureaucrats. This bill to repeal IPAB is just one step towards starting over with real health care reform that empowers patients instead of beltway bureaucrats." The IPAB is real. Whether its existence supports Raese's claim that "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat" is another matter. Here's how the Kaiser Family Foundation -- an independent health-care research group -- summarized the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board. The board would "submit legislative proposals containing recommendations to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if spending exceeds a target growth rate." If Medicare spending is found to exceed certain inflation benchmarks, the board, beginning in January 2014, "will submit recommendations to achieve reductions in Medicare spending." Then, beginning January 2018, if the appropriate inflation targets are not met, the board will submit proposals to the president and Congress for immediate consideration." However, Kaiser Family Foundation adds that the board "is prohibited from submitting proposals that would ration care, increase revenues or change benefits, eligibility or Medicare beneficiary cost sharing (including Parts A and B premiums), or would result in a change in the beneficiary premium percentage or low-income subsidies under Part D. Hospitals and hospices (through 2019) and clinical labs (for one year) will not be subject to cost reductions proposed by the board. The board must also submit recommendations every other year to slow the growth in national health expenditures while preserving quality of care by January 1, 2015." So the board is real. And Cornyn and his allies may have a case to make that the IPAB is a bad idea or poorly designed. Still, we don't see how its existence justifies Raese's statement. -- The board's purview is limited to Medicare. Patients who have employer-provided health care, Medicaid or insurance through the health care exchange would not be affected at all by the board. -- The board's powers are advisory. The board can only make recommendations, and it is expressly prohibited from anything that would "ration care, increase revenues or change benefits, eligibility or Medicare beneficiary cost sharing ... or (change) the beneficiary premium percentage or low-income subsidies" in the Medicare drug benefit. -- The board doesn't interact with patients. The board is supposed to do big thinking about cost-containment, not judge individual patients to determine whether they qualify for care. The changes that it suggests to the president and Congress could eventually, many years hence, shape how care is provided. But it's a major stretch to say that under the new law "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat." -- Patients didn't live in a bureacracy-fee paradise before the health care law passed. Today, patients may need to check with an insurance company before undergoing a procedure or making a visit to the specialist. If an employer's HR department decides to change health care plans, a worker may have to drop a doctor or give up benefits. And employers can eliminate health insurance entirely, or drive up the cost of premiums, either of which could intefere with a patient's health care. Though the Raese camp didn't mention it, we'll also pre-emptively dismiss any notion that the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute -- another entity created by the bill -- could wedge "bureaucrats" between a doctor and a patient. This institute, which would conduct research that compares the clinical effectiveness of medical treatments, is at least as controversial, if not more so, since it fed critics' fears that the bill could result in the rationing of health care services. However, the law prevents the institute's findings from being considered mandates. When we sent Raese's comment around to health care experts, they universally said he overreached. "This is purely ridiculous," said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. "Nothing changes in that respect relative to today’s system." "Choices, if anything, will be enhanced through the exchanges, with a much clearer description of what plans cover and their cost-sharing requirements," said Sara Collins, vice president of the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund's Program on Affordable Health Insurance. "In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services has to certify that qualified plans offered through the exchanges have adequate provider networks." Henry Aaron, a senior fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, called the statement a "rant, appalling if based on ignorance, and mendacious if uttered knowingly." Even a major critic of the health care bill said he thought Raese went too far. "As bad as I think this bill is, I don’t see that anywhere in it," said Michael Tanner, a health care specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute. We usually accept a bit of overstatement if it's in the vein of artistic license. But Raese's statement is a gross distortion, along the lines of his subsequent claim that the law is "pure, unadulterated socialism." (The law preserves the private-sector health care insurance for most Americans who already have it, and lawmakers rejected a single-payer model early on.) We see Raese's claim as yet another attempt to demonize the health care law by twisting the facts beyond recognition. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-07026	Says that President Obama said, "Nobody made these guys go to war. ... Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice?"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/04/chain-email/barack-obama-said-troops-whine-and-nobody-made-the/	Did you get this e-mail? It says President Barack Obama said the troops "whine about bearing the costs of their choice" and that "Nobody made these guys go to war." We've gotten many copies of these e-mails forwarded to us by readers. It's similar to another chain e-mail we fact-checked awhile back, but since this new version keeps arriving, we thought we'd look at it again. It's still Pants-on-Fire wrong. This particular e-mail seems aimed at veterans and their friends and family members. If someone has to explain this to you, You are not a veteran. ... He [Obama] doesn't seem to have much respect for the military. Maybe in the future our leaders should be veterans. THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SEE THIS!! THE MOST STUPID STATEMENT EVER BY A PRESIDENT. Bad press, including major mockery of the play by comedian Jon Stewart, led to President Obama abandoning his proposal to require veterans carry private health insurance to cover the estimated $540 billion annual cost to the federal government of treatment for injuries to military personnel received during their tours on active duty. The President admitted that he was puzzled by the magnitude of the opposition to his proposal. "Look, it's an all volunteer force," Obama complained. "Nobody made these guys go to war. They had to have known and accepted the risks. Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice? It doesn't compute.." "I thought these were people who were proud to sacrifice for their country," Obama continued. "I wasn't asking for blood, just money. With the country facing the worst financial crisis in its history, I'd have thought that the patriotic thing to do would be to try to help reduce the nation's deficit.. I guess I underestimated the selfishness of some of my fellow Americans." If he thinks he will ever get another vote from an Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard service member or veteran of a military service he ought to think it over ... If you or a family member is or has served their country please pass this to them. To begin with, President Obama never said these words. They actually come from the humorist John Semmens, who writes satire on the news. In fact, we've fact-checked two other chain e-mails that we've found to be rip-offs of Semmens' pieces, passed off as real facts. One chain e-mail claimed Rep. Gabrielle Giffords urged the military to stab or club their opponents instead of shooting them, as a way to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment. Another said Obama wanted to change the national anthem to "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing." We awarded both chain e-mails Pants on Fire ratings. In the case of this chain e-mail, Semmens wrote his report in March 2009 after the White House abandoned a plan to bill veterans' private insurers for their war-related injuries. It was intended as a cost-savings measure, to save the Veterans Administration $540 million a year. By the way, note that the chain e-mail changes that price tag to $540 billion, with a "b". That too is inaccurate. Veterans groups opposed the plan, and the White House scuttled the idea. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a press release on the matter on March 18, 2009: "The President demonstrated his deep commitment to veterans by proposing the largest increase in the VA budget in 30 years and calling VSO (Veterans Service Organizations) and MSO (Military Service Organizations) leaders into the White House for an unprecedented meeting to discuss various aspects of the budget proposal," Gibbs said. "In considering the third party billing issue, the administration was seeking to maximize the resources available for veterans; however, the President listened to concerns raised by the VSOs that this might, under certain circumstances, affect veterans and their families' ability to access health care. Therefore, the President has instructed that its consideration be dropped. The President wants to continue a constructive partnership with the VSOs and MSOs and is grateful to those VSOs and MSOs who have worked in good faith with him on the budget proposal." Not only have we fact-checked this before, but our friends at other fact-checking organizations -- Factcheck.org and Snopes-- have also debunked it. In fact, the chain e-mail is pretty much the opposite of Obama's actual comments about the troops. For example, here's what he said to troops in Afghanistan on March 28, 2010. "You've been there for us, tour after tour, year after year, at a time when too many American institutions have let us down, when too many institutions have put short-term gain in front of a commitment to duty and a commitment to what's right," Obama said. "You've met your responsibilities, you've done your duty -- not just when it's easy. That's why you've inspired your fellow Americans. That's why you inspire me. That's why you've earned your place next to the very greatest of American generations. And all of you represent the virtues and the values that America so desperately needs right now: sacrifice and selflessness, honor and decency." Or what he said to troops at Fort Cambell on May 6, 2011, in the days after Osama bin Laden was killed. "And today, here at Fort Campbell, I had the privilege of meeting the extraordinary Special Ops folks who honored that promise. It was a chance for me to say —- on behalf of all Americans and people around the world —- 'Job well done.' Job well done. They're America's 'quiet professionals' -- because success demands secrecy. But I will say this. Like all of you, they could have chosen a life of ease. But like you, they volunteered. They chose to serve in a time of war, knowing they could be sent into harm's way. They trained for years. They're battle-hardened. They practiced tirelessly for this mission. And when I gave the order, they were ready." Or what he said to troops at Fort Drum on June 23, 2011. "The reason that I know many of you continue to do the outstanding work that you do is not only love of country but it's also love for each other, and your commitment to making sure that those sacrifices were not in vain. So the main message I have for all of you here today is that the American people understand the sacrifices you're making; they understand the sacrifices that your families are making. ... So, for all the sacrifices that you've made, I want to say thank you." The chain e-mail that purports to be Obama's comments on troops is maliciously false. It's particularly egregious for trying to ply veterans with false information. We rate this one Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-07-04T19:44:12	2011-06-22	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-11487	Says Stephen F. Austin and James Bowie promoted slavery.	true	/texas/statements/2018/mar/01/ann-teich/austin-school-board-member-says-stephen-f-austin-a/	An Austin school board member hinted at the stain of slavery in the Old South when she warned that changing the names of schools named after Texans with Confederate roles makes it logical to change the names of even more schools. Austin school Trustee Ann Teich said at the school board’s Feb. 26, 2018, meeting that if the board was set on keeping the names of people who supported slavery from tainting schools, it should further move to change the names of Austin’s Stephen F. Austin and James Bowie high schools, because Austin and Bowie each promoted slavery. "That is only fair," Teich said, going on: "James Bowie was a slave trader with his brother. Stephen F. Austin did nothing to stop slavery being brought into the state of Texas." That night, Teich and another board member were on the losing end of a 7-2 board decision to rename five schools named after military figures or other officials in the Confederacy. We wondered later about Teich’s Bowie and Austin descriptions. Was each pioneer of Anglo Texas also pro-slavery? We turned first for evidence to biographical entries in the Handbook of Texas published by the Texas State Historical Association. The handbook’s Bowie entry says Bowie teamed with a brother and traded slaves after the War of 1812 in what later became the state of Louisiana. Also, the entry says, the brothers in February 1831 sold landholdings and 82 slaves to Natchez investors for $90,000. The publication’s entry for Austin, who led the Anglo colonization of Texas, says that after 1833, Austin consistently declared that Texas must be a slave state. Also, Texas Christian University historian Gregg Cantrell says in a video posted with the entry that Austin saw his colony’s future at the time that Mexico ruled depending on a booming cotton economy that attracted American colonists and slave labor. We learned more directly from Cantrell, who last year told the Austin American-Statesman that Austin’s attitude toward slavery was complicated in that he considered U.S. slavery a necessary evil. Cantrell told us by phone: "It’s unequivocal: At points in their lives, both men were slave owners. There are no ifs, ands or buts about that." Cantrell said in his 1999 book on Austin’s life that Austin "helped to bring slavery to Texas and struggled to preserve it." Also, Cantrell wrote, Austin earlier "used hired slave labor on a large scale in the family mining business, and he himself owned one or two slaves during most of his years in Texas." Yet the book also says that after the republic won its independence, Austin drafted a proclamation barring the African slave trade in advance of Texas becoming a U.S. state; he died in December 1836. To learn about Bowie, who died at the Alamo, we took Cantrell’s suggestion and perused "Three Roads to the Alamo," a 1999 book by historian William C. Davis tracing the lives of Bowie, David Crockett and William Barret Travis. According to the book, Bowie’s father kept slaves as the family moved south from Kentucky before settling in what became Louisiana. Bowie and two brothers subsequently got into the slave trade as young men, Davis wrote, despite that being banned by law as of 1808. "To young men of ambition who did not scruple violating federal law, the profits could be considerable," Davis wrote. The book specifies that slaves were sold at $1 a pound with the average healthy man costing $140. Aside from profiting from such trade, the book says, Bowie once sold his own slave, Henry, 19, to a cousin. Also, the book says, Bowie and other family members sold land and 80 slaves in 1831. In the book, Davis calls apocryphal a tale that Bowie in 1821 saved a runaway slave and thrashed the person pursuing him. "Given that slaves in general were property to Bowie," Davis wrote, "and this one in particular could have meant profit, it is inconceivable that he would act to help the runaway." We reached Davis by email. He replied: "No question Bowie owned slaves, most for resale, but at different times had" a "personal slave or slaves as well." We left Teich a phone message about her claim and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Teich told board colleagues that Austin and Bowie, key figures in the founding of Anglo Texas, each promoted slavery. Austin and Bowie each owned slaves. Austin believed his colony’s success required slaves and also that Texas should join the U.S. as a slave state. Bowie and two brothers earlier traded in slaves.

pomt-13832	Says GOP Senate nominee Darryl Glenn said he wants to see Ted Cruz appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.	true	/colorado/statements/2016/jul/13/michael-bennet/bennet-campaign-says-gop-senate-candidate-darryl-g/	For months Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado has run upbeat ads while more than a dozen Republican candidates slugged it out to become their party’s Senate nominee. But now that El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn has emerged as the victor in the Republican primary, the Bennet team has branded him as the candidate of "the fringe of the Republican Party" who is "too extreme for Colorado." In a recent fundraising email, the Bennet team ticked off things Glenn has said as proof that he’s "ultra-conservative." It included him saying on a conservative talk radio show, "I for one want to see (Ted) Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee." Yet, it appears unlikely that Glenn would view his passionate support of Cruz -- the Texas senator who lost his bid for the GOP presidential nomination -- as a negative. "I am an unapologetic Christian, constitutional conservative, pro-life, Second Amendment-loving American!" Glenn declared in a fiery speech that ignited the Colorado Republican Convention in April. The county commissioner, who had been struggling to raise campaign funding, swept up 70 percent of the convention vote and was the only GOP Senate candidate to win election to the ballot. (Others had to hire signature gatherers to petition their way onto the ballot). Soon Glenn was drawing endorsements from conservative standard bearers like Cruz and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and receiving crucial funding from the Senate Conservatives Fund. Just days before the state primary last month, Cruz came to Colorado and publicly endorsed Glenn, who told the crowd at the Westin Denver International Airport that if Cruz didn’t somehow wrestle the presidential nomination from Donald Trump, then Glenn had another job in mind for the Texas firebrand. "If he cannot be our next president of the United States of America, I am personally going to lead the charge to make sure he’s our next Supreme Court justice," Glenn said, stirring the crowd to give Cruz a standing ovation, according to the Denver Post. Later, in a backroom, Glenn reinforced the idea, telling Cruz, "I’m very serious about the Supreme Court, if that (presidential nomination) doesn't happen," the Post reported. Glenn made the Cruz-for-the-high court comment that the Bennet campaign quoted in its June 17 email on conservative commentator Mark Levin’s nationally syndicated talk show. (Here's a recording of the interview. Glenn makes the comment at 5:05 on the recording). "I am very serious about winning this race. We need to send a clear message, because what I want, I want an overwhelming victory so I can go to Washington, D.C., with a mandate, and send some reinforcements to Mr. Cruz. And I for one want to see Mr. Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee," Glenn said on the show. PolitiFact has asked the Glenn campaign for comment and hasn't received a reply as of publication. We’ll update the story if they respond. Our ruling In a fundraising email, the Michael Bennet campaign quoted Darryl Glenn saying, "I for one want to see Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee." Glenn, a self-described "unapologetic" conservative, has publicly repeated his vow to "lead the charge to make sure (Cruz) is our next Supreme Court justice."

pomt-11854	"IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump"	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/nov/05/creative-resistance/progressive-group-accuses-senate-splinter-group-do/	A progressive advocacy group says eight Democrats in the New York State Senate accepted money from campaign donors who typically support Republicans. A video released by The Creative Resistance targets the Independent Democratic Conference, a faction of Democrats aligned with Republicans instead of the other 23 Democrats in the Senate. "IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump," the narrator says. Outside groups often give to the majority party in each chamber. Republicans now hold a majority of 40 members, including IDC members and a Democrat who sits with the Republican conference. The video claims members of the IDC cashed in with donors who also contributed to GOP lawmakers. Is that true? Giving money in the Senate Special interest groups can give money to support candidates in two ways: to candidates directly or to a political party committee. In the State Senate, the Republicans, Democrats and IDC each has its own campaign account. The list of donors The Creative Resistance sent us to support its claim is long. Filings from the state Board of Elections show its claim is accurate -- the IDC did get money from real estate, charter school and health care lobbyists. But so did both Republicans and Democrats. Some health care examples: The Greater New York Hospital Association since 2011 has given $1.3 million to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, $625,000 to the Senate Democrat Campaign account and $311,000 to the IDC. Individual members of the IDC outpaced Democrats in donations from the association. They collectively received $16,500 since 2011. Individual Democrats collected $6,000 from the organization while Republicans received about $39,000. The Healthcare Association of New York State has given about $810,000 to Republicans between their conference’s campaign account and individual members since 2011. The IDC took a total of about $113,000 from the group. Democrats were given $105,000. Both organizations supported more Democrats than Republicans in the State Assembly, suggesting its money goes to whomever is in power. Charter schools Republicans in the State Legislature are more likely to support legislation that benefits charter schools. That’s reflected through donations they receive from charter school groups. Two of those groups, New Yorkers for Putting Students First and the Coalition for Public Charter Schools, have not given to mainline Senate Democrats since 2011. They gave about $167,000 to the IDC and its members and about $233,000 to Republicans. Eva Moskowitz, the founder of Success Academy Charter Schools, has favored the IDC over Democrats in the Senate. Her political action committee, Great Public Schools, has given about $66,000 to the IDC and its members since 2011. The PAC gave $114,000 to Senate Republicans, while six members of the mainline Democratic conference were given about $38,000 from the group. Real estate Some IDC donors from the real estate industry have ties to President Donald Trump, the video claims. The largest real estate donor on the group’s list is the Real Estate Board of New York, a statewide group that advocates for real estate developers. The Creative Resistance says the group is tied to Trump through his children. Both Eric and Ivanka Trump are members of the board. The board has given slightly more than $1 million to the Senate Republican campaign account and members since 2011. The IDC has received about $480,000 while mainline Democrats were given about $207,000. The IDC's response The IDC responded to the group's claim with its own analysis of major donors from health care, charter school and real estate lobbyists. "An honest review of campaign finance donations of all Democrats in New York illustrates that these same donors contribute to Democrats across the state, and the Senate's minority Democratic conference is no exception," IDC spokesperson Candice Giove said. Our ruling The Creative Resistance said in a video "IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump." The IDC and its members do get money from donors in the lobbyists. But so do mainline Democrats, even if it’s less than their IDC colleagues. It's not true the IDC members benefit while Democrats do not. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07868	Tells President Barack Obama that he also asked former President George W. Bush about how he felt about Americans hating him.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/08/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-tells-obama-he-also-asked-bush-about-/	During a Super Bowl interview on Feb. 6, 2011, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly prefaced a sensitive question to President Barack Obama by saying that he had asked the same question in a previous interview with former President George W. Bush. "I asked this to President Bush when I talked to him a few weeks ago," O’Reilly said to Obama. "Does it disturb you that so many people hate you? No. I mean, it's a serious question." A reader wrote to us to ask whether O’Reilly did ask that question of Bush. So we looked into it. We discovered that O’Reilly was referring to an interview aired on Nov. 11, 2010, when Bush, by then out of office for almost two years, was doing publicity for his memoir, Decision Points. Here’s the exchange between O’Reilly and Bush: O’REILLY: "Okay. But, the people in the press hated you, a lot of them. Why? Why?" BUSH : "I don’t know. You have to ask them. I’m not a hater, and so sometimes it’s hard for me to understand why somebody hates somebody. It could have been because of my policies, maybe they didn’t like my religion. I don’t know. I’m sure there’s a myriad of reasons. That’s what happens when you’re the president. It can either bother you or not bother you. I chose -- O"REILLY: "You ever think about it?" BUSH: "Being hated? No, not really." O’REILLY: "Really? Never?" BUSH: "No. I’m a pretty comfortable guy right now, you know." O’REILLY: "You look it." BUSH: "I really am. I’m honored to have served. I’m glad I served, and I gave it my all, and that’s all you can do at life. I got back -- and this sounds corny to some, I understand, but when I looked in the mirror, I know I didn’t sell my soul for the sake of any short-term politics or popularity. I think that’s important." For the record, here’s how Obama answered O’Reilly: "You know, the truth is, that the people -- and I'm sure previous presidents would say the same thing, whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody. The people who dislike you don't know you. … What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you that's out there. … I think that by the time you get here, you have to have had a pretty thick skin. If you didn't, then you probably wouldn't have gotten here." Technically, O’Reilly asked slightly different questions of each president. To Obama, he asked whether it disturbs him to be hated by "so many" Americans. To Bush, he asked how he felt about being hated by "a lot of" people in the press, and then followed up by asking him more generally if he ever thought about being hated. Still, O’Reilly’s two lines of inquiry are similar enough that we’re giving O’Reilly a True.

pomt-14146	Winning enough pledged delegates is "not impossible."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/02/bernie-sanders/sanders-its-not-impossible-get-enough-delegates-wi/	With less than 20 primaries and caucuses left in the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton has about 290 more pledged delegates than her rival Bernie Sanders. To close that gap and beat her outright, the simple numbers say Sanders has to win about 65 percent of the remaining delegates. The host of CBS News’ Face the Nation, John Dickerson, pressed Sanders on his odds of pulling that off. "To get there, many analysts who look at the pledged delegates just say, it's mathematically impossible," Dickerson said on May 1, 2016. "Are they wrong?" "It's difficult," Sanders said. "It's not impossible." So is it possible? Or impossible? The current pledged delegate count, according to NBC News, is Clinton 1,641, Sanders 1320. If you add in the superdelegates, it’s 2,151 and 1,361. Seasoned primary watcher Alan Abramowitz at Emory University said Sanders had a point -- albeit, a limited one. "Of course it’s mathematically possible for him to win 65 percent of the remaining pledged delegates," Abramowitz said, "But the probability of that actually happening is near zero." One way of gauging Sanders’ odds is to look at how many times he hit the 65-percent mark since the first contests in February. "He has won that large a share of the delegates in a few caucus states," Abramowitz said. "But he has never done it in a primary state other than Vermont, although he came close in New Hampshire." The Sanders campaign sent us their count of pledged delegates. By their reckoning, he needs 64.17 percent of the remaining delegates available. This is pledged delegates, not the super delegates who are free to throw their support behind whomever they want. (The count can vary, but right now, Clinton has about 510 super delegates to Sanders’ 40, according to NBC News.) Under Democratic Party rules, the pledged delegates are divided proportionately to the number of votes each candidate gets. That means there are no winner-take-all contests as there are on the Republican side. Using numbers from the Sanders campaign, we compared the number of contests where Sanders has taken at least 64 percent of the vote to the ones when he didn’t. (We rounded down for fairness.) This table show why analysts give him long odds: Sanders has crested the 64 percent mark on nine occasions, or about 20 percent of the time. For those who say that a 20 percent chance is tough but doable, Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, reminds us that not all primaries are equal. "Sure, Sanders could win California, the biggest prize remaining, but by enough to capture 65 percent of its delegates?" Kondik asked. "Nothing is impossible, but there’s absolutely no reason to think he could do that. Additionally, is Sanders really going to win New Jersey, a mid-Atlantic state, after Clinton generally dominated him in that region? Again, very, very doubtful." Abramowitz said the numbers don’t give Sanders any room for error. "Even if Sanders does better than expected in the remaining states, he would only slightly reduce Clinton’s pledged delegate advantage," he said. Both experts told us that the Democratic Party rule of awarding delegates proportionately makes it very difficult for Sanders to gain much ground. Clinton’s strength among the super delegates, and her overall lead of about 3 million votes, further weigh him down. Our ruling Sanders said it is not impossible for him to surge past Clinton. The experts we reached agreed. Mathematically, it is not impossible. Outside the realm of theory, however, his performance in past contests shows it is far more likely that he won’t hit the winning percentage he needs. The proportional allocation rule works against Sanders, leaving him no room to fall short. Sanders' claim is accurate with a major caveat. We rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d546e1d5-6b47-4c08-962d-2b9643544db1	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-05-02T16:48:57	2016-05-01	['None']
pomt-02436	Even though Chicago has "the most stringent gun laws on the books," it still "has the highest murder rate" in the country.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/02/ron-johnson/us-sen-ron-johnson-links-strict-gun-control-laws-h/	Citing the number of school shootings since Sandy Hook, a woman asked U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson at one of his town hall meetings why he doesn’t support expanded background checks for gun purchases. The Wisconsin Republican responded by connecting strict gun control with a high rate of homicide. "I’ll repeat it: I think we have enough gun laws on the books; we should enforce those," Johnson told his audience in Appleton on Feb. 18, 2014. "But, if you really take a look -- again, look at the facts. The most stringent gun laws on the books are in places like Chicago, (which) has the highest murder rate. "I mean, you see a lot of these -- and let’s face it, they’re all tragedies. I wish there was some magic solution to end those tragedies, prevent them, but there’s not. Some of these tragedies occurred with firearms that were legally obtained. We’ve got, what, 300 million guns on the streets? These tragedies occur in gun-free zones. So, law-abiding citizens abide by those laws; the criminals don’t." Is Johnson right that Chicago has some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, as well as the highest murder rate? And that the two are tied together? We’ll check both parts of his claim. Chicago gun laws, murders Two days after the town hall meeting, we asked Johnson spokesman Patrick McIlheran for evidence to support the senator’s claim. The next day, a blog post titled, "If stricter gun laws were a magic wand, Chicago would be safe," appeared on Johnson’s official Senate web page. McIlheran referred us to the post and said he didn’t have time to discuss Johnson’s claim. In the post, Johnson cited reports from 2013 by National Public Radio and The New York Times in saying that Chicago has some of the nation’s strictest anti-gun laws. Several experts told us there is wide consensus on that point. But Johnson changed the part of his claim about murder in Chicago. Chicago doesn’t have the highest murder rate among U.S. cities -- as in, the number of murders per 100,000 residents -- but rather the highest number of murders, Johnson wrote. The blog cited the latest full-year FBI figures, for 2012. Chicago ranked first among cities in raw numbers, with 500 murders. But its 18.5 murders per 100,000 people didn’t even put the Windy City among the top 10 cities for murder rate. Those figures are for all murders. We also found a January 2013 report by economist Richard Florida that said Chicago had a rate of 11.6 gun murders per 100,000 residents, far below the city with the highest rate, New Orleans, at 62.1. So, on the first part of Johnson’s claim, Chicago has some of the most stringent gun-control laws in the United States, but does not have the highest murder rate. Connecting gun laws, murder rates By citing Chicago in his remarks at the town hall meeting, Johnson’s message was that strict gun-control laws are not associated with low murder rates. In his blog post, Johnson wrote that Chicago has a much higher murder rate than Racine and Kenosha -- much smaller cities in Wisconsin, which the senator said has "more reasonable gun laws." But we found that, on any connection between gun control and murder, the evidence is mixed. For example, had Johnson singled out another heavy-gun-control city -- New York -- in questioning the effectiveness of strict gun control, his audience at the town hall meeting would have gotten an entirely different impression. In 2012, New York’s overall murder rate was 3.8 per 100,000 residents -- far below Chicago’s 18.5. Similarly, the Richard Florida study we noted found that New York's gun murder rate was 4 per 100,000 people and Chicago’s was 11.6 per 100,000. Other views Experts we consulted agreed there is no consensus on whether there is a clear correlation -- much less evidence of cause and effect -- between gun-control laws and a lower murder rate. They said that is particularly true in assessing the relatively few city-level gun control laws, given that most gun laws are put in place at the state and federal level. For one thing, even if a city has strict laws on who can own guns, that doesn't mean it is difficult to bring guns into that city, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. He said one study found that one-third of the guns recovered by police from criminals and crime scenes in Chicago had been purchased in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio or Mississippi -- states that, according to Webster, have the weakest gun laws. "Not surprisingly, it turns out this is a pretty complex thing to study," he said. Webster said that while it is difficult to compare cities, given their differences in demographics and other factors, it is possible to examine how a change in gun restrictions is correlated with gun crime. A study of his released in February 2014, cited by the Think Progress liberal blog, looked at what happened after Missouri in 2007 repealed a law that had required gun buyers in private gun transactions to undergo background checks. It found the repeal "was associated with" an additional 55 to 63 murders per year between 2008 and 2012. At the same time, there have been studies that found the opposite -- a link between fewer gun restrictions and lower murder rates. The findings of a November 2013 study by Quinnipiac University economics professor Mark Gius, which examined data from 1980 through 2009 and was cited by the National Rifle Association, "suggest" that states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murder rates. The results, the study added, "suggest that restrictive concealed weapons laws may cause an increase in gun-related murders at the state level." Guis told us that assessing gun laws and crime is difficult because so many factors, including poverty and drugs, affect crime rates. Moreover, gun murders committed in the heat of passion or in mass shootings are often carried out by people with no criminal record, many of whom would pass a gun background check, he said. "You really can't draw any direct correlation, definitely no cause and effect," Guis said, "especially with city level gun-control laws -- to crime." Our rating Johnson said that even though Chicago has "the most stringent guns laws on the books," it still "has the highest murder rate" in the country. Chicago does have some of the strictest gun-control laws, but is not number one among U.S. cities for the murder rate. Meanwhile, the evidence is mixed on whether stricter gun control is associated with fewer murders.

pomt-03833	"Taxes and fees amount to about 20 percent of a typical $300 round-trip domestic ticket. That’s higher than taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco and firearms."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/17/gary-kelly/southwest-airlines-ceo-says-federal-taxes-flight-a/	On a scale of politically controversial topics, airline tickets might rank near the bottom, perhaps somewhere just above Robert’s Rules of Order and a quorum call. And yet plane tickets have been part of some curious claims taken on by PolitiFact: "Every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you" -- PolitiFact Texas: Mostly False You can use food stamps for a plane ticket to "go to Hawaii" -- PolitiFact National: Pants on Fire Now coming down the runway is a claim by Gary Kelly, chief executive officer of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. Southwest carries the most domestic passengers in the U.S. and the most passengers at Milwaukee’s Mitchell International Airport. Kelly made his statement in a column he wrote for the February 2013 issues of the in-flight magazines of Southwest and of AirTran Airways, which Southwest acquired in 2011. "Taxes and fees amount to about 20 percent of a typical $300 round-trip domestic ticket," he stated. "That’s higher than taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco and firearms." With spring break around the corner, and alcohol, tobacco and firearms always in season, let’s see if Kelly’s claim takes flight. Cost of an airline ticket Kelly’s opinion column focused on federal taxes on airline tickets and other products. His source for the taxes on an airline ticket is Airlines for America, the trade group that advocates for the airline industry. It spent $6.37 million in federal lobbying in 2012, according to the nonpartisan OpenSecrets.org. In December 2012, Airlines for America announced details of a campaign it would undertake in 2013 to persuade lawmakers to reduce federal taxes on airlines and take other steps to help the industry. Just how high are those taxes? Southwest Airlines spokesman Brad Hawkins used figures provided by Airlines for America to give a breakdown of the four major federal taxes and fees on a ticket with a base price of $300. His example includes one connecting flight each way -- in other words, a ticket that includes two flights on the departure segment of the trip and two flights on the return. Type of tax Amount Total Excise tax 7.5% x $300 $22.50 Segment fee $3.90 x 4 segments $15.60 Passenger facility charge $4.50 x 4 segments $18 TSA ("Sept. 11th") fee $2.50 x 4 segments $10 Grand total $66.10 Based on Hawkins’ calculations, the $66.10 equals 22 percent of the cost of the $300 ticket, exceeding the 20 percent that Kelly claimed. As for the size of the taxes and fees, we found a Federal Aviation Administration document confirming the excise tax and segment fee amounts; they help fund the FAA, which coordinates air traffic control and other aspects of the aviation system. (An excise tax is somewhat like a sales tax, in that it is paid on a purchase, but it’s often included in the purchase price.) Another FAA document confirms the passenger facility charge, which is collected by public agencies that run commercial airports and is used for FAA-approved projects at the airports. And a Transportation Security Administration document confirms the Sept. 11 fee, which helps fund the TSA. We ran Kelly’s statement and his itinerary by Joakim Karlsson, a researcher with the Airline Ticket Tax Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the project studies ticket taxes and user fees added directly to airline tickets. He called Kelly’s statement "mathematically correct, but fundamentally misleading." Karlsson noted that fares are usually quoted with taxes and fees included. So, a $300 ticket would include a base fare of about $239. Karlsson calculated that would trigger $61 in taxes and fees, which would still amount to 20 percent of the ticket cost, the same amount Kelly claimed. But more importantly, Karlsson said, the sample ticket that Kelly uses is not typical: The typical domestic flight in the U.S. costs $418 (as of 2011), not $300. Two-thirds of all domestic tickets sold do not include connecting flights, but rather are non-stop, so they incur fewer federal fees. So, a $418 non-stop ticket would include $54 in taxes and fees, or just under 15 percent of the total. (The taxes and fees in Kelly’s $300 ticket example, if the trip were non-stop, also would equal just under 15 percent.) That means the first part of Kelly’s claim is accurate, but leaves out important details. Taxes and fees on other products As for the second part of Kelly’s statement, the Southwest Airlines spokesman cited a 2011 opinion column in The Wall Street Journal by the chief executive officer of Airlines for America, the airlines trade group. The column argued that the taxes paid by airlines are at the "same excessive levels" as "sin" taxes imposed on alcohol, tobacco and gambling. But the column provided no figures to show how the various tax rates compare. We found the following figures from the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, a division of the Department of Treasury. They represent only the federal taxes on these products. Product Tax Beer 5 cents per 12-ounce can Wine 21 cents per 750-milliliter bottle Distilled spirits $2.14 (at 80 proof) per 750-milliliter bottle Cigarettes $1.01 per 20 cigarettes Firearms 10%-11% of sale price Some brands of beer cost more than others, some wine costs more in one part of the country than another, buying in bulk costs less, etc. But, to consider some examples, if a: Six-pack of beer costs $6 at the store, 30 cents of that -- or 5 percent -- would be the federal tax. Bottle of wine costs $8, the 21-cent tax amounts to 2.6 percent. Bottle of 80-proof tequila costs $15, the tax is 14.3 percent. Pack of cigarettes costs $9, the tax would represent 11 percent of the cost; although if the pack cost $6, the tax would amount to nearly 17 percent of the cost. None of this takes into account state and local taxes on the various products, but Kelly’s claim focuses on federal taxes. So, the tax rate on an airline ticket -- whether it’s 20 percent, as in the example Kelly cited, or the more typical 15 percent as cited by the MIT program -- is generally higher than the federal tax rates on the other products Kelly cited. One might argue that taxes and fees on airline tickets, which help fund aviation operations, are fundamentally different from "sin" taxes on things like cigarettes, which are meant to hold down consumption. But that’s not an argument central to this claim. Our rating Kelly said: "Taxes and fees amount to about 20 percent of a typical $300 round-trip domestic ticket. That’s higher than taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco and firearms." The first part of the claim is technically accurate, but misleading, given that the tax rate on a typical flight -- which costs more than $300 and doesn’t include connecting flights -- is 15 percent. The second part of the claim, although it doesn’t take into account price variations on various products, appears generally accurate. On balance, since the thrust of the claim was which had more taxes and which had less, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Gary Kelly	None	None	None	2013-03-17T09:00:00	2013-02-01	['None']
pomt-01466	Says U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland "voted to keep the shutdown going."	true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/01/gwen-graham/steve-southerland-voted-extend-2013-government-shu/	After a barrage of fighting words from incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, Democratic congressional hopeful Gwen Graham has come back swinging in the tight race to represent a northern Florida district. First, Southerland called Graham a "Washington lobbyist," an attack that focused on what the just-out-of-law-school attorney was doing 25 years ago. We ruled that claim Mostly False. Now the daughter of Bob Graham, the former governor and U.S. senator, has dug into the first-term congressman’s voting record and accused him of being obstructionist. "Believe me, I can handle Congressman Southerland’s campaign of lies and put-downs," Graham said in a recent television commercial. "But his vote for the government shutdown? Now, that’s a problem. He cost taxpayers $24 billion. His shutdown hurt businesses and families, seniors and even our veterans. And when both parties finally got together to fix it, Congressman Southerland voted to keep the shutdown going." Graham’s mention of the shutdown refers to the battle between Oct. 1, 2013, and Oct. 16, 2013, when congressional Republicans refused to fund President Barack Obama’s health care law and Obama refused to sign spending bills unless they included funding for the law. With the two sides in deadlock for more than two weeks, annual spending bills did not move through Congress and to the president’s desk. Without money to fund its operations, the federal government reduced its activities to those of protecting lives and property; many federal workers were furloughed, and many federal services were dormant. Democrats have tried to blame the GOP for the shutdown, with some success. But is Graham correct that Southerland tried to keep the unpopular gridlock going even when his Capitol Hill cohorts tried to compromise? The short answer: Basically, yes. Shutdown showdown During the runup to the shutdown, the GOP-led House, stacked with tea party-backed junior representatives like Southerland, strategized to "defund Obamacare" -- that is, not pass any spending bill that gave money for the president’s signature health care legislation. The battle was joined in earnest on Sept. 20, when the House voted, 230-189, to raise the nation’s $16.7 trillion debt limit only if Affordable Care Act funding was stripped out of the spending bill. Southerland released a statement that day reading, "I do not want to see a government shutdown." He called the vote "a decisive step forward in our fight to ensure that the federal government is properly funded" while ensuring "our nation’s credit rating will be protected, while moving one step closer to a permanent delay and dismantling of government-run health care." He then went on to vote for three House bills stripped of Obamacare funding prior to Oct. 1, which his campaign manager Luke Strickland said was proof Southerland "didn't support and didn't vote for the government shutdown." It was well-known that the Democratic-held Senate would not accept such a bill sent from the House, and the bills went nowhere. Negotiations broke down and on Sept. 30, the federal government was shuttered. The House made several attempts to pass spending measures with similar provisions against Obamacare, but they continued to get bounced by the Senate. (Southerland, like most of his Republican colleagues, repeatedly approved these attempts.) Finally, after 16 days, the Senate passed a spending bill that raised the debt ceiling and funded the government through Jan. 15, 2014, by a bipartisan vote of 81-18. (Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was one of the Republican’s in the nay column; when he tried to say he voted to fully fund the government, we ruled the claim Mostly False.) The House soon relented, voting 285-144 for H.R. 2775, with 87 Republicans in support. But the key to checking Graham’s claim is that Southerland did not cross the aisle. Had enough additional Republicans joined him in voting no, the shutdown would have continued. Southerland’s campaign manager noted that while the lawmaker voted for several measures to fund essential services and to create the working group that focused on finding a compromise, his convictions led him to vote against the bipartisan bill that ended the stalemate. "After all of the uncertainty caused by the shutdown, Steve believed we needed a long-term solution that addressed the root causes of the crisis, not another stopgap that could have put us right back in the same boat months down the road," Strickland told PolitiFact Florida. It’s not like Southerland’s ashamed of his anti-Obamacare position. His online House profile boasts that he has voted to "to repeal, replace, and defund Obamacare over forty times." He did speak about the vote after H.R. 2775 passed and the government reopened. He said he "fought tooth and nail from day one to avert a shutdown" and blamed the Senate for rejecting the House spending bills. Southerland said the end result wasn’t something he could stomach, but he didn’t mention the looming specter of default that overshadowed the faceoff. "I had no choice but to oppose (Senate Majority Leader Harry) Reid’s bill because it provides short-term spending without addressing the long-term drivers of this shutdown, including an exploding national debt and glaring inequalities under the president’s health care law," Southerland said. (For the record, the bill was hammered out by Reid, a Nevada Democrat, and the Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.) "I simply can’t justify to my constituents a system where corporations and labor unions deserve a one-year compliance delay and government officials get special premium subsidies while average American families receive neither," Southerland continued. "I hope both parties in Washington learned a lesson from this shutdown and we get serious about addressing these issues before again bringing the nation to the brink." Our ruling Graham said Southerland "voted to keep the shutdown going." The ad refers to an Oct. 16, 2013, no vote Southerland cast against a bipartisan Senate bill that funded the government and ended the shutdown. By the time it reached the House floor, it was clear to lawmakers that their vote would effectively be deciding whether to end the shutdown or not. If more Republicans had joined Southerland in voting no, the shutdown would have continued. Regardless of Southerland’s personal feelings about a shutdown, Graham is focusing her attack on his vote -- and his vote was a clear "no" to ending the shutdown. We rate the claim True.

pomt-07381	"At Texas A&M University, only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead over the past five years."	false	/texas/statements/2011/may/04/dick-armey/dick-armey-says-49-texas-sam-university-faculty-ha/	In an opinion-page article, a former U.S. House majority leader from Texas poked at Texas A&M University while urging greater rewards for professors who attract research dollars. In the April 17 Houston Chronicle, Dick Armey wrote: "The incentives in our higher education system should attract the best professors and researchers in the world and provide our students the best education possible. Let's start by allowing researchers to keep up to 90 percent of the research dollars they generate instead of the 50 percent that is typically the limit today. Disclosing the salaries of tenured professors would be another useful reform, along with how many students they teach and how many funded research dollars they bring in." His A&M punchline: "At Texas A&M University, only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead over the past five years." Well, gig us. Is that count correct? To our request for back-up, FreedomWorks spokesman Adam Brandon said by email that the group is writing a detailed report making the point that "great researchers should be rewarded for bringing in lots of research dollars, rather than having them siphoned off to support less productive researchers." Armey chairs FreedomWorks, which says it mobilizes people for lower taxes, less government and more freedom. Brandon’s reply continued: "The easiest back-of-the-envelope calculation might be to assume that if a researcher brought in more funding than his salary, he would have ‘paid for himself.’ Incrementally this might be true, but neglects the full costs of running the university. To do a full cost analysis, you have to burden the compensation with overhead." Brandon said the latest available information, covering 2008, comes from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, which describes itself as a system of interrelated surveys conducted annually by the federal government involving every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs. Brandon said the data is the "foundation for (Armey’s) analysis that only 49 (A&M) researchers paid for themselves." Brandon said data drawn from that system show that for every $1 spent on faculty salaries, the university expended money on overhead. That is, Brandon said, each dollar of research "creates some additional costs elsewhere in the university." He said Armey calculated that each $1 of salary, plus 25 percent to represent the cost of benefits, must bear $2.71 of overhead. "Running these calculations, we found that over a five-year period, only 49 researchers paid for themselves." We unsuccessfully sought a detailed breakdown of university spending from Armey supporting his claim. Separately, an online search led us to articles published in September by the Bryan-College Station Eagle on a report prepared by the Texas A&M University System on the costs and contributions of faculty members in 2008-09. As summarized in a Sept. 15 news article, the study isolated "what a faculty member generates by teaching -- tuition paid by students and formula funding by the state based on weighted semester credit hours -- and subtracts from that the faculty member's salary and estimated cost of benefits. It doesn't take research dollars generated into account," the newspaper reported, though such information appears in an adjacent column. In a memo prefacing the detailed breakdown, the chancellor of the A&M system, Michael McKinney, said it shows the "faculty at each university generate revenue in excess of their payroll costs. University literally means totality," the memo says. "Our faculties work together, some teaching many undergraduates, some teaching fewer graduate students and some providing new knowledge through research." Once issued, the report prompted criticisms across A&M’s flagship campus, according to the Eagle. Some complained the report’s faculty research funding tallies were off and some said salaries were overstated. The paper quoted Jorge Vanegas, dean of the College of Architecture, saying the metric favors faculty who teach more without accounting for Texas A&M’s function as a research university. "When numbers are taken out of their full context and they feed into misconceptions or explicit lack of recognition of what the full spectrum of academia should be, it causes a demoralizing effect on faculty," Vanegas said. The Eagle reported that the A&M system removed the report from the Internet as a spokesman said the information on externally funded research continued to be refined. A few days later, the president at the College Station campus, R. Bowen Loftin, emailed faculty stating the report results wouldl not be used to "assess the overall productivity of an individual faculty member, and it certainly does not speak to the quality of that productivity," the newspaper reported. We obtained a copy of the report through an open-records’ request. Of interest: One column in its charts shows the difference between total funds generated by each faculty member and their salary costs. We quickly counted more than 49 faculty members credited with generating more than they cost in the studied year, in just the first three of dozens of the university’s academic departments. Specifically, the report lists 21 faculty in Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication; 17 in Agricultural Economics; and 18 in Animal Science--56 total--as net income generators. In those departments, 45 teachers ran in the red, so to speak, according to the report. In an interview, system spokesman Jason Cook confirmed that the study did not try to assign a cost for each teacher's overhead. "I don't know how we could do that," he said. What about Armey’s statement that only 49 A&M faculty members brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead the past five years? Cook emailed us: "We don't know how" Armey's number was determined. Cook later said that the IPED research cited by FreedomWorks is useful to compare A&M to other institutions, but cannot be used to pinpoint how many faculty members earn their keep. Upshot: Without access to Armey’s data, we couldn’t plumb his methodology. Meantime, our spot-check of Texas A&M’s recent study of faculty costs, which some critics said undercounted faculty contributions, suggests that way more than 49 faculty members accounted for more than they cost in 2008-09. We rate the statement False.	None	Dick Armey	None	None	None	2011-05-04T06:00:00	2011-04-17	['None']
pomt-08413	Pat Toomey "still supports privatizing Social Security."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/20/joe-sestak/joe-sestak-says-pat-toomey-still-supports-privatiz/	In what's becoming a close Pennsylvania Senate race, Democratic Rep. Joe Sestak is hammering former Republican Rep. Pat Toomey over Social Security. Here's an ad unveiled Oct. 11, 2010. "The stock market crash," a narrator somberly intones, as video and audio clips of the 2008 Wall Street tumble stream by. "If Social Security had been privatized, seniors would have seen their retirement wiped out." (Video shows four images of seniors.) "Congressman Pat Toomey still supports privatizing Social Security. See, Toomey has represented Wall Street his entire life, so Toomey puts Wall Street profits ahead of protecting Pennsylvania seniors." (Video shows images of Toomey and newspaper clips referring to his stance on privatizing Social Security.) We wondered how accurate Sestak's ad was, since it echoed other Democratic ads on Social Security that we've rated either Barely True or Half True. First, a little background on the idea of privatizing Social Security. Conservatives have long embraced the idea of turning Social Security as we know it -- in which younger workers' payroll taxes fund retired Americans' monthly payments -- into a system where workers may invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is that retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given the historical rates of return from private investments. Of course, critics note a major downside -- the possibility of loss. Social Security may be invested more conservatively than some private investments, but that protects retirees from market losses. And, because it's a legal entitlement, retirees can count on Social Security, unless the law is changed. While Republicans have emphasized possible gains from personal investing, many Democrats have focused on potential losses, leading many Republicans to distance themselves from the word they once used to describe the idea -- "privatization." Understanding that many seniors have deep concerns about changing the way Social Security works -- and knowing that seniors turn out to vote in comparatively high numbers -- few Republican politicians today advocate a full-blown privatization of Social Security. Rather, those who take up the issue at all propose a gradual transition in which current Social Security beneficiaries and those within a decade or so of entering the program will undergo no changes. Instead, the changes made would only affect those a decade or more away from retirement, and in most proposals, these younger workers would only divert a portion of their payroll taxes to private accounts (rather than 100 percent in the purest version) and would do so on a voluntary basis (instead of the shift being mandatory). This model is pretty close to what Toomey said represents his current view during a recent meeting with the editorial board of the Scranton Times-Tribune. "Under Mr. Toomey's proposal, the government would guarantee the Social Security benefits of people currently at or approaching retirement age," wrote staff writer Borys Krawczeniuk in his Oct. 8 report on the meeting. "'Any change for those folks would be outrageous and unreasonable. Those people who have worked a lifetime paying into a system with a promised set of benefits need to get what they were promised,' Mr. Toomey said. 'But if we're going to be honest about it, we know the program can't continue in its current form.'" The article added that Toomey's plan would allow "younger workers to voluntarily divert a portion of their Social Security payroll tax into private savings accounts they would control and invest any way they want. A young worker who did not want to do that could stay with the current system of a guaranteed benefit." So, back to the ad. We see two areas worth a closer look. • Is it "privatization" if it's partial, voluntary privatization? In our previous analyses, we have been critical of ads that fudge the difference. This one doesn't explicitly say that Toomey wants to privatize the whole program, but it doesn't disabuse viewers of that notion either. • Does the ad go too far in directing its message toward seniors, even though Toomey's plan specifically exempts them from any changes? As we've noted in an earlier fact-check of the Sestak-Toomey race, focusing on seniors makes good sense in Pennsylvania: It's the fourth oldest state in the union, with 15.5 percent of its residents over 65, trailing only Florida, West Virginia and Maine. Sestak's ad uses four images of senior citizens, and it specifically cites older Americans in its closing line by saying that "Toomey puts Wall Street profits ahead of protecting Pennsylvania seniors." Yet Toomey makes a point of saying that his plan won't affect those currently in Social Security or those entering the program in the next few years. He even said that any effort to change the rules for older Americans would be "outrageous" and "unreasonable." So wouldn't that qualify as misleading? Not so fast, says the Sestak camp. They argue that even though the seniors are nominally protected by Toomey's pledge, they wouldn't be kept safe in reality. When you drain Social Security revenue by allowing younger workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes privately, you increase the fiscal pressure on Social Security in its role delivering benefits to current retirees. Since retirees are still promised full benefits under the Toomey plan, the revenue shortfall will eventually have to be made up somehow, whether it's through new taxes or increased borrowing -- or reduced benefits. If benefits are to be reduced, then even retirees supposedly protected under Toomey's plan could suffer. We ran this line of thinking by a variety of policy experts. They agreed that there's a legitimate policy concern with the transition to a partially privatized system, but they added that it may not provide full justification for the ad's focus on today's seniors. For one thing, you could just as easily make the argument that current benefit levels are under fiscal threat due to demographic trends, yet the ad doesn't acknowledge that risk. In addition, the amount of immediate fiscal pressure will ultimately depend on how big a portion of their payroll taxes participants are allowed to invest privately, and whether the option proves widely popular or not. Finally, Social Security has a trust fund that is predicted to remain solvent through 2037, meaning that revenue replenishment might not have to take place immediately. This latter fact is relevant in judging the ad's atmospherics, because if the replenishment is delayed long enough, no one who's a senior today -- or who's going to be one any time soon -- would face the possibility of a cut in retirement benefits. And that would undercut the ad's focus on seniors. Paul Van de Water of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities does note that seniors may oppose even a partial privatization because they want their grandchildren to have a solid Social Security benefit when they reach retirement. "Since we don’t have pictures of what (their grandchildren) will look like 30 or 40 years from now, I don’t think that it’s misleading to use pictures of today’s elderly to illustrate the point," he said. We see his argument, but we still think the ad overplays its hand. The ad is correct that Toomey supports a type of privatization -- in fact, he's been quite open about it -- but that privatization proposal is limited and optional. The Toomey plan also wouldn't directly affect today's seniors, and it may or may not affect any of today's seniors who are still alive years down the road. This clashes with the ad's visuals, which seem directly targeted at older voters, not younger ones. On balance, we rate the ad Half True.

It uses video and audio clips of Ernst speaking at primary debates and in interviews as evidence for the claim that she does not "think there should be a national minimum wage." According to the most recent polls, Ernst and Braley are nearly tied. We wanted to know if this latest attack ad was accurate: Does Ernst oppose a national minimum wage? This isn’t the first attack on Ernst for her position on the minimum wage. In a June ad, the Iowa Democratic Party accused Ernst of flip-flopping on the issue. We decided to take a look back at Ernst’s public statements and positions on the minimum wage, but it can get confusing. So we compiled a timeline to see if her views changed. January 2014 On Jan. 9, 2014 Braley released a report on minimum wage that suggested raising the national figure to $10.10 an hour. Ernst disagreed. "I believe that businesses will do what is best for their business," she said in an interview the same day. "I don’t know that the government needs to be stepping in and telling them this is what you will do." February 2014 Ernst’s opposition to the federal government’s role in raising a minimum wage continued. "Government and government-mandated wage increases are not the solution," she said, as reported in a Quad-City Times story. March 2014 At a candidate forum held by the National Federation of Independent Business on March 18, 2014, Ernst said this: "I do believe it is best left up to the states. Our state economies are much different from state to state, so I don’t believe the federal government should be involved in setting the minimum wage." Ernst also talked about the great opportunity she had working a minimum wage job as a biscuit maker at Hardee’s. "I think $7.25 is appropriate for Iowa," she concluded. April 2014 In an April debate Ernst said she would not raise Iowa’s minimum wage. She argued that minimum wage jobs were "introductory level" positions and eventually workers could progress into better paying jobs as they acquired more skills. June 2014 Ernst appeared on Iowa Public Radio for a candidate profile on June 1, 2014. When asked about increasing the minimum wage, Ernst responded with a familiar line. "I do not support a federal minimum wage. Every state has a different economy, different cost of living. I don’t believe that’s the role of the federal government," she said. But she seemed to soften that position in late June. After Ernst won the Republican primary she suggested the minimum wage should be left as it is but not raised. "I never called for the abolishment of it. Never," Ernst said to U.S. News and World Report on June 23, 2014. "I’m saying I don’t support a $10.10 minimum wage. This is somewhat contradictory as her earlier comments suggested she saw no role for the federal government in setting the minimum wage. When we asked about it, Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel said Ernst believes that decisions about the minimum wage should be made "locally, not in Washington." Ernst believes that "Iowans know what’s best for Iowa and that’s where these decisions belong -- on the state level." July 2014 PolitiFact asked the Ernst campaign on July 31, 2014, about Ernst's position on the minimum wage. PolitiFact: "Does she believe that the federal government should play any role at all in deciding the minimum wage? Or should it be left up to the states entirely?" Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel: "While in college Joni worked for minimum wage at Hardee’s and believes the minimum wage is a safety net. Joni does not believe in Washington’s one size fits all approach; that’s why any decision pertaining to the minimum wage rate going forward needs to be decided locally, not in Washington. What’s right for New York or California, is not necessarily right for Iowa." PolitiFact: "In a couple of debates and interviews she refers to the minimum wage as a 'safety net.' What exactly does she mean by that?" Hamel: "The baseline minimum wage that has been set." Our ruling Braley said that Ernst does not support a "national minimum wage." Ernst's public statements have been confusing at times, but overall, she has said repeatedly that states should decide the minimum wage, not the federal government. She's also called the minimum wage a "safety net," and her campaign told us that by that she means the current baseline minimum wage. Overall, we rate Braley's statement Mostly True.

pomt-00015	Mexico is providing professional charter buses for the migrant caravan.	half-true	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/08/blog-posting/bus-caravan-needs-additional-context/	A story shared on Facebook claims that the Mexican government is helping the migrant caravan by paying for professional charter buses to help leapfrog the group closer to the United States border. The story was posted by the Red State, a conservative political blog, on Oct. 30 and cites a Fox News journalist, who reported from Mexico. The broadcast showed footage of buses lined up as hundreds of Central American migrants waited to board. The caravan is one of three trekking through Mexico and includes thousands of people. The Red State story said that the growing migrant caravan headed toward the U.S. border was followed by "disturbing reports of the migrants getting state-funded help from Mexico." This report was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the story was partially accurate, but lacked some essential details. The broadcast In the Oct. 30 broadcast, Fox News reporter Griff Jenkins said it was the first time he had seen "an organized bus operation from the state of Oaxaca actually getting volunteer buses to put people on them and take them to their next location." He said the buses were intended for women and children, but many fathers and husbands didn’t want to be separated from their families. Jenkins also said that while the Mexican police had tried to dissuade the caravan from crossing the Guatemala-Mexican border in mid October, it seems "at least Mexican towns are really assisting them to make their way now." An AZ Central story from the same day reported that migrants began arriving in Oaxaca that morning from Santiago Niltepec, a town about 30 miles to the south. For the first time, the outlet reported, buses were "used to transport women and children." Several images captured by the Associated Press also show families and children on buses, with reporting that the rides were donated to help some families get to the next destination. The images were taken the morning of Oct. 30 in the Niltepec, Oaxaca state. It is not known who paid for the donated rides. It isn’t clear if those were the same buses that Jenkins saw, but the time, date and region matches multiple reports that said families took donated buses to get to their next destination. An offer, and then a reversal A few days later, on Nov. 2, a Mexican governor offered to help assist the caravan with buses, The Associated Press reported. Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes announced in a video that authorities in the state would provide humanitarian assistance as well as buses to leapfrog them to the country’s capital. But almost immediately after, Yunes withdrew the offer in a second video, saying that because Mexico City’s water system was undergoing maintenance, it would not be correct to send the migrants there. However, reports say that the scheduled maintenance had been known for some time. Most of the migrants were reported to have continued on foot instead, and reached the Mexican capital over the weekend. Our ruling It is unclear whether the buses Fox News saw and reported on were the work of the Mexican federal government, but other reports from the same day and region said buses were donated for some migrant families to use to get to their next destination. At one point, a Mexican governor did make an offer to transport migrants by bus to Mexico City, the group’s next stop at the time. However, he withdrew that plan almost immediately thereafter. The story has some basis, but it doesn’t provide readers with all the details or mention that multiple buses were donated. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07471	Multnomah County has faced "11 straight years" of cuts	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/16/jeff-cogen/has-multnomah-county-had-cut-11-straight-years/	Multnomah County Chairman Jeff Cogen is in the midst of proposing his first real budget, after succeeding Ted Wheeler last year. For the chairman’s first state of the county speech in February, he described the current budget picture as challenging. "This year we face yet another multimillion-dollar budget deficit … it’s the 11th straight year of cuts at Multnomah County. That’s right: 11 straight years of cuts. Our broken tax system means that in good years we cut services and in bad years we slash them." (from prepared remarks) We believe the chairman when he says the county has faced some pretty lean years, especially with two recessions within the last decade. But did the county really face 11 straight years of cuts? The statement needed checking out. First, a little background. The county is responsible for some public safety, library, public health and human services. One third of the county’s total budget is the general fund, the bulk of which comes from property taxes, and then business taxes, car rental taxes, and so on. Because property tax rates are capped annually at 3 percent, while inflation, personnel and other costs are more like 4 percent or 5 percent (according to the county), budgeting can be rough going. Now for the budget numbers, which go back about a decade. The first column lists general fund dollars; it includes the temporary county income tax for fiscal years 2004-06, about $32 million a year, but not the portion that went toward public schools. The figures are unadjusted for inflation. The second column shows ongoing and one-time money, adjusted for inflation, and excluding the temporary income tax. The third column shows general fund dollars adjusted for inflation but excluding one-time money. (The analyst didn’t go all the way back.) All three sets come from the county. General fund, unadjusted for inflation Adjusted for inflation, includes ongoing and some one-time dollars Adjusted for inflation, excludes one-time dollars FY 2003 $304 $342.2 -- FY 2004 $306.2 $310.5 -- FY 2005 $310.1 $304.2 -- FY 2006 $333.4 $306.4 -- FY 2007 $351.7 $354.5 $324.8 FY 2008 $363.6 $358.7 $341.3 FY 2009 $407.6 $381.4 $350.1 FY 2010 $380 $340.1 $335.5 FY 2011 $392 $349.8 $337.2 FY 2012* based on March forecast $407.9 $366.2 (unadjusted for inflation) $352.8 (unadjusted for inflation) You can see that the numbers have climbed steadily since 2006, no matter which column you pick, with the exception of fiscal year 2010, which saw a significant dip. How then does the county justify the claim that it’s had 11 straight years of cuts? Well, it depends on how you think of "cuts." People understand the concept of a pay cut: You have less money to spend or save. The county, though, has more money to spend so it hasn’t faced 11 straight years of that sort of cut. But the county considers reducing services a cut. It rolls back services if there is a gap between projected ongoing revenue and projected ongoing expenses. Projected expenses means the money needed to maintain current service levels. So even though the actual dollar amount available for FY 2012 is more than for FY 2011, the county budget people say they are facing cuts, either to direct services or to staff. The March revenue forecast shows a projected $4.4 million gap between revenues and expenditures -- or a difference of a little more than 1 percent -- in the operating budget for fiscal year 2012, which starts July 1. No doubt the county has had to make cuts over the years, maybe in some department every single year, but Multnomah County also has added programs, has expanded programs and has paid more for raises, health insurance and cost-of-living increases for much of the past decade. Cogen strenuously disagrees with our definition. He said most people see cuts not in terms of fewer dollars, but fewer services. Having more money does not mean the county avoids service cuts, he argues, mainly because the general cost of doing business goes up. He even pointed to language in stories in The Oregonian that say K-12 schools will get $80 million more over the next two years, but that won’t be enough to avert teacher layoffs or shorter school years. (That’s because educators say they need $1 billion more to cover inflation and student enrollment increases.) The bottom line for PolitiFact Oregon? Multnomah County has consistently received more money in the general fund with few exceptions. We don’t think of that as more than a decade of cuts. We believe Cogen when he says he takes his integrity seriously. And we recognize that the county is restricted by the cap on property taxes. But we can’t agree with the chairman’s statement that the county has had 11 years of cuts. The statement may be accurate, in that there were service cuts, but it leaves out important details, such as the rising dollars in its budget. We rate this Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-02519	"The median net worth of American households hasn't changed much over the past decades, it's about $20,000 ... but Congress' average median net worth has ballooned, more than doubled."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/11/ari-melber/msnbcs-melber-congressional-wealth-climbed-while-m/	If Democrats have their way, the growing gap between the wealthy and everyone else will play a major role in the 2014 elections. The trend certainly raises questions about government policies, but it also has implications for the make-up of our government itself. In an interview with retiring U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., MSNBC host Ari Melber noted the increasing affluence within the halls of Congress. "The median net worth of American households hasn't changed much over the past decades, it's about $20,000," Melber said. "But Congress' average median net worth has ballooned, more than doubled." As Melber spoke, a chart comparing 1984 and 2009 appeared on the screen. The column showing the median household net worth was about the same in both years. But the column for members of Congress started out tall and became much taller. Melber cited a Washington Post article that brought together two sets of information. One was a detailed survey of the financial status of Americans collected by University of Michigan researchers. The other was the disclosure forms from members of Congress. In constant dollars, the net worth in Congress went from $280,000 to $725,000. Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for the median American household went from $20,600 to $20,500. It’s important to note that these numbers don’t look at net worth the way most analysts use that term. The Washington Post analysis excluded the value of peoples’ homes. And home values significantly boost people’s net worths, said Richard Fry, a senior economist with the Pew Research Center. "The total median wealth of American households, if you include the home, was not flat since 1984," Fry said. "There was a big run up house prices over the 25 years." But the Post had a reason for excluding this real estate in their analysis: Members of Congress don’t have to disclose the value of their homes. Cutting it out of the tally for regular Americans allowed the newspaper to compare apples to apples. MSNBC host Melber said if the network decides to quote somebody else’s work, they stick to what was originally reported. "We avoid adding data to the results or findings," Melber said. The downside of this approach is it left MSNBC viewers with the misleading impression that Americans have far fewer assets than they actually do. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a more accurate figure today for all Americans, including home value, is a bit under $69,000. (Members of Congress would have higher net worths, too, using this calculation.) So while both numbers are higher, Melber’s point about the widening gap between the wealth of typical Americans and their elected representatives in Washington is spot on. The gap has grown because as investments, real estate and Wall Street have followed very different trajectories. To put it simply, stocks and other financial investments have shot up, while real estate has not done nearly as well. By one analysis, home prices fell 31 percent from 2005 to 2011. In the same period, the S&P 500 delivered a 13 percent return. Who tends to have more money in stocks and such? Wealthy people. And what’s the profile of our elected officials in Washington? Affluent. More than 300 members are in the millionaires club, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. For John Samples, director of the Center for Representative Government at the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington, the impact on net worth over time is predictable. "Higher net worth individuals tend to be more invested in capital markets, which have done well since 2008 and indeed, over the long term," Samples said. According to the Census Bureau, nearly two-thirds of households with a net worth over $500,000 owned stocks or mutual funds, compared to about 10 percent of all other households. In 2012, the median net worth in Congress was over a million dollars, putting members squarely in the high-end group. As for why Congress might have so many members with a high net worth, Sarah Bryner, an analyst with the Center for Responsive Politics, said there is no one answer. A hypothesis? It’s not easy to run for office unless you’re wealthy. "If I work for somebody else, I can't tell that person I will need a year and a half off to run for office," Bryner said. "They would laugh at you. But if I own a law firm, then I do have the flexibility to take off large chunks of time to go fundraising." Our ruling MSNBC’s Melber said that the median net worth of Americans has barely changed since 1984 while it has skyrocketed for members of Congress. Experts confirmed that the real and growing gap between the typical American and a member of Congress is on the order described by Melber. However, when Melber said that the median net worth of American households is about $20,500, he failed to note that the figure relied on a peculiar definition of net worth that omitted the value of people's homes. That omission left viewers with a signficant misunderstanding of the real number. Because of that, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09298	"The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country.''	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/22/barack-obama/obama-campaign-financed-large-donors-too/	New financial regulations are pending in Congress, but both political parties get a lot of campaign contributions from the people they intend to regulate -- Wall Street. The financial sector donates millions to both Republican and Democratic candidates. And during the last couple of election cycles, Democrats have outstripped Republicans, who have traditionally been thought of as more business-friendly. Those political realities have made for interesting dynamics as the negotiations on financial regulation continue. President Barack Obama answered questions on this topic in an interview with CNBC's John Harwood on April 21, 2010. "In the 2008 campaign, you got a lot of money, about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs," Harwood said. "Your former White House counsel Greg Craig is apparently going to represent Goldman Sachs. In light of this case, do either of those things embarrass you?" "No," Obama said. "First of all, I got a lot of money from a lot of people. And the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country. And moreover, anybody who gave me money during the course of my campaign knew that I was on record again in 2007, and 2008, pushing very strongly that we needed to reform how Wall Street did business. And so, nobody should be surprised in the position that I'm taking now because it is one that I was very clear about in the course of the campaign." What jumped out at us in this exchange was Obama's statement, "the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country." We've seen that statement repeated elsewhere, but the evidence doesn't back it up. Campaign contributions are public record, so there's verifiable data on how much political candidates receive and who gives it to them. Obama did raise a lot of money from small donations collected over the Internet, and several groups have analyzed the information to determine how much that was. While Obama got more money from small donors than his opponents, they did not account for the majority of his funds. We're setting the bar for a small donor as someone who gives $200 or less. The Federal Election Commission rules say that someone who gives this amount does not need to publicly disclose their name, address, occupation and employer. In the general election, Obama got about 34 percent of his individual donations from small donors, people who gave $200 or less, according to a report from the Campaign Finance Institute. Another 23 percent of donations came from people who gave between $201 and $999, and another 42 percent from people who gave $1,000 or more. His numbers for the primary were similar. He got about 30 percent of his money from donors who gave $200 or less. Another 28 percent of donations came from people who gave between $201 and $999, and 43 percent from people who gave $1,000 or more. These numbers were compiled by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, and included in a report Reform in an Age of Networked Campaigns, which was published jointly with the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute. During the campaign, Obama ended up opting out of the public financing system for presidential candidates, because the system limits how much money candidates can raise, and Obama realized he could raise much more money outside of the system. (Read more details from our previous report, 'Parallel public financing'? Only partly.) Obama was bothered about opting out of the public financing system, because he believed it would undercut his moral authority in arguing for campaign finance reform, according to Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, who wrote about the decision in his campaign memoir, The Audacity to Win. So the campaign considered opting out of the federal system but limiting contributions to $250. "The idea sounded appealing," Plouffe writes. "But when our finance staff ran the numbers, it became clear this option would produce the worst of both worlds: we would not raise enough money to justify the pummeling we would take." Obama supporters like to counter that Obama raised more money from small donors than any previous candidate for president, which is true. But Obama still needed large donors to fund his campaign. Obama implies that he won the presidency without much money from large donors, and the evidence does not support that. In fact, even if we set the bar for small donors higher -- if we stipulated that everyone who gave less than $1,000 was a small donor -- that still means 43 percent gave more. And the interviewer, John Harwood, was correct when he said Obama got about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs; the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics puts the number at $994,795. Obama's skill at raising money from small donors for the 2008 campaign was significant. But Obama was also skilled at raising money from large donors. His statement was, "the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country." That's not the case. Only 32 percent of his general election money came from people who gave $200 or less. We rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-04-22T12:54:37	2010-04-21	['None']

pomt-04273	Says Ovide Lamontagne wants to eliminate kindergarten.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/nov/03/new-hampshire-democratic-party/does-ovide-lamontagne-want-get-rid-kindergarten/	New Hampshire voters have almost made it to the Election Day finish line -- signaling a final push for campaigns to flood mailboxes and front doors with mailers. Among the shower of flyers, the New Hampshire Democratic Party recently labelled Republican gubernatorial candidate Ovide Lamontagne as "radically backward," with an ad that features a photo of a frowning first grader "already one year behind" his classmates because he didn’t go to kindergarten. "Ovide Lamontagne wants to eliminate kindergarten, which will leave our kids one year behind," the mailer states, scrawled in crooked font that looks like a struggling elementary school student could have written it. Democrats have used lines like this throughout the campaign season to attack Republicans who oppose state-mandated kindergarten. The New Hampshire Democratic Party mailer also cites examples from debates and media coverage that show Lamontagne’s "radical agenda that will hurt our public schools." But since the flyer clearly aims at Lamontagne’s views on kindergarten, we’ll stick to that. New Hampshire democrats backed up the flyer by pointing to a debate between Lamontagne and Kevin Smith in August, prior to the Republican primary, to prove Lamontagne wants to "repeal the law ensuring all children can go to kindergarten." At the time, Lamontagne, who served as chairman of the state’s Board of Education, said kindergarten should not be state-mandated. "I’ve always been for local control," Lamontagne said. ""The decision about whether or not to have kindergarten is a decision for the communities and school districts of our state, it is not something that should be compelled, it's really not something that should be compelled by the state. … If you turnover that decision to the state, what other decisions are you going to turn over to the state -- or worse to the federal government?" Press secretary for the state Democratic Party Collin Gately provided us additional back-up including endorsements from The Telegraph and the Concord Monitor for Lamontagne’s opponent, Maggie Hassan and a Telegraph story about a Lamontagne-Hassan debate at Rivier University, quoting Lamontagne: "I support public kindergarten but those decisions should be made by parents and citizens at the local level, not mandated from Concord. Maggie thinks it should be mandated from Concord." Lamontagne spokesman Tom Cronin told PolitiFact New Hampshire that Lamontagne, a former schoolteacher, has "no intention of trying to overturn the kindergarten mandate." "He opposed the original kindergarten mandate years ago because he believed it was the prerogative of local school districts to decided whether or not to offer and fund public kindergarten," Cronin said. If elected governor, Lamontagne could face whether to sign or veto a bill to repeal the state mandating kindergarten. During the 2011, session, state Rep. Jonathan Maltz, R-Hudson, proposed H.B. 631 to repeal the state mandate requiring districts to provide kindergarten programs. The bill specifically addressed repealing SB 530, which provides kindergarten construction grants for districts that do not currently operate kindergarten programs, until every district in the state has a kindergarten program, according to Stephanie Rose, an Associate Policy Analyst with the Education Commission of the States. But Maltz’s bill didn’t gain much traction from House Democrats or Republicans. (It’s worth noting, that some New Hampshire legislators oppose the mandate so vehemently they tried to correlate higher crime rates with towns that offer kindergarten). There’s still the question of whether repealing the state mandate would mean the elimination kindergarten for New Hampshire families. Not quite, history tells us. For decades, New Hampshire was the only state in the country that didn’t require schools to offer public kindergarten. Even so, 140 New Hampshire towns-- more than 90 percent of New Hampshire districts -- already offered free public kindergarten. Nashua, the second largest district in the state -- and where the Democrats’ flyer was mailed -- was one of the communities to offer kindergarten without being required to. "If the state were to repeal the kindergarten mandate I can tell you we would not be looking to eliminate that grade level," Nashua Superintendent Mark Conrad said. "I think it’s well-recognized as an essential part of the public school system throughout the United States." About a dozen districts, representing about 1,500 children, did not offer public kindergarten, until fall 2009, which is when the state officially required kindergarten to be part of an "adequate education." Those children either went to private kindergarten, to out-of-district schools or stayed home. If the mandate was lifted, so could the number of public kindergarten programs in the state. "I also think it would be fair to say, without the mandate, over time, you might find some communities dropping (kindergarten) as they’re pressed for costs that we're all facing in these tough economic times," Conrad added. Our ruling A dramatized New Hampshire Democratic Party flyer tries to make Lamontagne out as a kindergarten abolisher. Lamontagne acknowledges he opposed state-mandated public kindergarten -- and still doesn’t agree with it. But he has no plans to repeal it, which is a far cry from eliminating an entire school grade from public schools. To say repealing the law would "eliminate kindergarten" and put a generation of New Hampshire students "one year behind" is over the top. But doing so would likely impact the families who can’t afford to send their children to private or out-of-district schools for kindergarten. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13420	Says comprehensive immigration reform "will add $700 billion to our economy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-say-immigration-reform-will-add-70/	Hillary Clinton supports plans by President Barack Obama to defer deportation for millions of people in the country illegally, she said at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual gala Sept. 15. But there is more to do beyond defending the programs, the Democratic presidential nominee said, such as closing private detention facilities and stopping immigration raids and roundups. "No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning, not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home," Clinton said. "So here's the bottom line: Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy, and enable America to be what it's always been, a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation." We wondered, will an overhaul of the immigration system add $700 billion to the U.S. economy? What we found is that Clinton is citing a reputable estimate, but experts say she ignores the time frame of the economic impact and just what is producing the influx of new money. Clinton’s source Clinton’s campaign said the figure came from a November 2014 fact sheet from the White House on the economic benefits of immigration reform. "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that enacting the Senate immigration reform bill would increase real GDP relative to current law projections by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033 – an increase of roughly $700 billion and $1.4 trillion, respectively, in today’s dollars," the White House said. The CBO in 2013 estimated the economic impact of a version of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) -- commonly known as the "Gang of Eight" bill. The measure, written by four Democratic and four Republican senators, passed the Senate but died in the House. The CBO said calculating the economic impact of the legislation was tricky and questionable. Yet the report says S.744 "would boost economic output" and increase real (inflation-adjusted) GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033. It also projects a U.S. population increase of 10 million by 2023 and 16 million by 2033. Changes in direct spending and revenues would also decrease federal budget deficits by $197 billion from 2014 to 2023 and by nearly $700 billion from 2024 to 2033, the report said. Overall, CBO found that enacting the 2013 bill would: • Increase the size of the labor force (about 6 million in 2023 and 9 million in 2033) and employment • Decrease wages through 2024, but increase them in 2025 and later years • Slightly increase unemployment rate through 2020, but no effect on unemployment rate after 2020 • Raise labor productivity and capital (increase in high-skilled immigrants would lead to technological advancements, including new inventions and improvements in production processes) • Increase amount of capital investment (return on investment would be higher under the proposed legislation) • Result in higher interest rates (with a greater rate of earnings on investments, federal government "would face higher interest rates than under current law because it would be competing with the private sector for investors’ money) Caveats The biggest caveat with Clinton’s claim, experts say, is just where that new money would come from. George J. Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues and professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the $700 billion increase in GDP would be almost entirely captured by new immigrants migrating to America. "Practically all of that increase in GDP would need to be paid to the immigrants as wages and salaries. They are not going to work for free," Borjas said. What really matters, Borjas said, is the "immigration surplus" — which is the benefit accruing to the native-born population. About 98 percent of the increase in GDP due to immigration goes to immigrant salaries, and about 2 percent goes to natives already living in the United States, Borjas estimates. "Then the question becomes: who did Hillary refer to when she said ‘our economy’? I take it, in the context of a political speech, that means us — the current population of the United States that is voting in November," Borjas said. "I don’t think she meant the future immigrants who have yet to arrive. And, as a result, I would say the statement is false." On the flip side, immigration reform would allow people currently living in the United States illegally additional opportunities for advancement, said David Dyssegaard Kallick, a senior fellow and director of the Immigration Research Initiative at Fiscal Policy Institute. A pathway to citizenship would mean currently undocumented immigrants would have greater potential for advancement and result in more productive employees, Kallick said. "Making sure workers can’t be taken advantage of by employers wouldn’t hurt, either, pushing businesses to compete based on higher productivity rather than evasion of the law," he said. Lastly, any GDP increase would not be automatic. The CBO projected it would take 10 years to increase the GDP by $700 billion. And while $700 billion sounds like a lot, it would remain a tiny fraction of the country’s GDP, which today is nearing $18 trillion. Our ruling Clinton said immigration legislation "will add $700 billion to our economy." Clinton’s statement stems from 2013 estimates of the stalled "Gang of Eight" bill. But that bill couldn't pass, and there's no telling what a future version might look like or mean for the U.S. economy. A Congressional Budget Office report found that if the 2013 bill was enacted, gross domestic product would increase by 3.3 percent in 2023, or roughly $700 billion. Clinton omitted that timeframe in her statement. The report acknowledges that determining economic impact of immigration policies is complex and can be "uncertain." While immigration scholars say the $700 billion estimate is a reasonable estimate, some say increases in GDP would mostly go toward future immigrants, not the current population. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-10354	"McCain will give more tax breaks to big oil."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/10/barack-obama/big-oil-like-all-companies-would-get-tax-break/	A new TV ad from the Obama campaign called "New Energy" takes three swipes at John MCain. We've addressed two of them previously at PolitiFact: that McCain voted with President Bush 95 percent of the time; and that McCain's plan to open up offshore drilling wouldn't result in oil production for at least seven years. Here we will focus on an attack in the ad that has become a common jab in Obama's stump speeches: "McCain will give more tax breaks to big oil." If you read the small print at the bottom of the ad, it cites a March 27, 2008 report from the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The report is titled "The McCain Plan to Cut Oil Company Taxes by Nearly $4 Billion." Here's how the think tank - which is headed by former Clinton chief of staff John D. Podesta - arrived at its headline. McCain has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent to make U.S. corporations more competitive. Says the McCain campaign Web site: "John McCain believes the taxes we impose on American companies should be no higher than the average rate our major trading partners impose on theirs. We currently have the second-highest combined corporate-tax rate in the industrialized world, and it is driving many businesses and the jobs they create overseas." The Center for American Progress Action Fund grabbed the five largest U.S. oil companies from Fortune Magazine's list of the Fortune 50. Then they obtained financial statements for those five companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission and listed the reported current and deferred taxes paid in 2007 to the federal government for income earned from U.S. operations. Based on those figures, they calculated how much less those companies would pay if the corporate tax rate were dropped from 35 percent to 25 percent. The total savings to the five oil companies, $3.8 billion; $1.2 billion Exxon Mobil alone. Obama cited these same numbers in a speech on June 24th, 2008, in Las Vegas. "He's willing to spend nearly $4 billion on more tax breaks for big oil companies," Obama said, "including $1.2 billion for Exxon alone." Obama is cherry-picking here. The corporate tax rate reduction would apply to ALL corporations. Yes, Exxon Mobil, but also to Wal-Mart, General Motors and Home Depot, to name a few of the other Fortune 50 biggies. Even everybody's favorite, Starbucks, would get the same tax break. Obama's statement is technically true, but singling out oil companies suggests McCain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks. He hasn't. We rate Obama's statement, and the claim in the ad, Barely True. As for the other two claims in the ad: * "McCain and Bush support a drilling plan that won't produce a drop of oil for seven years." We addressed this before in PolitiFact, finding that most oil experts say if the U.S. pursued oil drilling in prohibited offshore areas, as McCain has proposed, it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant oil production. McCain has even acknowledged that fact himself, saying in a June 23 town hall meeting in Fresno, Ca., "Even though it may take some years, the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that I think is beneficial." * McCain has "voted with Bush 95 percent of the time." We've also dealt with this claim previously and concluded that it accurately reflects a 2007 "presidential support" score from Congressional Quarterly. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11153	"While Phil Bredesen was in the governor’s office, the number of Tennesseans on unemployment nearly doubled."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/29/tennessee-republican-party/tennessee-gop-slams-democrat-senate-race-jobs-over/	The U.S. Senate race in Tennessee is starting to heat up. Phil Bredesen, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, lofted an ad touting his accomplishments as governor. The Tennessee Republican Party fired back that on jobs, Bredesen’s track record wasn’t so rosy. "While Phil Bredesen was in the governor’s office, the number of Tennesseans on unemployment nearly doubled," the GOP posted on its website May 23. "He is backtracking to change his weak record, but Tennesseans won’t be fooled by misleading ads." The post included numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to back up the claim. When Bredesen became governor in January 2003, the state had about 149,000 unemployed people. When he left in January 2011, it had about 296,000. As the Republicans said, that’s about double. Before we get into the caveats, we should note that there’s a flaw in the Republican language. The post talked about "the number of Tennesseans on unemployment." That’s different from the number of unemployed people, because some might not have been eligible for unemployment benefits in the first place, and some might have seen their benefits run out. The state labor market reports track the number of new claims for unemployment each month, but not the total number of people getting benefits at a given point in time. As for the point about unemployment growth, the Republican post leaves out the enormous impact of the Great Recession. That wasn’t something under Bredesen’s control; it was a global economic collapse that struck every state and pretty much every nation worldwide. In the time Bredesen was in office, the national unemployment rate went from 5.8 percent to 9.1 percent. The rate in Tennessee went from 5.1 percent to 9.5 percent; worse than the national average, but the overall trend was the same. This chart shows shifts in the unemployment rate under Bredesen. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The GOP post also overlooks that before the recession, Bredesen oversaw a net increase in jobs. The state had 2.76 million jobs when he took office, and four years later in 2007, it had 2.94 million, a gain of about 180,000 jobs. Even as the automobile sales were falling in 2008, on Bredesen’s watch, Volkswagen committed to building a new plant outside Chattanooga, Tenn., a move that ultimately created 2,000 new jobs. Our ruling The Tennessee Republican Party challenged Bredesen’s track record on jobs, saying that the number of people on unemployment doubled during his time as governor. Government statistics show that the number of unemployed did rise by that amount. But the statement suffers from two flaws: It ignores the impact of the Great Recession which was beyond the control of Bredesen or any state leader. And it assumes that every unemployed person is getting unemployment benefits, which is not accurate. The numbers leave out important context. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02613	"The largest enterprise in the world is the federal government of the United States of America"	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/jan/24/mark-warner/warner-says-us-government-largest-entity-world/	No man-made entity is larger than the U.S. government, says Sen. Mark Warner. The Virginia Democrat made the claim last month during an interview on a radio show hosted by one of his colleagues, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. Warner was stressing his trademark theme: that Congress needs to take a more organized and long-range approach to budgeting instead of going from crisis to crisis. "I think if folks across America understood how crazy what we were doing in that the largest enterprise in the world is the federal government of the United States of America," he said. "The single largest subset of that is the Defense Department. When you run that large an enterprise on three- and six-month short-term funding resolutions, you actually cost the taxpayer more money that you save because you stop and start contracts, you’re not able to hire people for a long period of time...The amount kind of lost to the taxpayer as well as what it does to our military preparedness, for example, staying on defense, is a huge, huge issue." We wondered if the U.S. government really is the biggest show on earth. Warner spokesman Kevin Hall sent us links to the president’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2014, which ends in September, and to news articles listing the revenue and employee figures for large corporations. Let’s look at employees first. According to White House figures, Uncle Sam employed the equivalent of about 4.3 million full-time workers during the 2013 budget year, which ended Sept. 30. Of them, about 1.5 million are in the military and another 800,000 are civilian workers at the Department of Defense. For comparison, Warner’s office sent us a list of largest worldwide employers published in 2012 by the BBC. We searched on our own for a more current list, but couldn’t find one. Here are the largest employers, behind the U.S. government: China’s People’s Liberation Army, 2.3 million workers Walmart, 2.1 million McDonald’s, 1.9 million UK National Health Service, 1.7 million China National Petroleum Corporation, 1.6 million State Grid Corporation of China, 1.5 million Indian Railways, 1.4 million Indian Armed Forces, 1.3 million. There’s a problem with these figures, however. They don’t offer-to-apples comparison of central government employment in the United States to that in China, the world’s most populous country. Although the data give us an idea of the size of China’s military and its two largest state-owned companies, experts say there is no reliable data on how many people are employed in all sectors of the Chinese government. Two years ago, Liu Xirong, a member of the National People’s Congress in China, cited what he said were official figures showing his nation’s bureaucracy had grown from 6 million public servants in 2006 to 10 million in 2010, according to an article in News China. In response, the State Administration of Civil Service said China’s number of public servants stood at 6.89 million in 2010. These figures did not include state-owned enterprises and organizations, which would grow the number to more than 30 million, News China reported. Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies China’s economy, said it’s reasonable to include the employees of state-run corporations in the count. But even if you don’t, logic says China’s rolls of government workers would be longer than the United States’ roster of 4.3 million employees. "In the U.S., labor is expensive and we have substituted technology as shown by the large decline in clerical workers," he said. "In China, technology is expensive and workers are cheap. I do not know of any fully comparable data. I would be quite confident that on most comparisons, China's workforce would be larger, if for no other reason than the size of its army and security forces." In addition to number of employees, Warner’s office also told us it defines "largest enterprise" by the money an organization takes in and spends. We were pointed to the latest information in the CIA’s World Factbook. It shows the U.S. in 2012 -- with $2.5 trillion in revenues and $3.5 trillion in expenses -- topped all nations in both categories. China, by comparison, collected $1.9 trillion in and spent $2 trillion. Those figures don’t include revenues for China’s state-run corporations which, if added up, would easily exceed the U.S. government’s cash flow. The United States’ budget figures dwarf the finances of the largest corporations in the world. According to CNNMoney’s list, Royal Dutch Shell had the largest revenues last year -- $482 billion. It was followed by WalMart, $469 billion; Exxon Mobil, $450 billion; Sinopec Group, $428 billion; and China National Petroleum, $409 billion. Our ruling Warner said the U.S government is the largest enterprise in the world. His staff said the statement was based on the federal government’s employment and budget. The claim runs aground in China. Warner’s office cites statistics that compare the employment of the U.S. government to parts of the Chinese government, but not the whole. China has issued conflicting numbers on its total number of civil servants, but they all greatly exceed the number of workers paid by the U.S. government. Warner is on better footing on the budgeting side of his claim. A variety of widely used statistics shows no government or corporation raises and spends more money than the U.S. So Warner is wrong on one of measurements and right on the other. We’ll split the difference and rate his statement Half True.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2014-01-24T00:00:00	2013-12-16	['United_States']
pomt-05123	Says GOP U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin "voted twice to end Medicare."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/25/pat-kreitlow/dem-challenger-gop-us-rep-sean-duffy-wisconsin-say/	How preoccupied were Wisconsin political types with the state's gubernatorial recall election? On June 6, 2012, the day after the vote, Democrat Pat Kreitlow used Republican Gov. Scott Walker's victory to whack first-term U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis. Kreitlow, a former state senator and TV anchor, is seeking to oust the former district attorney and MTV reality show star in the November 2012 election. Here's the first paragraph of a two-paragraph news release that Kreitlow issued about Walker's defeat of Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett: "Governor Walker's margin of victory shows that there are still well over a million Wisconsin residents who believe our leaders should represent regular Wisconsinites and not corporate special interests. Unfortunately, Congressman Sean Duffy does not abide by this belief and voted twice to end Medicare and make seniors pay thousands more for their health care, all to give more tax breaks to multimillionaires and corporations who ship our jobs overseas." Hmmm. Duffy, who represents a northwestern Wisconsin district, voted twice to end Medicare, the federal program that pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65? Deja vu Where have we heard before that Republicans voted end Medicare? Oh, yeah. That was PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year for 2011. Wisconsin Democrats were well represented among those making end-Medicare-related claims, with former state representative Sandy Pasch and state legislative candidate Shelly Moore each earning a Pants on Fire. PolitiFact National pointed out that the target of the Democrats' attacks -- a budget plan advanced by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- would not affect people currently in Medicare, or even people 55 to 65 who would join the program in the next 10 years. Our colleagues also noted that in 2011, the University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org concluded that Medicare would remain an entitlement, though more costly to future beneficiaries. And The Washington Post’s Fact Checker said that while there’s "a worthwhile debate" about whether Ryan’s proposal should be adopted, "it is not true to claim Republicans are trying to ‘kill’ Medicare." That makes three fact checkers knocking down the claim that Republicans voted to end Medicare. Nevertheless, now comes Kreitlow. Kreitlow's case The evidence to back his claim are Duffy's votes in April 2011 and March 2012 for Ryan's budget proposals, said Kreitlow campaign manager Jocelyn Steinberg. The proposals would replace Medicare with a voucher, she claimed. Steinberg cited statements in eight news or opinion articles, including some that vehemently disagreed with PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year selection. Among them: Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman claimed Ryan's 2011 plan "ends Medicare and leaves seniors with a voucher and no guarantee they can afford health care costs that would double." The Economist magazine opined that the plan "ends the guarantee that all American seniors will have health insurance." And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said "most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system." There's no question Ryan's 2011 and 2012 budgets, neither of which were adopted, would have dramatically changed Medicare; indeed PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a claim that his plan would privatize Medicare. As our colleagues noted in that item: "Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, although they would receive "premium support" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money." The point is, Medicare would change -- significantly -- under the proposals Duffy supported. But it would still exist. Asked to respond to Kreitlow's claim, Duffy campaign manager Justin Richards simply noted PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year selection. Our rating Kreitlow said Duffy "voted twice to end Medicare." But under the proposals Duffy voted for, a revamped Medicare would remain. At this stage, Kreitlow’s statement is false and ridiculous -- Pants on Fire.	None	Pat Kreitlow	None	None	None	2012-06-25T09:00:00	2012-06-06	['United_States', 'Wisconsin', 'Sean_Duffy']
pomt-12687	"Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/14/rosemary-laird/do-half-million-people-florida-have-alzheimers-dis/	A Florida physician who specializes in geriatrics and memory care warned a Florida Senate committee that Alzheimer’s disease is both a present and a looming problem for the state. "Please make no mistake -- we are in the midst of an epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease," Rosemary Laird, a geriatrician at the Centre for Senior Health in Winter Park, told the Senate Health Policy Committee on March 14. "Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness." Laird was testifying in favor of SB 1050, a bill sponsored by Sen. David Simmons, R-Longwood, to establish a memory disorder clinic at Florida Hospital in Orange County. Laird’s office did not return a call, but we were able to find statistics that closely matched what she told the committee. They were cited in "2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures," a report by the Alzheimer’s Association, the leading advocacy group for patients with the severe memory-loss condition and their families and caregivers. The report, in Table 4, offers projections for state-by-state numbers of residents with Alzheimer’s in 2017 and 2025. For Florida, it lists 520,000 people with the disease in 2017 and 720,000 for 2025, a growth rate of 38.5 percent. Rounded off, those are essentially identical to the figures Laird cited. However, it’s worth noting that the table cites these figures as "estimates" (for 2017) and "projected" (for 2025). The numbers in the report are footnoted to a study published in the academic journal Neurology in May 2013. The authors used Alzheimer’s diagnosis statistics from 2010 to create estimates of how many cases would be expected in future years as far out as 2050. Given the margins of error in estimates and projections, and given the difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease in patients, it’s a slight overreach for Laird to frame these as hard numbers of Floridians who have the disease today. They are a useful yardstick and were published in a respected scientific journal, but her phrasing suggests too high a degree of certainty about the numbers who have the disease today. "It is accurate to say that the numbers are estimates, or as we put it in the report, ‘projections,’ " said Laura Cilmi, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer’s Association. Our ruling Laird said, "Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness." These numbers are sourced to a credible scientific paper, though it’s worth noting that the paper deals in estimates and projections, rather than hard, verifiable numbers.

pomt-14529	Says she will "work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it’s ever been — $12 an hour in today’s dollars."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-wants-return-real-minimum/	Calls to raise the minimum wage -- something that hasn’t been done in seven years -- are a staple of many Democratic campaigns. Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid is no exception. In a Feb. 12 Medium post, Clinton wrote, "As president, I will work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it’s ever been  —  $12 an hour in today’s dollars  —  and support state and local efforts to go even further." Here we’re checking if Clinton’s proposal to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour would bring the minimum wage "back to the highest level it’s ever been." We began by looking at the history of the inflation-adjusted minimum wage and found that the highest-ever inflation-adjusted value was $10.69 an hour in February 1968. The second-highest was $9.69 an hour in February 1967. You can see the data here and in the following graph. So Clinton’s $12 minimum wage actually would go beyond restoring, or bringing back, the minimum wage to its highest level ever. It would be $1.31 an hour higher in purchasing power than the previous record -- or 12 percent higher. What’s going on? When we asked the Clinton campaign for an explanation, they pointed to a paper by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This paper looked at how the minimum wage compared to the median wage at the time. According to the paper, in 1968, the minimum wage was about half as high as the median wage at the time -- 52.1 percent. By 2014, that had fallen to 37.1 percent, meaning that wages overall had risen while the minimum wage failed to keep up. Looking ahead to a proposed $12 minimum wage, the paper estimated that raising the minimum wage that high would bring the ratio back up to between 49.9 percent and 54.1 percent, or roughly what it was in 1968. And it found similar results when using a different benchmark -- the average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory production workers. Economists we checked with thought this was a credible standard for Clinton to use, and using this statistic supports her overall point. Indeed, Clinton would have been correct if she’d said she would work to raise the federal minimum wage back to where it was in comparison to the median wage at its historical record. But outside the economics department lounge, that’s a much bigger mouthful than saying she’d bring the minimum wage "back to the highest level it’s ever been — $12 an hour in today’s dollars." The problem for Clinton’s streamlined phrasing is that it oversimplifies in a way that could give readers a misleading impression. The term "today’s dollars" usually means "inflation-adjusted," and using the inflation-adjusted minimum wage, she’s wrong that a $12 minimum wage has historical precedent. Our ruling Clinton said she will "work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it’s ever been — $12 an hour in today’s dollars." The minimum wage has never previously been "$12 an hour in today’s dollars" -- it’s gone as high as $10.69 an hour. However, Clinton has a point using other economic data. The data suggests that a $12 minimum wage would be similar to the 1968 wage when compared to median wages at the time. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-02-17T14:27:33	2016-02-12	['None']

pomt-06734	"We spend less on defense today as % of GDP than at any time since Pearl Harbor."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/29/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-defense-spending-historic-low/	In case you missed it, there’s been a lot of talk recently about spending cuts in Washington, D.C. Led largely by conservative Republicans, Congress curtailed future spending by more than $3 trillion earlier this month. But there’s one element of the federal budget that some conservatives are reluctant to curtail -- money for guns, fighters, tanks and missiles. A few Republican presidential candidates are even calling for increased military spending as they rally the base in anticipation of next year’s primaries. For example, Newt Gingrich, Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. House speaker, last month tweeted: "We spend less on defense today as % of GDP than at any time since Pearl Harbor." In 1941 the country was unprepared to fight the Axis powers, but today, with thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, cruise missiles raining down on Libya and predator drones circling terrorist enclaves across the globe, is our investment in defense really comparable to the days preceding the Japanese sneak attack? Gingrich and his staff did not return calls seeking clarification of his tweet. Benjamin Friedman, a defense research fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said this lack of response is predictable. Friedman said politicians and other policy wonks sometimes use the percentage of gross domestic product, which refers to the value of all goods and services produced in the country, spent on defense as a talking point to support spending billions more on military gear. But he said the statement is so "indefensibly false" they typically will not engage in a discussion about the concept. "They’re not lying, they’re just being deliberately obtuse and misleading," he said. The actual numbers don’t help Gingrich. The United States spent 4.8 percent of its GDP on defense in 2010, according to statistics from the Office of Management and Budget. Defense spending was smaller than 4.8 percent of the GDP from 2009 back through 1991, 1979, 1978 and 1948. "It’s wrong for every year since the end of the Cold War and other years besides," Friedman said. So Gingrich is flat out wrong on his statement, but maybe the facts were erroneous -- grossly erroneous, true -- but the general idea that we spend less is still spot on? Gingrich is wrong there, too, said Gordon Adams, a former senior White House national security budget official for President Bill Clinton. "Beyond the point of him being factually incorrect, it’s an irrelevant measure," Adams said. "The GDP is a completely red herring argument. It doesn’t tell you how much you’re spending in real dollars or what you’re getting." Adams and Friedman both point out the GDP is growing and therefore tying defense spending to the GDP would suggest military spending would have to increase every year. "It’s kind of crazy to say you should have a fixed percentage of your wealth to spend on defense because your enemies and circumstances in the world change," Friedman said. A better way to compare defense spending, or any kind of government spending over a long period of time, is to use dollars adjusted for inflation, Adams said. The United States spent $700 billion on defense in 2010, $300 billion more than the adjusted Cold War average, Adams said. Winslow Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project, said defense spending also does not include funding for other agencies that contribute to national defense such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State Department. "It’s a distorted way to think of it for the sole purpose to pimp for more money," Wheeler said. Gingrich tweeted that the country now spends less on defense as a percentage of the GDP than at any time since the start of World War II. That’s a firm statement, but since the Cold War ended, and in a few other years as well, the percent of GDP used for defense has been consistently lower than current spending levels. Further, experts say the concept is highly misleading. Gingrich gets our lowest rating on this one.

pomt-09703	The GOP health care plan "would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a pre-existing medical condition."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/05/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-says-gop-alternative-health-care/	The GOP's alternative health care plan hadn't even hit the streets before the Democratic push-back began. The day before the plan was officially unveiled, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., took aim at the way the GOP plan was described by media outlets that had gotten early, leaked versions of it. In a press release from the Democratic National Committee, Vice Chair Wasserman Schultz said the GOP plan, "would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a pre-existing medical condition." Requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions has been a popular element of the Democratic plan. Now that we've seen the full 219-page GOP alternative plan, it shows Wasserman Schultz is correct that it does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people due to pre-existing medical conditions. But to listen to her, one might get the impression the Republicans have completely ignored the issue of pre-existing conditions. And they haven't. They have a different idea that they think will get at the problem. More than 10 pages of the GOP bill spell out a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions by allowing universal access to expanded and improved state-run high-risk pools. They accept patients who have health conditions that might prompt private insurance companies to reject them. Already, 34 states have high-risk insurance pools. "We want to encourage all states to have these," said House Republican Leader John Boehner. "And we put more money into these high-risk pools so that we can bring down the cost of health insurance. And at the end of the day, what we're doing with our proposal is lowering health care insurance premiums — lowering cost and expanding access." The Republican plan calls for $25 billion in funding through 2019 to subsidize state high risk pool and reinsurance programs. In an MSNBC interview on Nov. 4, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said the cost of bolstering state funds and insurance programs to cover people with pre-existing conditions would be offset by savings from medical malpractice reforms that he said would "rein in some of these runaway massive lawsuits that drive defensive medicine and drive up the cost of premiums." Democrats counter that high-risk insurance pools have done little to solve the problems faced by people with pre-existing medical conditions. Premiums in those pools are usually far more expensive than in your average health insurance plan, and therefore remain out of reach for many moderate to low-income people with pre-existing conditions. The Republican plan tries to address that by requiring that the pool "must limit the pool premiums to no more than 150 percent of the average premium for applicable standard risk rates in that state." In other words, it might cost people with pre-existing conditions 50 percent more than average premiums paid by healthy people. But a study shows that might make the price too high. A February 2005 study by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund found that in states with high-risk pools, the rates were typically 25 percent to 50 percent higher than average rates. People with lower incomes just couldn't afford to buy into the state pools. As a result, they found, high-risk pool subsidies tended to go to a small number of relatively high-income people, those who could afford premiums well above market rates. The GOP plan for dealing with the issue of people with pre-existing conditions "is essentially the same as now, and now is not working," said Jonathan Beeton, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz. Wasserman Schultz was correct when she said the GOP plan does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. We found nothing in the 219-page Republican plan that would do that. Insurance companies have argued that they can only absorb the cost of taking people with pre-existing conditions if they could offset that expense by expanding their customer base through mandates that everyone buy insurance. And the Republican plan doesn't do that. Still, we think Wasserman Schultz's comments imply that Republicans have simply ignored the issue of pre-existing conditions altogether. They have not. They have taken a different tack from the Democrats. And Democrats may not agree that dealing with the issue through state-run high-risk pools is an adequate plan, but it is a plan. And so we rule Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2009-11-05T13:31:53	2009-11-03	['None']

pomt-06038	Says Rick Perry cut taxes.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/13/craig-james/craig-james-republican-senate-candidate-says-rick-/	CORRECTION, 4:45 p.m. Jan. 17, 2012: This fact check originally presented per-capita state and local sales tax collections for 2000 and 2010 attributed to information from the U.S. Census Bureau. But, as a reader helpfully pointed out, those figures solely reflected state taxes. This article has been revised accordingly. The changes do not affect the rating of the statement. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Craig James, a former ESPN football analyst, saluted Gov. Rick Perry in an online video posted Jan. 3, 2012, saying Perry "changed Texas--cut waste, reduced taxes, put people back to work. And that’s just what I’ll do in Washington." We’re not sure how to gauge how Perry cut waste or personally put people to work. But it’s possible to gauge if he reduced taxes. Caveat: Per-person tax collections go up and down partly due to changes in state tax policy, though they’re also affected by population growth and the economy. Another vantage point: Each resident’s taxes change depending on personal circumstances -- a job change, a move, the purchase or sale of a house. Until a few years ago, the U.S Census Bureau calculated per-capita state and local taxes collected. In 2000, the year that Perry became governor, state government collected $1,315 per person, a rate that was the 49th lowest among the states. That would have been $1,665 in 2010 dollars, according to our calculation using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. In 2010, state government in Texas collected $1,567 per person; we reached this figure by dividing the bureau’s tabulation of Texas state taxes collected that year, nearly $39.4 billion, by the state’s April 2010 population of 25.1 million. So, those collections ran about $100 less per person than the inflation-adjusted amount collected in 2000. There are other calculations. Per-person state tax collections were slightly higher in 2007 than in 2001, according to information published by the advisory Legislative Budget Board. In 2001, Perry’s first full year as governor, the state reaped nearly $1,377 in tax revenue per resident. In 2007, according to the board’s latest Fiscal Size-Up publication, the state gathered nearly $1,691 per resident, which was equivalent to $1,444 in 2001 dollars, according to our check on the BLS calculator. So, that suggests a $67 per person increase in state taxes. However, experts cautioned us against reaching sweeping conclusions about Perry and taxes based on measures of total tax collections. The reality is he’s signed both tax hikes and cuts into law. Neither the state sales or gas tax -- two major revenue generators -- has been hiked during Perry’s governorship. But in 2006, he approved a package of changes including a $1-a-pack cigarette tax hike, modification in how the state taxes used-car purchases and an overhaul of the state’s business franchise tax, all toward covering a mandated one-third reduction in local school property tax rates. Separately over the years, as we noted in a November 2010 fact check, Perry signed into law higher taxes on smokeless tobacco, fireworks and the purchase or rental of diesel equipment. He also has agreed to fee increases, which some liken to tax bumps. Perry has said the 2006 increases shouldn't be counted against him because the cuts in property taxes set in motion by lawmakers were bigger. Told by the Texas Tribune in 2010 that some people consider the franchise tax change to be an increase, Perry replied: "That was a net tax decrease." An August 2008 analysis of the 2006 changes by the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association says that while some taxes clearly were raised, those increases were dwarfed by nearly $7 billion for 2007 in legislated property tax cuts. That’s not to say, though, that taxes went down -- only that they did not continue escalating as they would have under previous law, the association said. If lawmakers had not acted, its analysis says, taxpayers would have seen an estimated $4.7 billion tax increase to fund school maintenance and operations between 2005 and 2007. Instead, the average Texan’s total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been without the legislative action, the analysis says. The analysis says many Texans were still paying higher property taxes in 2007 than they did in 2005, before the tax changes, for several reasons: --Almost all school districts exercised their authority to increase tax rates above the state-mandated one-third reduction; --Local voters approved additional taxes to pay for debt service for facilities, which went up 37 percent from 2005 to 2007; --Residential property values accelerated; --And city, county and special district property taxes continued to increase. These factors combined produced a total property tax bill for Texans that was $1.7 billion higher than came due in 2005, the analysis says. It closes: "Even so, there is no doubt the actions taken in 2006 have saved Texans an estimated $7 billion a year in property taxes. The average Texan’s property tax bill may not be lower than it was two years ago, but it is unmistakably much, much lower than it would have been." By email, the group’s president, Dale Craymer, recently told us that Perry reduced taxes overall. "The 2006 package raised the franchise and cigarette taxes, but for each dollar raised the property tax was lowered by more than $3," Craymer said, "so the package clearly nets out as a sizable tax cut (overall, probably the biggest tax cut in history)." In 2011, he added, the state cost of school property tax relief as required by the 2006 law amounts to about $7 billion -- with the state tax changes from 2006 generating $2.2 billion of that, he said. That is, the local property tax load was lightened considerably more than state taxes were up. By email, Dick Lavine, a tax expert for the Austin-based, liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, agreed school taxes were cut, though, Lavine said, lawmakers also left a multibillion-dollar gap between available revenue and "necessary" state expenditures, or "structural deficit," that must be addressed each legislative session. Eva DeLuna Castro, the center’s senior budget analyst, separately pointed out that total collected state and local taxes, including property taxes, annually increased all but one year from 2006 through 2010. The year-to-year increase from 2008 to 2009 was only $300 million, while from 2009 to 2010, such collections dropped $1.7 billion to $81 billion, a decrease DeLuna attributed to the national recession. "Sorry, I’m going to give all of you a Pants on Fire," Castro said by email. "Taxes have not been reduced. At best, (Perry) ‘bent the curve?’" In an interview, Will Newton, executive director of the Texas chaper of the National Federation of Independent Business, pointed out that Perry also signed into law changes that increased the number of businesses exempted from the revised franchise tax. The 2006 law excused businesses with total revenues of $300,000 or less. A few years later, Perry agreed to exempt businesses with total revenue of $1 million or less. "That’s a really big thing for smaller businesses," Newton said. In another fact check, we looked at another way of gauging Texas taxes under Perry. The non-partisan Tax Foundation, based in Washington, annually estimates how much residents of each state cough up for state and local taxes. In 2000, Texans were taxed at an effective rate of 7.1 percent, meaning 7.1 cents of every dollar in income went to state and local taxes. That year, the foundation says, each resident paid about $2,214, on average. In 2009, the latest year checked, Texans paid an effective rate of 7.9 percent; the per-person amount of state and local taxes paid was $3,197-- up 44 percent from 2000, or 17 percent adjusted for inflation. As noted in a July 17, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article, the 7.9 percent compared with the national average of 9.8 percent and only five states (Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming) had lower state-local tax burdens than Texas. Our ruling Perry put in motion major tax hikes generating less revenue than state-ordered reductions in local school property taxes the governor also signed into law. However, it’s overly simplistic to say that Perry simply reduced taxes. He cut some, raised others. This statement rates Half True.

pomt-10149	"We're building a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline, which is North America's largest and most expensive infrastructure project ever."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/03/sarah-palin/palin-exaggerates-status-cost-of-pipeline/	In the vice presidential debate, Gov. Sarah Palin repeated claims she has made from time to time about a plan to build a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. After arguing the wisdom of the chant, "Drill, baby, drill" — heard frequently at McCain-Palin rallies — she followed up with this: "Even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas. And we're building a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline — which is North America's largest and most expensive infrastructure project ever — to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets." It certainly would be something to boast about if Alaska had started building a natural gas pipeline under Palin. The state has been trying to get a pipeline built from its natural gas-rich North Slope for some three decades. But her claim is premature. We've scrutinized her claims on the pipeline before (see our review of her claim about the cost here and a look at the status of the project here ) and found them less than accurate. Palin did spearhead a plan under which TransCanada Corp., a Canadian company, will get $500-million in state funds to design and seek approvals for the pipeline. But they are not obligated to build it. Financing and approvals are far from certain, and the company can back out even if those contingencies come through. TransCanada does not anticipate construction beginning until at least 2015, and several experts we spoke to were skeptical that the company's plan would come to fruition. "I'll believe it when I see it," said Sarah Ladislaw, a fellow specializing in Western Hemispheric energy issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Palin has repeatedly mischaracterized the agreement with TransCanada. In a news conference in Alaska on Aug. 1, 2008, she said the state never before had "commitments to build this line. Now we do." In its news story the next day, the Anchorage Daily News wrote: "That's incorrect. TransCanada has not promised to actually build the gas line, one of the state's grandest and most frustrated economic development dreams." Now what about Palin's claim that the pipeline would cost "nearly $40-billion"? We're not sure where she got that figure — neither her office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign has ever returned our calls to tell us. TransCanada estimates the cost at $26-billion. Yes, there could be cost overruns. But experts were skeptical the price could reach Palin's estimate. Palin was certainly wrong that the pipeline would be the "most expensive infrastructure project ever." What we suspect she meant to say — and has said repeatedly in the past — is that it would be the most expensive privately funded infrastructure project ever. But she's probably wrong on that count, too. We talked to several experts in pipelines and large-scale engineering projects, who said the only private infrastructure project on the scale of Palin's proposed pipeline was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, an oil pipeline also from the North Slope that is often referred to as the Alaska Pipeline. The Alaska Pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of $8-billion. In 2007 dollars that would be just over $27-billion, edging out Palin's proposed natural gas pipeline. While there are plans on the drawing board to build a pipeline, and Palin moved them forward in certain respects as governor, her claim in the debate suggests construction is underway, when that's not true. And she overstated the estimated cost of the project. We find her claim to be False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-10-03T00:00:00	2008-10-02	['None']

Once such attempt, with headlines such as "Soros Provides Migrants With Prepaid Debit Cards To Fund Illegal Journeys," was posted on News Punch Nov. 5. But the story doesn't talk about the Honduran migrants. Instead, it says that Soros has been helping out migrants coming to Europe from Syria and other countries. "The European migrant crisis is being fueled by free cash handouts from the United Nations, European Union and George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, according to bombshell information from Europe which suggests the UN, EU and Soros are luring illegal migrants to the continent with money," News Punch says. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The "bombshell information" link sends readers to a Slovenian website called nova24tv.si and an Oct. 30 story expresses alarm over Muslim migrants coming into Europe. It questions where the migrants are getting their money and focuses on prepaid debit cards that carry the MasterCard logo and have been given to migrants. The Nova24TV story says they are paid for by the U.N.'s World Food Program. But there's no mention of Soros as a source of the cards. Instead, the Nova24TV story asks, "Does the EU, directly with taxpayers' money, finance the violence that the Islamic invasion brings with it to European countries?" The blue cards carry the logo of The UN Refugee Agency and a case study evaluating how well the card was helping refugees, found on the ReliefWeb.int website, doesn't mention Soros or a Soros organization. So why is Soros being pegged with providing these cards? Nearly two years ago, Soros and Mastercard announced "plans to explore creating a social enterprise to apply commercial strategies to deliver a positive impact on society. Called Humanity Ventures, the enterprise could catalyze and accelerate economic and social development for vulnerable communities around the world, especially refugees and migrants." The Jan. 19, 2017 news release isn't specific about what programs Soros' Humanity Ventures would try, but the bloggers are making the connection without offering any evidence. In fact, it's clear from the "bombshell" source News Punch is citing that by time the Soros-Mastercard agreement was announced, the UN Refugee Agency prepaid debit cards had been around for at least four years. The Nova24TV story says that a Mastercard website was reporting that 300,000 people in places like Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt had received the cards by the end of 2013 and Mastercard "wanted to distribute 2.5 million such cards to be used in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey" by the end of 2014. The website Inside Philanthropy reported shortly after the announcement that Humanity Ventures, a for-profit organization, "plans to combine existing global health and development solutions to expand access to healthcare and education, as well as to improve local economic development and entrepreneurship. An additional goal of the organization is to improve the delivery of humanitarian aid." So has the Soros initiative included adding money to some of those prepaid Mastercards to migrants in Europe? Soros spokesman Michael Vachon said in an email the claim is false. MasterCard and the philanthropist "have been in discussions about joint investment opportunities," he said. "None has reached fruition so far." Without that connection, this debit card claim is overdrawn. We rate it False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-11-13T13:56:29	2018-11-05	['None']

pomt-04059	We have the fourth highest in-state tuition for public universities in the country.	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/jan/25/maggie-hassan/new-governor-claims-new-hampshire-college-costs-ar/	New Hampshire officials usually like to see the state’s colleges and universities climb the national rankings. But there’s at least one ranking New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan would like to avoid. Minutes after Hassan was sworn in as New Hampshire’s 81st governor, she took state legislators and university administrators to task for high tuition costs, which do little but chase students out of state, she said. "Our population is aging, yet we pursue policies that are driving our young people out of the state," Hassan said during her Jan 3. inauguration speech. "We have the fourth highest in-state tuition for public universities in the country, and too many of our talented students pursue a college education elsewhere." In New Hampshire, as in the rest of the country, tuition costs have risen dramatically in recent years. But are they really among the nation’s highest? We decided to do the homework. To start, here’s a quick overview of the New Hampshire university system. In total, the state houses four public, four-year schools -- the University of New Hampshire, Keene State College, Plymouth State University and Granite State College. Together, the schools served 35,200 students in 2012 at 14 campuses across the state, according to the University System of New Hampshire’s 2012 Annual Report. Tuition varies at each school, and often at each campus. So, we approached Hassan’s office to determine which she referred to. As expected, Hassan’s representatives pointed us to the system’s flagship school,UNH, which is by far the state’s largest school. For the 2012-13 school year, UNH administrators are charging $16,422 per year for state residents on the Durham campus, according to the University website. Officials at the U.S. Department of Education, which tracks tuition costs through its College Affordability and Transparency Center, have not yet analyzed the 2012 data to determine the most costly schools. But this summer they did release rankings based on 2010-11 data, and, according to their findings, UNH did charge one of the nation’s highest in-state tuition. That year, the school charged $13,672 for in-state students. That rate, which includes some required fees, trailed only Pennsylvania State University’s University Park campus ($15,250), the University of Pittsburgh ($14,936) and the University of Vermont ($14,066). Considering room and board, among other costs, UNH’s average net price jumped to $17,234 for in-state students. That figure, which considers the average amount of state and federal grants and scholarships, was good for 18th highest among public universities in 2010-11, according to the federal data. But, for this piece, we’re concerned with tuition rates, not total costs. New Hampshire’s other schools rated as more affordable. Neither Keene State College ($10,140 tuition for in-state students), Plymouth State University ($9,906) or Granite State College ($6,435) ranked among the 30 most expensive traditional, four-year schools. In her claim, however, Hassan didn’t specify four-year schools. So, we expanded our research to include community colleges and other public, two-year schools. Even then, UNH still ranked fifth nationally for highest tuition. Only the Michigan Career and Technical Institute ($16,200) placed above it. (As a side note, all seven of New Hampshire’s community colleges ranked among the top 12 most expensive two-year schools in 2010-11, ranging from $6,432 to $7,123 for in-state tuition.) Costs at most of the schools have moved since the 2010-11 ratings. Last year, as New Hampshire legislators cut state funding by a record 49 percent, UNH officials raised in-state tuition more than 11 percent to $15,250, which pushed it past the University of Vermont on the list of most expensive schools. And this year, tuition rose again, this time reaching $16,422, according to university records. Looking forward, administrators have pledged to freeze tuition costs if state lawmakers agree to restore the funding cuts from previous years. "We work continuously to reduce costs and increase non-tuition revenue streams," Erika Mantz, a university spokeswoman, said this week. "These accomplishments aside, we know there is still a lot of work to be done. Access and affordability remain central priorities." Our ruling Data for the 2011-12 or 2012-13 school years isn’t available yet. But, according to the U.S. Department of Education, which compares tuition rates across the country, the University of New Hampshire was one of the nation’s most expensive schools in 2010-11 for in-state students. The state’s other public schools -- Granite State College, Keene State College and Plymouth State University -- didn’t make the national list. But UNH’s $13,672 tuition placed fourth at the time, trailing only Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Vermont. We rate the claim True.

pomt-00240	Says Andrew Gillum has presided over "the highest crime in Florida four years running."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/08/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-says-tallahassee-mayor-andrew-gillum-/	Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum wants a promotion to the governor’s office. But Republican rival Ron DeSantis says the state would be in trouble if that happened based on Gillum’s track record with crime in the capital city. "This is a guy that is presiding over the highest crime in Florida four years running," DeSantis said on CBS4 Jim DeFede’s show Sept. 23. One week later on DeFede’s show, Gillum boasted about a drop in crime. "I'm the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate and we accomplished that by having fewer arrests at the same time," Gillum said. We decided to fact-check both candidates who are running for governor. We found that both DeSantis and Gillum point to valid statistics, but they are cherry-picked. Here, we will fact-check the statement by DeSantis that Gillum has presided over the highest crime in Florida four years running. FBI data on Leon County crime rate Leon County and the city of Tallahassee have been in the limelight for crime in recent years. Experts generally focus on crime rates per 100,000 residents rather than sheer numbers of crimes. Crime rate data submitted by law enforcement to the FBI shows that there were 4,802 crimes per 100,000 residents in Leon County in 2017. The data includes violent offenses such as murder and rape and property offenses such as theft. In 2017, Leon County had the highest crime rate of all Florida counties. Leon County’s crime rate was the highest in Florida in 2014, 2015 and 2016, too. While Leon County is a broader area than just the city of Tallahassee, the Tallahassee Police Department handles the bulk of the county’s crime. Gillum’s former chief of staff, who is now running for mayor, has also made statements about the high crime rate and "the highest number of murders in history last year." There were 17 murders in 2017 compared to 11 the year before. The Gillum campaign, however, has said the crime stats actually have good news, too: The county crime rate overall dropped between 2016 and 2017 by 15 percent. The statistics based on crimes reported only by the Tallahassee Police Department showed a similar decrease. And the downward trend has continued for the first half of 2018. The Tallahassee Police Department ranks 28th in the crime rate when examining all cities and counties in 2017. However, a comparison of all departments isn’t particularly useful because that combines tiny towns and large counties. Tallahassee’s population is about 190,000. When looking at cities with a population of at least 90,000, Tallahassee’s rate in 2017 was lower than Miami Beach, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale — all cities with a high number of visitors or workers who may not live in the city. While DeSantis didn’t single out any type of crime, the data shows that the majority of the crimes reported by the Tallahassee police department were larcencies. That includes anything from shoplifting to breaking into a car and stealing a briefcase, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said. Limitations of crime rate data The American Society of Criminology and FBI caution about the pitfalls of using crime statistics to rank communities. Such rankings ignore local characteristics that influence crime, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population. Tallahassee is a college town -- home to Florida State University and Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University -- as well as the state government. A city mayor has relatively little control over the characteristics most often identified as the strongest predictors of local crime rates such as poverty and the age of residents, said Brian Stults, an associate criminology professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee. The mayor may have some control over the size of the police department, but studies are inconsistent about whether increases in police size and funding lead to decreases in crime, Stults said. The more important factor is not how many police you have, but how they police. A city spokeswoman said Tallahassee has hired a few dozen more police officers during Gillum’s tenure as mayor, growing the force by about 11 percent. Understanding the crime rate requires a look at the specific characteristics of Tallahassee. The city has a large number of visitors who do not live year-round in the city, including students, lobbyists, politicians and other people who work in the capital city but may live in other cities. That means that crimes committed against — or by — students or commuters who work in the capital city are included in the count of Tallahassee’s crimes, but many of them are not counted in the residential population of the city. Mayors, and police chiefs, can influence the strategies the police department uses, but the results that flow from these strategies take time, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a police officer in Bartow, Fla., in the 1970s. Experts caution against giving politicians credit or blame for declines or increases in crime, which are more likely a function of social changes in the community or economy than political actions. Our ruling DeSantis said Gillum has presided over "the highest crime in Florida four years running." DeSantis was referring to the crime rate in Leon County, in which Tallahassee represents most cases. Data shows that Leon County had the highest crime rate in Florida in recent years. DeSantis omits that the county’s crime rate in 2017 declined from 2016. A few cities had higher crime rates, but like Tallahassee, they draw a lot of visitors who aren’t included in the residential population. Experts and the FBI caution against using the statistics to compare jurisdictions because it fails to take into account unique characteristics, such as a high college student population or visitors.

pomt-12767	"Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/feb/23/steve-adler/steve-adler-says-authorities-43-states-turned-down/	Austin Mayor Steve Adler says Travis County’s sheriff isn’t out of line by not automatically honoring federal requests that specific suspects be held 48 hours so immigration authorities can step in. Adler’s February 2017 open letter to residents objects to U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement officers arresting Austin-area residents suspected of living in the country without legal authorization.The letter further says that "participating in a voluntary, warrantless ‘detainer’ program, which is not required by law, will make our community less safe because it jeopardizes community trust." "In fact, and you wouldn’t know it from the debate here locally, local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015," Adler's letter says. "Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states," Adler wrote. We wondered about those figures. Have detainer requests been turned down almost everywhere? Mayor’s backup Adler was piping up in defense of the county’s new sheriff, Sally Hernandez, a Democrat who announced in January 2017 that as of the next month, her department would agree to hold an inmate in response to an ICE detainer request only if she or he were charged with murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking — or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant. Otherwise, inmates would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Through the first eight days of implementation, we later determined, 45 individuals for whom detainer requests were denied were released by the county--with about 150 inmates whose detainer requests were refused remaining behind bars, in some cases unable to make bond. Adler’s letter includes, right next to the figures, a web link to a Feb. 10, 2017, story posted by Stateline, a nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts journalism project that focuses on state policies. The story, "Sheriffs Still Looking for Clarity on Deportation," introduces the Adler-cited figures after referring to President Donald Trump’s January 2017 executive order directing federal agencies to act against "removable" immigrants and to enlist state and local law enforcement agencies to apprehend such individuals: "When considering whether to deport prisoners under Obama administration policies, ICE focused on those deemed to ‘pose a threat to public safety’ because of gang activity or felony convictions unrelated to immigration status. Trump’s executive order expands that focus to include any criminal activity, fraud or abuse of public benefits, or failure to obey a court order to leave the country. "Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states." A 26-month study The story lacks a source for those numbers. But to our query, Stateline reporter Tim Henderson pointed us to a chart posted in August 2016 by the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which describes itself as a data gathering, research and distribution organization focused on federal staffing, spending and enforcement activities. TRAC’s chart (Table 1 here), drawing on ICE data, indicates that from October 2013 to December 2015, local police agencies in 43 states refused to honor 16,296 detainer requests--as Adler basically said. Nationally, the chart says, 6.1 percent of detainer requests were denied over the 26 months. Also as Adler said, the chart identifies Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming as the only states where no requests were denied, together accounting for a scant 1,056 of 267,548 of the total detainer requests tallied nationally. For our part, we noticed that adding up the tallies shown for each of the states yielded smaller totals than the national totals topping the chart. That is, it looked like among the 50 states over the 26 months, 13,372 of 242,525 detainer requests were denied, which breaks out to a 5.5 percent denial rate or 94.5 percent detainer approval rate. So, would it be more accurate to say that more than 13,000 (not more than 16,000) detainer requests were denied in 43 states? It's not that simple. First, a note below the chart clarifies that the presented national totals fold in detainer requests submitted to and denied by jurisdictions in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories as well as requests made or denied for which a state wasn’t listed on federal paperwork. Second, Sue Long, the clearinghouse’s director, told us by phone that most detainer requests and denials tallied in the national totals but not showing in the state-by-state entries reflect gaps or blanks in ICE forms related to actions in states, not in Puerto Rico or beyond. Long otherwise cautioned that denials of detainer requests shouldn’t instantly be characterized as local law agencies failing to cooperate with federal colleagues. For instance, she said, local jurisdictions might wish to maintain control over the prosecution of a local crime rather than risk losing a suspect to deportation. Also, Long advised, the clearinghouse has yet to reach a more up-to-date analysis of detainer requests and requests denied. ICE-provided data, she said, has proved increasingly incomplete. Most detainer refusals in a few states We noticed that TRAC’s chart gives helpful context to the mayor’s claim. For instance, the chart shows the bulk of detainer denials in the study period occurred in a handful of states with only a few occurring in each of more than 20 states including Texas, which led the nation with 58,452 federal requests to hold suspects--and agencies in the state refused only 18 requests. From the chart, we broke out the 10 states that fielded the greatest number of detention requests--finding refusal rates ranging from nearly zero in several states up to 15 percent or 16 percent in three states: STATE Total Requests to Detain Requests Refused* % Requests Refused TEXAS 58,452 18 0.03% CALIFORNIA 46,444 7,292 15.70% ARIZONA 16,724 13 0.10% FLORIDA 11,462 1,022 8.90% GEORGIA 11,089 37 0.30% NEW YORK 10,768 1,696 15.80% NORTH CAROLINA 6,275 20 0.30% VIRGINIA 5,860 16 0.30% PENNSYLVANIA 5,382 171 3.20% COLORADO 5,268 804 15.30% * ICE did not assume custody and it recorded refusal by law enforcement agency (LEA) that was sent notice or detainer request. SOURCE: Report including Table 1, "Outcome of ICE I-247 Detainer Requests by State, FY 2014 - FY 2016," "Has Cooperation by State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies Improved ICE's Apprehension Numbers?," Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, August 12, 2016 In raw numbers, local agencies in California led the nation by a wide margin in refusals with 7,292 requests rebuffed. That total was followed by detainers refused by departments in New York (1,696 refusals); Florida (1,022); and Colorado (804), TRAC’s chart shows. Put another way, agencies in the four states accounted for 81 percent of detainers refused in the 50 states. Eight other states had 129 or more refused requests each, the chart shows. Put another way, a dozen states accounted for 96 percent of the detainer requests denied in the 50 states. At the low end, the chart shows a dozen states had 10 or fewer denied requests. We also looked at refusal rates by state. According to the chart, eight states led the nation with detainer refusal rates of 10 percent to nearly 16 percent (topped by agencies in New York and California). In contrast, local departments in 27 states including Texas had refusal rates of 2 percent or less, leaving eight states with refusal rates of 2.5 percent to nearly 9 percent. Another sheriff comments and mayor stands by claim For perspective outside Travis County, we reached Patrick Royal of the National Sheriffs’ Association who guided us to A.J. "Andy" Louderback, the sheriff for Jackson County, Texas, and legislative director of the Sheriffs’ Association of Texas. By phone, Louderback called Adler’s claim a misrepresentation because the vast majority of jurisdictions nationally didn’t deny detainer requests, especially those in Texas. We similarly shared the TRAC chart and our 50-state figures with Adler spokesman Jason Stanford who said by email: "For us, what the" mayor’s "statement means is that detainers without warrants are not accepted in many places around the country and that our sheriff is not alone (we continue to believe that is true)." Our ruling Adler said: "Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states." Adler’s figures trace to research based on ICE data, though our review of the figures suggests that fewer detainer requests might have been refused by local law enforcement agencies. Missing here too is that nearly all detainer requests were honored nationally and most of the tallied detainer refusals occurred in a handful of states. We rate this claim Mostly True.

"US President D. Trump Approves Scholarship for 50,000 African Student (sic) to Study in USA 2018," reads the headline of one such post on the website studentapply.info. But you shouldn’t believe it. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article is rife with grammatical errors that almost bring it to the point of incomprehensibility. To start with, the headline references "50,000 African Student," singular, not 50,000 African students, plural. At one point, it declares, "The US Embassy will work emphatically through their specialists with understudies occasionally masterminded social events and courses to help them all through the application strategy to hook declaration and honors to go to schools and colleges in the United States." We searched on Nexis to see if any major news outlets reported on the news of Trump approving scholarships for African students, and could not find any evidence to support the headline’s claim. A Google search revealed that this hoax has appeared before in a similar form. Another website previously touted that Trump had approved "fully government sponsored scholarships for international students … in USA universities."

pomt-05914	"A cashier earning $20,000 per year pays the same (Virginia) income tax rate as a hedge fund manager earning $20 million per year."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/01/david-englin/del-englin-says-cashier-and-rich-hedge-fund-manage/	Del. David Englin says Virginia’s tax code is "nonsensical" and in need of reform. In a Jan. 20 news release, the Alexandria Democrat said the code is fraught with exemptions and inefficient formulas for taxing gas, machinery and business receipts. And Englin said the state income tax is inequitable. "A cashier earning $20,000 per year pays the same (Virginia) income tax rate as a hedge fund manager earning $20 million a year," he said. Would that cashier and that multi-millionaire really shell out an equal percentage of their earnings in state income taxes? We checked. Englin backed his statement by pointing to a state law that applies a 5.75 percent levy on all taxable income over $17,000. But does that mean the hedge fund manager earning $20 million annually and the cashier earning one-thousandth of that amount would pay the same tax rate? The answer is no. That’s because everyone who pays Virginia income tax gets to claim certain deductions and exemptions. Joel Davison, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Taxation, said those reductions would shrink our cashier’s income below the top threshold. Let’s take the example that would offer the fewest state tax advantages to our cashier: He or she is single, has $20,000 in wages with no other income or federal deductions. The worker could claim a $930 state personal exemption and a $3,000 standard deduction for a single tax filer, leaving him or her with $16,070 in Virginia taxable income. That means the cashier falls short of the $17,000 threshold for entry into Virginia’s top income tax rate of 5.75 percent, Davison said. The highest rate the worker would pay on any portion of his or her income would be 5 percent. Any other scenario would further reduce the cashier’s Virginia taxable income. Our worker, for example, could receive a $930 exemption for each dependent child. If the cashier is over 65, her or she would be entitled to a $12,000 deduction. To be fair, there is a scenario under which the hedge fund manager would owe no taxes in Virginia. For example, he or she could have cataclysmic business losses or multiple tax credits could lower the tax liability to zero. But Davison pointed out that such occurrences would be "unlikely." Englin made a mistake in the wording of his statement by focusing on the cashier’s gross pay. He told us in an email that he was referring to the rate on "Virginia taxable income" and that he was assuming, for the sake of argument, the cashier and the hedge fund manager had no deductions or credits. But this creates a new wrinkle. Even a cashier with taxable income of $20,000 would pay a lower overall rate than a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager. That’s because the first $17,000 of all Virginians’ taxable income is assessed below the top rate. Virginia imposes a levy of 2 percent on the first $3,000 of taxable income, then 3 percent on the next $2,000, and 5 percent on taxable earnings from $5,000 to $17,000. So the cashier with $20,000 in taxable earnings would pay the top 5.75 percent levy on the last $3,000 of that money, but lower rates on the rest. Overall, a person with $20,000 in Virginia taxable income would pay a "blended" tax rate of 4.5 percent, according to Ryan Losi, executive vice president at the Piascik and Associates accounting firm in Richmond. We also ran the numbers on the overall rate someone would pay if he or she had $30,000 in taxable income. It would be 4.9 percent. That would still be below the roughly 5.75 percent levy the hedge fund manager would pay on his or her $20 million income, since all but a minute portion of the earnings would be taxed at the top rate. Our ruling: Englin said a cashier earning $20,000 a year would pay the same Virginia tax rate as a hedge fund manager who makes $20 million annually. He’s wrong. Basic deductions and exemptions would lower the cashier’s taxable income to a level below the state’s top rate of 5.75 percent that the hedge fund manager would likely pay. Englin tells us he intended to say that a cashier with a Virginia taxable income of $20,000 would pay the same rate as the rich hedge fund manager. But in such a case, the worker’s overall state income tax rate would still be lower than the millionaire’s. We rate Englin’s statement False.

pomt-04027	"As a result of National Rifle Association and other private-sector (safety-education) programs, fatal firearms accidents are at the lowest level in 100 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/01/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-nra-says-fatal-firearms-accidents-a/	During a closely watched Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun policy on Jan. 31, 2013, National Rifle Association executive director Wayne LaPierre offered several statistics designed to bolster his group’s position against gun control. Here’s one claim that caught our eye: "Teaching safe and responsible gun ownership works, and the NRA has a long and proud history of doing exactly that," LaPierre said. "Our Eddie Eagle Child Safety Program has taught 25 million young people that if they see a gun, they should do four things: stop, don't touch it, leave the area, and call an adult. As a result of this and other private-sector programs, fatal firearms accidents are at the lowest level in 100 years." Let’s take a look at two parts of LaPierre’s comment -- the numerical claim that accidental shooting deaths have declined, and the question of whether NRA safety programs made a difference. Are "fatal firearms accidents … at the lowest level in 100 years"? To check this part of the claim, we turned to a massive compendium of data produced annually by the National Safety Council, a nonprofit, congressionally chartered organization. The group issues an annual report that includes a category called "unintentional injury deaths" -- with data going all the way back to 1903. The most recent version of the "Injury Facts" report available on the Internet is the 2011 edition, with data up to 2009. But we were able to obtain draft data from the council that offers preliminary data for as recently as 2011 (numbers that the group says are subject to refinement). According to council data, the total number of unintentional deaths from firearms sank to 554 in 2009 -- easily the lowest of any year back to 1903. In fact, it took from 1903 all the way until 1997 for the number of unintentional gunfire deaths to drop below 1,000. The all-time highs came in 1929 and 1930, when the number of such deaths reached 3,200 for two consecutive years. This decline is all the more striking considering the increase in population over this period. In 1904, there were 3.4 unintentional firearm deaths per 100,000 people. By 2009, that rate had fallen to 0.2 deaths per 100,000 in people. However, the data for unintentional gun deaths ticked up modestly in 2010, to 606, and then fell slightly to 600 in 2011. So LaPierre was very close to correct -- 2009 represented a record low, but the number was slightly higher in both 2010 and 2011, at least according to preliminary data. Did safety education programs by the National Rifle Association and other groups help reduce accidental gun deaths? In a 2004 paper in the journal Pediatrics, researchers studied two child-safety programs, including the NRA’s Eddie Eagle. They concluded that Eddie Eagle was "effective for teaching children to reproduce verbally the gun-safety message … but the skills were not used when the children were assessed via real-life" situations. (Separately, gun-control advocates have complained that the Eddie Eagle program, whatever its safety benefits, helps recruit new generations of children into the NRA’s approach to guns.) However, the study should be taken with a grain of salt: Pediatrics is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group that, at the time the paper was published, was on record supporting "regulation of the manufacture, sale, purchase, ownership, and use of firearms; a ban on handguns and semiautomatic assault weapons; and expanded regulations of handguns for civilian use." (The group reaffirmed that position in 2012.) We did not hear back from the NRA for this story, but several independent experts said they feel the NRA programs and others like it probably did help contribute to the decline in accidental gun deaths. "I taught my children these same principles when they were very young so they had a way to evaluate the situation," said Mark E. Safarik, executive director of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. "If the gun safety course teaches those principles, then it has to have had an effect." Jay Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida, agreed that such programs probably made a difference. "Overall, I believe the NRA should be commended for its firearm safety programs," Corzine said. "It is a certain that they have prevented some accidental shootings and deaths." That said, Corzine cautioned against giving Eddie Eagle too much credit for the drop. Corzine pointed to a 2002 study in the journal Homicide Studies that suggested an entirely different rationale for the drop: improved medical care, particularly for trauma victims. The authors of that study wrote that "we have garnered considerable support for the hypothesis that advances in emergency medical care have greatly and increasingly reduced the lethality of violent assaults." In an interview, Billie Weiss, an epidemiologist at the UCLA School of Public Health, pointed to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., as an example of the advances in medical treatment. Giffords was shot in the head at a public gathering in January 2011. While she still faces a difficult road to recovery, Giffords survived the shooting. "Ten years ago, she most certainly would not have lived after her injury," Weiss said. To factor out improvements in trauma care, Corzine said it’s better to use a different data set than the one LaPierre used. Rather than focusing on accidental deaths from gunfire, Corzine said, look at accidental injuries from gunfire instead. The National Safety Council’s annual report doesn’t include such data, but the CDC makes it available. We found that unintentional gunfire injuries have also been declining -- by about 20 percent between 2001 and 2010. That’s somewhat slower than the decline in unintentional gunfire deaths over the same period, which was 24 percent. But it’s not dramatically different. (As with the figures for unintentional gunfire deaths, the number for unintentional gunfire injuries ticked up slightly in 2011.) What may be more relevant is that the incidents LaPierre cited -- unintentional deaths from gunfire -- only amounted to about 600 cases in 2010, compared to 14,161 cases of unintentional gunshot injuries that didn’t lead to death. In addition, there were 53,738 gunshot injuries caused by intentional assault in that year and another 4,643 non-fatal gunshot injuries caused by suicide attempts. In other words, the roughly 600 unintentional gunshot deaths LaPierre cited in his testimony accounts for only a tiny proportion of all gun-related deaths and injuries -- less than half of one percent, to be precise. Indeed, just looking at gunfire deaths, the trend lines for unintentional and intentional fatalities have been moving in opposite directions. Back in 1968, intentional gunfire deaths outpaced unintentional deaths by a ratio of 10 to 1. By 2009, that gap had expanded significantly, with intentional deaths exceeding unintentional deaths by a factor of more than 50 to 1. So while LaPierre worded his statistic carefully and in a way that was very close to accurate, he chose to focus on a tiny subset of gun-related harm while ignoring the vast majority of gun-related deaths. Our ruling LaPierre was very close to being right about his carefully framed statistic: Despite significant population growth, unintentional firearms deaths fell to a 106-year low in 2009 before tracking up slightly in 2010. But while LaPierre is probably right that NRA-sponsored safety programs played a role in this decline, improvements in trauma care -- something LaPierre didn’t cite -- likely played as big a role as well, if not a bigger role. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Wayne LaPierre	None	None	None	2013-02-01T12:53:46	2013-01-30	['None']

pomt-13740	Speakers at the Democratic National Convention made "zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-right-no-democratic-speaker-mentioned-isis-con/	Night one of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia had barely ended when the Republican National Committee sent a blast email to reporters attacking the Democrats for ignoring the threat of terrorism when speaking at the podium. "61: Number Of Speeches At The DNC Tonight," the Republican National Committee wrote. "0: Mentions Of The Global Terrorist Threat Posed By ISIS." Was the Democratic discussion of ISIS and Islamic terrorism that thin? Basically, yes. It’s worth noting that the first night was not intended to have a specific focus on foreign policy, leaving the Democrats with three days left to discuss the issue. And Hillary Clinton -- away from the podium in Philadelphia -- issued a fairly muscular call for action against ISIS at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Charlotte, N.C. "We have to protect ourselves against terrorists," Clinton told the group. "To do that, we need to lead other countries in stopping ISIS, al-Qaida, and other radical jihadist groups. We shouldn’t leave that to the rest of the world to figure out on their own. That won’t keep us safe." That said, as it concerns the convention in Philadelphia, the RNC’s statement is literally correct. Based on our searches of C-SPAN closed-captioning text, Congressional Quarterly transcripts and other video archiving services, we couldn’t find any speaker who mentioned "ISIS," "Islamic" "terror," "terrorist," or "terrorism" during the first day of the convention. The closest example came in a video that quoted Hillary Clinton’s speech after the mass shooting in Orlando in which a gunman who professed allegiance to ISIS attacked a gay nightclub. "From Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate," she said. But that doesn’t really fit the description in the RNC’s email, since the email referred to speeches at the Democratic convention, not to video footage shown of Clinton’s past speeches. Our ruling The Republican National Committee said speakers at the Democratic National Convention made "zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS." While Clinton took the opportunity to bring up the topic at an appearance in Charlotte on the same day, the email accurately reflects what was said -- or more precisely, not said -- from the podium in Philadelphia.

pomt-04219	Says veterans’ disability claims backlog doubled in Obama’s first term.	true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/28/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-veterans-disability-claims-backlo/	In legislation filed this week, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn touts a Texas-tested method to address backlogged veterans’ disability claims, a problem he recently highlighted on Twitter. On Nov. 19, 2012, the Texas Republican tweeted, "Veterans' disability claims backlog had doubled during POTUS's first term. He needs to announce a plan to reduce it. ASAP." Reducing the Department of Veterans Affairs backlog was one of the campaign promises Barack Obama made in 2008 as he ran for POTUS (president of the United States). PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken in a Nov. 2, 2012, article that delved into some of the reasons the problem had grown worse. The term "backlog" is used in this context as shorthand for claims that have gone unaddressed by the government for 125 days involving military veterans’ disability compensation and pensions and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die because of their military service. PolitiFact said the nationwide backlog "nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012," due in part to the influx of veterans returning from war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Texas’ backlog doubled from July 2010 to July 2012, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a July 16, 2012, news story. And the VA claims office in Waco has both the nation’s longest wait and the nation’s largest backlog, according to an Aug. 14, 2012, Statesman article and Cornyn’s Nov. 12, 2012, opinion column in the Waco Tribune-Herald. Cornyn’s legislation, according to his Nov. 28, 2012, press release, would require the VA to come up with a national plan similar to its recent partnership with the Texas Veterans’ Commission, which assists veterans with their claims individually. We asked Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie for details on the senator’s tweet about Obama’s first term, which began Jan. 20, 2009. His second term begins Jan. 21, 2013. Brandewie emailed us data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Looking at numbers from the department’s weekly reports, Brandewie said, there were 86,687 backlogged claims on Jan. 24, 2009, and 597,636 on Nov. 17, 2012. That, we calculated, is a 589 percent increase. But, Brandewie noted, there’s a hitch in those numbers. Before October 2009, he said, the VA considered a claim backlogged if it had gone unaddressed for more than 180 days. Then the department raised the bar. Beginning that month, a claim was backlogged if it had been pending for more than 125 days. That meant a lot of claims were immediately reclassified as backlogged. The agency’s Sept. 26, 2009, report has 88,195 claims older than 180 days; the next report, issued Oct. 3, 2009, has 158,290 claims pending for more than 125 days. We wondered if 180-day-late claims had doubled on Obama’s watch, but the VA reports stopped including that statistic after the 2009 change. As an alternative, we checked the longest span of days we could get with the 125-day measure -- Oct. 3, 2009 to Nov. 17, 2012. The result: a 278 percent increase. Veterans’ Affairs spokesman Randy Noller, whom we interviewed by phone, sent us data that matches the numbers Brandewie sent us. Brandewie also pointed out that the backlog had doubled in another way: as a percentage of the whole. Two years ago, less than a third of all such veterans’ claims were pending. Now, more than two-thirds of all claims are pending. Why did the backlog increase so much? Noller told us, "We’ve got more claims being filed now than ever before." PolitiFact said the VA added staff, but it wasn’t enough to keep up with a sharp increase in claims volume, much less reduce the past backlog. The undersecretary for the Veterans Benefits Administration, Allison Hickey, said the volume of claims rose 48 percent from 2008 through 2011 -- from 888,000 to 1.3 million -- in testimony to a U.S. House subcommittee July 18, 2012. That’s despite a decline in the number of veterans, which dropped about 6 percent in the same period -- from 23.4 million in 2008 to 22.2 million in 2011 by the department’s VetPop estimates and from 23.2 million in 2008 to 21.5 million in 2011 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Noller told us "ten years’ worth of war" in Iraq and Afghanistan is a large factor. Because of advances in technology and tactics, "more of our people are coming back alive," he said, and they report more medical conditions per person than their Vietnam and World War II predecessors. Those older veterans face additional problems of their own as they age, according to a Sept. 27, 2012, New York Times news story. "The department is administering pensions for World War II veterans while handling new claims from Vietnam veterans struggling with the multiplying ailments of age," the story said. In her testimony, Hickey said another major contributor to the backlog pile-up has been claims involving Agent Orange, a herbicide the U.S. sprayed to reduce vegetation providing enemy cover in Vietnam. The Aug. 4, 2012, Statesman news story said rules adopted in 2010 made it easier for Vietnam veterans to file claims based on post-traumatic stress disorder and exposure to Agent Orange. The Times story said that even though Veterans Affairs "added nearly 4,000 new workers since 2008, the agency did not keep pace." Our ruling Cornyn said the backlog of veterans’ claims doubled in Obama’s first term. Counting from Jan. 24, 2009, forward yields an increase of 589 percent. This is an overstatement, though, since the government lowered its threshold for declaring a claim as backlogged after Obama became president. Still, the backlog has tripled since the lower threshold was imposed in October 2009. We often find fault in claims that assign the responsibility for broad results to a particular officeholder. That’s because many factors are usually at play. In this instance, however, Obama promised to reduce the backlog of claims and PolitiFact recently rated this a promise Broken. In turn, we rate Cornyn’s statement as True.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2012-11-28T16:57:04	2012-11-19	['None']
pomt-12033	"Calling for the assassination of the president is a federal crime."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/15/william-lacy-clay/chappelle-nadals-statement-isnt-necessarily-federa/	Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, faced calls that she should resign after writing on Facebook "I hope Trump is assassinated!" in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Criticism of Chappelle-Nadal’s statement came from Republicans and Democrats, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis. "Calling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime. … (She is) an embarrassment to our state. She should resign immediately," Clay told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in an article published Aug. 18. On Wednesday, the Missouri Senate censured Chappelle-Nadal. The resolution reads, "Members of the Missouri Senate urge Senator Chappelle-Nadal to resign or, upon failure to do so, she may be subject to potential expulsion at a future session of the Missouri Senate." That’s a political decision. We wanted to know whether calling for the assassination of a president really is a federal crime. We reached out to Clay’s spokesman, Steven Engelhardt, who pointed us to a Wikipedia article on U.S. Code Title 18, Section 871, which states that "knowingly and willfully" threatening the president is a felony. While that is the law, after consulting with experts, we found it’s not quite as straightforward as Clay made it out to be. The context, wording and intent of the statement are all important factors to consider to determine whether the speaker committed a federal crime. History of the law Early versions of the law date back as far as 1351, with the British Treason Act. The act made it a crime to plan or imagine the death of the king of England. The United States is no stranger to presidential assassinations and attempts, which justifies the existence of the current law, said Ronald Feinman, author of the book, "Assassinations, Threats, and the American Presidency: From Andrew Jackson to Barack Obama." "One out of every 10 presidents has been killed, and one out of every seven has been wounded and about half of them have faced threats we know of," Feinman said. "So it is a endemic problem in America." Lyrissa Lidsky, dean of the MU School of Law, said threats have a "tremendously disruptive effect" and are considered outside the boundary of normal conflict in the political arena. "Threat laws are designed to, one, prevent the person who's making the threat from carrying out the threat," Lidsky said. "But another purpose is to prevent intimidation of the person who's threatened. So if a speaker says, 'I'm going to kill you,' chances are, your life will be seriously affected if you think someone has made a serious threat to kill you." The law has evolved, MU School of Law professor Frank Bowman said. "In 15th century England, this statement would surely be taken as a threat," Bowman said of Chappelle-Nadal’s comment. "Now the Secret Service has to do some triage to discover if a threat was made." Context matters While it is a crime to threaten to assassinate the president, Clay’s statement fails to consider the nuance needed to determine whether a statement is a true threat that would be deemed a crime. "It's an overstatement," Lidsky said of Clay’s claim. "You really have to look at the statement and discern what the speaker intended. Whether it was a joke, a jest, hyperbole or whether it was a serious intent to threaten the president." Other experts emphasized the importance of the statement’s language, context and tone when analyzing it. "The key word really is threat. Threat doesn’t just mean, 'I wish this would happen,'" Bowman said. The United States Supreme Court explicitly dealt with the issue in 1969 in Watts v. United States, when an 18-year-old man who disagreed with being drafted said, "If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J." The Supreme Court ruled that the man’s statement was "crude political hyperbole" that "did not constitute a knowing and willful threat against the President." Experts have stressed that social media complicates the problem. "A statement made on social media doesn't automatically have the same contextual clues as to the speaker's meaning as a statement made in person," Lidsky said. When it comes to free speech and what you can say or post on social media, there are limits, Feinman said. "You can condemn (the president), you can denounce him, but you don't have a right to call for his death, because that could incite others to commit violence," Feinman said. "I hope" vs. "I will" It’s unclear if Chappelle-Nadal’s statement was "calling for the assassination of the president," as Clay claimed. "Saying, 'I hope' is not the same thing as saying, 'Please someone go out and assassinate the president,’ " Lidksy said. "The very language of it itself means it's unlikely to be a threat, because she's not saying she's going to assassinate him, and she's not even calling for somebody to go out and assassinate him. It's a hope. And so therefore, that's unlikely to be a federal crime standing on its face." Experts said they thought it would be unlikely that Chappelle-Nadal would be prosecuted. At most, she could be investigated. Our ruling Clay said, "Calling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime." While calling for the assassination of a president can be a crime, context matters. Decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis to determine if someone’s statement is a true threat with intent that could lead to prosecution. In Chappelle-Nadal’s case, experts agreed that her statement was more wishful thinking than incitement to assassinate the president. Therefore, Clay’s statement was missing important details and was an overgeneralization of the law. We rate it Half True.	None	William Lacy Clay	None	None	None	2017-09-15T11:44:41	2017-08-18	['None']

"Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control our own energy future," he said.

We reached out to the White House asking for backup to this claim but did not receive any. But back in 2011, the EPA announced a plan, in partnership with a dozen automakers, to increase average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks. (That figure represents a combined city/highway rating as tested in a lab. In real-world driving, the EPA estimates drivers would average closer to 43 mpg.) Is that for cars coming off the assembly line now? Not hardly. The 54.5 mpg benchmark is the goal for model year 2025 vehicles. Fuel efficiency is gradually increasing on the way to the 2025 goal. When he took office in 2009, federal standards called for an average rating of 27.5 mpg. For 2013 vehicles, the standard is 30.5 mpg. In 2016, it rises to 34.1. So comparing fuel efficiency in 2009 and now, there’s an increase of 11 percent -- not nearly double. Our ruling Obama said the U.S. has "doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas," which clearly sounds as though cars on the road today are running at twice their earlier fuel efficiency. But he was comparing a real number with a projected one, a standard for vehicles manufactured more than a decade from now. The statement was misleading and more importantly untrue. We rate it False.

pomt-08165	"The tuitions in Virginia colleges...have doubled -- 100 percent -- in the last 10 years."	true	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/02/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-college-tuitions-have-/	In a recent "Ask the Governor" session on WTOP radio, host Mark Segraves told Gov. Bob McDonnell that a Virginia Tech student had called to complain about the rising cost of tuition. "And he should," McDonnell responded. "I have a daughter at Virginia Tech and two (sons) at U.Va. right now and I’m saying I understand his pain. The tuitions in Virginia colleges, Mark, have doubled -- 100 percent -- in the last 10 years. It’s unacceptable." We won’t challenge the governor on where his children are enrolled, but we did wonder whether tuition at all state schools had doubled. McDonnell Press Secretary Stacey Johnson supported the claim with a July State Council of Higher Education for Virginia report. She pointed to a chart showing the average full-time in-state undergraduate tuition with mandatory teaching-related fees has risen from $2,192 in 2000-01 to $5,670 for 2010-11 -- significantly more than double. But we wondered if each public college and university had doubled its tuition over the decade. So, we turn back to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia’s report, which clearly shows that tuition and fees are on the rise. For 2010-11, all of the state’s 16 public schools show undergraduate tuition and mandatory teaching-related fees increasing by at least 5 percent from the previous year. Half of those increases are in the double digits, with Virginia Commonwealth University at the top of the list with a 23.9 percent hike from 2009-10. Old Dominion University had the smallest increase at 5.3 percent. Now, we need to see how things looked a decade ago. According to a 2000-01 State Council of Higher Education report, McDonnell’s claim still holds up if we look at all the state’s public four-year institutions. Only Richard Bland College -- a two-year junior college -- has not doubled its tuition, and even that school is only $256 shy of the mark. The only way McDonnell’s claim runs into trouble is if we look at tuition and all mandatory fees -- for non-instructional uses such as athletics and capital debt service. Even then, only two schools -- James Madison University and Old Dominion University -- have yet to double the 2000-01 figures, and both are short by less than $200. In case you’re curious, the average tuition including all mandatory fees and room and board for four-year state schools has risen from $8,813 in 2000-01 to $16,833 this year -- nearly double. Also of note: Tuition spiked sharply in fiscal 2002 after a tuition freeze instituted in fiscal 1997 was lifted. A mandatory tuition reduction was also implemented in fiscal 2000. "The freeze was lifted in Fiscal Year ‘02 because of budget cuts to higher education. That's when tuition and E&G (instructional) fees shot up by an average of 21.5 percent across the public institutions," said Kirsten Nelson with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. More recent spikes were also caused by budget cuts. "The reasons they have gone up fairly substantially in the past couple years is because they’ve suffered budget cuts from the General Assembly," Nelson said. "One of the reasons that higher education gets cut is because the institutions have an alternate source of income, which is tuition." Nelson said things could have been worse were it not for the almost $275 million state colleges and universities received from the 2009 Stimulus Act. Now, let’s review: McDonnell’s claim that Virginia tuition has doubled in the last 10 years is 100 percent true using the average. If we look individually at each of the state’s four-year schools, it’s still true. Only if we include Richard Bland, the state’s only two-year junior college, is it not entirely true to say that all state colleges and universities have doubled tuition, but even then it’s off just a tad. So we find the claim to be True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2010-12-02T11:35:22	2010-11-30	['Virginia']
pomt-02598	"Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days."	false	/florida/statements/2014/jan/27/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-it-takes-two-days-get-environmenta/	Gov. Rick Scott, who has drawn criticism from environmentalists for his strongly pro-business policies, this week called for an increase in spending for conservation projects on waterways and in the Everglades. At a Jan. 21, 2014, event in Tallahassee to honor 125 Department of Environmental Protection employees, Scott announced a budget request that includes efforts to protect and restore springs. He then made a statement praising the speed at which such employees work: "Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days. That’s great." In a press gaggle following the event, DEP Secretary Herschel Vinyard Jr. -- a Scott appointee -- was asked about that two-day timetable. He didn’t back up his boss: "We're actually at about 32, 33 days is our average permit processing time. So I'm not exactly sure what was mentioned," Vinyard said. (Tampa Bay Times reporter Steve Bousquet was at the press gaggle and recorded the comments. We also confirmed Scott’s comments in his written prepared remarks.) Once we started digging, it became clear that Scott was talking about an entirely different type of permit. Let’s go deep into the weeds to discern the differences between these two types of permits. Permitting process at two state agencies There is a license that takes on average two days to obtain -- but it’s not an environmental permit. "Under Gov. Scott’s administration, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation has reduced professional license processing time by more than 60 percent from an average of six days to two days," said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz in an email. Those professional licenses are for a range of jobs including auctioneers, hair braiders, geologists, realtors and veterinarians. For these permits, it now takes two days to process the application. In some instances, applicants have to complete other steps -- for example, to pass an exam or receive board certification, said Department of Business and Professional Regulation spokeswoman Tajiana Ancora-Brown. It takes longer to process an environmental permit, though the lag time has dropped. It took the Department of Environmental Protection 87.7 days in 2010-11 to produce permits. It’s now 33.7 days on average. This covers permits related to waste, water and air. Typically, the applicants seeking such permits are businesses, though on occasion, homeowners may apply, too. For instance, a resident who wants to build on a wetland on their property would have to file an application, said Patrick Gillespie, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. Officials for both the Department of Business and Professional Regulation and the Department of Environmental Protection told us they had sped up the process in part by emphasizing online applications. At DEP, they also added a "pre-application meeting" for applicants to go over the regulations and reduce the chance their application would arrive incomplete. In 2012, Scott signed a bill that reduced the amount of time to approve certain permits -- for example wetlands permits -- from 90 days to 60 days, earning kudos from business groups. In December 2012, DEP employees who improved customer service including speeding up the permitting process received bonuses. But environmentalists have raised concerns. While the department found more than $500,000 for bonuses, it also laid off 58 employees. State Rep. Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach, told the Tampa Bay Times that the bonuses sent the wrong message to employees. "You’re arguably providing an incentive to turn your head," Pafford said. "You’re giving someone a bonus for them not to take the time required when reviewing permits. That’s dangerous for an agency called the Department of Environmental Protection." Our ruling Scott said, "Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days." Scott was mistaken; he was actually referring to the amount of time it takes to get a professional license from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. During Scott’s tenure, the state has reduced the amount of time it takes to get an environmental permit to about 34 days. However, what he said was incorrect. We rate his claim False.

pomt-06714	Says President Barack Obama delivered $2 billion to Brazil to help with offshore drilling projects.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/01/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-delivered-2-billion-brazil-h/	On the day he entered the Republican campaign for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said at a New Hampshire house party that the Obama administration has made life more difficult for oil companies in Louisiana and Texas while being overly generous to energy projects in other countries. "This president goes to Brazil and delivers $2 billion to that country to help them with their offshore drilling projects," Perry said. "What are they thinking?" But as we drilled down into this statement, we found an empty well. Obama didn't "deliver" any such thing during his visit to Brazil, and Obama had no connection to a much smaller loan guarantee that a Brazilian company ultimately got from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Experts we interviewed said Perry was distorting the truth and wrongly characterizing what happened. We tried to contact the Perry campaign, but it did not return calls or e-mails asking for supporting evidence of this statement. We found Perry is referring to two things: Obama's trip to Brazil in March 2011, which was intended to encourage growing economic and political ties to the country, and a decision by the Ex-Im Bank, an independent agency, to offer a preliminary commitment to a Brazilian oil company in April 2009. We'll take them one at a time. Obama's trip to Brazil On March 19, 2011, Obama met with Brazil’s new President Dilma Rousseff, hailed Brazil as an emerging "global leader" and talked of a bright future of cooperation between the two countries. Several times in his visit, Obama expressed support for increased trade and partnerships with Brazil. He mentioned building infrastructure for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics and developing biofuel technology. And several times, Obama said that the U.S. wanted to help Brazil develop its recently discovered deepwater oil reserves so the U.S. could be a customer. At a business summit in Brasilia, Obama said: "At a time when we’ve been reminded how easily instability in other parts of the world can affect the price of oil, the United States could not be happier with the potential for a new, stable source of energy." In an address at the Palacio do Planalto, he said: "In particular, with the new oil finds off Brazil, President Rousseff has said that Brazil wants to be a major supplier of new stable sources of energy, and I’ve told her that the United States wants to be a major customer, which would be a win-win for both our countries." But while Obama said that the U.S. would be a customer for the country's oil, he said nothing about the U.S. providing the $2 billion, as Perry claimed. Indeed, the action by the Ex-Im Bank involving the Brazilian oil company actually occurred in April 2009, almost two years before Obama's trip. It was approved by bank officials who all were appointees of President George W. Bush. Bush appointees approved $2 billion deal Perry's claim that Obama gave Brazil $2 billion echoes criticism we found in many blogs, many of which referred to a Wall Street Journal editorial written in August 2009, titled "Obama Underwrites Offshore Drilling." The editorial correctly reported that the U.S. Export-Import Bank agreed to a "preliminary commitment" for $2 billion with the Brazilian oil company Petrobras in 2009. But from there, the waters turned a bit muckier as the editorial held Obama responsible for that development. "Americans are right to wonder why Mr. Obama is underwriting in Brazil what he won't allow at home," the editorial concluded. First, a quick explanation of the Ex-Im Bank: It is an independent federal agency that provides financing options -- including direct loans, guarantees of loans and export-credit insurance -- to foreign buyers to help them buy U.S. goods and services, according to its website. When we called the Ex-Im Bank’s spokesman Phil Cogan, we could hardly get the question out about Obama's involvement before he interjected. "Not true," Cogan said. This much is true -- the bank agreed to a preliminary commitment with Petrobras in 2009 for $2 billion. That commitment, in lay terms, was "an expression of the bank’s willingness to consider an application of loans," Cogan said. But Obama had no role in approving it. When the bank’s board of directors made that decision on April 14, 2009, all five directors were appointed by Bush. Obama had no appointees on the board at that time. And it's important to understand that, according to the bank’s charter, the Ex-Im Bank is an independent credit agency. The president appoints the directors to the five-person board -- three of the president’s party, two of the minority party -- but does not vote on or sign off on transactions, Cogan said. For transactions exceeding $100 million, there is a 30-day review period, during which the president and members of Congress can comment on proposed transactions, Cogan said. But it’s very rare to receive comments, and the ultimate decision is made by the bank’s board of directors. The Ex-Im Bank receives its spending authority from Congress, but it gets no appropriated funds, Cogan said. It operates using revenue from the fees and interest that it charges lenders and borrowers. "In those rare cases when it makes direct loans (the majority of our financing is guarantees of loans made by commercial lenders), the bank borrows the money from Treasury, collects fees and charges interest to the ultimate borrower and repays Treasury both principal and interest," Cogan explained. On Feb. 4, 2010, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to a $308 million loan guarantee (out of the initial $2 billion commitment) with Petrobras, essentially guaranteeing prevention of default on a private loan from the lender, which in this case was JPMorgan Chase. The vote on that $308 million was not unanimous. Chairman Fred Hochberg, the only Obama appointee at that time, and director Diane Farrell voted for it; director Bijan Kian opposed it. They were the only directors that voted. In an e-mail, Petrobras officials confirmed that the loan has been signed and the money will be used to buy U.S. goods and services. According to the Ex-Im Bank, the companies that will benefit include three companies based in Louisiana -- and at least five companies in Perry’s home state of Texas. No evidence of an Obama connection So far, there's no evidence to support Perry's case that Obama delivered the loan guarantee. But is it possible the bank was under White House pressure to act? That's not how the place works, said Joseph Grandmaison, an international trade consultant who lives in Rye, N.H. Grandmaison was appointed by Bush to serve on the Ex-Im Bank’s board of directors for seven years, ending his term in July 2009. "In all the time I was there, to the best of my knowledge, there were never any calls from the White House to persuade us of anything," said Grandmaison, a Democrat. "They don’t influence transactions." That $2 billion preliminary commitment was tantamount to "establishing a line of credit" to Petrobras for the purpose of buying American goods. It was also intended to encourage U.S. companies to sell to Petrobras, Grandmaison said, because the financing was in place. Oliver O'Connell, an analyst who follows the Ex-Im Bank as editor of Trade Finance Magazine, agrees. "The idea that the president was somehow involved in this is a fallacy," O'Connell said. "This was about the Ex-Im Bank making sure that U.S. exporters could compete on the same level playing field as their foreign competitors, with the intention of creating American jobs." It’s a resilient fallacy, though, one that keeps popping up, from the Wall Street Journal to Fox News, going viral in emails and landing on various conservative blogs. It’s been enough to encourage the Ex-Im Bank to post a fact sheet on its website in attempt to shoot down the various charges. Addressing the claim that the loan represents a reversal of the Obama administration’s stance on offshore drilling, the fact sheet states: "There is no connection between federal policies on offshore drilling in U.S. waters and financing U.S. export sales for drilling by other countries. In fact, should Ex-Im Bank refuse to finance sales by U.S. companies it is likely that the sales will go instead to their foreign competitors." Cogan could not keep exasperation out of his voice when discussing the matter. "There have been so many errors and misconceptions about this," he said. "It keeps getting repeated and repeated, despite the facts." Our Ruling Perry’s claim is wrong in several ways. First, the number is wrong. Although there was an initial commitment for $2 billion, it ultimately became a $308 million loan guarantee. Second, Perry ignores that the Ex-Im Bank is an independent federal agency, and he is wrong to attribute its actions to Obama. The initial commitment came when it was controlled by Bush appointees. And although the Obama appointee voted for the $308 million loan guarantee, there is no evidence that it done at the behest of Obama. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05527	Mayor Tom Barrett’s policies drove unemployment up 27 percent in Milwaukee, pushing it to "one of America’s 10 worst cities for unemployment."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/11/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-mayor-tom-ba/	When PolitiFact Wisconsin Googled "Tom Barrett" the other day, top results included: A WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) story about Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s bid to take on Scott Walker in the 2012 recall race. A post on an education technology blog by a guy named Tom Barrett in Nottingham, England with 20,000 Twitter followers. Mayor Tom Barrett’s Wikipedia entry; his newly minted gubernatorial campaign website; and his official City Hall site (he was re-elected mayor on April 3, 2012). That’s in real life. In a campaign TV ad released March 29, 2012 by an arm of the Republican Governors Association, less neutral results appear as a woman searches on "Tom Barrett." In the ad, the woman gets these search hints: "Politician. Increase spending. High unemployment. Candidate for governor." As she "finds" some Barrett material online, she offers a running commentary. "Tom Barrett increased spending in Milwaukee by $300 million? Huh. "Raised taxes every year but one. Uh oh." "And what did his taxes and spending do to the economy? Unemployment up 27 percent. Under Barrett, Milwaukee’s one of America’s 10 worst cities for unemployment." She concludes: "Spending -- up. Taxes -- up. Unemployment -- up. Governor Tom Barrett? I don’t think so." The RGA ad claims on taxing and spending are not in dispute. But did unemployment jump 27 percent during Barrett’s first two terms, spanning 2004 to 2012? And was Milwaukee one of the toughest places in the United States for employment? We decided to investigate both -- and the ad’s claim Barrett’s policies were responsible. Unemployment rates are reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and state agencies such as the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development. We found a 26 percent increase in the number of unemployed from April 2004, when Barrett took office, to January 2012, according to the latest figures reported on the BLS site. The number is 27 percent if you do the math on the unemployment rates for those years (8.1 percent and 10.3 percent), though such comparisons are usually expressed as percentage point changes. In other words, you would typically say unemployment went up 2.2 percentage points under Barrett. But either way the RGA is pretty much on target on that piece. On the second part of the RGA claim, a top-10-worst ranking, the group’s spokesman pointed to 2005 -2007, when Milwaukee was sixth-highest for unemployment rate among large cities and to 2009, when the city was 10th. The RGA uses the nation’s 50 largest cities as a pool of comparison. If you expand to municipalities of any size, Milwaukee improves hundreds of places in the rankings. But it seems reasonable to compare Milwaukee, which is near the middle of the 50 largest cities, to its peer group. So it’s clear the city was in the top 10 for highest unemployment in four of Barrett’s first five full years in office. But what about 2008, and the most recent two years, 2010 and 2011? Milwaukee improved to 16th in 2008, and ranked 11th in 2010, when six California cities were among the worst. (The annual average for 2011 was not available as of early April 2012.) So the city’s ranking has edged out of the top 10 worst in three recent years under Barrett. One note: the TV ad subtly makes two different claims on the "top 10" ranking. The on-screen graphic says Milwaukee "was" one of the worst 10, while the narrator says that "Milwaukee’s one of America’s worst" -- a line that suggests the top-10 ranking is current. But either way the claim of a top-10 ranking is accurate or very close in five of the seven full years under Barrett. But the claim is about more than numbers. It places the blame squarely on Barrett and his policies ("what did his taxes and spending do to the economy?" asks the ad). Mayors clearly have a policy role on job creation, but state and national trends drive much of the employment picture at the local level. By the RGA’s logic, Scott Walker, as much as Barrett, could be accused of causing unemployment to soar when he was the elected executive of Milwaukee County, which includes the city of Milwaukee. Why? Because both Barrett’s and Walker’s eighth budgets included spending that was more than 30 percent higher than the budgets they inherited. (We used eight budgets for an apples-to-apples comparison; Barrett has submitted eight budgets; Walker did nine.) Separately, property taxes went up 20 percent over Walker’s first eight years, compared with 25 percent under Barrett. (Note: Walker never proposed a tax hike but used County Board levy increases as his base the following year). Our conclusion The Republican Governors Association, which backs Scott Walker, was basically accurate on its claims, but overstates the influence of a mayor on taming unemployment. This comes in Half True.	None	Republican Governors Association	None	None	None	2012-04-11T09:00:00	2012-04-29	['Milwaukee', 'United_States', 'Tom_Barrett_(politician)']
pomt-08907	"There are more pain clinics in Broward County than there are McDonald's in Broward County."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/29/dave-aronberg/aronberg-says-broward-pain-clinics-outnumber-mcdon/	The proliferation of pain clinics in Florida has been a growing problem -- particularly in Broward County. Dave Aronberg, a state senator from Palm Beach County running in the Democratic primary for attorney general, has now quantified that problem by comparing it to the availability of Big Macs. "There are more pain clinics in Broward County than there are McDonald's in Broward County," he told the St. Petersburg Times editorial board July 26. We at PolitiFact Florida wondered, are there really more spots to buy happy meds than Happy Meals in Broward County? Determining the number of pain clinics was more complicated than counting the number of McDonald's restaurants. Aronberg campaign spokesman Allison North Jones cited a grand jury investigation led by Broward State Attorney Mike Satz issued in 2009. That report stated that in 2007, there were four pain clinics in Broward. From August 2008 to November 2009, the number swelled from 47 to 115. A footnote in the report states that the statistic comes from the Broward Sheriff's Office Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit. BSO spokesman Jim Leljedal told us that as of July 28, BSO lists 144 pain clinics in the entire county. But he warned "sometimes it is hard to have an accurate count because these places come and go, they are thrown out of one storefront and move across the street." Aronberg sent us a March 2 blog in the Broward Palm Beach New Times which also looked at his McDonald's comparison -- that time he had made the comment at a St. Petersburg debate. "After dozens of phone calls and hours of research, it turns out that finding the exact number of pill mills in Broward is impossible," The New Times wrote. "First, it depends on your definition of a 'pill mill.' The pain management clinics in South Florida range from legitimate medical business targeting specific patients suffering chronic pain to junkie-friendly, low-rent operations. Second, a lot of these clinics open and shut down quickly, only to reopen at a new location. Third, and most important, there is little government regulation of the industry, no agency responsible for tracking the businesses." The New Times quoted Mike Jachles, a BSO spokesman, as saying there were "at least 80" in areas that BSO oversees. The New Times counted 71 McDonald's for Broward County in the phone book. We also consulted the Florida Department of Health's pain clinic registry. That spreadsheet shows about 343 clinics in Broward, but it lists several with the same addresses multiple times, making it difficult to get an accurate account. We called and e-mailed the health department's communications office in Tallahassee and did not hear back. Two other law enforcement agencies quoted in the past regarding the number of pain clinics -- the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Hollywood Police Department -- referred us to the health department. Next we tried to identify the number of McDonald's restaurants in Broward County. We e-mailed and called McDonald's media relations and after two days of no response, we typed all 31 cities in Broward into the chain's online restaurant locator. We found 73. Aronberg's Senate staff had done the same earlier this year, and found 78. (PolitiFact Florida came up with a different figure than Aronberg's team for Davie, Miramar and Pompano Beach. It's possible that some restaurants have opened and closed since Aronberg's office counted them.) We could not detemine a way to check unincorporated Broward on the McDonald's website. But there is little unincorporated land left so it's unlikely that would change the total significantly, if at all. So how is Aronberg's math? A grand jury report put the number of pain clinics at 115 by late 2009. The Broward Sheriff's Office puts the number at 144 as of July 28. We found the state health department database too confusing to evaluate, and no one to answer our questions. The best number we could determine for McDonald's locations was 73 -- Aronberg's campaign put it at 78 while the New Times said 71. No matter which number you pick, the number of pain clinics in Broward is dozens higher than the number of McDonald's. We rate this claim True.

At just about every appearance, Allen accurately says that Virginia gained 300,000 jobs when he was governor from 1994 to 1998 and lost 100,000 when Kaine led the state from 2006 to 2010. Kaine addressed that argument during an Oct. 18 debate, noting that he governed during a deep national recession. He told Allen, "You were governor during the Clinton boom years, the biggest expansion of the American economy since World War II." Was there really record economic growth under Bill Clinton’s presidency from 1993 to 2001? We took a look. Kaine’s campaign cited two sources to back the claim: a Forbes magazine ranking from 2004 and an historic chart of the nation’s annual gross domestic product -- the market value of all goods and services produced -- from 1945 to 2000. Forbes created a scale to measure "prosperity" under the 10 presidents from Harry Truman through Clinton. It ranked them on six measures of economic performance: GDP growth, real disposable personal income, employment, unemployment, inflation and deficit reduction. Clinton topped the overall ranking, averaging 3.2. Lyndon B. Johnson came in second, averaging 3.7. He was followed, in order, by John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Truman, Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush, who ranked an average of 8.5. Forbes’ prosperity scale certainly points to good economic years under Clinton. But economic growth, as defined by the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Modern Economics, is measured by changes in GDP. So let’s look at the GDP chart Kaine’s campaign sent, which was adjusted for inflation by using 2005 real dollars. It showed GDP during Clinton’s terms grew from $8.5 trillion in 1993 to $11.2 trillion in 2000. The $2.7 trillion increase was by far the largest under any postwar president. Here’s the ranking of postwar presidents based on GDP growth during their terms that is adjusted to 2005 dollars. We should note that the figures for Barack Obama are from 2009-2011 because annual GDP totals for 2012 are not available. 1. Clinton, 1993-2001, $2.7 trillion. 2. George W. Bush, 2001-2009, $1.7 trillion. 3. Reagan, 1981-1989, $1.6 trillion. 4. Johnson, 1963-1969, $741 billion. 5. Nixon, 1969-1974, $628 billion. 6. Eisenhower, 1953-1961, $484 billion. 7. Carter, 1977-1981, $461 billion. 8. George H.W. Bush, 1989-1993, $401 billion. 9. Obama, 2009-2012, $325 billion. 10. Kennedy, 1961-1963, $310 billion. 11. Ford, 1974-1977, $261 billion. 12. Truman, 1945-1943, $231 billion. But there are a few quirks to this method of cumulative comparison. With the exception of Truman -- who presided during a major reshuffling of the economy at the end of World War II -- the presidents at the top of the GDP list served two terms and those at the bottom served one term or less. And among the two-term presidents, the comparison favors those who served 35 years or more after the war -- Clinton, George W. Bush and and Reagan -- over those who served in its near aftermath -- Truman and Eisenhower. That’s because the GDP, even when adjusted for inflation, has steadily grown and today is more than five times greater than it was at the end of World War II. So, what’s the best way to compare economic expansion under presidents? Economists told us it’s best to measure the average annual rate of real GDP growth in constant dollars. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, ran the calculations for us, starting with the year each president entered office and ending with the year he left. Here’s the ranking of postwar presidents by the annual rate of real GDP growth in inflation-adjusted dollars during their terms. 1. Johnson, 5.2 percent. 2. Kennedy, 4.2 percent. 3. Clinton, 3.9 percent. 4. Reagan, 3.4 percent 5. Carter, 3.2 percent. 6. Eisenhower, 2.9 percent. 7. Nixon, 2.8 percent. 8. Ford, 2.5 percent. 9. George H.W. Bush, 2.1 percent. 10. George W. Bush, 2 percent. 11. Truman, 1.2 percent. 12. Obama, 0.3 percent. Our ruling Kaine said that Clinton presided over "the biggest expansion of the American economy since World War II." He backs his statement by offering a 2004 "prosperity" rating created by Forbes magazine that put Clinton at the top of postwar presidents. Kaine also cites the gross GDP growth, adjusted for inflation, over the administration of each president since 1945 -- a measure that favors recent two-term presidents. A different picture emerges when we use a comparison measure preferred by economists that measures annual average growth in the GDP. Among postwar presidents, LBJ was tops in economic expansion, followed by Kennedy. Clinton was third. There’s no doubt Clinton presided during a strong economic expansion, but not all indicators point to it being a postwar record. We rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-12003	The GOP’s health bill will protect people with pre-existing conditions "every bit as well as Obamacare did."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/22/ron-johnson/graham-cassidy-gop-alternative-obamacare-weakens-p/	How the latest GOP alternative to Obamacare would treat pre-existing conditions is a question repeatedly put to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who is one of the lead co-sponsors of the bill. On Sept. 20, 2017 -- 10 days before a deadline to pass the measure with a simple majority -- there was this exchange between Johnson and Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC’s "MTP Daily" talk show: Todd: "So, you contend that this bill will protect those folks with pre-existing conditions -- period." Johnson: "Every bit as well as Obamacare did. And it’s also going to protect the individuals that can’t afford Obamacare right now." The protections are a major point of contention. The Affordable Care Act makes it illegal for insurers to deny coverage to people who have pre-existing health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or cancer, or charge them higher rates. But under the Johnson-sponsored plan, waivers that would give states new flexibility erode protections for pre-existing conditions. "The only way people (with pre-existing conditions) are protected is if every state in the nation looks at this and says, ‘We’re not going to do that,’" said Karen Pollitz, a health reform and private insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. "This lets states take away your protections." The bill The bill, introduced a week before Johnson’s interview, is known as the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill (or its shorter moniker, Graham-Cassidy). That’s for the GOP senators co-sponsoring the measure: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Dean Heller of Nevada and Johnson. Under Senate rules, the bill could be approved with 51 votes (50 senators plus a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence) if it is adopted by Sept. 30, 2017. After that, Republicans, who hold 52 seats, would need 60 votes, which seems an impossibility. (On Sept. 22, 2017, with eight days left before the deadline, Arizona’s John McCain said he would join two other Senate Republicans who have indicated they would not vote for the bill, potentially dooming its chances.) The bill and pre-existing conditions got heavy attention after late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, whose infant son was born with a congenital heart disease, attacked it on his show the night before Johnson’s interview. (Johnson has also noted in defending the bill that his adult daughter was born with a pre-existing condition.) How it treats pre-existing conditions The bill keeps the Affordable Care Act prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would enable them to opt out of other ACA provisions that protect those people. The upshot: States could allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more than they charge healthy people; and the insurers could offer policies that offer less than the "essential benefits" that are now mandated. PolitiFact National rated Mostly False a claim by President Donald Trump that the bill includes "coverage of pre-existing conditions," finding that: If a state merely says it "intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions," then it can allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones. The federal government could withhold money granted to a state under a waiver if the state doesn’t do as it promised, but the words "adequate" and "affordable" are open to interpretation. Policies would not have to provide the same level of coverage now mandated under Obamacare. Estimates say about 34 states would see net funding cuts under the bill. It costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it. Johnson's claim goes further than Trump’s, saying the bill’s pre-existing protections are as good as Obamacare’s. But in reviewing the GOP bill, the political news website Axios arrived at similar findings: The funding cuts "could pressure states to waive protections for sick people as a way to keep premium increases in check. Older, sicker people in every state could end up paying more as states try to make up for a funding shortfall." States could get a waiver to let insurers charge sick people more than healthy people. A waiver would exempt insurers from the current requirement to provide "essential health benefits," including prescription drugs -- so, people who need expensive drugs might have to pay out of pocket. And Pollitz told us that states could also allow insurance companies to: Charge lower premiums to people while they’re healthy, but then raise the rates at renewal time if, for example, they get cancer. Charge higher premiums based on a person’s location or occupation, practices that are outlawed under Obamacare. Information from the bill’s sponsors say it would protect people with pre-existing conditions, but doesn’t provide details. Patrick McIlheran, a Johnson spokesman, told us the bill gives states the flexibility to try "new approaches to keeping insurance for those with pre-existing conditions affordable." Before we close, it’s worth noting: Writing about the bill in the conservative National Review, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, made one reference to pre-existing conditions, saying: On the positive side, supporters of the legislation correctly point out that it would give the states far more flexibility with the funds they receive, and would allow them to waive many of Obamacare’s more onerous regulations, including the mandate to buy coverage, mandated benefits and pre-existing-condition coverage requirements. Those are the regulations most responsible for driving up premiums and destabilizing insurance markets. Our rating Johnson said the GOP health bill he is co-sponsoring will protect people with pre-existing conditions "every bit as well as Obamacare did." The bill would keep the Affordable Care Act’s prohibition on denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would allow insurers -- unlike under Obamacare -- to charge people with pre-existing conditions premiums and provide them lesser benefits.

pomt-01078	The streetcar project planned by Mayor Tom Barrett would be a "1900s style trolley."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/16/jim-steineke/rep-jim-steineke-says-milwaukee-streetcar-would-be/	Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s plan to move ahead with a $123.9 million downtown streetcar project -- which is approaching an important vote at the Common Council -- has drawn strong reactions from opponents who want to force a citywide vote. Republicans in Madison have joined the criticism, including Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, who linked spending on the the streetcar to possible public financing for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena. "Mayor Barrett, if you have $120 mil to pay for a 1900's style trolley, you certainly don't need state tax $ for a #Bucks arena," Steineke, a Kaukauna Republican, said in a tweet. When we asked Steineke to elaborate beyond 140 characters, he returned to the theme that the streetcars are outdated technology -- akin to the network Milwaukee had for nearly 100 years until the last route ran in the 1950s. "Back then they were not for the yuppie entertainment around in the downtown parts of the city," Steineke said. "We moved away from fixed-rail streetcars 50 years ago as a country." He continued: "Obviously there would be more modern cars and electric systems … but the style of transportation remains consistent." Of course, Barrett isn’t suggesting putting the city’s old streetcar system back into service. The mayor supports a $123.9 million 2.1 mile system, with an 0.4 mile extension to the lake. The Common Council is expected to vote on the proposal Jan. 21, 2015. "Studies and public statements by Milwaukee developers show that a fixed-rail line will encourage development because of the route’s permanence and the transportation alternative it provides," according to an overview of the project prepared by City Engineer Jeff Polenske. Critics counter that it simply takes development away from other areas that are not on the street car line, and that city residents would be better served by an improved bus system with the flexibility to readily change routes. So how would the new system compare with the old? Is Steineke right that the project is an outdated form of transportation? Let’s look at three aspects of the modern streetcar proposal and see how they compare with the city’s previous system. Route and service area Barrett wants a "starter system" based downtown. It would allow for connections to other neighborhoods and -- someday -- destinations far beyond the downtown area such as the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center, Miller Park, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the airport. The previous system began in 1860 with a small network of horse-drawn cars. Those lines eventually grew into a large network powered by electricity. The streetcar became an important part of the city’s fabric -- and the foundation for the city’s electric utility. In terms of routes, it looked more like the current Milwaukee County bus system. In the streetcar’s heyday, Milwaukee had a network of 15 to 20 lines that hauled workers to factories and families to picnics. But ridership declines began in the 1920s as cars became more popular, and after financial troubles the system ceased operation in 1958. So, in terms of scope, the new plan would be much smaller than the old system. But Barrett does have expansion plans in mind. Vehicles Obviously, the new streetcars are …new, compared with those from the past century. They’re air conditioned and quieter, with a "sleek modern look," the city says. The city also notes that the modern system would include "real time technology" that tells riders when the next car is arriving. In addition, the cars would be fully accessible to the disabled and carry more people than the older cars. "In general, describing the proposed system as ‘1900s style’ is accurate but disingenuous," said local historian John Gurda, who has written extensively about the old streetcar system. "Yes, the cars would follow fixed routes on steel rails, like their predecessors, but so do passenger trains. In both cases, the rolling stock of today is markedly different from what our ancestors knew." So, Steineke’s claim is accurate in terms of using fixed rails, but what would run on them would be much different than your grandparents’ streetcar. Old technology vs. new popularity Around the country, there’s a streetcar renaissance of sorts underway. Systems operate in at least seven U.S. cities and the Washington Post reported Nov. 30, 2014 that six systems are under construction, with two others -- Milwaukee and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- in the planning stages. (Not included in that list is Kenosha, the only Wisconsin city with streetcars. That city’s two-mile loop features vintage cars on rails and is aimed at tourists, with links to museums, the downtown and harbor.) Plans to build new streetcar systems have run into opposition in some areas, including Washington, D.C., where the system has been scaled back from 37 miles to about eight. The Post noted concerns that "streetcars can gum up, and get caught in, already busy traffic lanes. In nearby Arlington, Va., public skepticism of the high cost and uncertain benefit of a streetcar line caused officials to cancel an entire project" in November 2014. On the other hand, the system in Portland has expanded five times and now covers eight miles, and Seattle is adding a second route and planning a third. On this point, Steineke is perhaps the most off. There has been a recent burst of streetcar systems, which suggests they are returning in popularity -- not consigned to the history books. Our rating Steineke criticized plans for a new Milwaukee streetcar system, saying the project was a "1900s style trolley." His Twitter followers may not be following the project closely, but Steineke certainly knows Barrett isn’t planning a nostalgic system with old-time or refurbished cars. The city sees the streetcar as a modern transportation system, a building block that could lead to future economic growth. In theory, it’s a catalyst rather than a throwback. And at least some other cities see streetcars in the same light. We rate Steineke’s claim Half True.	None	Jim Steineke	None	None	None	2015-01-16T05:00:00	2014-11-19	['Tom_Barrett_(politician)']
pomt-09346	"The path to ObamaCare becoming law all started with Charlie Crist supporting President Obama's $787 billion stimulus."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/apr/07/marco-rubio/rubio-tries-blame-crist-health-care-overhaul/	Marco Rubio is again trying to link Gov. Charlie Crist to President Barack Obama. Rubio, the former state House speaker and Republican frontrunner for the U.S. Senate, has played and replayed images of Crist hugging Obama when the two campaigned together in Florida on behalf of the federal stimulus. Now Rubio is trying to make a case that Crist, his rival in the Senate race, is to blame for the federal health care overhaul, too. "The path to ObamaCare becoming law all started with Charlie Crist supporting President Obama's $787 billion stimulus," Rubio's campaign said in a recent fundraising e-mail. "Marco is the only candidate you can trust to repeal Obamacare." We know that Charlie + Obama = manhug. And Obama + Congress = health care overhaul. But does Charlie + Obama + stimulus = Obamacare? To be honest, we started this analysis not sure how Rubio's statement could possibly be true. In fact, we wondered if the Rubio campaign aides would just scream 'Uncle" and accept a Pants On Fire. They didn't. "The night Obamacare passed, on the floor of the House, Nancy Pelosi said, in essence, that Obamacare would not be possible without the stimulus," Rubio adviser Alberto Martinez told PolitiFact Florida. "Charlie Crist was instrumental in providing the political support that Barack Obama needed to pass the stimulus." That's a big logical leap, so let's explore the facts behind it. On the fine point about Speaker Pelosi, Martinez is correct that she referenced the stimulus in her health care speech. "We would not be here tonight for sure without the extraordinary leadership and vision of President Barack Obama. We thank him for his unwavering commitment to health care for all Americans," Pelosi said on March 21, 2010. "This began over a year ago under his leadership in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act where we had very significant investments in science, technology, and innovation for health care reform. It continued in the president's budget a few months later, a budget which was a statement of our national values, which allocated resources that were part of our value system and in a way that stabilized our economy, created jobs, lowered taxes for the middle class and did so and reduced the deficit and did so in a way that had pillars of investment, including education and health care reform." The Rubio campaign tried to make hay of the speech the following day, linking Pelosi's words to Crist in a press release. The campaign also posted a video of Pelosi's statement with the headline "Pelosi: Road to ObamaCare began w/Crist-Obama Stimulus," and is now repeating the claim in the fundraising pitch. Charlie and the stimulus No doubt about it, Crist supported, campaigned for and endorsed the federal stimulus bill. But was he instrumental in it passing? Crist campaigned for the stimulus bill with Obama in Fort Myers on Feb. 10, 2009. He made several national television appearances supporting the proposal, saying on Hardball with Chris Matthews, for instance: "It's going to help (Floridians') children. It's going to help their traffic situation. It's going to help produce more jobs here in the Sunshine State. That's a perspective that I have to have as, in essence, the CEO of Florida. And that's why I support it." We also know that Crist lobbied members of Florida's congressional delegation from both parties to support the stimulus package. The Miami Herald reported that Crist lobbied Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, along with Democratic Reps. Kathy Castor and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. But what good did all of that campaigning from a prominent national Republican do? How many votes did he affect in Congress? Was he the lynchpin? Not a whole lot. Not a whole lot. And no. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 passed the U.S. House 244-188, without the support of one Republican (which means no Republicans from Florida). It then passed the U.S. Senate 61-37, with just three Republican votes: Maine's two Republican senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter. (Specter's now a Democrat, by the way.) If you're truly keeping score, the conference report -- the congressional action that merges the House and Senate bills -- passed the House 246-183, again without a single GOP vote, and passed the Senate 60-38 with the votes of Collins, Snowe and Specter. We also checked the Congressional Record to see if members of Congress referenced Crist during floor debate on the stimulus. Crist's name was mentioned once, on Feb. 11, 2009, by Democratic U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton of Ohio. Sutton was talking about Crist's support of the stimulus and how Crist said it could save and create jobs in Florida. So there's nothing to confirm the Rubio campaign's claim that Crist was "instrumental." There's no evidence that Crist's support swayed a single vote. For the Florida delegation -- like all state delegations except Maine and Pennsylvania -- it was strictly a party-line vote. Indeed, Crist was more outlier than influencer, a rare Republican leader who spoke up but was roundly criticized in his party. Brendan Daly, a Pelosi spokesman, said that because no House Republicans supported the bill, that he "does not think Crist was instrumental in passing it." We asked Kate Kelly, a spokesman for Specter, if Crist's support had been a key factor for the Pennsylvania senator. She replied, "Sen. Specter has never mentioned that as a reason he voted for the stimulus." Charlie begat stimulus; stimulus begat health care Now, to the Rubio campaign's claim that the stimulus bill led to health care reform. The stimulus act passed in February 2009 did have health care-related proposals, including a plan to create electronic health care records and about $20 billion to help unemployed workers purchase health care through the employer-based COBRA system. But the stimulus hardly was the impetus for health care reform. And if you read Pelosi's statement again, that's not what she was saying. She was praising Obama and citing some of his accomplishments and notable proposals that included health care. But there's scant evidence of a causal link between the stimulus and health care reform that the Rubio campaign alleges. First, health care reform pre-dates the 2009 economic stimulus by years -- or even decades. Obama made it one of his key domestic policy promises during the 2008 campaign. And the roots of reform can be traced as far back as President Theodore Roosevelt (Obama frequently mentions that the nation has been trying to overhaul health care since then). And of course, the issue came up during the early 1990s when Hillary Clinton chaired the health care task force in the Clinton administration. Second, Rubio has failed to prove a causal connection between the two. It's not like the stimulus bill created some kind of legal foundation for health care reform -- it was a bill filled with tax cuts and spending to boost the economy. And it's not like it provided Obama with a huge surge of momentum. Indeed, more than a year lapsed between the final passage of the stimulus and the health care bill. John Rother, executive vice president of policy and strategy for the AARP, a group that closely followed the health care debate, said there's no link between the stimulus and health care bill. Rubio "might be the only person in America who might make that claim," Rother said. Our ruling So Rubio contends that "The path to ObamaCare becoming law all started with Charlie Crist supporting President Obama’s $787 billion stimulus." The logic is that Crist was instrumental in helping Obama deliver the stimulus, and that the health care reforms would not be possible without the stimulus. We find this wrong on both points. Crist, while a vocal supporter of the stimulus and one of the only major Republicans endorsing the spending plan, did little to sway votes in Congress and get the stimulus bill passed into law. And the stimulus, while it had a few health care provisions, had little to do with the health care bill that eventually was passed by Congress. The seeds for the health care bill were sewn during Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, not at a town hall and hug in Fort Myers. All this to say, our first instinct was right. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10001	"The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/30/house-republicans/GOP-full-of-hot-air-about-Obamas-light-switch-tax/	Taxpayers may have been shocked to learn from House Republicans that President Barack Obama wants to pay for health care by charging them to turn on a light. "The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year," the House Republican Conference said in a Web post and press release titled "Questions on the Budget for President Obama," distributed March 24. "What effect will this have on Americans struggling to pay their mortgages?" it asked. This alleged "light switch tax" is a reference to Obama's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions, and allow companies to trade emissions credits among themselves. That's called a cap-and-trade program, and Republicans say the companies would just pass the tax on to electricity consumers. So any revenue raised by a cap-and-trade program amounts to a "light switch tax" on consumers, the House Republicans alleged. To back up the claim, their staff pointed us to an M.I.T. report that says a similar a cap-and-trade proposal (the administration has not yet detailed their own version) would raise $366 billion per year. If you divide that by the 117 million households in the United States, you find it would cost each household $3,128, they said. But is it that simple? Can you just assume consumers would be out $366 billion since that's how much the program would raise from fuel companies? No. "It's just wrong," said John Reilly, an energy, environmental and agricultural economist at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the report. "It's wrong in so many ways it's hard to begin." Not only is it wrong, but he told the House Republicans it was wrong when they asked him. "Someone from the House Republicans had called me (March 20) and asked about this," Reilly said. "I had explained why the estimate they had was probably incorrect and what they should do to correct it, but I think this wrong number was already floating around by that time." It continues to float. That's just not how economists calculate the cost of a tax proposal, Reilly said. The tax might push the price of carbon-based fuels up a bit, but other results of a cap-and-trade program, such as increased conservation and more competition from other fuel sources, would put downward pressure on prices. Moreover, consumers would get some of the tax back from the government in some form. The report did include an estimate of the net cost to individuals, called the "welfare" cost. It would be $30.89 per person in 2015, or $79 per family if you use the same average household size the Republicans used of 2.56 people. The cost would grow over time as the program ramps up, but the average annual cost over time in today's dollars — that is, the "average annual net present value cost" — is still just $85 per person, Reilly said. That would be $215.05 per household. A far cry from $3,128. And that isn't the only inaccuracy in the claim. The Republican press release said the cap-and-trade program would pay for "nationalized health care." But Obama's health care proposal is not for "nationalized health care." It does call for a "National Health Insurance Exchange" with private insurance options plus a new public plan based on the one currently available to members of Congress — but consumers could still keep their private insurance if they want, as Obama emphasized during his presidential campaign. Even if it were true that Obama wants to nationalize health care, he does not envision paying for health care reform with the cap-and-trade program as the Republicans alleged. Rather, his $634 billion health care reserve fund is to come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper-income taxpayers, according to Obama's proposed budget. The House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim, changing their Web site and sending out an updated press release that says the cap-and-trade program would pay for "increased spending" rather than health care. But it still calls cap-and-trade a "light switch tax" and claims the whole cost would come from consumers. If the Republicans had simply misstated the results of the MIT study, the Truth-O-Meter would have been content giving this one a False. But for them to keep repeating the claim after the author of the study told them it was wrong means we have to set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire. Update, May 6, 2009 Two days after we published this item, Reilly sent a letter to Rep. John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House, complaining that his study "has been misrepresented in recent press releases distributed by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The press release claims our report estimates an average cost per family of a carbon cap and trade program that would meet targets now being discussed in Congress to be over $3,000, but that is nearly 10 times the correct estimate, which is approximately $340." (The $340 is a cost per family of four, comparable to the $215 we used as the cost per household of 2.56 people.) Reilly said it was "simplistic and misleading" to interpret the statistics the way the Republicans did because the administration's cap and trade proposal has "been designed to offset the energy cost impacts on middle and lower income households." A day later Boehner responded with a statement that insisted $3,128 was accurate. "In reality, it would be a tax of up to $3,100 per family on every American family that drives a car, buys products manufactured in the United States, or flips on a light switch," Boehner said in the statement. On April 22, the conservative Weekly Standard came to the defense of the Republicans and published an article that said Reilly had erred in calculating the cost. It said that Reilly had since corrected the figure from the original $340 to $800. The article by John McCormack, an editorial assistant at the publication, said that even with the corrected figure, Reilly was "still low-balling the cost of cap and trade by using some fuzzy logic. In reality, cap and trade could cost the average household more than $3,900 per year." The Weekly Standard noted that Obama plans to use some of the cap-and-trade revenues to fund his "making work pay" tax credit of $400 per individual and $800 per family per year but then did not reflect that plan in the ultimate cost to households. It said there was no proof that Reilly is correct to assume that "the $3,128 will be 'returned' to each household." The article also said that our PolitiFact item was incorrect because we relied on Reilly's numbers. Several PolitiFact readers who apparently believe that Reilly's corrected figure means the Republicans are now accurate, wrote to us and urged us to publish a correction. So we have revisited the numbers to provide this update. First, we should emphasize that our original item was simple and straightforward. The Republicans said their claim was based on the MIT study. But Reilly, the author of that study, said the Republicans were misrepresenting his work. And not only that, he said he'd told them they were misrepresenting his work before they made the claim, and they made the claim anyway. That struck us as an egregious falsehood. And it's important to recognize that our Pants on Fire rating was on the overall statement that, "The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year." The first part of that statement about nationalized health care is completely false. The Obama administration is not proposing nationalized health care, a phrase we believe is meant to invoke fears of socialized medicine. Yet Republicans have repeatedly made that inaccurate claim. So that part of the claim was and remains ridiculously false. Now, in light of Reilly's revised number and Boehner's refusal to change what he says, let's reconsider the second part of the claim, that the Obama administration is proposing "a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year." First, calling it a light switch tax remains incorrect. That implies that it is a federal tax levied on consumers when in fact it is an extrapolation of the per-family burden of a new federal charge that would be levied on energy companies. To say it "would cost every American household $3,128 a year" suggests tremendous precision. But we have found virtually no precision about anything to do with the cap and trade proposals because they are still very much just in the talking stages. Indeed, the House Democratic version is known as the "discussion draft" and, although there are some broad concepts, key details about how the program would work, its ultimate cost and how Americans would be reimbursed for higher energy costs are still far from final. But, given Reilly's corrected number, is it now accurate to say it will cost every household $3,128 a year? No, it's not. As we said in our original item, Reilly's analysis has produced two different ways to measure the cost of a cap and trade system. One way is the total estimate of federal revenues from a cap and trade auction, which indeed works out to $3,128 per family in the United States. That's the amount of money the energy companies would have to pay the federal government, and presumably the companies would pass those costs to consumers through higher prices. The issue then becomes whether or not the Obama administration intends to offset that cost to families. Republicans take the position, which was echoed by the Weekly Standard, that the Obama administration has no such plans. Reilly says the administration does. Who's right? Of course, we can't really know what the administration intends to do, but the available record makes it pretty clear that the White House has made plans to return to families the money the cap and trade program might cost them in energy bills. Some of it -- $400 per year for individuals, $800 for families -- would go directly back to families through the "making work pay" tax credit totalling $65 billion per year, according to the Obama budget proposal . An additional $15 billion per year would benefit them indirectly through research and development on clean energy technologies. And the budget specifies that "all additional net proceeds will be used to further compensate the public." That backs up Reilly's claim that the $3,128 is effectively returned to people. The second way to look at the cost of cap and trade is through the impact the proposal would have on the overall economy -- the extent to which the new system would constrain the economy and slow its growth. That's the source of Reilly's $340 number, which he has corrected to $800. That number is still far short of the very precise $3,128 the Republicans have been using. And Republican leaders continue to toss around the $3,100 number, often with no caveats or qualifiers -- or mention of the $800. We called Reilly to get his reaction to the article in the Weekly Standard and the Republicans' latest claim . He said the Weekly Standard editorial assistant who wrote the story "just completely twisted the whole thing." He said his correction to the $800 figure didn't substantially improve the accuracy of what the Republicans are contending. Their claim "is a misrepresentation. They are basing (the $3,128) on our study and that is an incorrect use of our study. It's false." Here at PolitiFact, we're sure there will be plenty of other claims in the next few months that will allow us to further examine the cost of a cap and trade proposal. This claim has centered on Reilly's two-year-old study, but other studies have been done more recently and will soon be in the political mix. But for now, this claim remains a serious distortion in many ways. It is a ridiculous falsehood to say the money is being used "for nationalized health care." It is inaccurate to call it a "light switch tax." And it is incorrect to cite a precise "tax" of $3,128 -- with no caveats or qualifiers -- when the Obama administration has specified how the money would be returned to people. Given Reilly's comments that they are using his numbers improperly, we see nothing to change our conclusion. So our original ruling stands: Pants on Fire. - Bill Adair, PolitiFact Editor	None	House Republican Conference	None	None	None	2009-03-30T11:24:41	2009-03-24	['United_States']

pomt-13462	Says Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has "ties to the Muslim Brotherhood."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/14/sean-duffy/top-hillary-clinton-aide-has-ties-muslim-brotherho/	Interviewed on CNN as a Donald Trump surrogate, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy attacked Hillary Clinton for several minutes for having coughing fits and then took aim at one of her longtime aides, Huma Abedin. After the Aug. 23, 2016 exchange turned testy, the Wisconsin Republican told host Brianna Keilar she was the one who raised the coughing issue. Then this back-and-forth about Abedin ensued: Duffy: Why aren’t we talking then about Huma and her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood? Why aren’t we talking about the fact that she was an editor for a pro-Sharia newspaper? Keilar: She doesn’t have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Duffy: The information is out there that she does have these ties. Keilar: Uh, no. The Washington Post Fact Checker has already knocked down Duffy’s allegation. And, when we asked for backup, Duffy’s office cited to us only a New York Post column that didn’t directly allege any ties between Abedin and the Muslim Brotherhood. What is Muslim Brotherhood? The Muslim Brotherhood for years has been cast in a negative light by some Republican politicians. In 2012, then-U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., sent a letter to the deputy inspector general of the State Department. At the time, Clinton was secretary of state and Abedin was her deputy chief of staff. Bachmann (now a Trump campaign adviser) asked for an investigation, citing information that claimed Abedin’s mother, brother and late father were "connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations." In March 2016, when Trump and then-presidential candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich appeared in Milwaukee for a CNN Republican Town Hall event, Cruz called the Muslim Brotherhood a "terrorist organization." But a CNN news report debunked the Texas senator’s claim. The report pointed out that the Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamist organization with active branches in many Middle Eastern countries that was founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion, but a way of life and advocates for a move away from secularism -- and that it has never appeared on the U.S. State Department’s list of terrorist organizations, although Egypt and several other countries have put the group on their lists. Earlier that month, Cruz and other Republicans had tried to have the Muslim Brotherhood designated as a terrorist group. At the time, U.S. News & World Report described the group as an Egyptian Islamist organization dedicated to instilling Islamic law (Sharia) based on the teachings of the Quran and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. Experts said the group has not been involved in terrorism, rather it has functioned as a social organization and a political organization that participates in elections -- a description similar to one provided in a 2015 article in the Middle East Journal, an academic publication. Recent Abedin references Duffy’s staff cited a Paul Sperry column published two days before Duffy’s CNN interview. The column said that from 1996 to 2008, Abedin was an editor at the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs working under her mother, Saleha Abedin, who remains editor-in-chief. The column called the journal "a radical Muslim publication that opposed women’s rights and blamed the US for 9/11." But the column made no mention of the Muslim Brotherhood. An opinion piece by Trump supporter Kenneth Timmerman in The Hill, which piggybacked on the Sperry column, did mention the brotherhood -- but in a roundabout way, in relation to Abedin. The piece said Abedin’s father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs; that the institute was supported by the Muslim World League; and that the league has been called "perhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world." The piece also said Abedin’s mother, Saleha Abedin, sits on the Presidency Staff Council of the International Islamic Council for Da’wa and Relief, a group that is chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi. A fact check The Washington Post Fact Checker, after interviewing a number of experts, called the connections "so tenuous as to be obscure," and concluded: Duffy asked why the alleged Muslim Brotherhood connections to Huma Abedin are not being talked about. Perhaps it’s because they are bogus. Abedin has lived in the United States for 23 years, working in the White House, the Senate and the State Department. Vague suggestions of suspicious-sounding connections to her parents don’t pass the laugh test, even at the flimsiest standard of guilt by association. The Fact Checker gave Duffy four pinocchios -- its lowest rating. And we’ve found no evidence to support Duffy’s claim, either. Our rating Duffy says Clinton aide Huma Abedin has "ties to the Muslim Brotherhood." Duffy made the claim in the context of stories in the presidential campaign that get relatively little media coverage. But he cited no evidence to back his statement, and we couldn’t find any. We rate his statement False.	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2016-09-14T05:00:00	2016-08-23	['None']
pomt-06860	The debt ceiling deal will result in "the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/02/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-debt-ceiling-deal-lowers-domesti/	During his July 31, 2011, remarks announcing an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama offered a bit of historical context. "The first part of this agreement will cut about $1 trillion in spending over the next 10 years -- cuts that both parties had agreed to early on in this process," Obama said. "The result would be the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president -- but at a level that still allows us to make job-creating investments in things like education and research. We also made sure that these cuts wouldn’t happen so abruptly that they’d be a drag on a fragile economy." We received a number of requests to check Obama’s claim that the debt ceiling deal will result in "the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president." So we are checking it. First, we’ll need to explain the term "domestic spending," because in the past, Obama has used a slightly different term. In February, we rated a similar comment by Obama. Back then, he said that under his own budget proposal -- which was not enacted -- "domestic discretionary spending (would be at) its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president." Domestic discretionary spending is generally defined as spending that (a) is not defense- or security-related, (b) is appropriated by Congress rather than being set by a formula (which is how funding for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is determined) and (c) is not used to pay interest on the debt. Domestic discretionary spending includes a broad range of spending categories, from air traffic control to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When we looked at Obama’s February comment, we found that according to White House budget projections, domestic discretionary spending under Obama’s proposal would indeed fall by 2015 to its lowest level since the early 1960s. That would come in the middle of Obama’s second term, if he wins one. We concluded that there was some merit to criticism that longer term "projections" about future reductions to discretionary spending were less meaningful than the ones proposed for the subsequent year. On that basis, and a few others, we rated Obama's claim Half True. The phrasing in the more recent statement is different. On July 31, Obama referred to "the lowest level of annual domestic spending." Taking Obama literally, he would be referring not just to domestic discretionary spending, as before, but domestic mandatory spending as well, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. We didn't think that’s what he meant to say -- and the White House confirmed that it was not -- but at PolitiFact, words matter, so we’ll calculate the numbers both ways to be sure. Using the more traditional definition -- that is, non-defense discretionary spending, excluding domestic mandatory spending -- Obama is on pretty solid ground. The Office of Management and Budget has a historical table showing non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, going back to 1962. (Two brief and fairly minor caveats: 1961 was Eisenhower’s last budget, so the available data only goes back to the start of John F. Kennedy’s presidency, and a small portion of "domestic" discretionary spending is actually diplomatic in nature and thus international rather than domestic. But it’s a pretty small portion of the entire budget, so we’ll ignore it in our calculations.) The OMB table shows that since 1962, non-defense discretionary spending has ranged from between about 3.2 percent of GDP and 5.2 percent of GDP. So the question is whether the debt ceiling deal just struck will lower domestic discretionary spending below 3.2 percent of GDP. It does, according to calculations we made using Congressional Budget Office figures. To do this, we used three sets of statistics: the caps on discretionary spending set in the budget deal (table 1 here), the projected gross domestic product for each year from now until 2021 (table D-2 here) and the ratio between defense discretionary spending and non-defense discretionary spending (calculated from table 3-1 here). Because CBO only provided figures for discretionary spending as a whole, we first determined that defense spending is expected to account for about 54 percent of all discretionary spending through 2021, and non-defense spending is expected to account for 46 percent. So we divided the capped amount of discretionary spending set in the debt deal by the projected GDP for the appropriate year, then multiplied the result by 46 percent to determine how much non-defense discretionary spending represented as a percentage of GDP. We found that non-defense discretionary spending started as 3.6 percent of GDP in 2012, then would fall to 3.1 percent by 2014 and 2.5 percent by 2021. (This assumes GDP grows as projected, but these are the best numbers we have.) So, starting in 2014, non-defense discretionary spending is poised to fall below the lowest level it reached between 1962 and the present, and that percentage continues to decline through 2021. Using this measurement, then, Obama is correct. However, it’s important to note a few caveats. First, as we noted, Obama referred to "the lowest level of annual domestic spending." Using a strict definition of these words, the numbers would have to include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- and by this standard, Obama would be wrong. Those programs currently account for roughly 13 percent to 14 percent of GDP -- several times the share allocated to non-defense discretionary spending. The combination of these two percentages will be bigger -- even under the deal -- than in many of the years since 1962. Second, Obama implied that the debt deal deserves credit for achieving "the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president." In fact, the federal budget was already on a course to do this before the debt ceiling deal was struck. Earlier this year, CBO published projections (table 3-1 here) showing that non-defense discretionary spending would fall to 3.2 percent by 2019 and 3.1 percent in 2020 and 2021. The deal did have two important effects, however. It sped up the process -- setting a new post-1962 low by 2014 rather than by 2019 -- and it put the projections into law. So where does this leave us? Obama would have been right if he’d said the debt deal would reduce non-defense discretionary spending to its lowest level since 1962. If current projections of GDP are accurate, it would do so by 2014. And the deal deserves some credit for both accelerating the timetable for that achievement and enshrining it in law for the first time. But that’s not what Obama said. He said that the deal would bring "the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower." By not specifying that he was referring to "discretionary" spending, Obama is wrong, since the expenses for mandatory domestic programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will remain high in the years ahead. According to the White House, that's not what he meant, but he still said what he said. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-10804	"McCain Trying to Have it Both Ways on Iraq"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/03/democratic-national-committee/or-maybe-iraq-isnt-that-simple/	Sen. John McCain's television ad in which he touts his history of criticizing the Bush administration on Iraq has drawn the fire of the Democratic National Committee. In a news release on Oct. 3, 2007, the DNC declared, "McCain Trying to Have it Both Ways on Iraq." Here's the DNC's full charge: "After years of supporting President Bush's failed strategy in Iraq, and after leading the charge for the Bush-McCain escalation of that war, John McCain is trying to have it both ways by trying to cast himself as a longtime critic of the administration while at the same time refusing to change course on the war." Well, yes, that's true. McCain is indeed trying to cast himself as a longtime critic of the administration while staying the course in Iraq. More to the point, though, it's accurate. McCain actually has been a longtime critic of the administration on Iraq, even as he has advocated a sustained and larger military presence there. But saying that's "having it both ways" is just the kind of oversimplifying of facts the Democrats love to accuse the White House of doing. A bit like saying that opposing U.S. involvement Iraq is the same as opposing the war on terrorism. McCain's ad is part of an attempt to distinguish himself from the president on Iraq. The Democrats point out that McCain has been wedded to the president's overall war policy, and like President Bush, McCain has displayed a tendency to offer rosy predictions about the outcome in Iraq, even as conditions didn't seem to be improving much. All of that is true, and there's no shortage of evidence. "I think the situation on the ground is going to improve," McCain told the Hill newspaper on Dec. 8, 2005. "I do think that progress is being made in a lot of Iraq. Overall, I think a year from now, we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course. If I thought we weren't making progress, I'd be despondent." As the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain has been a tireless supporter of the war, and he has robustly defended the president's ability to wage the war as he saw fit. Arguing Sept. 19, 2007, against an amendment that would have required troops to spend as much time at home as they spent in Iraq before being sent back to Iraq, McCain said this on the Senate floor: "Clearly the message I am getting from the troops in the field is not that the war is lost. ... We are succeeding and we are winning. And with the enactment of this amendment, we will choose to lose. This is setting a formula for surrender, not for victory. "I am hearing from the troops in the field three words, three words: Let us win. They have sacrificed a great deal. ... Now give them a chance to win. That is what they want. They do not want that sacrifice to be in vain." McCain was calling for more troops and resources as far back as 2003, just months after the invasion. He criticized former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for two years before Rumsfeld resigned. In speeches and interviews, he frequently warned that failure to change tactics would lead to a long and difficult fight. In fact, it's common for McCain to express his concerns about the U.S. strategy in Iraq and his belief in the U.S. mission there in the same speech. "We have made many, many mistakes since 2003 and these will not be easily reversed," McCain said during a Jan. 5, 2007, panel discussion at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. "Even greater than the cost thus far, and in the future, however, are the catastrophic consequences that would ensue from our failure in Iraq." McCain's positions on Iraq underscore the complexity of the war as a political issue, and of McCain's unique position as supporter and critic. It may prove difficult for voters to get the nuance. It also may offer a little insight into why the other top-tier presidential candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike, are treading a bit more lightly. The DNC's critique of McCain has at its core a nugget of truth about how McCain supports the war while being critical of how it has been conducted. But we find the DNC's claim that this is "having it both ways" to be a Barely True presentation of the facts. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2007-10-03T00:00:00	2007-10-03	['Iraq']
pomt-10072	"Geithner still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Service flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/16/competitive-enterprise-institute/geithners-second-crack-squaring-taxes/	Honest mistake. That's the line from the Obama team about the tax problems that have sparked controversy about treasury secretary nominee Timothy Geithner. The IRS audited Geithner in 2006 and found that he failed to pay self-employment taxes on compensation he received as an employee of the International Monetary Fund for tax years the IRS was looking at, 2003 and 2004. By law, the IRS could not audit him for years prior to 2003. So Geithner paid $16,732 in back self-employment tax and interest. The IRS waived penalties for those years. As far as the IRS was concerned, case closed. Fast forward to late 2008. The Obama transition team began to vet Geithner in preparation for Obama nominating him to his Cabinet. The transition team found a few problems in Geithner's previous tax returns, including the fact that in addition to not paying self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, he also didn't pay them for 2001 and 2002. So last month, Geithner voluntarily amended his tax returns for those years and wrote a check to the IRS for another $25,970. His nomination followed immediately after. Some opponents of Geithner's nomination find this second payment particularly troubling. "Treasury Secretary Nominee Timothy Geithner's failure to pay four years’ worth of self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare is absolutely astonishing," John Berlau, director of the Center for Investors & Entrepreneurs at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in a news release on Jan. 14, 2009. "And as more details are released, Geithner's actions seem even more disturbing. According to the New York Times, Geithner still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years. To have him leading the department that manages the IRS would be a slap in the face to the millions of self-employed Americans who fulfill their responsibilities to correctly asses their tax burdens." Berlau's organization is a conservative think tank "dedicated to the principles of free enterprise and limited government." His criticism is typical of those who are opposing Geithner's nomination. By some accounts, it can be confusing for IMF employees to figure out their tax obligation. As an international organization, the IMF is exempt from the FICA and Social Security taxes that most Americans get deducted from their paychecks automatically. U.S. nationals who work for the IMF in the United States are required pay them on their own. But let's put aside for the moment the issue of whether Geithner should have known he was obligated to pay the self-employment taxes (Republicans have correctly noted that Geithner got ample documentation from the IMF informing him of his tax obligation). There's still the issue of the 2001 and 2002 taxes that Geithner didn’t pay until the presidential transition team pointed it out. First off, tax experts say that due to a statute of limitations, Geithner was under no legal obligation to pay the taxes related to 2001 and 2002. The IRS could only go back three years. So Geithner was legally in the clear. But considering that the IMF pays extra money to U.S. employees, on top of their regular salary, to offset those self-employment taxes, some have questioned whether Geithner had a moral or ethical obligation to square up with the government. After the IRS pointed out in 2006 that Geithner had not paid his self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, it stands to reason Geithner would then have known that he also didn’t pay in 2001 and 2002. "You have to ask yourself, 'Would you do it?'" asked Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center. That's an issue the Senate Finance Committee overseeing Geithner's confirmation hearing will have to weigh. But as for Berlau's statement that Geithner "still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years," Berlau is right. Geithner didn’t make good on the previous years until he learned he was in line to be treasury secretary. We rule the statement True.

pomt-12450	"We got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years" under Barack Obama.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-pants-fire-claim-air-force-pilots-force/	Lauding Republican legislation that would increase defense spending, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan attacked former President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress, charging they had put the military in a "readiness crisis." And he made a claim -- about the Air Force and museums, of all things -- that we want to check. "Under President Obama, Democrats insisted that an increase in defense spending be tied to an equal increase in non-defense spending," the Wisconsin Republican said at a news conference on May 2, 2017. "You want to help the troops? You want to help the military? I need just as much money for domestic discretionary spending. "That was the Obama rule that we lived under for eight years. They insisted on this even as our military plunged further and further into a readiness crisis. Well, we got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years." So, this is a sweeping claim: Air Force pilots, crippled by inadequate funding, being forced to scavenge for parts in museums to keep their own planes flying. Typically we don’t use many quotes in our fact checks. But in this case, they seem to tell the story about Ryan’s claim: "That’s a grotesque distortion," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group Corp., which does research on the aerospace and defense industry. "It’s grossly misleading," said Benjamin Friedman, a Cato Institute defense and homeland security studies research fellow. "While I admire Ryan, and agree that there are some problems in military readiness, this kind of hyperbole needs to be called out," said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Ryan’s evidence Ryan’s staff noted to us that PolitiFact Texas in July 2016 checked a similar but much more involved claim made by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Our colleagues found that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz. -- a practice that goes back decades because it saves money and keeps the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made. But that fact check didn’t get to whether the Air Force takes what seems like a more desperate step of sending parts hunters to museums. The only example Ryan’s office cited was a May 2016 Fox News article in which an Air Force captain said spare parts needed for a B-1 bomber at a base in South Dakota were taken from seven "museum aircraft" from around the country, including the South Dakota Air and Space Museum. So, Ryan’s evidence is pretty thin: An isolated example to back a broad claim. Expert views Conversely, more than a half dozen experts confirmed to us that it has been common for decades to retrieve parts in military airplane "boneyards." Indeed, that is one of the main purposes for collecting and preserving older planes at such sites. Davis-Monthan, according to AirplaneBoneyards.com, is the largest aircraft boneyard in the world. Known officially as the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, the boneyard has more than 4,400 aircraft from the Air Force, other military branches and other federal agencies, according to the base. Besides storing aircraft that can be tapped for parts, the base also restores planes to put them back into operation. The boneyard also offers tours. But that hardly makes it a museum. As for Ryan’s slap at the Obama administration’s military spending, PolitiFact National found in December 2015 that the spending did drop during Obama’s tenure. But O’Hanlon, Todd Harrison at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Laicie Heeley at the Stimson Center and other defense experts agreed that lack of funds has not been a problem in terms of the Air Force finding spare parts. Our rating Saying the military was plunged into a readiness crisis under Obama, Ryan claimed: "We got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years." It is a broad claim, but his office cited only one news article that quoted an Air Force captain as saying parts for seven planes were obtained from "museum aircraft." Meanwhile, defense experts told us that Ryan’s claim was highly misleading, in that any such museum scrounging, if it has ever occurred, is isolated. Indeed, the Air Force operates a base whose main functions include storing thousands of planes to be available for spare parts. The experts also agreed that even as defense spending dropped under Obama, the Air Force had sufficient funding to prevent the need for pilots to hunt for airplane parts in museums. We rate Ryan’s claim Pants on Fire. Editor's note: This item was updated on June 9, 2017 to say that the Fox News report did identify one museum. That information does not change the rating.

pomt-02998	Says "nearly 30,000" federal employees in Oregon were furloughed during the government shutdown.	false	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/17/suzanne-bonamici/were-30000-oregonians-employed-federal-government-/	The federal government is finally reopening its doors, and hundreds of thousands of furloughed employees are back on the job. Still, the cost to the economy lingers. Recently, Standard & Poor’s, the financial services company, estimated that the 16-day shutdown cost the U.S. economy some $24 billion. In an opinion piece published on OregonLive.com a few days before the government reopened, U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., bemoaned such costs. "The government shutdown is already causing damage," she wrote. "Veterans’ benefits have been held up, national parks and museums are closed, federal research has been halted, and small business loan applications are not being processed. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees, including nearly 30,000 in Oregon, have been furloughed, and millions more continue to do their jobs without knowing when they’ll receive a paycheck." The consequences of the political brinksmanship are no doubt profound. Still, the piece about 30,000 Oregonians being on furlough caught our attention. We’d read lots of articles that mentioned the state’s nearly 30,000 federal employees, but surely they weren't all on furlough, right? We started where we usually do, with the source, and called the representative’s office. Bonamici’s spokesman, Mike Morosi, looked into the matter and quickly issued a clarification. "The Oregonian and other news outlets have reported that there are approximately 30,000 federal employees in the state of Oregon," read the widely circulated clarification. "The precise number of federal employee furloughs fluctuated throughout the duration of the 16 day shutdown. Our office has requested an analysis of furloughs in Oregon, but it will take some time before that information is made available. "The guest editorial was careful to not claim that all federal employees in Oregon had been furloughed, but the use of the word ‘nearly’ may have been an overstatement. Some news reports indicate that roughly a third of federal employees nationwide have been furloughed, but that number differs greatly by agency and state. "In the absence of more specific information, it would have been more appropriate to say that ‘many of the approximately 30,000 federal employees in Oregon have been furloughed.’ " We asked Morosi how long it would take to get the furlough analysis the representative’s office has requested. Unfortunately, he said, it could take longer than a week given how backlogged much of the federal government is following the shutdown. The quick response and clarification from the office was definitely appreciated, but PolitiFact Oregon generally continues to pursue the question even if the speaker admits a mistake. Words matter and such statements can last a long time in the political arena, even if they are revised later. So we called Nick Beleiciks, a state employment economist with the Oregon Labor Market Information System. He told us that the most recent data put the state’s number of federal workers at 26,926. Of those, 6,567 work for the U.S. Postal Service and were not furloughed. That left a possible 20,000 employees. But even that number is an overstatement because 3,500 work for federally run hospitals such as the Veterans Affairs medical centers. And 3,000 work for federal environmental programs and nearly 1,500 in national security and international affairs positions, including the Transportation Security Administration. Now, some of those 8,000 employees may have been furloughed, but others were considered essential and continue to work and still others, like those working for Veterans Affairs, have positions funded a year in advance or through other sources. That is all to say that the number of Oregon workers on furlough was not "nearly 30,000." In fact, State Economist Mark McMullen told Oregonian reporter Molly Young that about "one-thid of those employees, or about 9,000 workers" would likely be furloughed when the shutdown first began. In our various discussions, Morosi did note that those working still had to forgo paychecks. They’ll receive back pay, but until the government opened again, checks couldn’t be written. That was no doubt a huge strain on many households -- it certainly would be for ours -- and it’s good context. Bonamici said nearly 30,000 federal employees in Oregon were furloughed because of the government shutdown. Now it’s true that those nearly 30,000 federal employees in Oregon were affected by the shutdown, but they weren’t all furloughed. We’d love to have the full forthcoming analysis requested by the representative’s office, but even without its specifics, we know this statement isn’t accurate. We rate this statement False.

pomt-06583	Stimulus money funded a government board that made recommendations that would cost 378,000 jobs and $28.3 billion in sales.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/27/paul-broun/broun-stimulus-money-funded-effort-will-kill-jobs/	Hey, Chester the Cheetah. You think it ain’t easy bein’ cheesy? Well, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens says that the federal government wants to hang your hide on its wall. And it could take down hundreds of thousands of jobs with you. Republican Broun tweeted his concern for the Cheetos snack food mascot during President Barack Obama’s Sept. 8 jobs speech before Congress. Food company critics are targeting Chester for extinction because they think using cartoon characters to sell junk food fuels childhood obesity. As you may remember, Broun has taken to sitting out joint sessions, such as January’s State of the Union Address, so he can tweet critiques of the president real-time. Chester came up in the second of a four-part list explaining why Broun thinks the country doesn’t need the new jobs bill. The president could simply change his policies, Broun argued. "2) Stimulus $ study on food advertising: proj -$28.3 billion in sales and -378,000 #jobs – just to keep Chester the Cheetah off the air," he tweeted. Feds are willing to kill off that much of the economy to restrict food marketing to children? And they’re doing this with stimulus money? Chester better trade those sunglasses for a bulletproof vest. And we’d better check Broun’s facts. In 2009, Congress created the Interagency Working Group on Food Marketed to Children to study and recommend standards for efforts with a large audience of 17 years old or younger. In April, the working group recommended voluntary guidelines that would reduce kids’ exposure to pitches for products that don’t meet certain nutritional guidelines. Targeting children through television, radio, print, company-sponsored websites, email and text messaging, product placement, toy branding, sports team sponsorships, and other methods would cease. Chester’s defenders pounced. A Broun spokesman referred us to an Aug. 29 paper published by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. It said that "even the working group concluded that the guidelines would result in a 20 percent reduction in ad expenditures that would in turn cause losses of $28.3 billion in manufacturing and retail sales and 378,000 jobs lost by 2015." But the working group did not come to this conclusion. Economic analysis firm IHS Global Insight wrote the report. We also noticed that the Heritage Foundation’s numbers are off, as are those in Broun’s tweet. The IHS report actually says that from 2011 through 2015, lost sales would total $152 billion. The predicted loss of $28.3 billion is for 2011 alone. Furthermore, stimulus dollars did not fund the group, as Broun asserted. Records show the board was created by a separate bill and was funded by the regular budgets of the agencies involved. Now, IHS Global Insight’s analysis does not fit the accepted definition of a "study," as Broun called it. It wasn’t peer-reviewed or conducted by an independent professional. It was funded by opponents of the guidelines. Most importantly, its methodology wasn’t transparent. Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti and IHS spokesman Mike Raimondi defended the IHS report, saying the firm is well-regarded (it is the successor to a research organization founded by a 1980 winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics) and guideline opponents were not fishing for numbers to suit their claims. Food manufactures actually thought IHS’ report underestimated how much the guidelines would hurt the economy, Griffanti said. Raimondi said he could not provide detailed information on the findings because IHS did not write a more comprehensive report. He said the results were based on federal and industry data and decades of research. PolitiFact Georgia showed IHS’ report to three marketing professors. They all had reservations with the report’s fundamental assumption: that food and beverage advertising spending would drop 20 percent. IHS did not publish how it reached its conclusions, so other experts cannot check them. "Based on this type of reasoning without any support, I could just as easily assume that there would be smaller decreases. There’s no way of telling," said Jerome Williams, a Rutgers University marketing professor who has studied food marketing to children. In fact, marketing spending might not decline at all, experts said. Companies could redirect the cash to promote healthier kids foods or sell salty snacks to grown-ups. IHS did not look into this possibility, Raimondi said. Ad spending could even increase, Williams said. After the federal government banned cigarette advertising on radio and television in 1971, U.S. cigarette marketing spending grew. In 1970, it totaled $361 million, according to the Federal Trade Commission. In 1975, it was more than $491 million; in 1976, it was $639 million. Broun’s camp rejected the tobacco analogy because the proposed voluntary guidelines would block ads on shows with big adult audiences, as well as marketing techniques beyond broadcast such as product placement. That said, independent scholars haven’t corroborated the IHS report, noted University of Arizona professor Dale Kunkel, an expert on food marketing to children. And while the voluntary guidelines could lead to job losses, they could also create jobs for those who develop and market healthier foods, Emory University marketing professor Douglas Bowman said. Published reports show that food manufactures are innovating in response to child obesity concerns. For instance, Cheetos no longer advertises to children, but the brand is still growing, especially in the Latino market, an executive said last year during a PepsiCo investor event. He said it was rolling out Cheetos with less sodium and fat in Brazil. Griffanti said job creation is unlikely because food companies are continuously updating their products. In sum, while Broun does have a point that jobs could be affected by the guidelines, his claim is deeply flawed. Stimulus dollars did not fund the group that produced the voluntary guidelines. The report that predicted major economic losses was not a true study. Plus, there’s evidence to think that advertising spending won’t plummet. And since the guidelines are voluntary, companies could avoid implementing the bits they think would be too tough on their bottom lines. Or they could ignore them altogether. Chester, take heart. You still have a chance. We rate Broun’s claim False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-09-27T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['None']
abbc-00238	The campaign for the March 17 South Australian state election is in full swing, with both major parties releasing extensive "plans" after drip-feeding the release of several other policies.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-06/fact-check-election-has-labor-adopted-liberal-policies/9475898	Mr Marshall's claim is in the ballpark. His claim refers to five policies, but his spokesman, when approached by Fact Check, pointed to six policies that the Opposition claims Labor has poached. In four of the six cases, the Liberals did announce very similar policies ahead of Labor. The fourth case — a policy on home batteries — was first announced by the Liberals, and while Labor later announced an arguably more generous policy, it was not included in its 2017 "Energy Plan". When it comes to the other two cases, the record is mixed. The Liberals were the first party to promise a wide rollout of phonics testing, but this followed on from a trial in selected schools previously instituted by the Labor Government. It is arguable that the full rollout was an expected follow-on from the trial. The other policy the Liberal spokesman pointed to — a policy on drug rehabilitation orders — differs from Labor's proposal. And Labor says it is still considering the precise form its policy will take. It is also impossible to know whether Labor would have announced the same policies in the absence of earlier Liberal announcements, or exactly when it had finalised a specific policy. What is clear, however, is that the policies that the Liberals and Labor share only constitute a small proportion of all the policies and initiatives being proposed in the campaign.

pomt-04667	Mitt Romney "said it was 'tragic' to end the war in Iraq."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-said-it-was-tragic-end-war-iraq/	President Barack Obama portrayed himself as seasoned on foreign policy and Mitt Romney as new to the world stage during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. "You know, in a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven. Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did," he said. "My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy, but from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly." Obama then went through a long list of complaints about Romney’s foreign policy views, including this one: "My opponent said it was ‘tragic’ to end the war in Iraq." PolitiFact is evaluating other claims from Obama’s speech. Here, we wondered if Obama correctly quoted Romney as saying it was "tragic" to end the war in Iraq. Back in October 2011, Obama announced that all troops would leave by the end of the year. Obama had always intended to draw down forces in Iraq, but by the end of 2011, the administration couldn’t reach an agreement with the Iraqi government on the size of the residual force. In the final days leading up to withdrawal, the U.S. had about 200 members remaining that operate within the American Embassy, the New York Times wrote. Romney criticized the withdrawal as too hasty, making comments at a roundtable discussion with veterans on Veterans Day in 2011 at a South Carolina barbecue restaurant. A colonel asked Romney how he would handle the influx of soldiers returning home from Iraq in need of jobs, according to a transcript of the event. Romney called Obama’s troop removal "an enormous mistake," "a failing," and yes, "tragic." His complete response: "Yeah. A couple of things. One, you probably know that it is my view that the withdrawal of all of our troops from Iraq by the end of this year is an enormous mistake and a failing by the Obama administration. Secretary Panetta and others had indicated they were working to put in place a Status of Forces Agreement to maintain our presence there, so that we could most effectively transition to the Iraqi military and Iraqi security forces providing security for their country. "The precipitous withdrawal is unfortunate. It's more than unfortunate. I think it's tragic. It puts at risk many of the victories that were hard-won by the men and women who have served there. I hope the risk is not realized. I hope instead that the Iraqis are able to pick up the baton, and despite the fact that we will have walked away on a too-rapid basis." From there, Romney moved on to the issue of jobless veterans (and even praised an Obama initiative to give businesses who hire veterans a tax credit). By this point, Romney’s disdain for Obama’s Iraq war policy was known for a few weeks. His campaign issued a biting statement when Obama announced his plan to withdraw all troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. "President Obama’s astonishing failure to secure an orderly transition in Iraq has unnecessarily put at risk the victories that were won through the blood and sacrifice of thousands of American men and women," Romney wrote on Oct. 21, 2011. "The unavoidable question is whether this decision is the result of a naked political calculation or simply sheer ineptitude in negotiations with the Iraqi government." The Obama campaign countered that Romney lacked a plan to end the war. Romney’s current campaign website is vague on plans for Iraq. He buries the issue in a topics page about the Middle East, praising George W. Bush’s 2007 "surge" of troops and bashing Obama’s 2011 withdrawal deadline. He makes a reference to reports from field commanders who "recommended a 14,000 to 18,000-strong residual force as the minimum necessary to carry out our transition mission." "In light of these developments, it is impossible to forecast what conditions in Iraq will confront the next American president in January 2013," Romney states on his website. We contacted both campaigns for our report. The Obama campaign pointed us to Romney’s remarks at the veterans’ roundtable. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said Obama took Romney’s quote "completely out of context." Our ruling According to Obama, Romney "said it was ‘tragic’ to end the war in Iraq." Romney characterized Obama’s 2011 removal of troops from the country with that word, but he was talking about the pace of the drawdown. Romney’s point, held by other Republicans, was that Obama’s drawdown happened too quickly and would lead to an unstable transition for Iraq. Romney has said conditions in Iraq are difficult to forecast and he would prefer a larger transitional force. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01587	"Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/07/chuck-todd/chuck-todd-said-8-9-states-toss-senate-races-are-l/	Chuck Todd kicked off his hosting duties on Meet the Press by landing an interview with President Barack Obama. But because he’s widely known as a politics junkie, the show also spent a lot of time discussing the 2014 Senate races. Over the weekend, the White House announced Obama wouldn’t be taking executive action on immigration reform before the midterms. Obama told Todd it wasn’t about the upcoming elections, but the Meet the Press pundits disagreed. "Democrats are playing defense this year in the race for the Senate. They’re playing in red states where this issue is always going to red hot," said Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report, one of the show’s panelists. "Taking executive action on anything Republicans could call amnesty would boost the Republican base." Conversely, if you look at demographics, action on immigration may not play a significant role for boosting Democratic turnout in the Senate races, Todd pointed out. "Look at this map, you have this great stat," Todd said. "Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate." We thought Todd’s statement was interesting, so we decided to take a deep dive into the numbers. Competitive seats Out of the Senate seats up for election this year, the Cook Political Report rates nine races as toss-ups, meaning either party has a chance of winning. The Cook Report also counts three more races as competitive but leaning toward one party. There is some deviation on the number of competitive races. On the high end, CNN considers 12 races competitive, dividing them into six seats "up for grabs" and six with "tilts" towards a party. On the low end, FiveThirtyEight, which doesn’t label the races competitive or otherwise, lists five seats in which leaders have less than a 60 percent chance of winning. Cook Political Report FiveThirtyEight CNN Alaska Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up Arkansas Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Colorado Toss-up Toss-up Leaning Democrat Georgia Toss-up Leaning Republican Leaning Republican Iowa Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up Kansas Leaning Republican Toss-up Safe Republican Kentucky Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Louisiana Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Michigan Toss-up Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat New Hampshire Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat North Carolina Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up West Virginia Leaning Republican Safe Republican Leaning Republican Nonetheless, while projections of tilts and toss-ups differ, nine seems to be a popular number of competitive states, the same number reported by the New York Times, Huffington Post, and the Rothenberg Political Report. Hispanic voters Todd’s chart on Hispanic voter numbers listed the source as a New York Times article, which extrapolated figures from past Census Bureau surveys to project 2014 elections. For good measure, we’ll compare the Times’ estimates for the nine states to 2012 Census results for 12 states considered to be competitive. Actual Hispanic voter turnout in 2012 and the projected number of likely Hispanic voters in 2014 are both lower than the share of eligible voters. By both sources, Todd is right to say that Hispanic voters comprise less than 10 percent of the total voters in states that are toss-ups. Whether that’s out of the top five, top nine, or top 12 most competitive states, only one, Colorado, has a Hispanic voting population above 10 percent. Mindy Romero, director of the University of California-Davis Civic Engagement Project, agrees with the Times’ conclusion that the Hispanic voting population will only have a little impact in the competitive 2014 Senate races. But that’s not without caveats. "Latinos will still impact congressional races, though they may not change the outcomes in these races," Romero said. In the short term, Latino voters may not alter the toss-up races significantly, but Romero said they’ll definitely matter in the long run. Take a look at California, a once red and then purple state that’s now solidly blue, in part thanks to Latino voters. "(California senators) Boxer and Feinstein are very safe, and Latinos are a large part of the story of why those two seats are safe, Romero said. The ruling Todd said, "Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate." Though there’s some deviation in the number of competitive states, nine seems like a pretty safe bet, and the number reported by a good portion of news sources. As for the share of Hispanic voting population, Todd is right on the money. We rate his claim True.	None	Chuck Todd	None	None	None	2014-09-07T18:13:41	2014-09-07	['None']
pomt-04320	Says that "when Congressman (Steve) Cohen took office in 2007, the unemployment rate was at 4.8 percent. The unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7 percent."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/28/george-flinn/george-flinn-blames-steve-cohen-shleby-unemploymen/	With what sometimes appears to be an unlimited supply of money to spend on campaign commercials, Dr. George Flinn is flooding the airwaves trying to make voters in the 9th Congressional District reconsider returning the incumbent, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, to Washington, D.C. In a campaign mailershowing the crumbling edifice of a large brick building, Flinn, the state’s biggest campaign self-funder, provides voters with numbers that indicate the unemployment rate in Shelby County is more than twice as bad now as it was when Cohen began in Congress. The 9th is comprised mostly of Memphis, with some parts of northern Shelby County, and recent national media reports have pointed out that Cohen is one of the few southern white Democrats remaining in Congress. "When Congressman Cohen took office in 2007, the unemployment rate was at 4.8 percent," reads one bullet point. And then the very next one says, "The unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7 percent." The Cohen campaign has challenged the veracity of many claims by Flinn, a radiologist who has built his wealth by owning radio stations and spent millions on various campaigns since 2002. Cohen’s campaign says the mailer contains numbers that are both out of context and inaccurate. So we asked the Flinn campaign for evidence. On statements like this, where statistics are used in an attempt to assign someone credit or blame, it is PolitiFact policy to a) determine the accuracy of the numbers and b) the extent to which the designation of credit or blame is accurate. Flinn spokeswoman Kristi Stanley defended the mailer and said the numbers came straight from federal statistics as reported by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. But when we double-checked, we found that the Cohen campaign was closer to the truth -- Flinn’s campaign either misread the statistics or cherry-picked other numbers from the years 2007 (when Cohen took office) and 2012 (the current election year). Cohen officially took office as the 9th Congressional District representative in January of 2007, following his election in November of 2006 to succeed five-term Congressman Harold Ford Jr. The originally reported unemployment rate for Shelby County for January of 2007 was 5.5 percent. When it was later revised, the new numberwas 5.7 percent. Either way, a significant distance from the 4.8 percent listed on the mailer. What about the unemployment rate now? The 9.7 percent figure used by the Flinn campaign appears to be pegged to reports for July, but the unemployment rate by August dropped to 9.0 percent in Shelby County. Those numbers for August did not become available until Sept. 27, so it’s possible the mailer was prepared with only the July numbers available. In any case, the most recent figures reported on Oct. 25 show the unemployment rate for Shelby County had dropped to 8.4 percent, following national trends. As to whether Cohen deserves blame for the unemployment rate’s worsening in Shelby County since arriving in D.C. in January of 2007, we reached out to some economists and consulted similar PolitiFact rulings involving other elected officials. Malcolm Getz, an associate professor of economics at Vanderbilt University, put it this way in an email: "One member of Congress has 1/435 of the vote in the House of Representatives. Whatever passes the House must also pass the Senate. The system is designed to allow many voices to be heard and counted with no single voice having determinative effect." And: "Macroeconomic phenomena like the unemployment rate is strongly influenced by events outside of government control." Economics professor John Gnuschke, head of the University of Memphis’s Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research, had a similar reaction: "A single Congressman doesn't have the ability to change the direction of the economy or the recovery." Gnuschke wrote further that "economic conditions in Memphis mirrored those in the rest of the nation and were in no way unique. . . . Improvements locally have been slow because the nation's recovery from the Great Recession has been slow. Congressman Cohen was not the cause of the decline and is not the problem with the slow recovery. Look to a weak private sector and their unwillingness to hire and invest as the issue of the day." Google makes it possible to create charts that show the unemployment rate over time, and you can compare different geographies. When you match up the unemployment rates for the United States, Tennessee, Shelby County and Memphis, you get four lines that rise and fall consistently at about the same rate. The Cohen campaign strongly believes Cohen does not deserve blame for the numbers, and points to examples that it says represent actions that improved the economic situation in Memphis and Shelby County. Cohen campaign manager John Marek wrote in an email: "Congressman Cohen brought us Tennessee’s first Minority Business Center, which will give racial minorities and women more access to business loans, which means jobs. Congressman Cohen also saved 500 jobs when he ensured that the American Steamship Company came to Memphis, and he created many jobs in Memphis when he brought us the $15 million Tiger grant, which will be a big development project downtown. He supported President Obama's jobs bill, which was blocked by Republicans in Congress." Marek also made this point -- Flinn was a Shelby County Commissioner from 2004 to 2010: "Arguably a County Mayor and County legislature would have more to do with the unemployment numbers than a Federal Congressman." Flinn’s campaign stands by the mailer and says Cohen has not delivered. Our ruling In a campaign mailer, Republican congressional candidate George Flinn blamed Steve Cohen for the unemployment rate in Shelby County being more than twice as bad now (4.8 percent to 9.7 percent) than it was in 2007 when he took office. But Flinn’s numbers are off, no matter if you stop the clock at the July numbers or the more recent September numbers. Further, the campaign overreaches by trying to pin responsibility for Shelby County’s economic collapse and then gradual recovery on one elected official. We rule this claim False.

pomt-08834	"The border security plan of Sens. McCain and Kyl called for 3,000 additional troops to keep us safe. President Obama says he'll send 524."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/11/john-mccain/john-mccain-said-he-would-add-3000-troops-border-w/	Sen. John McCain of Arizona is up for re-election and facing a challenge in the Republican primary from J.D. Hayworth. His latest television ad ignores his primary opponent, instead going after President Barack Obama and emphasizing that McCain is committed to border security. "The border security plan of Sens. McCain and Kyl called for 3,000 additional troops to keep us safe. President Obama says he'll send 524," the narrator says. "This is no political game, Mr. President. It's about Arizona lives. It's a fight we must win. And with John McCain on our side, we will." We wanted to check whether it was true that McCain called for 3,000 troops while Obama said he would send 524. First, we checked out the plan outlined by McCain Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz.. The 10-point proposal was released in April and includes the following point: "Immediately deploy 3,000 National Guard Troops along the Arizona/Mexico border, along with appropriate surveillance platforms, which shall remain in place until the Governor of Arizona certifies, after consulting with state, local and tribal law enforcement, that the Federal Government has achieved operational control of the border. Permanently add 3,000 Custom and Border Protection Agents to the Arizona/Mexico border by 2015." McCain and Kyl introduced a bill to carry out the plan in May, but there has been no significant action on the proposed legislation. But McCain did add an amendment to a pending appropriations bill that authorizes defense spending; the amendment would send 6,000 troops to the border area, double the number McCain mentioned in his ad. The bill has not yet come up for a vote in the full Senate. Now, for Obama's plan. Obama announced in May that he was sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the southwest border to help with border security. The troops were sent to different states: 524 to Arizona, 250 to Texas, 224 to California, and 72 to New Mexico. Other troops were to serve in command and control or support positions in various states, according to the U.S. Army. But Obama has also asked Congress to pass emergency legislation to add 1,000 new border patrol agents. That legislation is pending, and the number has been increased to 1,500 agents. It does not specify how many agents would be assigned to which states. McCain said he supports the bill and that it should be passed as quickly as possible. So McCain supports 3,000 to 6,000 additional troops. On Obama's side, you could count the 1,200 National Guard troops he sent in May, plus 1,500 agents to be funded by legislation Obama is expected to sign upon passage. That totals 2,700, or 2,200, if you only count Obama's original request to Congress. In his ad, McCain gives a fair description of his own proposal calling for 3,000 more troops. But he downplays the number of personnel Obama has called for. The number 524 represents only National Guard troops being sent to Arizona as part an initiative announced in May. It does not include the 1,000 to 1,500 additional border patrol agents in proposed legislation that Obama supports, some of whom would be assigned to Arizona. Still, McCain does appear to want more new agents and troops sent to the border than Obama does. So we rate McCain's statement Half True.

pomt-03611	"Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/09/chris-christie/new-chris-christie-tv-ad-touts-balanced-budgets-jo/	No new taxes. The best job growth in a decade. All under Chris Christie’s leadership. New Jersey was a broken state before Christie became governor, but now that he’s here and has made tough decisions, the state is on a more positive and fiscally sound path, a new television ad claims. "Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever," a narrator states as scenes of a gritty New Jersey and the aftermath of October’s Hurricane Sandy, play. This fact-check looks strictly at the ad’s claims about balanced budgets, new taxes and job growth. Two of the claims are on target. We will fact-check the ad’s education-related claims Sunday. The governor claims he balanced four budgets and he’s correct. But it’s hardly an accomplishment that distinguishes Christie from any other governor since state law requires a balanced spending plan. No new taxes for anyone, however, is debatable. During a 2011 town hall meeting in Evesham Township, Christie ruled out any tax increases, according to a fact sheet for the ad shared by Christie For Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts. But other actions by the governor could be construed as raising taxes, experts have previously told PolitiFact New Jersey. Although rates for income, sales and corporate business taxes have not gone up under Christie, Christie has cut funding to several tax credit programs that have the same effect as tax increases. Here’s one example: New Jersey scaled back the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit -- which the state Treasury Department website said "reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey" -- in Christie’s first year in office. Although rates didn’t increase, some homeowners and some low-income individuals received less money to offset tax bills – and that’s a type of increase, professors from the University of California Davis School of Law, and at The George Washington University, told us. Bill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, said at the time that "the Earned Income Tax Credit in most cases really represents a subsidy payment to low income citizens," pointing out that more than 76 percent of earned income tax credit recipients in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax. Next, let’s review that claim about New Jersey having the best job growth in 12 years, amounting to about 130,000 new private-sector jobs. The claim is accurate, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. New Jersey saw an inrease of 66,400 total payroll jobs from December 2011 through 2012. There is no other annual timeframe, measured from December to December, that had as high an increase in the previous 12 years, said Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The state also had the best year-over-year increase in private-sector jobs from December 2011 to December 2012, at 59,100, he said. New Jersey also added 127,800 private sector jobs from February 2010 – Christie’s first full month in office -- through March 2013, Seneca said in an e-mail. Seneca said Christie’s bipartisan efforts to control costs, not raise taxes and to reduce inefficiences that increase business costs all factor into New Jersey’s improving business climate. Our ruling A new ad by Christie for Governor claims that under the governor’s leadership, the state has had "four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever." It’s true that Christie has balanced four budgets -- as required by state law, but some experts have told us that cuts in tax credit programs can be deemed tax increases. In terms of job gains, the news is positive for year-over-year data, growth in the past decade and since Christie’s been in office. A Rutgers economist confirmed that some of Christie’s actions are responsible for those gains. We rate these claims Mostly True. Read Part 2 of our fact-check of this ad on Sunday.

pomt-14971	The Washington D.C.-area "never has a recession."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/19/mike-huckabee/huckabee-says-dc-region-never-has-recession/	When the rest of the nation is in economic agony, metropolitan Washington doesn’t feel the pain. So says Mike Huckabee, a Republican presidential candidate and the former governor of Arkansas. Here are his comments during a recent interview with John Fredericks, a Hampton Roads radio talk show host. "John, you’re close to the Beltway. I don’t have to tell you, it’s the only economy in America that never has a recession," Huckabee said during a call-in interview on the show. "Six out of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C." We recently looked at Huckabee’s claim that a half-dozen of the 10 wealthiest counties surround D.C. We rated that as True, based on median household income -- a standard way to measure county-wide affluence. Since the D.C. area includes Northern Virginia - an economic engine for the rest of the state - we wondered if it’s correct that the capital region has been recession-proof. We emailed the Huckabee campaign three times seeking evidence, but no one replied. The basic definition of a recession is a "marked slippage" of economic activity, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Economists look at a range of things including personal income growth and employment data to determine if there’s been a downturn. One of the most widely cited definitions of a recession is whether there’s been two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced. For the Beltway economy, we looked at Washington and 15 surrounding counties - an area on which analysts typically focus when measuring the economic health of the region. Adam Goldin, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, a company that assesses economic data, told us it’s incorrect to say the D.C. area hasn’t had a recession. The company’s data show the region experienced consecutive quarters of declining GDP during the 2007-09 Great Recession as well in the early 1980s and early 1990s, Goldin said. "(During) the Great Recession, D.C. was certainly impacted like the rest of the country," Goldin said. The Bureau of Economic Analysis has tracked the growth of every metro region in the nation since 2001; that’s long enough to examine the D.C. area’s economy amid the Great Recession. The figures show D.C. regional growth stalled twice. From 2008 to 2009, the value of all goods and services produced in the region fell slightly from $414.6 billion to $414.3 billion - a drop just shy of one-tenth of 1 percent, according to the BEA. By comparison, the U.S. economy declined 2.8 percent between those years. Output in the D.C. area barely dropped, from $434.5 billion to $434.4 billion, from 2012 to 2013, and the BEA figures list the growth rate then as 0 percent between those years. Although D.C. growth was flat at that time, the U.S. economy grew 1.5 percent from 2012 to 2013. The figures show D.C.’s recent annual GDP declines have been very light. "That doesn’t mean there weren’t a couple of really bad quarters in there," said Terry Clower, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. Clower told us that, contrary to Huckabee’s statement, the D.C. area does experience downturns. "The presence of the federal government does provide a bit of insulation. It doesn’t prevent us from going into recession," Clower said. "Certainly, we have recessions in this region." Still, Clower doesn’t completely fault Huckabee, noting that it is true that the D.C. region long has had shallower downturns than other parts of the U.S., due to the presence of the federal government. But he said there’s a flip side to that reality, he said. "In a time when you start talking about a federal (government) shutdown here, federal employees quit being paid, it affects this area quite a bit," Clower said. We also spoke to Anirban Basu, chairman and CEO of the Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore-based economic consulting group. He said that, beyond GDP data, job creation and retail sales figures also show metro D.C. experienced a downturn during the Great Recession. Basu said there’s "no question" the D.C. area experiences recessions, but he echoed Clower’s sentiments that its downturns tend to be milder than the rest of the country because of the presence of the federal government and associated spending. Our ruling Huckabee said the metropolitan Washington area "never has a recession." Data from Moody’s Analytics show the region has had consecutive quarters of GDP retraction - a common measure of recession - three times in the past four decades. Three economists said the region has experienced downturns, albeit not as deep as most of the nation. We rate Huckabee’s claim False.

pomt-06434	"This is the first time in our state, and one of the first times in the country, where benefit reductions . . . has happened to people who are retired."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/23/george-nee/rhode-island-afl-cio-president-george-nee-says-red/	One of the more controversial elements of the pension legislation proposed by Governor Lincoln Chafee and General Treasurer Gina Raimondo calls for freezing cost of living increases for people currently receiving a state pension. The COLAs, in most cases now 3 percent, would be frozen at least until the system reaches adequate funding, which could be decades. At a Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce breakfast on Oct. 19, 2011, George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, suggested that such a freeze would be unprecedented, at least in the state. "This is the first time in our state, and one of the first times in the country, where benefit reductions -- and the suspension of the COLA, in our opinion, is a benefit reduction -- has happened to people who are retired," he said. Would the change really be as historic as Nee claims? We're going to assume that Nee is talking about public pensions, not private pensions. We immediately thought of the City of Central Falls, where retiree pensions were recently cut up to 50 percent as a result of bankruptcy proceedings, making national news. (And in September 2009, the bankrupt town of Pritchard, Ala., stopped sending pension checks to its 150 retirees.) But because Nee made his comments in the context of proposed cuts in state employee pensions, let’s focus on the portion of his claim that concerns other states. Nee told us in an e-mail that benefits for retirees have been cut in three states -- Colorado, Minnesota and South Dakota. That, he said, would make Rhode Island "one of the first" to enact such cuts. But according to Stephen Fehr, a researcher for the Pew Center on the States, those three states enacted COLA limits last year. Since then, New Jersey, Maine, Oklahoma and Washington have also frozen, restricted or eliminated cost of living increases for current retirees. (Retirees in five of the seven have gone to court to overturn the action. Judges in Colorado and Minnesota already have upheld the COLA cut, Fehr said. Whether further challenges are successful will depend, in part, on whether the pensions were created through contract, through the state's constitution, or, as is the case in Rhode Island, through state law. A lawsuit filed by Rhode Island unions over pension changes in 2009 and 2010 is pending in Superior Court.) Limiting or eliminating COLAs for existing retirees would not make Rhode Island "one of the first" to do it, as Nee says. We'd be the eighth out of 50. Now let's move to Rhode Island itself. If the Raimondo-Chafee package were to be approved, would it be the first time Rhode Island has cut benefits to its retirees? In 2010, the General Assembly passed -- and Gov. Donald Carcieri signed into law -- legislation limiting cost-of-living increases to the first $35,000 of retirement income. That would clearly be a benefit reduction to retired people whose checks will total more than $35,000 per year (a benchmark that goes up with inflation). But that law did not apply to people who were already retired, or eligible for retirement when it was enacted. And although it required newly-retired workers to wait until their third anniversary (or age 65, whichever was later) to get their first COLA, workers were already required to wait until the third January after their retirement before their cost-of-living adjustments kicked in. Our ruling Nee, referring to the current proposal to scale back pension benefits, said "this is the first time in our state, and one of the first times in the country, where benefit reductions . . . have happened to people who are retired." We’ll give him a pass on the glaring exception of Central Falls, since he was talking about state plans. Nor is it one of the first times for state plans in the United States. Seven states -- 14 percent -- have already done it. But Nee was correct in noting that previous pension changes had no effect on the people who already had retired at the time. And if the Raimondo-Chafee proposal is passed, it would be the first time that benefits for already-retired public employees would be cut, making that part of his statement true. Overall, we rate Nee's statement as Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-08507	"Since Debbie Halvorson has been in politics, Illinois has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/07/adam-kinzinger/adam-kinzinger-says-hundreds-thousands-illinois-jo/	With unemployment rates near their post-World War II highs, it's no surprise that challengers have been attacking incumbents for the nation's weak employment numbers. One who's taken that tack is Adam Kinzinger, the Republican nominee running against Rep. Debbie Halvorson, D-Ill., in a sprawling district south of Chicago. In a recent television ad, Kinzinger said, in part, "Since Debbie Halvorson has been in politics, Illinois has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs." We thought it would be worth checking Kinzinger's numbers. Checking the claim seemed like it would be straightforward. But we hit some unexpected twists that first had us thinking the claim would be False, then True, then somewhere in the middle. The first thing we did was to turn to Halvorson's official biography to determine when she first entered politics. From 1993 to 1996, she served a term as clerk of Crete Township, Illinois. In 1996, she ran for state Senate and won, serving until 2008, including three years as the chamber's majority leader. Then, in 2008, Halvorson was elected to her first, and current, term in the U.S. House. While some may balk at describing the job of Crete Township clerk as being "in politics" -- a Kinzinger spokesman noted that the position has little or no influence on the statewide economy -- it is an elected position serving a geographical entity with 26,650 residents. So by our book, that counts as being "in politics." Next, we went to our trusted source for employment and unemployment statistics -- the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS calculates a wide variety of employment indicators, both nationally and within each state. We looked up the non-farm, seasonally adjusted employment figures for Illinois, which is the broadest, most widely used job statistic. Economists typically count "lost jobs" by comparing the total employment on one date to the total employment on another date. If you count from 1993 until today, the state of Illinois gained a net 310,500 jobs. Repeat: Gained, not lost. Now, to be fair, we also noticed that if you were to start counting from Halvorson's swearing-in as a state senator in 1997, the state had lost 135,000 jobs. And if you were to start at the beginning of her term in Congress, the state had lost 208,000 jobs. But counting from the start of Halvorson's political career in 1993, which we determined was the most accurate approach, the claim appeared to be False. That is, until the Kinzinger camp provided some alternative numbers. A Kinzinger spokesman sent us to a web page posted by the Illinois Department of Employment Security. This page provided a new statistic -- the actual number of unemployed Illinois residents, measured every month from January 1976 until the present. According to these statistics, there were 449,300 unemployed people in Illinois in January 1993, and that number had grown to 671,400 by August 2010. That's 222,100 more unemployed people today than when Halvorson started. So using that measurement, it appeared Kinzinger was correct. Why the difference? The expanding labor force. Since January 1993, the Illinois labor force has grown by 598,800 people, as people have moved into the state and as Illinois children have grown old enough to begin working. So that makes it possible for there to be more unemployed people even as the state has experienced a net gain of jobs. So does this mean the statement should be rated True? Not necessarily. The numbers cited by the Kinzinger camp refer to the increasing number of unemployed people in Illinois. But that doesn't exactly mean that hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost. Instead, it could mean that the state has failed to create hundreds of thousands of jobs to keep pace with population growth and new entrants into the work force. That's a similar point, but it's not exactly the same thing. The ad compounds the confusion by using an on-screen visual to back up Kinzinger's jobs claim. It says, "683,682 out of work," which is the number of unemployed Illinois residents in July 2010, according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security. Here's the problem: Not only is that not a jobs-lost figure, it's also a snapshot of one month's unemployment, even though the ad is talking about the jobs lost over a nearly 18-year period. Kinzinger would have been entirely justified making an ad that said the state had lost 135,000 jobs since Halvorson had been elected to the legislature, or 208,000 jobs since she was elected to Congress. Certainly it would have made for an easier fact-check. But he didn't. Instead, we're left with one valid statistic that the state gained 310,500 jobs during Halvorson's political career, and another statistic that shows that the state's economy fell far behind in creating enough jobs to keep up with population growth. The math can be complicated, but this one adds up to Half True.	None	Adam Kinzinger	None	None	None	2010-10-07T10:07:49	2010-09-21	['Illinois']
pomt-05803	"Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/23/bill-proctor/rep-proctor-says-half-high-school-grads-cant-read-/	In 2011, Florida state legislators approved a bill to link teacher pay to student performance. Despite resistance from some educators, including a lawsuit filed by the teachers’ union, state Rep. Bill Proctor, R-St. Augustine, stood firm behind Senate Bill 736. Proctor is the chair of a House education committee and chancellor at Flagler College. "Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level, and grade level isn’t that difficult," Proctor said in comments to the St. Augustine Record. "We’ll see which teachers affect learning in their students." We were surprised by that statistic: Do half of Florida’s high school graduates head off to college or work without reading at grade level? Florida’s seniors aren’t tested for reading skills as they don their caps and gowns. But we found two compelling pieces of evidence that indicate Proctor is probably right. FCAT and college entrance exams Florida high school students take the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT, in the 10th grade. Proctor’s office sent us to the most-recent 10th grade FCAT results. A "3 or higher" is considered reading at grade level. During the 2010-11 school year, only 39 percent of nearly 186,000 10th graders scored that well. But 60 percent passed the test, which means it’s possible to pass the test and read below grade level. Students are required to pass the 10th grade FCAT to graduate. Students who fail have two opportunities per year to retake the test which would ultimately boost that 39 percent figure who scored at grade level. The retest data mixes students from different years, though, so we can’t give a definitive number for how many more students passed the FCAT in a specific graduating class. "Yes, we graduate students that cannot read on 10th grade reading level," said Lindy Smith, an aide to Proctor, in an email. "Of those students passing the 10th grade Reading FCAT, I do not know how many actually graduated - but as you know students must pass 10th grade Reading FCAT in order to graduate. We expect some growth in reading in grades 11 and 12 but do not test those results on FCAT." The other piece of evidence came from the Florida Department of Education. Staff there pointed us to a December 2011 report on school assessment standards. The report stated that to be "college ready" students must graduate from high school, take certain courses and demonstrate basic literary skills. During the 2009-10 school year, 55 percent of the graduating seniors scored college ready for reading based on the ACT, SAT or CPT (The CPT, or College Placement Test, is primary used for the state’s public community colleges.) That number, too, supports Proctor’s claim. Experts on testing and education If the number of students reading at grade level is so abysmally low, why the repeated push for testing? We posed that question to Matthew Ladner, a senior advisor of policy and research for the Foundation for Excellence in Education (chaired by former Gov. Jeb Bush). Ladner coauthored Report Card on American Education: Ranking State K-12 Performance, Progress and Reform for the American Legislative Exchange Council. Without the testing, Florida wouldn’t have a measurement of its students’ performance, he said. And although no one is happy about that 39 percent figure of students reading at grade level in the 10th grade, Florida has made gains. Ladner pointed to the National Assessment of Education Progress which tests samples of students. Florida’s fourth grade reading results were below the national average in 1998, but climbed enough by 2011 to be above the national average. "What you find is while there is still plenty of room for improvement in Florida, there has been a large amount of progress in the right direction," he said. We also spoke with Robert Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, a national organization which advocates for better forms of assessment. Schaeffer said that Proctor’s claim sounded accurate, but he said that what constitutes "grade level" isn’t objective criteria. "Grade level is a political construct," he said. "If you gave the FCAT to many competent adults they would fail." Schaeffer also said that the SAT and other college entrance exams are given to students who are already college bound, so that measure doesn’t provide a full picture -- for example students who have dropped out. The State Board of Education approves the achievement level descriptions for FCAT 2.0. Our ruling Proctor said "Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level." The results for 10th grade reading FCAT show only 39 percent at grade level. Some additional students met that grade level mark through retests or by a sufficient score on the SAT or ACT, which would boost that 39 percent figure. Another way to measure Proctor’s claim is by looking at the percentage who were deemed college ready for reading based on college entrance exams, and that figure was 55 percent for 2009-10. By both measurements, the figure is close to 50 percent. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Proctor	None	None	None	2012-02-23T08:17:26	2012-01-06	['None']
pomt-01515	Americans now "support strikes (against ISIS) but the support for ground troops is not there. The support is very thin."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/21/katrina-vanden-heuvel/katrina-vanden-heuvel-americans-support-air-strike/	Progressives, wary of another open-ended conflict in the Middle East, are concerned President Barack Obama is bending to war hawks in Washington by using the military to stop the march of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. On ABC’s This Week, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of the left-leaning magazine The Nation, said Obama has moved away from his foreign policy principle of "don’t do stupid stuff" and "surrendered to war party in both parties, to a media that has lathered up hysteria about a threat that is not an immediate threat to this country." She questioned whether Americans are on board with increased military involvement. "There's a barbarism and a gruesomeness to the videotapes (of the Islamic State beheading two American journalists) which have moved the American people at this stage to support strikes, but the support for ground troops is not there," vanden Heuvel said. "The support is very thin." Did vanden Heuvel accurately capture the sentiment from Americans? We decided to take a look at the polling data. Airstrikes At Obama’s direction, the military began a targeted airstrike campaign in Iraq earlier this month against the Islamic State, a terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that is also called ISIS or ISIL. We found a number of recent surveys that asked respondents how they felt about this decision. As vanden Heuvel suggested, there’s significant majority support for airstrikes. According to a CNN poll published Sept. 8, 76 percent of Americans backed additional airstrikes against the Islamic State. Just 23 percent opposed. The results were consistent with several other recent polls. Washington Post/ABC News (Sept. 4-7) Reuters/Ipsos (Sept. 10-12) Huffington Post/YouGov (Sept. 18-19) Strongly support 52 42 34 Somewhat support 19 22 32 Strongly oppose 11 12 10 Somewhat oppose 12 9 9 Other 6 16 16 Vanden Heuvel also said that the Islamic State’s beheading of two American journalists was the tipping point for public support of airstrikes. The videos contained a "barbarism and a gruesomeness" that "moved" Americans to back Obama on this, she said. However, polls don’t exactly bear that out. A Washington Post/ABC poll from Aug. 13-17, found majority support, 54 percent, for airstrikes against the Islamic State. That poll was conducted before Aug. 19, when the Islamic State released footage of a Sunni insurgent beheading journalist James Foley. A Pew Research Center/USA Today poll released Aug. 18 -- also before the videos were released -- showed 54 percent of Americans supported airstrikes while just 34 percent opposed. Even earlier in the summer, the country was split on whether to launch airstrikes. A Washington Post/ABC poll from June 22 found 45 percent of respondents backed airstrikes and 46 percent opposed them. So it’s not as though the pro-airstrike crowd was weak months before the beheadings, either. While support for airstrikes jumped in the aftermath of the gruesome videos, it was already building and above 50 percent before news outlets learned two journalists were beheaded. Ground troops Obama has vowed not to get American troops directly involved in combat in Iraq and Syria. Polls are mixed, but it does not seem that there’s a great appetite for "boots on the ground," as some may say. The September Reuters poll allowed respondents to select multiple actions they deemed appropriate for America to take to fight the Islamic State. Choices ranged from humanitarian aid to no intervention at all. Just 9 percent of respondents favored sending troops, easily the least-chosen option. Similarly, CNN found two-thirds of Americans opposed ground troops while about one-third supported it. The Huffington Post/YouGov poll (the most-recent poll we found) had a far less definitive result. Asked if they would support or oppose ground troops in Iraq and Syria to fight the Islamic State, 38 percent expressed some support while 44 percent were against it. So a plurality opposed the move, but it was much closer than other surveys. On This Week, vanden Heuvel embellished a bit when she said support for ground troops to fight the Islamic State was "not there" and "very thin," but her general point is on target. Polls found at least a plurality opposed sending combat troops to fight the Islamic State. Our ruling Vanden Heuvel said Americans now "support strikes (to fight the Islamic State) but the support for ground troops is not there. The support is very thin." In general, vanden Heuvel captures the sentiment of the American people. But she over-exaggerates the influence of videos showing beheadings of journalists on Americans' attitudes about airstrikes. There was already majority support for airstrikes before the killing of the first journalist, James Foley. It is also a stretch to say support for ground troops is "not there" or "very thin." It is a minority opinion, but at least two polls show one-third of Americans support the idea. On balance, we rate her claim Half True.

pomt-07344	"The only people in this town that have voted to cut Medicare spending are the people who voted in favor of Obamacare. That’s a fact."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/may/10/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-those-who-voted-federal-healt/	On May 1, 2011, Sen. Marco Rubio appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to discuss everything from his take on Donald Trump’s presidential aspirations to the crisis in Libya. During the nearly 10-minute interview, Rubio was asked by host David Gregory for his thoughts on fellow Republican Rep. Paul Ryan’s proposal to overhaul the nation’s Medicare system. Ryan’s proposal calls for a voucher-type system -- where, starting in 2022, those 65 and older would chose from a private health insurance plan, but the government would contribute a certain amount toward their premiums. The House passed Ryan's budget plan, including his Medicare proposal, on April 15 by a vote of 235 to 193. "Would you vote for the Ryan plan?" Gregory asked. "I will support any plan that saves Medicare, doesn’t impact current seniors and doesn’t hurt economic growth. The Ryan plan does that," Rubio responded. The freshman senator then went on to say: "The Ryan plan doesn’t cut Medicare. Actually, it increases funding in it. And the only people in this town that have voted to cut Medicare are the people that supported Obamacare, that cut half a trillion dollars over the next 10 years out of Medicare and is using it to fund a health care experiment somewhere outside of Medicare." Medicare cuts are an issue PolitiFact has covered extensively on the national level and in other states. So we wondered, once again, how accurate Rubio was in stating that those who voted for the federal health care law, in essence, voted to cut Medicare? Medicare First some background on how the Medicare system was affected by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act. Under the act, Congress voted to reduce $500 billion in projected Medicare spending over the next 10 years, not in one substantial chunk. The reductions are aimed at eliminating parts of the Medicare program seen as ineffective or wasteful. For example, the plan phases out payments to the Medicare Advantage program, an optional program set up under the George W. Bush administration, where seniors could opt to enroll in a private insurance program and the federal government would subsidize a portion of their premium. On the surface, it may seem that lawmakers voted to cut Medicare spending under the new health law, but they instead cut the rate of growth. As a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office notes, the amount of spending for Medicare will continue to increase over the next decade, from $499 billion in 2009 to $929 billion in 2020. And even though $500 billion in spending is being reduced, health care experts say the quality of care should not be shortchanged. "Some (reforms) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage," said Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, in a video on the foundation’s website. "Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation," Neuman said. "Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care." Ryan plan While Rubio said he would support any plan that "saves Medicare," he also said that "Medicare as we now have it is not an option" because of the cost. Ryan’s plan would completely overhaul the Medicare system. Currently, any senior 65 or older is eligible for Medicare, which provides health care coverage for the vast amount of elderly Americans. The program provides health insurance for 39 million seniors and another 8 million people under the age of 65 receiving Social Security benefits. Under Ryan’s plan, starting in 2022 seniors would choose a private health insurance plan from a designated "Medicare exchange." The federal government would contribute an average of about $8,000 toward the annual premium for the private insurance plan. Ryan notes that this will result in a cost savings. But a CBO report notes that while government spending for beneficiaries would go down, the burden would then fall on beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket to cover the rest of their medical expenses. "To summarize, a typical beneficiary would spend more for health care under the (Ryan) proposal than under CBO’s long-term scenarios for several reasons," the CBO report states. "First, private plans would cost more than traditional Medicare because of the net effect of differences in payment rates for providers, administrative costs and utilization of health care services. … Second, the government’s contribution would grow more slowly than health care costs, leaving more for beneficiaries to pay." For example under Ryan’s proposal, according to the CBO, the cost to buy private insurance in 2022 would be about $20,510 a year. Even with the estimated $8,000 federal subsidy, the senior would still have to pay the difference of $12,510, about $1,000 more a month. Compare that to the Medicare program under the current health care law, the estimated cost to provide insurance would be about $14,770 in 2022, according to the CBO. That would leave the senior to pay just $6,150 out of pocket -- about $500 a month. Ryan’s plan, as noted in this news article from the Associated Press, also intends to keep the $500 billion in reductions that Republicans have criticized Democrats for approving under the Obama plan. How does that all add up? Neither the current law nor the Ryan plan would "cut" Medicare. Under both plans, the money allocated for Medicare in the budget would continue to grow for the next 10 years. The reduction -- under both plans -- is only in the rate of growth. Both Ryan's plan and the health care law would decrease the rate of growth. So what was Rubio speaking about? Rubio's position We turned to Rubio press secretary Alex Burgos to get a better understanding of Rubio’s take. "The Medicare cuts under ObamaCare are already current law," Burgos wrote in an e-mail on May 5, 2011. "They are part of CBO's baseline. It does not follow that supporting the Ryan budget is the same as supporting the Medicare cuts in ObamaCare." Burgos referred us to a statement made by Ryan press secretary Conor Sweeney to the Associated Press on April 13, 2011. Sweeney states that Ryan’s plan "ensures that all current-law savings and future reforms are devoted to saving Medicare." Burgos made it a point to underline "current-law savings." Still we wondered, aren’t the "current-law savings" Ryan's office touts a result of the same "cuts" to Medicare Sen. Rubio was referring to in his interview? Not according to Burgos, who counters that under the current health law, "that money is being cut from Medicare to fund a health care experiment outside of Medicare," Burgos responded. The "experiment," Burgos said, is the federal health care law approved last year. "The Ryan budget acknowledges these current cuts as the law, but ensures that money is preserved within Medicare," Burgos said. So Rubio's position is that what he calls a "cut" under the current law isn't a cut when it's included in the Ryan plan because it's already the law. The Ryan budget, however, is fairly explicit that it is reducing future spending in the Medicare program with the aim of restoring balance to the federal budget. If the Democratic health care law reduced future Medicare spending in order to expand coverage to the uninsured, then the Republican plan reduces future Medicare spending in order to reduce the deficit. In both cases, future Medicare spending is being reduced in order for the parties to pursue other policy goals. Our ruling So back to the question. Was Rubio accurate in stating that those who voted for the federal health care law, in essence, voted to cut Medicare? To his credit, during his interview, Rubio did state that the cuts would be spread out over the next 10 years, instead of making it seem like the money would come out of the current-year budget. However, Rubio still identifies those who voted for the federal health care law as those who voted to "cut Medicare," without noting that spending on the program is still expected to increase. The vote taken by Congress was not to cut Medicare but to reduce the rate of growth by $500 billion by targeting inefficiencies in the program. That's a cost-reduction plan that Ryan himself kept intact in his own budget proposal. Republicans, meanwhile, voted for a budget plan that envisions spending less on Medicare in the future to restore fiscal balance to the federal budget and reduce the deficit. Both parties have voted -- at different times and on different proposals -- to reduce future spending for Medicare. We rate Rubio’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05427	Says "Bill Pascrell voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires, and I voted no."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/30/steve-rothman/rep-steve-rothman-claims-rep-bill-pascrell-voted-e/	When it comes to protecting the middle class, U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman makes it sound like U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell isn’t the fighter he claims to be. As the two Democrats prepare to face off in the June 5 primary to represent a newly drawn congressional district in northern New Jersey, Rothman criticized Pascrell in a recent YouTube video for voting "to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires." "The people of the district really are looking for a progressive Democrat, and they’re looking for somebody who will fight for them," said Rothman, speaking from the Plaza Diner in Bergen County during the video posted April 18 by NorthJersey.com. "So when people in the middle class wanted their representative to fight for them and not give away the store to the super rich in America, Bill Pascrell voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires, and I voted no." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Rothman’s claim does not have much truth behind it, and it’s deeply misleading. Pascrell voted in June 2000 for a bill to gradually repeal the federal estate tax. But after President Bill Clinton vetoed the legislation, the congressman reversed his position and rejected the bill about three months later. Pascrell also opposed subsequent efforts to eliminate the estate tax on at least seven occasions during the administration of President George W. Bush. The estate tax is levied against the transfer of wealth following a person’s death. Paul Swibinski, a senior advisor to the Rothman campaign, argued the claim is accurate: "The fact that Bill Pascrell flip flopped and voted both for and against eliminating the estate tax proves that he is not a consistent, reliable supporter of progressive issues." First, let’s explain Pascrell’s yes vote in 2000. In June 2000, Pascrell voted in favor of the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000, which would have repealed the estate tax by Jan. 1, 2010. Rothman voted against the bill. The House failed to override Clinton’s veto in September 2000, when Pascrell and Rothman both voted against the bill and overriding the president’s veto. Pascrell spokesman Sean Darcy told us the congressman originally supported the estate tax repeal in 2000 because at that time, the tax "put an undue burden on middle class taxpayers like small business owners." At the time of the override vote, Pascrell noted on the House floor that Clinton would work out a solution to ease the burden on the middle class, Darcy said in an e-mail. Darcy added: "True to form, while Bill Pascrell has been fighting for middle class taxpayers on the Ways and Means Committee and the floor of the House, Steve Rothman was nowhere to be found." From that point on, the two congressmen continued to oppose estate tax repeal efforts. In April 2001, Pascrell and Rothman voted against the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2001, a measure to gradually repeal the estate tax. Provisions of that bill were included in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which Pascrell and Rothman opposed in May 2001. Signed into law in June 2001, that legislation repealed the estate tax for individuals who die in 2010, and then reinstated it in 2011. On at least five occasions between 2002 and 2007, the two congressmen voted against permanently repealing the estate tax. The existing regulations were part of a tax cut deal reached in late 2010 by President Barack Obama and Congress, with Pascrell’s and Rothman’s support. Our ruling In a video posted April 18 on YouTube, Rothman claimed "Bill Pascrell voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires, and I voted no." Pascrell did vote in June 2000 for a bill to gradually repeal the estate tax, but after Clinton vetoed the legislation, the congressman reversed his position and rejected the bill in September 2000. In subsequent years, Pascrell voted against repealing the estate tax on at least seven occasions. Since Rothman’s claim "ignores critical facts that would give a different impression," his statement is Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04986	Says he could be "the first president in modern history to be outspent."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/20/barack-obama/obama-says-he-could-be-first-president-modern-hist/	In the spring of 2012, headlines blared about President Barack Obama’s "hefty cash advantage." By June, once Republicans had settled on Mitt Romney, the story had changed to this: "Romney’s fund-raising outpaces president’s." Obama used the news to appeal to donors in a June 26 fundraising plea: "I will be the first president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign, if things continue as they have so far. I'm not just talking about the super PACs and anonymous outside groups -- I'm talking about the Romney campaign itself. Those outside groups just add even more to the underlying problem." We researched whether Obama’s team could be outraised by Romney and concluded that there are too many unknowns to determine if his prediction will come true. (Read our extended analysis of the issue.) We could determine, though, if there had been any president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign. We looked at two races involving Democratic incumbents facing Republican challengers: President Jimmy Carter vs. Ronald Reagan in 1980 and President Bill Clinton vs. Bob Dole in 1996. These examples contradict Obama’s point. But a simple comparison of the numbers doesn’t tell the full story. The earlier races both occurred when candidates accepted public financing for general election campaigns. The public financing system, began in the wake of the Watergate scandal, gave each candidate a set amount of money to spend after the primary and before the general election. Obama opted out of that system in both 2008 and 2012 because he could raise more money on his own. 1980: Carter vs. Reagan We shared Obama’s claim with Bob Biersack, a former longtime official at the Federal Election Commission who now works for the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan center that tracks campaign fundraising. He suggested we look back at the 1980 race. The Federal Election Commission dug up a report for us that showed that Reagan outraised Carter in the primary: $28.3 million to $19.6 million, which includes some federal matching funds. For the general election, both candidates participated in public campaign financing, said Georgetown government professor Clyde Wilcox in an email. "Carter’s popularity was low, and he had just won a divided primary election against Kennedy," said Wilcox. "Reagan faced a number of competitors in a divisive context that lasted months. So it makes sense that he raised more money." An FEC press release about political party spending for the 1980 election stated that "Republican Party committees at the national, state and local levels spent almost five times as much money as their Democratic counterparts." 1996: Clinton vs. Dole FEC records for the 1996 presidential race show Dole raised $44.9 million, while Clinton raised $42.5 million during the primaries, which included public matching funds. But Dole was at a disadvantage, because he had to spend money to fend off primary challengers, while Clinton faced no Democratic challengers. They both took a federal grant of about $62 million for the general election. The Republican national, state and local party committees outraised the Democrats in hard money, and Republican national party committees also raised more than the Democrats in soft money, about $138 million to $124 million. But most of that money didn’t go to the presidential race, said Wilcox. (Soft money allowed donors to bypass contribution limits. See the FEC description about soft money.) "All of Clinton’s money went against Dole," Wilcox said. "Most of Dole’s money went against his GOP rivals." Fundraising totals don’t tell the full story, though. It’s also important to look at the amount of cash candidates had on hand close to Election Day. By that measure, Clinton was far ahead: He had $31 million in the bank 20 days before the election, while Dole had $16.7 million, the Miami Herald reported in 1996. Comparing numbers doesn’t tell the full story Just as it’s not a simple exercise of comparing numbers for the 1980 and 1996 races, it’s also not simple to look at fundraising for the general election of 2012. Obama’s side is ahead so far. But Republicans have gained momentum, and with multi-millionaire donors and super PACs in the mix, the final tally won’t be known for months. Obama and Romney are both forgoing public financing. "It is not really fair to compare the publicly funded races to what we have now," said Brendan Glavin, data manager for the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes campaign spending. "The Reagan-Carter race was publicly funded evenly on both sides. The money that Reagan raised was nearly all spent in the primary race against George Bush," he said. "Similarly, Carter was fighting off a challenge from Ted Kennedy. Also, at that time the distinction between primary and general election was stronger. George Bush dropped out of the race in late May 1980 and the convention was in mid July." Obama is technically wrong, said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato, but the fundraising landscape is different. "You are really operating under a very different -- maybe completely different -- campaign finance universe," Sabato said. "That doesn’t make his statement right. If he had said he’d be the first president under the new system of campaign finance to be outspent in his re-election campaign that would be right." Sabato, who predicts election outcomes on his Crystal Ball website, said he doesn’t know for certain that Obama will be outraised but predicts that he will be outraised by "sizable margins" due to the super PACs. In both the 1980 and 1996 races, the fundraising difference wasn’t that significant, Sabato said. "Yes, Reagan outspent Carter, but that had nothing to do with Carter’s loss. Carter’s loss was about two recessions, the economy and the Iranian hostage crisis," Sabato said. And the 1996 race doesn’t account for the labor movement’s work, which is off the books. Their get-out-the-vote efforts benefited Democrats. "Clinton consistently led by a mile in the polls -- it was good economy, peace. There was never any question Clinton was going to win," Sabato said. Sabato told us if we compare those earlier races to Obama-Romney in 2012, we’re not quite comparing apples and oranges, but we are comparing oranges and tangerines. Our ruling Obama was wrong to suggest that there hadn’t been other presidents in modern history to be outraised in their re-elections. Looking at numbers alone, Carter and Clinton fall into that category. But what we are comparing is primary races then with total fundraising for the general election now. We think 1980 and 1996 certainly fall under "modern history," but the campaign finance picture has changed dramatically since then, and there are important caveats to those races. Those earlier races involved public financing -- this time Obama and Romney are forgoing those dollars. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05549	An effort to repeal voting-reform legislation would be "the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/09/eric-kearney/eric-kearney-says-repeal-voter-reform-legislation-/	A bill to reform Ohio election laws, House Bill 194, has been a consistent source of controversy since it was introduced last year. The latest flap came on March 28 when the Ohio Senate passed a bill to repeal the law, which Democrats and others have called a "voter suppression" bill. Although they oppose HB 194, largely because it restricts early voting opportunities, Democrats also spoke out against the bill’s repeal because there already is a referendum on HB 194 scheduled for this fall’s ballot. Sen. Eric Kearney, who leads the Senate’s Democratic caucus, said voters have the right to decide the fate HB 194. He said Republicans were unconstitutionally taking away their right to referendum by repealing the law before the election on Nov. 6. "This is the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum," Kearney, of Cincinnati, said during the floor debate March 28. The GOP-controlled Senate passed the bill to repeal HB 194 on a party-line vote that day, sending the bill to the House of Representatives for consideration. Anytime an elected official utters the words "this is the first time in Ohio history," we at PolitiFact Ohio become instantly curious. So we decided to dig into Kearney’s claim. First, it’s important to recognize that the legislation passed last month, Senate Bill 295, does not directly stop the referendum on HB 194. It essentially nullifies the referendum because it repeals the law, therefore there would be no law to put before voters. Kearney’s larger point – that repealing HB 194 before the referendum vote is unconstitutional – is ripe for debate and, many lawmakers agree, likely will be decided in court if the House also passes SB 295 and the governor signs it. An attempt to verify Kearney’s assertion that the repeal is unprecedented could help shed light on the situation. If the senator is wrong, a similar case could help answer the question of the repeal’s constitutionality. We checked with several government and legal sources and could not find an identical situation in Ohio’s history. The provision to allow Ohioans to challenge a law passed by the General Assembly was included in the Ohio Constitution in 1912, according to a history of ballot issues maintained by the Secretary of State’s office. Mike Rowe, spokesman for the Senate Democratic caucus, said the caucus’ legal staff could not find a similar case despite research that looked at the Ohio Revised Code, legislative records and discussions with staff members. Republicans in the Senate and House also came up empty. Senate GOP spokeswoman Angela Meleca said the caucus’ legal staff, along with the Ohio Legislative Services Commission, looked back and could not find another case of the General Assembly repealing a bill that is up for a referendum. "There was nothing that matched or fit this scenario," Meleca said. Carrie Davis, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, testified before a Senate committee on March 21 that the Ohio Supreme Court had never addressed the question of repealing a bill up for a referendum. "If we’re all hitting the same wall and not finding anything, I’m not sure it’s there," Davis said in an interview. There was one case with similarities, but it fell short of exactly matching the repeal of HB 194. Lawmakers passed a bill last year to establish new congressional districts. The legislation replaced districts established by an earlier bill, House Bill 319, that spurred a referendum effort backed by Democrats. But when the second bill, House Bill 369, passed with a new map, the referendum effort ceased because the new maps replaced the old ones involved in the referendum. The partial repeal of HB 319 is different, though, because Democrats dropped their bid to collect the signatures needed to get a referendum on the ballot. In the case of HB 194, Secretary of State Jon Husted last year certified that petitioners met the requirements to place the referendum on the November ballot. So Kearney appears to be on solid ground. But it is important to remember the bill to repeal HB 194 has not been passed in the House. So the repeal is not official yet, although Republican House Speaker William G. Batchelder supports it. Nevertheless, the experts we talked to all agreed that Kearney’s point that the repeal would be a first in Ohio history is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.

"Breaking: 3 liberal celebrities arrested for conspiracy to assassinate President Trump," said a May 6 headline by Miami Post, a pro-Trump fake news website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story is made up. The story said that "the three liberals were arrested as enemy combatants and brought to a military base due to the danger of mass destruction that may be called domestic terrorism." The story lacked basic details such as where they were supposedly arrested. (Tthere was no mention of Miami or Florida in the article by Miami Post.). If famous celebrities were nabbed for trying to take out Trump, it would be all over the news —-- but it’s only been all over the fake news world. Other fake news stories with the same phony allegations have circulated since 2017. In December 2017, Rogen jokingly tweeted: "This is a right wing news website that says me and Franco and Miley Cyrus got arrested. Luckily they let me tweet from prison. Haha."

pomt-07663	Says Charlotte Nash "pretends to be a chicken farmer" in order to get property tax exemptions.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/11/larry-gause/candidate-says-opponent-using-loophole-get-tax-dea/	Political campaigns are often full of interesting claims, but this one had us chirping. Larry Gause, candidate for chairman of Gwinnett County’s Board of Commissioners, recently sent out a flier and created a website full of claims against opponent Charlotte Nash. The general theme is that Nash, Gwinnett’s administrator from 1995 to 2004, wants to be chair to "feather" the nest of herself and friends. He cites evidence such as Atlanta Journal-Constitution articles that reported a temporary arrangement to pay a retired police chief half of his $138,000 annual salary for a homeland security job that some county commissioners were unaware of. Most of the claims were not new, but one piqued our interest. Gause accused Nash of using a "loophole" to get huge property tax breaks. "How does she do it? She pretends to be a chicken farmer," Gause wrote. Nash laughed off the accusation in a telephone interview, calling it "typical campaign stuff." "It’s a part of the process," she added. Gwinnett is Georgia’s second highest-populated county, and the chairman is the most politically powerful position. A special election for the position, previously held by Charles Bannister, who resigned under pressure, is scheduled for Tuesday. Ethics are a big issue in Gwinnett County politics. One sitting county commissioner, Kevin Kenerly, was indicted last year on bribery charges. Bannister resigned his position last year amid the grand jury investigation that resulted in Kenerly’s indictment. Kenerly voluntarily suspended himself after the indictment. His term ended in December. The race, which has received little attention, is heating up. Norcross resident Joe Newton has filed a complaint with the county’s Board of Assessors, charging Nash is receiving "improper and unjustified tax credits" and wants an investigation. Nash owns two properties under scrutiny. Both are located in Dacula. The larger property is more than 100 acres and has a market value of about $1.1 million, county tax records show. The records show Nash received about $14,000 in exemption savings last year and paid $1,862.74. Gause said Nash is wrongly using a conservation use assessment exemption to get the tax break. The land was once a chicken farm, but it is now used to grow timber -- a legal exemption for the property, according to Gwinnett Tax Assessor Steven Pruitt, who has not endorsed a candidate in the race. The exemptions date back to 2005, county officials said. Nash and her sister inherited the land after their mother died. They applied for the exemption, which gives tax breaks to individuals who use land for conservation purposes for at least 10 years. Land owners who develop the property must pay back twice the tax savings. Pruitt said there are 1,046 properties with exemptions in Gwinnett. Pruitt said you can’t get an exemption if you have just one tree on the property or one horse. Properties larger than 2,000 acres cannot get an exemption. The exemptions must be approved by the county’s Board of Assessors. We toured the site Thursday and saw scores of hardwood trees in the distance, ready for spring. Gause says Nash is not honoring the spirit of the assessment law -- arguing there’s little timber production going on there. Pruitt, however, said it could take 15 to 20 years before it is time to cut and sell the timber. Others we talked to agreed. The other property is about 14 acres. It has a market value of $463,500, according to county records. Nash and her family received about $4,000 in exemptions for the property in 2010, records show. They paid about $2,800 in property taxes. Pruitt said Nash has an agricultural exemption for that property because it is a farm. Gause told us Nash is playing loose with the exemption rules. "I observed the property [twice]," Gause wrote in an e-mail. "There were no animals on the land. Not a horse, cow, pig or chicken. There were no crops growing. There was no farming equipment. I’ve worked on farms. I know what farms look like. Neither property is a farm." We also checked out that site Thursday and didn’t see any animals there. Pruitt said he has seen horses there and notes there is a barn. "That’s how it qualifies [for an exemption]," Pruitt said. A short biography of Nash on a government website says she and her husband live "on a chicken farm in the Harbins Community south of Dacula." But that refers to a long-ago use of the property, Nash said. She said she has never claimed to be a chicken farmer, and her property tax exemptions have nothing to do with poultry. So who’s right here? Nash says the land was once a chicken farm, but it is not anymore. Nash has an exemption for agricultural purposes for the smaller property -- where she is registered to vote -- and an exemption for timber purposes for the larger plot of land, the county assessor told us. The assessor’s office was unable by Thursday to share the original exemption paperwork with us. Gause’s real point is whether Nash actually deserves the agricultural exemption. But he bases his argument on the claim that she "pretends to be a chicken farmer." We found no evidence of that. We rate his statement as False.

pomt-14811	"Instead of fighting ISIS, (the Saudis) have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/24/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-right-saudi-arabia-more-focused-con/	Bernie Sanders delivered his long-awaited speech on democratic socialism last week, also outlining his plan for fighting ISIS. Sanders called for a broad international coalition but stressed that Muslim nations must shoulder the fight, which he called "a struggle for the soul of Islam." So far, he said, wealthy and powerful countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have done very little. "Saudi Arabia, turns out, has the third-largest defense budget in the world," Sanders said on Nov. 19. "Yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen." Sanders is correct that Saudi Arabia’s military budget is the third largest in the world. But is he also right that the Saudis aren’t prioritizing ISIS? In a word, yes. A striking scaleback The Saudi embassy in Washington did not return our requests for comment. But the Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times article that says, "Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have shifted most of their aircraft to their fight against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen." In 2014, the Houthis — a longstanding Shiite separatist group in northern Yemen, a country with a Sunni majority — rebelled against the Yemeni government and seized the presidential palace. After months of tense peace brokered by the United Nations, the Houthis took over the government and placed the president under house arrest in early 2015. Saudi Arabia, which has a Sunni majority and is ruled by a Sunni monarch, led a 10-state Arab coalition and launched airstrikes against the Houthis on March 26. It pledged to use 100 warplanes and 150,000 soldiers. In a month, the Saudis conducted 2,415 sorties (a deployment of an aircraft), releasing at least 1,000 air-to-ground weapons. Meanwhile, as part of the U.S.-led coalition of 60 countries, Saudi Arabia has also been involved with the international effort against ISIS since September 2014. Since then, it has deployed just four F-15 fighter jets and an unspecified number of Typhoon combat jets against ISIS. (Saudi state media trumpeted the participation, releasing photos of pilots who flew in the strikes and highlighting that the son of King Salman was among them.) Experts said Saudi Arabia doesn’t publicize the exact number of airstrikes it has carried out, but the data shows that the amount of non-U.S. airstrikes overall has been scaled back since the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen began in late March. Conversely, the United States has beefed up its strikes. Here’s a chart from Airwars.org, a project tracking the international air war against ISIS, that demonstrates this point: Data compiled by Airwars.org shows that from Dec. 1, 2014, to Nov. 16, 2015, Arab allies conducted just 143 of the 2,827 airstrikes in Syria, 90 of which occurred before April 3 (intervention in Yemen began March 26). For comparison, Saudi Arabia sometimes conducted as many as 125 strikes a day against the Houthis, according to the BBC. "Bottom line, Bernie Sanders is right. All the evidence points to it," said Chris Woods, an investigative journalist who leads the Airwars project. "Clearly, we saw with the Saudis a capability unleashed in Yemen that we never saw in Syria." "The volume of Saudi military forces deployed to combat the Houthis puts the Saudi deployment against ISIS to shame," said David Weinberg, an expert on the Gulf monarchies at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy. Weinberg looked at tallies from the Defense Department which are consistent with Airwars.org data. He also noted a decline in the number of non-U.S. airstrikes in Syria and "a pitiful lack of participation by America’s Arab allies in what was supposedly unveiled as a joint U.S-Arab effort when it was launched last fall." According to the New York Times article cited by the Sanders campaign, the Saudis flew their last strikes in Syria in September, Jordan in August, and the UAE in March. Conflicting crises Riyadh has its reasons for prioritizing the Houthis over ISIS. Among them: Yemen’s proximity, Iran’s gains in the region, sectarianism and, simply put, practicality. "Yemen is the soft underbelly of the kingdom, and Iranian presence there through its support of Houthis is viewed as an existential threat to the kingdom," said David Ottaway, the Middle East specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center. "In the end, Syria doesn’t border Saudi Arabia like Yemen does," said Lori Plotkin Boghardt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "And more fundamentally, the Saudis view Assad as the root of the ISIS problem and have argued from the beginning that Assad has to be defeated first in order to defeat ISIS." Saudi Arabia is also somewhat relying on the United States to take on ISIS, added Weinberg of the Defense of Democracies. It’s also politically easier for the Sunni kingdom to mobilize public opinion there against radical Shiites like the Houthis rather than radical Sunni terrorists like ISIS, he said. The United States, for its part, supports the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen (the Houthis’ slogan is "Death to America, Death to Israel, Damn the Jews, Victory to Islam"), despite concerns over civilian casualties and possible war crimes. What’s more, Boghardt pointed out, "the irony and the danger" is that the conflict in Yemen has given al-Qaida and ISIS room to operate there. As for ISIS, there’s no question that the Saudis are aware of the threat it poses. The terrorist group has repeatedly targeted the kingdom, bombing mosques and detonating car bombs. Beyond military engagement, the Saudis have foiled terrorist plots and arrested hundreds of ISIS supporters. But experts say the kingdom could be doing a lot more. "Saudi Arabia really should be doing more to militarily combat the twin scourges of ISIS and al-Qaida," Weinberg said. "Bernie Sanders is right that we should expect more from our Saudi allies in the fight against terror in Syria as well as beyond." Our ruling Sanders said, "Instead of fighting ISIS, (the Saudis) have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen." This is an accurate assessment. The Saudis have prioritized the conflict in Yemen over the fight against ISIS, as evidenced by the amount of resources it has committed to both crises. We rate Sanders’ claim True.

pomt-11240	"Mitch McConnell was one of the few senators that voted after Tiananmen Square not to have punitive actions against China for human rights violations."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/03/don-blankenship/fact-checking-don-blankenship-mitch-mcconnell-chin/	In the closing days of West Virginia’s Senate primary, relations between Republicans Don Blankenship and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have turned sour. Blankenship is running for Senate despite spending a year in jail for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found that, under his leadership as CEO of Massey Energy, the company systematically refused to take steps that would have prevented a deadly combination of methane gas and coal dust that left 29 West Virginia miners dead in 2010. The prospect that a candidate with that kind of background could win the nomination to face Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin has prompted national Republicans to target Blankenship in the hope that he doesn’t win the primary. Blankenship’s top rivals for the nomination are U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. In April, a group of GOP strategists aligned with McConnell established the Mountain Families PAC, backed by six-figure television ad buys targeting Blankenship, Politico reported. Blankenship responded by attacking McConnell, including an ad that dubbed him "Cocaine Mitch." (That reportedly refers to a 2014 article in The Nation that said drugs had been found on a ship owned by the family of Elaine Chao, McConnell’s wife and the current Transportation Secretary.) In a May 1 Fox News debate in Morgantown, W.Va., Blankenship continued to attack McConnell and Chao. He brought up the incidents of June 1989, when the Chinese government cracked down militarily on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, resulting in the deaths of between hundreds and perhaps thousands of protesters. "Mitch McConnell was one of the few senators that voted after Tiananmen Square not to have punitive actions against China for human rights violations," Blankenship said. Let’s look at what Congress did in the aftermath. The sanctions bill from 1990 After the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the United States responded with a series of economic sanctions. On Jan. 30, 1990, the Senate followed the House in passing a $9.7 billion spending measure for State Department activities during fiscal years 1990 and 1991. That bill included a suspension of U.S. financial support to China by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development Program. It also stopped the licensing for U.S. exports of military items. The bill passed the Senate, 98-0, and McConnell voted for it. So the most straightforward way to interpret Blankenship’s statement doesn’t hold up. After we reached out to Blankenship’s campaign, they clarified the legislation in question. It was actually a bill from 2000 known as S. 2277. The bill would have authorized the president to extend "normal" trade relations to China, as long as the president certified that China was living up to World Trade Organization standards. This is something quite different than what Blankenship said during the debate. What was S. 2277? Here are some of the problems with Blankenship’s characterization of the bill in question? • The bill didn’t come just after Tiananmen. Blankenship said McConnell voted for the bill "after Tiananmen Square." But S. 2277 was hardly in the immediate aftermath of the killings -- it came 11 years later. • McConnell couldn’t have "voted" for it. Blankenship said McConnell "voted" on the bill, but S. 2277 was an early version of a bill that was later subsumed into a different piece of legislation. So S. 2277 never actually received a floor vote. The Blankenship campaign acknowledged to PolitiFact that it would have been more accurate to say the bill was "sponsored" by McConnell. • McConnell wasn’t one of a "few" GOP supporters. McConnell was indeed a sponsor of S. 2277, along with 10 other Republicans and 14 Democrats. That amounted to one-fifth of the Republican conference at the time -- a significant number of co-sponsors for a Senate bill, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in the U.S. Senate. Moreover, the bill passed out of the Senate Finance Committee with only one dissenting vote in either party. (McConnell was not on the Finance Committee, so he could not have voted on it there.) Once S. 2277 was incorporated into the successor bill -- H.R. 4444 -- that bill received broad support, as well. The bill passed the Senate by an 83-15 margin, with 46 Republicans voting for it and eight opposing it. That’s a Republican conference support rate of 85 percent. • The final version of the bill is more nuanced on human rights than Blankenship suggests. Blankenship has a point that the final bill was designed to end the requirement that the United States renew China’s "normal" trade status on an annual basis. But the bill did seek to maintain some leverage over Chinese human rights policy. Specifically, it established a Congressional-Executive Commission on the People’s Republic of China, charged with monitoring "the acts of the People’s Republic of China which reflect compliance with or violation of human rights." The bill offered a detailed list of human-rights concerned, ranging from freedom of expression and religion to an end to arbitrary arrest and cruel and unusual punishment. The bill also said U.S. funds could be spent for certain purposes in China "if the president has credible evidence" that the recipient "has been materially responsible for the commission of human rights violations." We should also mention Blankenship’s apparent implication that Chao is a reason why McConnell is soft on China. "The key question is what we would expect of McConnell and Chao if they had no Chinese ties," Koger said. "Answer: There is no clear difference. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were a lot of voices calling to end the annual certification of China's trade status. Congress passed a law to that effect, and not because most members of Congress have rich Chinese in-laws." Our ruling Blankenship said, "Mitch McConnell was one of the few senators that voted after Tiananmen Square not to have punitive actions against China for human rights violations." This assertion is inaccurate in multiple ways. McConnell and every other Senate Republican had voted in favor of sanctions in the immediate aftermath of Tiananmen Square; the legislation Blankenship said he was referring to came 11 years later. The 2000 bill arguably weakened but did not eliminate human-rights leverage over China. And the vast majority of Republicans -- not just a "few" -- supported the final version of the measure.

pomt-01597	Says Dan Sullivan approved a "light sentence" for a sex offender who got out of prison and is now charged with a gruesome murder and sexual assault.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/03/mark-begich/sen-begich-wrongly-ties-republican-opponent-horrif/	Sen. Mark Begich, the incumbent Democrat from Alaska, has been forced to pull a television ad that said his Republican opponent’s actions as the state attorney general led to a gruesome murder -- a serious charge based on paper-thin evidence. Begich released an attack ad the Friday before Labor Day that said Dan Sullivan was soft on sex crime during his 18-month tenure as attorney general. Begich and Sullivan are locked in a toss-up race, one of several that could decide which party controls the Senate come November. "(Sullivan) let a lot of sex offenders get off with light sentences," says the ad’s narrator, identified as a retired police officer, standing outside of an Anchorage apartment complex. "One of them got out of prison and is now charged with breaking into that apartment building, murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter. Dan Sullivan should not be a U.S. senator." The ad is talking about a crime allegedly committed by a man named Jerry Andrew Active on May 25, 2013 -- just hours after Active was released from prison. Active should have spent several more years behind bars for a prior sexual assault conviction, according to an Alaska Department of Law investigation, but a clerical error led to a shorter sentence. Active is currently awaiting trial on the May 2013 charges. The ad did not mention Active by name, but it gave a detailed description of the crime -- which received significant coverage in the Alaska media last year -- in front of the building where it occurred. The Sullivan campaign retaliated almost immediately with its own ad (in which they identify Active), defending his record and calling Begich’s ad "shameful." Both campaigns have pulled the videos down at the request of the victims’ family, who claimed the ad was insensitive and could affect upcoming prosecution. (PolitiFact obtained a copy of the ad in order to fact-check it; a TV report in Alaska shows a clip of it.) Even though the ads are no longer on the Alaska airwaves, the skirmish points to serious criminal justice issues. So we decided to dig in and see if Sullivan bears any responsibility for Active’s alleged crime. We found that the timing just doesn’t line up. Doing time Begich’s campaign declined to talk with us about the ad -- citing the pending trial -- so we asked the Alaska Democratic Party for evidence tying Sullivan to events leading to Active’s sentencing and the May 2013 crime. The party pointed out that Sullivan was attorney general in March 2010, when prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement with Active, who at the time was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, among other charges. (Sullivan’s name is stamped on the plea agreement, though it bears the signature of an assistant district attorney.) The Alaska Department of Law later found that Active’s 2010 plea agreement was based on incorrect information and should have come with a longer sentence. If Active had received the longer sentence, he likely would have still been in jail on the day he committed the murders. But Sullivan is not personally responsible for this plea agreement mistake. Let’s take a look at the course of events, according to the Department of Law. Keep in mind that Sullivan was attorney general from June 2009 to December 2010. In January 2009, state troopers arrested Active for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and then physically assaulting the girl’s mother and brother. In March 2010, Active pled guilty to those charges, accepting a deal with prosecutors that sentenced him to about four years of jail time (including the time he had served up to that point, since his arrest in January 2009). Active was released in 2012. From then on, he was in and out of prison on probation violation charges until May 25, 2013, when he committed the murder referenced in Begich’s ad. When drawing up Active’s plea agreement in 2010, the state looked at his criminal history. As is customary, they received this information from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network. However, Active’s report failed to identify a 2007 felony conviction for providing a minor with alcohol. (That’s typically a misdemeanor, but Active’s charge was treated as a felony due to some nuances in the law.) Because of the inaccurate report, the Department of Law miscalculated Active’s presumptive sentence. They believed it to be between two years and 12 years -- leading to his four-year sentence and release in 2012. If their calculation had included his 2007 felony charge, he would have had a presumptive sentence of eight years to 15 years. The Department of Law said at the time that they are not sure how the mistake happened, though the information network sometimes has blind spots when it comes to offenses that happen in rural villages, like the one where Active was arrested in 2007, according to the Alaska Dispatch. Regardless, this chain of events happened before Sullivan became attorney general. The Alaska Public Safety Information Network pulled Active’s report the day after he was arrested in January 2009 -- Sullivan took office the following June. So although Active’s plea agreement and sentencing happened in 2010, while Sullivan was in office, the mistake that led to Active’s shorter sentence happened more than a year earlier. (At the time, Sullivan was on active duty for the U.S. Marine Corps, according to his campaign.) Additionally, it’s highly unlikely that Sullivan was personally involved with Active’s case and plea agreement at all, said John Skidmore, director of the Department of Law’s criminal division. The state handles about 40,000 cases each year, at least half of which are felonies -- so it’s "unrealistic" for an attorney general to be involved with individual cases, he said. "There is no way that (any attorney general) would be involved in that sort of decision at that level at that time," Skidmore said. Part of a trend? The Alaska Democrats said that under Sullivan, there was a trend of the state giving sex offenders light sentences -- pointing to a dozen cases in which Alaska prosecutors negotiated sentences with sex offenders that fell at the low end of the sentence-length spectrum. They also noted that Alaska local television station CBS 11 produced a story in March 2010 about what happens to criminals who fail to register as sex offenders with the state. The story includes examples of convicted rapists receiving the minimum sentence for failing to register, and others having charges against them dropped. However, Alaska’s sentencing structure encourages prosecutors to negotiate sentencing agreements, leaving judges with little influence over sentencing, said former Alaska Chief Justice Walter Carpeneti in 2012. And these presumptive sentencing policies had been in place since the late 1970s -- so when Sullivan entered the office, these practices were already well-established. During his time as attorney general and subsequent role as commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan was one of the main faces of the "Choose Respect" campaign, started in 2009 by Republican Gov. Sean Parnell to address domestic violence and sexual assault in Alaska. The "Choose Respect" campaign passed several pieces of legislation while Sullivan was attorney general, which his campaign said exemplifies his commitment to the issue. The laws passed include harsher sentences for people involved with child pornography or human trafficking, revision of bail laws for people charged with serious crimes, and specified procedures for DNA retention in murder and sexual assault cases. The campaign also said Sullivan hired the Department of Law’s first cyber-crimes prosecutor whose focus is combating child pornography. Following Active’s arrest for the May 2013 crimes, the state changed its plea bargaining policies, so Alaska prosecutors are no longer permitted to negotiate lower sentences with people charged with violent felonies or sexual crimes. Our ruling Begich said Sullivan approved a "light sentence" to a sex offender who is now charged with "murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter." Active, who is awaiting trial, received a shorter sentence than he was supposed to, but the mistake that led to this sentence happened before Sullivan became attorney general. So to pin the error on Sullivan is wrong, and to suggest that he actively approved the sentence is a fabrication. The ad is not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation.

pomt-12474	Easing school lunch regulations "is not reducing the nutritional standards whatsoever."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2017/may/04/sonny-perdue/ag-sec-perdue-changes-school-lunch-rules-says-stan/	Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue went to an elementary school lunchroom in Virginia to announce new rules for the food schools serve. Under the banner of trimming the childhood obesity rate, combatting rising levels of diabetes and other health problems, Congress passed and the Obama administration implemented new targets for schools. Perdue gave schools more time to comply in two areas -- whole grains and sodium levels -- and expanded the rules for milk. "We're giving these food service professionals the flexibility to move as we get a healthier generation," Perdue said May 1. "This is not reducing nutritional standards whatsoever. It's pausing here to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not." Perdue argued that if kids don’t like what they’re offered, they simply won’t eat it, and giving schools more time to comply would help children get more of the nutrition they need. We focus here on Perdue’s claim that his move does not reduce nutritional standards. Is it true that they do no reduce nutritional standards set by the department in 2012 "whatsoever?" While Perdue is technically correct about not reducing the standards, his department will not be enforcing them. "He is not changing the standards per se, but he is allowing schools to not follow them," said nutrition policy researcher David Pelletier at Cornell University. "It’s a bit like saying the posted speed limits on the roads remain the same, but you can go as fast as you want." The starting point Washington’s school lunch program reaches about 30 million kids every day at a yearly cost of about $11 billion. To qualify for federal support, schools must meet a number of dietary regulations. In 2012, the Agriculture Department announced the final version of Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. For milk, schools could provide "flavor in fat-free milk only." By 2015, all grain products, such as bread, oatmeal and noodles had to be "whole grain-rich." That term meant that at least half was whole grain and the rest could be processed but enriched with vitamins and minerals. The rule for reducing sodium, or salt, was more complicated and set increasingly lower targets that varied slightly by age group. So for example, by July 2014, a lunch for an elementary student couldn’t contain more than 1,230 mg of sodium, which is about 65 percent of the upper limit for a full day as set in the Federal Dietary Guidelines. By July 2017, the target became 50 percent of the daily limit, and by July 2022, the target went down to about 33 percent. Making 'school meals great again' Perdue’s office sent out a press release entitled "Ag Secretary Perdue Moves to Make School Meals Great Again." It said the department would start the process to allow schools to start serving 1 percent flavored milk. At the elementary school event, Perdue said, "I wouldn't be as big as I am today without chocolate milk." For grains, schools could apply for exemptions to the whole grain-rich content rule through 2020. On sodium, any school meeting the first target for lunches of about 65 percent of the daily limit would be considered in compliance through 2020. In a statement, the department said this was similar to a 2016 memo from the Obama Agriculture Department. That memo said it recognized that manufacturers had lagged in cutting down the salt in food, and so schools "that are working toward compliance" would not suffer if they hadn’t yet made the grade. Perdue’s policy is more lenient, declaring that no school need push beyond the first target while, as Perdue said, the department pauses "to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not." Were nutrition standards reduced? For whole grains and sodium, the new policy extends the timeline for achieving those standards, but so far, the overall goals remain -- with the option to reassess later. Pelletier of Cornell and nutrition policy researcher Joann Slavin at the University of Minnesota both said the underlying nutrition standards are unchanged. But Pelletier called Perdue's statement a "semantic trick." The situation with milk is a little trickier. The 2012 rules, which match the recommendations from a 2009 National Academy of Sciences panel, said flavored milk had to be non-fat. Perdue hasn’t officially changed that yet, but he said "USDA will seek to publish an interim rule as soon as possible to effect the change in milk policy," to allow flavored 1 percent milk. Slavin said the federal rules on milk went too far. That said, they were published as nutritional standards and followed the guidance from an independent research group. Our ruling Perdue said his changes to the school lunch requirements did not reduce nutritional standards. The plain facts and the assessment of experts confirm that the long term goals for whole grains and sodium remain in place for now. However, under the new policy, schools need not make more progress toward those goals for another three years. In addition, the current standards don’t allow flavored 1 percent milk, and the new policy states that the department wants to change that through an interim rule. So the standards might not have changed yet, but Perdue said he plans to do so. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03324	Patrick Murphy voted for Obamacare in 2010, "yet he reversed himself and voted to delay" the employer mandate and the individual mandate.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/jul/25/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-says-patrick-murphy-flip-flop/	Americans for Prosperity, a group opposed to Obamacare, called U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, a hypocrite for his votes on the health care law. The group announced that it had started running online ads nationwide to highlight votes House members took to delay ObamaCare mandates. In Florida, the ads are targeting three South Florida Democrats: Murphy, Lois Frankel and Joe Garcia. (All three members are in their first terms -- Murphy and Garcia are expected to face competitive races in 2014.) A July 23 press release from the group stated: "Rep. Murphy voted for the law back in 2010, yet he reversed himself and voted to delay both the employer mandate (in keeping with President Obama’s decision) and the individual mandate..." and then continued about Garcia’s and Frankel’s votes. The press release portrayed Murphy as a flip-flopper: did he vote for Obamacare in 2010 and then vote to delay the employer and individual mandate? (AFP supports delaying the mandates and repealing the health care law.) The problem with this claim that leapt out at us was that Murphy -- as in Patrick Murphy who represents parts of Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties -- wasn’t a member of Congress in 2010. Murphy beat U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens, in November 2012 and officially took office in January 2013. There was a Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy in 2010 -- but he was from Pennsylvania and lost re-election in 2010. (To make matters more complicated there is a U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa.) We asked an Americans for Prosperity spokesman if it had mixed up Patrick Murphys. "Yes, that’s an error, it was a mix-up with Murphy from PA. We sent out a corrected release a couple minutes later," spokesman Christopher Neefus told PolitiFact Florida in an email July 24. At PolitiFact, we give props to folks who admit to their errors -- and the group did ‘fess up quickly. But we still continue our fact-check. In this case, when we looked at AFP’s newsroom page about Florida on July 24, it still contained the press release with the wrong information about Murphy. The online banner ad doesn’t contain the error -- it simply says "Patrick Murphy voted to delay the ObamaCare mandate. Now let’s end it for good." Murphy’s position on Obamacare On the campaign trail in 2012, Murphy said he supported the health care law, but also thought it could be improved. Specifically, he liked the provisions offering coverage for young people on their parents’ plans, fixing the doughnut hole to get prescription drugs for seniors, and forcing insurers to offer coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions. He criticized some of the requirements on businesses, such as the requirement for filing complicated 1099 forms. That requirement was later repealed. In office, Murphy has continued that general stance of supporting the law overall while calling for "improvements." AFP correctly pointed to separate votes Murphy took for a one-year delay for the employer and individual mandates on July 17. Murphy was one of 35 Democrats to join the Republicans on the employer mandate vote and one of 22 on the individual mandate. (Murphy’s votes help him build the case that he is a moderate. The liberal Daily Kos pointed out that more than half of those 22 Democrats won close races.) The Democratic-leaning Senate is not expected to vote in favor of the delays. In early July, Obama said he would delay enforcement of the employer mandate. The Palm Beach Post quoted Murphy about the mandate votes: "While I believe these delays are important," he said – to give the administration time to work out complexities in the law – "I do not support a wholesale repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is already providing important protections and security to individuals and families who previously didn’t have access to affordable, quality health insurance." Murphy does not support full repeal of the mandates but does support a one-year delay. Our ruling Americans For Prosperity said in a press release: "Rep. Murphy voted for the law back in 2010, yet he reversed himself and voted to delay both the employer mandate (in keeping with President Obama’s decision) and the individual mandate." The group quickly admitted that Murphy of Florida wasn’t in Congress in 2010, so that part of the claim is wrong. While campaigning in 2012, Murphy said he was generally supportive of the law although he called for some changes. The group is also correct that Murphy voted to delay the employer and individual mandates, but their claim leaves readers with a false impression that his voting record reflects flip flops.

pomt-00622	Says Marco Rubio said that "felons should not have their voting rights restored" but that "convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time."	false	/florida/statements/2015/may/27/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-says-marco-rubio-wants-restore-gun-r/	A Facebook meme suggests that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., believes convicted felons should regain their right to own a gun but not the right to vote. The meme, sent to us by a reader, presents two quotes purportedly by Rubio. The first, dated March 16, is, "No, felons should not have their voting rights restored even after they have served their sentence." The second quote, from May 6, says, "Of course, convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time. It is their constitutional right." The claim was attributed to the Facebook community group "Stop the world, the teabaggers want off." We’ll note right off the bat that the group’s Facebook page cops to being a primarily satirical site. It says, "This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages." Still, casual Facebook users are unlikely to see this bit of context and could easily take the quotes in the meme at face value, so we’ll check the substance of the meme anyway. We searched Nexis and Google for the quotes and did not find any instances in which Rubio said those words. (We contacted spokespersons for Rubio and did not get a response. We also tried to contact the "Teabaggers" group via Twitter and Facebook but did not hear back.) Felons and voting rights States have the power to decide how -- or whether -- to restore the rights of felons to vote once they have served their time. (Maine and Vermont allow felons to vote while in prison.) In Florida in 2007 under then-Gov. Charlie Crist, the Cabinet agreed to relax the rules to make it easier for felons to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. The Cabinet set rules for three levels of offenders who could apply to get their rights back, including the requirement that they had to finish their sentences. At the time, Rubio was the speaker of the House, but since the Cabinet set the rules, the Legislature had no official role. When Rubio ran against Crist for a U.S. Senate seat in 2010, he attacked his record on restoration of voting rights. In 2009, Rubio said on Morning Joe that Crist "restored the rights of felons to vote automatically here in Florida." The following year, Rubio said Crist "worked with ACORN and groups like that to give felons voting rights in Florida." (ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in 2010 in the wake of a video sting that showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The group advocated for increased voter access, but there was no proof that Crist worked with ACORN on his plan to restore voting rights to felons, so we rated that claim False.) In both instances, Rubio clearly sounded like he was criticizing Crist. It’s not a big leap to think that he is personally against allowing felons to regain their right to vote, but his words fall short of making that clear. The issue of restoring voting rights to certain felons has come up in the U.S. Senate the past two years but it hasn’t received a vote, so we don’t know Rubio’s position on it. The Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act of 2015 would allow citizens to vote in any federal election even if they had been convicted of a non-violent criminal offense unless the individual was in jail or on probation. The bipartisan duo of Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate from Kentucky, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, are the measure’s co-sponsors. Last year, Paul co-sponsored a similar bill with U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida. Paul, who has made efforts to court black voters, has said that stripping voting rights from felons is a form of voter suppression and has disproportionately harmed black voters. Felons and gun ownership Under federal law, individuals with felony convictions lose their right to own guns, but states can restore these rights, a 2011 New York Times investigation found. In some states, felons can only regain their right to bear arms if they are pardoned, while others allow certain felons to regain their rights after five to 20 years. In Florida, felons are eligible to apply eight years after the completion of their sentence. But we could not find any statements in which Rubio directly talked about whether convicted felons should be able to regain their right to own a gun. Our ruling A Facebook meme says Rubio said that "felons should not have their voting rights restored" but that "convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time." The meme was posted by a site that describes itself as satirical, and we found no evidence that Rubio actually said the words attributed to him. While Rubio has spoken critically in the past about felons regaining voting rights, he does not appear to have taken a stance on the restoration of felons’ gun rights. Rubio didn’t say these words, so we rate the claim False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2015-05-27T10:26:20	2015-05-13	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-04875	President Obama and Nancy Pelosi said "Obamacare" would save money because "they factored in 10 years worth of tax revenue and only six and half years worth of expenses."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/08/eric-hovde/gop-candidate-us-senate-hovde-claims-obamacare-lev/	The U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the federal health care reform law didn’t slow down efforts by Republicans to block the measure -- or at least heap criticism on it while campaigning. In a July 29, 2012 interview on WISN-TV with host Mike Gousha, U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde joined the chorus of critics and said the law would "help bankrupt the country." Hovde said he disagreed with assessments from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that repeal of the bill would add to the federal deficit. "Let's go back and show how Nancy Pelosi and President Obama said that over the next decade, ‘Obamacare’ will save us money," said Hovde, who is running against three other Republicans in the Aug. 14, 2012 primary. "What they did is they factored in 10 years worth of tax revenue and only six and half years worth of expenses. " Those numbers sound familiar. Indeed, the "10 years and six" claim has been a common refrain by Republicans and has been looked at a number of times by our PolitiFact partners. When we asked Hovde’s campaign for backup, they referred us to several articles that make the same point about the health care law: "Congressional Democrats delayed these provisions in order to show only six years of spending under the plan in the original 10-year budget window (from FY2010-19) used by CBO at the time the law was enacted," said a July 11, 2012 statement from Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, as reported in the conservative Weekly Standard. Basically, the supporting evidence simply re-states the claim. So we took our own look. The health care law took effect in 2010, and taxes began then to support the measure. Key parts of the bill don’t kick in until 2014. In an item about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, PolitiFact National noted that the 10-year aspect of the claim was correct. The item read, in part:: "The CBO said this about the health care law back in 2010: It lowers the deficit, by about $124 billion over 10 years. And in 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health care law, the CBO said that increased the deficit, by about $210 billion over 10 years." That estimate was updated in July 2012, when the CBO said the law would cost $84 billion less than it had previously predicted. On Jan. 6, 2011, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virg., made virtually the same claim as Hovde, saying the law "offset 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases" and it was Half True. PolitiFact Virginia noted: "Cantor’s argument that the ‘benefits’ don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at the biggest provisions of the law. But many other, smaller provisions to boost coverage have already taken effect." Those include small business tax credits, coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, assistance for early retirees and coverage for dependents until they’re age 26. Also, not all of the taxes kicked in immediately. On March 1, 2011, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said the law has "six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue." PolitiFact Virginia also rated Cuccinelli’s claim Half True. "The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost," it wrote. "But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014." So, yes, the taxing began in 2010, and key parts of it don’t kick in until 2014. But, like so many claims, it’s not as simple as that. Some benefits already kicked in, and some of the taxes don’t take effect until later. Our rating Hovde repeats a claim that’s been a routine part of the GOP attack on Obamacare: that there are 10 years of taxes charged for six years of benefits. It’s true that the tax money began to come in starting in 2010. But it’s false that the benefits don’t kick in until 2014. There are numerous parts of the bill that have already taken effect. Hovde joins the crowd who have made the same claim. It’s Half True.	None	Eric Hovde	None	None	None	2012-08-08T18:30:53	2012-07-29	['Nancy_Pelosi', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-10523	"I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/07/barack-obama/20-years-is-an-accurate-count/	In a race where his opponent Sen. Hillary Clinton has touted "35 years of experience" over and over, Sen. Barack Obama has begun to cite his own experience of 20 years. At a debate in Cleveland, moderator Brian Williams asked Obama to respond to Clinton's charges that he was heavy on oratory and light on action. Obama responded: "You know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action. And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service." The voters will decide if the lesser number is significant, but we find Obama's claim of two decades' experience to be accurate. To arrive at this number, we looked closely at Obama's official congressional biography, his professional resume and news articles chronicling his political rise in Illinois. If Obama wins election and takes office in January 2009, he will have served four years in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois. Before that, he was a state senator in Illinois for eight years. He also was a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school during that time. His schedule from the school shows him teaching two or three classes in the fall and winter terms — usually Constitutional Law III: Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process; Voting Rights and the Democratic Process; and Current Issues in Racism and the Law. In the spring, he would attend the Illinois legislative sessions. It seems a fairly safe bet that, like most legislators, his constituent work — fielding phone calls and helping people in his district — went on year round. Press reports indicate he did a small amount of private law practice during the summer. So that's eight years as a public official in Illinois, bringing our total to 12 years. To get to 20 years of experience, we still need eight years from Obama's career prior to holding public office. Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983. He worked for a year as a financial analyst; in his memoir he said he spent his days behind a computer terminal, "checking the Reuters machine that blinked bright emerald messages across the globe" and feeling like "a spy behind enemy lines." He gave up that job to go into community organizing, work he felt was more important politically. He worked three years as a community organizer in Chicago before going to Harvard Law School. We won't count the junior-level business experience as working "on behalf of families who are having a hard time," but the community organizing work does seem to fit the bill. That brings his work experience to 15 years. At Harvard, Obama began to receive national attention. He became the first black president of the Harvard Law Review and was recruited heavily by law firms around the country. (He met his future wife, Michelle Robinson, as a summer associate at the Chicago firm Sidley Austin.) He graduated in 1991. He ran Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive, for much of 1992, and then accepted a position with the Chicago firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. The firm specialized in political and civil rights work and neighborhood economic development work. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1993. He was elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1996 and took office in 1997, so his full-time work after law school comprises five years. That gets us to 20 years. (During these years, Obama also worked on his career as an author. His memoir Dreams from my Father was published in 1994 and reprinted after his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. A follow-up, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream , was published in 2006. His personal financial disclosure statements show that those books earned him $1.8-million in 2005 and 2006, the majority of his income.) The other part of Obama's claim is that his experience is "on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream." We take that to mean his experience is broadly in the field of public service, and that too is an accurate claim. The bulk of Obama's professional experience is either in elected office or working for a nonprofit, a university or a civil rights law firm. Obama's 20 years of experience are 15 years short of Clinton's, but it's worth noting that Obama is 14 years younger than Clinton. Voters will decide whether the gap between 35 years and 20 years of experience is significant, but we find Obama's statement about his own experience to be True.

pomt-06004	"The top 10 most well-paid CEOs in America received a combined $770 million in 2010, while the average American worker’s wage rose just 2 percent."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/19/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-says-combined-top-ceo-pay-topped-7/	Rep. Dennis Kucinich often decries the pay gap between America’s top earners and the growing poverty class. He recently took to the stump after the U.S. Census Bureau released a new report on poverty, using it as a chance to promote safety net programs and his National Emergency Defense Act, which calls for investing in infrastructure and folding the Federal Reserve into the U.S. Treasury. "The top 10 most well-paid CEOs in America received a combined $770 million in 2010, while the average American worker’s wage rose just 2 percent," he said in a news release. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. To think, these 10 CEOs are so gifted that they command compensation — in a single year — that is the rough equivalent of the gross domestic product of Grenada. Put another way, if they pooled their annual pay for 2010 it would have exceeded: What Tiger Woods reportedly paid his ex-wife ($750 million) in their 2010 divorce settlement. What China Shipping Container Lines recently paid ($754.4 million) for eight new container ships to be delivered in 2013. Heck, the CEOs’ collective booty totaled nearly one one-thousandth of the economic stimulus called for in President Obama’s $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. Kucinich based his claim about the 10 highest paid CEOs on a survey produced annually by a group called GMI, which tracks corporate governance. We looked at a summary of the report and found it to be on the level. The total for the combined compensation of the 10 highest paid CEOs on its list was $770,046,373. Just to be clear, we note that the compensation these CEOs received was not all in the form of salary. Much of it came in the form of exercised stock options, deferred compensation and other benefits. But to that, we say, so what? It is still compensation. According to the survey, the highest paid CEO on the list is John Hammergren of health care giant McKesson Corp. of San Francisco. He exercised $112 million in stock options while getting a boost of $13.5 million in retirement benefits. His salary was but a measly $1.6 million. And if he gets bounced from the company, he won’t be left wanting. If that were to happen, he stands to collect $469 million in severance pay. The pay package didn’t sit well with GMI. "Shareholders understand and expect that extraordinary compensation must be linked sufficiently to extraordinary performance," said GMI’s chief communications officer Paul Hodgson in a written statement. "For that reason, they are increasingly frustrated about these clear failures of compensation governance." GMI also pointed out that in 2010, the total realized compensation for CEOs in the Standard & Poor’s 500 rose by a median of 36.5 percent. "The 36.5 percent increase in realized compensation is particularly notable when it’s put in context of the modest growth of the economy in 2010 and general public company performance last year," Hodgson stated. Kucinich’s staff provided a table from the Census Bureau to support the part of his claim about wage growth for average American workers. It states that total compensation for civilian workers rose 2 percent in 2010. If just wages and salaries are included, the percentage drops to 1.6 percent. So, on this point, Kucinich’s statement is pretty close. We note, though, that his statement used the word "wage" to describe the 2 percent increase. The 2 percent figure from the Census Bureau includes total compensation. But the real figure -- 1.6 percent -- would only strengthen his point. Politifact Ohio is not trying to stoke the fire of class warfare by pointing out how much certain CEOs made in a year compared with the average worker. We’ll let Kucinich take the hit for that. But as to his claim about the vast difference between the haves and the have-nots, he is pretty much on target. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich’s claim True.

pomt-06739	Rick Perry "has advocated abandoning Social Security, scuttling Medicaid and ending the federal income tax."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/28/margaret-carlson/columnist-margaret-carlson-says-perry-has-advocate/	In an opinion column published Aug. 9, 2011, Margaret Carlson of Bloomberg News says Gov. Rick Perry has said some "far-out things." Among examples: Perry "has advocated abandoning Social Security, scuttling Medicaid and ending the federal income tax." Talk about shaking up the USA. Is this right? We did not hear back from Carlson on the basis of her claim. But we had an idea of where to start our check. "Fed Up!," Perry’s 2010 book urging Americans to resist Washington’s drift, includes his critiques of Social Security, Medicaid and the federal income tax. For instance, Perry writes that Social Security is "something we’ve been forced to accept for more than 70 years now" and calls it a "crumbling monument to the failure" of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. He likens the program, which provides benefits to senior citizens and the disabled, to a Ponzi scheme — a claim we rated False in November 2010, noting that Social Security is accountable to Congress and the American people while a Ponzi scheme is a criminal enterprise. He also highlights the decision by three Southeast Texas counties in the early 1980s to leave Social Security for a private retirement savings program. In December 2010, we rated Mostly True his claim that employees in the counties fared well as a result. In a Nov. 4, 2010, interview on CNN's Parker Spitzer, Perry said an option for the country going forward would be to let states decide whether to stay in Social Security or take a different approach to retirement savings. Part of the exchange between host Eliot Spitzer and Perry: Spitzer: "So, you want to let people opt out (of Social Security)?" Perry: "I think, let the states decide if that’s what’s best for their cities." Spitzer: "So the states will let people opt out of Social Security." Perry: "They should, I think it’s a discussion…" Spitzer: "I haven’t seen anybody propose that before because that’s going to be …" Perry: "Well, we just laid that on the table so let’s talk about it." Spitzer: "OK, so that’s your plan?" Perry: "That’s not my plan, Eliot." Spitzer: "But, governor, I’m trying to get you, look, you’ve written a book …" Perry: "I know, you’re trying to get me in a corner and I don’t corner very good. What I’m trying to do is have a discussion with the people of this country on an issue …" So, Perry has advocated a discussion of letting states opt out of Social Security. In his book, Perry doesn’t call for scuttling Medicaid, a state-federal partnership providing health insurance to low-income Americans, though he writes that the 2010 Democratic-passed health care overhaul "only makes matters worse for the existing broken systems of Medicare, Medicaid and" the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures children of the working poor. Perry adds: "The primary problem with Medicaid right now is that there are too many beneficiaries and not enough doctors or funding," a situation he says will worsen under the health care overhaul because more residents will be eligible for Medicaid. Perry sounded another anti-Medicaid note in a November 2010 interview with Greta Van Susteren of the Fox News Network, telling her: "I'd like to see the states be given the opportunity to opt out of the Medicaid program that we are looking at today." An Austin American-Statesman news story at the time said that in interviews, Perry had referred to a December 2009 Heritage Foundation memo stating Texas could save $60 billion between 2013 and 2019 by dropping out of Medicaid—even though the federal government was picking up 60 percent of the Texas costs. That memo says: "On a state-by-state basis, every state except North Dakota would come out ahead financially by leaving Medicaid but continuing long-term care (nursing home) spending with state-only dollars." In a Dec. 3, 2010, press release from his state office, Perry calls for changes to Medicaid. "The current Medicaid system is financially unsustainable for states and the federal government, as costs increase about 9 percent per year in Texas alone," Perry said. "Without greater flexibility and the elimination of federal strings, Medicaid will strangle state budgets and taxpayers as Obamacare and other programs expand Medicaid rolls." Perry continues: "Texas, the states and the federal government would be much better served by increasing flexibility and innovation in Medicaid, even block granting funds to the states, so we can tailor Medicaid dollars to best serve the needs of Texas patients, families and taxpayers." The same month, Perry said a Texas request for a waiver enabling the state to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool helping some low-income Texans get private insurance "has languished in a file cabinet at the (federal) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years." We rated his statement Pants on Fire after noting we’d earlier determined the federal government was waiting for Texas to submit a revised proposal. Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us this month the Texas waiver request was ultimately shelved by the state in the wake of the 2010 congressional overhaul of health care laws, though this year the commission submitted a limited proposal seeking a waiver to change how some Medicaid payments are made to hospitals. She said the request isn’t intended to curtail any Medicaid services. In his book, Perry lists changes to taxation among steps "we must take to wrest the reins of the federal government from those who have let it run wild for far too long." Toward restricting "the unlimited source of revenue that the federal government has used to grow beyond its constitutionally prescribed powers," Perry writes: "One option would be to totally scrap the current tax code in favor of a flat tax," simplifying taxation and making it harder to manipulate. Another option, he continues, "would be to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment," which enabled the income tax, and then pursue an alternative model of taxation such as a national sales tax. Asked to comment, gubernatorial spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email that Carlson didn’t reflect Perry’s views. "Social Security and Medicaid programs are unsustainable in their current form," Frazier said, "and Gov. Perry believes they must be substantially reformed." Frazier said Perry "has never advocated ending the federal income tax, but has" called it misguided. Her email continues: "The 16th Amendment sadly gave far too much taxing power to Washington, and helped usher in a massive expansion of government and a tax code too complicated and onerous to easily comply with. The way the federal government taxes Americans must be reformed." Our judgment: Perry would at least study giving states leeway not to continue Social Security. If study led to such an option, and if states went along, this would effectively amount to abandonment. As far as we can tell, though, Perry has not said Social Security should now be abandoned. Perry has said he wishes states could opt out of Medicaid. If that option were offered and if states agreed, the program would effectively be scuttled. But Perry also has said he favors Medicaid reforms. Finally, he says taxation could be improved by replacing the federal income tax. While this would end the income tax, Carlson’s statement misleads by failing to note that Perry would replace some income-tax revenue with money from a new tax. We rate Carlson’s statement Half True.

pomt-00867	"(Jeb) Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/13/american-bridge-21st-century/liberal-pac-says-jeb-bush-edited-his-own-emails/	While all the attention is on Hillary Clinton’s email records, one left-leaning political action committee wants to remind everyone about a correspondence flap from another potential presidential candidate -- former Gov. Jeb Bush. American Bridge 21st Century posted on its website a reaction to a March 2 tweet Bush sent out about Clinton’s use of a private email account while she was Secretary of State. The PAC pointed out that Bush also had used a private account as governor, and had repeatedly defended his own editing of what emails would become part of the Florida public record. "Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose – apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails," the American Bridge website read. Does Florida’s open records law allow Bush (and all other of the state’s elected officials) to hand-select what emails they make available to the public? Sure enough, it does, but there’s more to it than just letting politicians self-report emails. Mail call Bush famously used the personal email address Jeb@jeb.org for all eight years of his two terms, from 1999 to 2007. He cultivated an open and tech-savvy image by announcing in December 2014 he would post more than 250,000 emails from his time as governor, ahead of a possible 2016 presidential run. In February 2015, jebbushemails.com went live with a quarter-million emails and the first chapter of an e-book Bush was writing about being governor. But there are a few things about the release that sometimes get overlooked. First, those emails were selected from messages already available from the state archives as of December, so the disclosure wasn’t entirely new. Bloomberg reported Bush didn’t submit all of his email until earlier in 2014 -- more than seven years after he left office. The Sunshine Law states an official must turn in records "at the expiration of his or her term of office." Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush’s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007, most recently in June 2014. The last batch is described as "Additional 2002-2003 emails." Next, and this gets to the heart of what American Bridge said, is that the messages sent to the archives and subsequently posted on Bush’s website are only a portion of all his correspondence during his term. Bush in 2007 said that he had received 550,000 emails through the Jeb@jeb.org address -- plus another 2.5 million through his public email address -- so obviously plenty were not included in the batch of about 250,000 that the Bush team posted in February. As American Bridge said, Bush decided what would go to the archives and what wouldn’t. The PAC told us that’s comparable to Hillary Clinton’s situation and is therefore hypocritical. (We’ll leave it to readers to decide what’s hypocritical and what’s not.) Bush’s camp told PolitiFact Florida that he had more than satisfied state reporting requirements. "Governor Bush complied with Florida’s broad public records laws for more than 15 years, beyond what was even required by the law," Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell. "His emails related to state business have been available via requests to the state for that entire period of time." The emails Bush turned over to the state are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising -- although there are several emails from donors posted on the site. Bush acknowledged he kept his emails on a private server. But while American Bridge tried to draw a parallel between Bush’s self-selection and Clinton’s current dilemma, we found nothing to suggest Bush’s editing had violated Florida’s Sunshine Law. State statute allows officials or an authorized custodian to determine which emails go into the public record based on whether they pertain to state business. The state archives only receive and preserve them. Another big difference is that while Clinton was not open about her private email use, Bush was transparent about the fact that he was using a private account, according to First Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen. "There’s nothing in the public records law about personal accounts," Petersen said about rules in Florida. "Some agencies have policies discouraging the use of personal accounts, but that was after Bush left office." If there is any question that emails had been left out of Bush’s disclosure, a person or group could make a public records request and file a civil suit if they think something’s missing, she said. State law does allow private inspections of electronic devices if warranted to find missing texts and emails. But no one has made that challenge of Bush, Petersen said. Overall, the emails provide Bush with a talking point leading up to 2016, said Bill Allison, senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation. He’s done what Florida law requires and exerted pressure on his presumptive Republican rivals. "Once you create the expectation to become transparent about something, people will expect that," Allison said. "I’m not sure this will catch on the same way as health records and tax returns, but it could make it very difficult for candidates who do not comply." Our ruling American Bridge said "Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose." Bush did self-edit which emails were posted on a website he established in February, but the PAC doesn’t note one important point: State law allows him to do that. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05166	Says Mitt Romney has said "we don't need 'more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.' "	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/18/tennessee-democratic-party/tennessee-democrats-accuse-romney-saying-more-cops/	The debate over economic policy is beginning to dominate the presidential campaign, and when presumed Republican nominee Mitt Romney visited suburban Nashville for a June 12 fundraiser, the Tennessee Democratic Party pounced on a statement it called "shocking." The TNDP sent a flurry of similarly worded press releases and one read: "Rep. Mike Turner, a career firefighter, and Principal Roxie Ross, a lifelong educator, held a press conference call at 2 p.m. responding to Mitt Romney’s claim that we don’t need ‘more firemen, more policemen, more teachers’ ahead of a Romney fundraiser in Williamson County." Of course, Republicans often criticize "big government" and sometimes portray government workers as overpaid, but it’s rare to see any politician single out a specific set of workers -- particularly firefighters and police officers. Noting that the TNDP isolated a phrase in quotes, we wondered if Romney’s words might have been taken out of context. TNDP communications director Brandon Puttbrese responded to our inquiry with links to news articles about Romney’s comments, made just after Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker won the recall election. Here is the full Romney quote from which the TNDP lifted the remarks. Romney is referring to President Obama’s call for more spending to boost the public sector: "He wants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people." We note that Romney did not say there should be "fewer" policemen, firemen and teachers, but the full context of the quote makes clear he disagreed with Obama’s stated policy goal of having Congress appropriate more stimulus money to add more of them. The more accurate characterization of Romney’s remarks would have been that "Romney disagrees with President Obama’s goal of adding ‘more firemen, more policemen, more teachers,’ " though we recognize that doesn’t have the same zing as the TNDP’s wording. Romney’s quote came at the same event in Iowa in which he criticized Obama for saying that "the private sector is doing fine." Obama's private sector comment was part of a longer discussion in which he argued the massive public sector job losses have been a drag on an economy that has otherwise steadily added private sector jobs. Romney has pushed back, suggesting that it is an overweight public sector that is shackling the private sector. One point worth noting here is that Walker has responded to the Obama-Romney tete a tete by defending his own record when it comes to firemen, policemen and teachers. He said recently: "I know in my state our reforms allowed us to protect firefighters, police officers and teachers. That's not what I think of when I think of big government." Our check of other Romney comments found that he has typically been critical of government workers in general without specifying workers such as cops and firefighters: "That stimulus he [President Obama] put in place — it didn’t help private sector jobs, it helped preserve government jobs. And the one place we should have shut back — or cut back — was on government jobs." Our ruling The Tennessee Democratic Party says Mitt Romney has said "we don't need 'more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.' " That's a slight exaggeration of Romney's remarks -- he was responding to Obama's comments on them, not outlining his own specific policy against them. Still, that's pretty close to what Romney said. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Tennessee Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-06-18T05:00:00	2012-06-12	['None']

pomt-04162	Northern Virginia is the most "heavily trafficked place in the country."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/dec/20/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-northern-virginia-has-ther-nations-/	Northern Virginia is No. 1 in the nation when it comes to traffic jams, according to Gov. Bob McDonnell. "Here we are with the most heavily trafficked place in the country in northern Virginia and Hampton Roads not far behind," McDonnell said during a Dec. 6 news conference while promoting a plan to seek $500 million in transportation funding from the General Assembly. Anyone who’s endured rush hour in Northern Virginia can relate. But is it really the most congested place in the country? Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman McDonnell, told us the governor’s claim is based on a 2011 study by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University, an often-cited gauge of traffic congestion in the U.S. The research found that drivers in the Washington area -- which includes parts of northern Virginia and Maryland as well as the nation’s capital -- spent an average of 74 hours in traffic jams during 2010, the most in the country. Chicago, where commuters spent an average 71 hours on snarled roads, ranked second. Los Angeles was No. 3, where the delay per commuter was 64 hours. McDonnell’s off-the-cuff language was a bit inexact. He said Northern Virginia was the worst, but it was the Washington region overall that earned that distinction in the Texas institute’s report. We learned that McDonnell was more precise while delivering a prepared speech at a statewide transportation conference on Dec. 5, saying that TTI "ranked the Washington, D.C./Northern Virginia metropolitan area as the most congested area in terms of commuter delay in the U.S..." The Washington region has been ranked first or second in the yearly delay per commuter in each annual TTI report going back to 1999. Hampton Roads, meanwhile, was listed as having the 26th highest delay per commuter at 34 hours in 2010. The Richmond region, with 20 hours of delay each year per commuter, ranked 64th out of the 101 urban areas examined. The report also found the Washington area had the second highest traffic time index -- which is the ratio of how much extra time a commuter drives in peak travel conditions as opposed to "free flow" conditions. By that score only Los Angeles, had a worse rating. TTI plans to update its traffic report in early 2013. TTI’s findings have been widely cited by the Federal Highway Administration and the media. Philip Shucet, a former Virginia transportation commissioner, told us the TTI report is "the industry standard" for measuring traffic. Other organizations studying traffic have come to different conclusions than TTI. INRIX, a traffic analysis company based in Seattle, this past May released its report on the worst cities for traffic in 2011. Honolulu topped the list; INRIX found drivers there wasted 58 hours last year in traffic. Also ranking in the top five were Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Bridgeport, Conn. The Washington area, where drivers spent 45 hours in traffic jams, ranked sixth. We wondered why the two studies -- TTI examining 2010 traffic patterns and INRIX looking at 2011 conditions -- came up with different results. David Schrank, co-author of the TTI report, said his institute uses a narrower definition of metropolitan areas than INRIX. Shrank said the TTI study, cited by McDonnell, focuses on densely developed areas in and near to the urban core of a region. INRIX, he said, includes less populated areas on the fringes of urban regions. Schrank also said INRIX study measures traffic by vehicle speed, while TTI took both traffic speed and traffic volume into account. We made three attempts by phone and email to reach a spokesman for INRIX, but received no response. INRIX keeps an updated scorecard on its website listing the cities with the most traffic congestion in U.S. As of this writing, it showed Los Angeles at No. 1 and Washington at No. 9. GPS maker Tom Tom releases its own gridlock report every three months based on information from drivers using its devices. Of all U.S. and Canadian cities it surveyed from April to June, in 2012 Los Angeles congestion was rated the worst. Among U.S. cities, Washington was tied with Seattle for third place. Tom Tom bases its rankings on a measure of how much added travel time is caused by congestion in each area it examines. Our ruling McDonnell, during a news conference, said Northern Virginia is the most "heavily trafficked" area in the country. His wording would have been more precise if he had said Northern Virginia is part of the most congested area in the country that also includes Washington and populous Maryland suburbs, according to a 2011 TTI report. McDonnell did make that distinction in a prepared speech he gave one day earlier at transportation conference. While traffic is bad around Washington, not all experts agree it’s the worst in the nation. We found reports by other transportation organizations that ranked the region sixth and third. But we don’t fault the governor for relying on the TTI study -- the industry standard for measuring traffic. So we rate McDonnell’s comments True.

pomt-07197	"I did not say that I would not have them [Muslims] in my Cabinet."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/08/herman-cain/cain-denies-claims-he-said-he-would-not-appoint-mu/	Former pizza CEO and talk show host Herman Cain loves to say he’s not politically correct. Now, his brash words have pushed him to correct the political record. On "The Glenn Beck Program" radio show May 24, the Republican presidential hopeful tried to rebut accusations that in March he said he would not appoint Muslims to Cabinet positions or federal judgeships in a potential Cain administration. "I did not say that I would not have them in my Cabinet. Because if you look at my career, I have hired good people regardless of race, religion, sex, gender or orientation and this sort of thing," Cain told Beck. This statement, made just three days after Cain’s May 21 announcement that he is running for president, was only his latest attempt to put the controversy to rest. Reporters have dogged him on the issue for two months. "People are trying to push me in a corner," he groused in April to The Daily Caller, a news website founded by conservatives. No one puts Herman Cain in a corner. But fact-check him? We can’t resist. What did he say in March about appointing Muslims to his Cabinet? We called and emailed the Cain campaign for comment. It did not respond, so we proceeded without it. Metro Atlantans are accustomed to Cain as an agitator. He’s been goading liberals for years as a conservative talk show host on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB. Cain’s comments about Muslims barely made news locally, but with the growth of his support, he faces more scrutiny than ever before. Now we’re learning whether what plays with metro Atlanta conservatives works on the national stage. The controversy began in February in a Milner church. Cain talked about his bout with stage four liver and colon cancer and suggested he was uncomfortable when he learned his surgeon’s name was "Abdallah." The evangelical publication Christianity Today asked Cain about his comment in a March 21 article. Cain replied that Muslims should stop trying to convert others. "And based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, you know, they have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them," Cain said. Five days later, a blogger for liberal ThinkProgress.org questioned him at the Conservative Principles Conference in Des Moines, Iowa. "Would you be comfortable appointing a Muslim either in your Cabinet or as a federal judge?" the blogger asked. "No, I will not," Cain replied. "And here’s why. There is this creeping attempt, there’s this attempt to gradually ease Sharia law and the Muslim faith into our government. It does not belong in our government." By that Monday, Cain was explaining his comments to national media outlets. He’s been at it ever since. This brings us back to Beck’s radio show, where Cain said his statement was "misconstrued." "[The reporter] said, would you be comfortable with a Muslim in your Cabinet?" Cain told Beck. "And I immediately said, without thinking, ‘No, I would not be comfortable.’ I did not say that I would not have them in my Cabinet. Because if you look at my career, I have hired good people regardless of race, religion, sex, gender or orientation and this sort of thing. " Indeed, the question the ThinkProgress.org blogger asked Cain was whether he would be "comfortable" with a Muslim in his Cabinet, not whether he would appoint one. If you take the video on its face, the explanation Cain gave on Beck’s show seems reasonable. The problem is that it contradicts what Cain said about his own comments. The Monday after the news broke, Cain recounted what he said on Fox News’ "Your World with Neil Cavuto." "A reporter asked me ‘Would I appoint a Muslim to my administration?’ I did say ‘no,’ " Cain told Cavuto. "And here’s why ... I would have to have people totally committed to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. And many of the Muslims, they’re not totally dedicated to this country," he said. In April, Cain repeated he would not hire a Muslim to radio host Bryan Fischer, who is also a conservative. We found an excerpt from the show on a website critical of the political right: "[T]he comment I made that became controversial, and my staff keeps hoping will die, is that I wouldn’t have Muslims in my administration. And it’s real simple. The Constitution does not have room for Sharia law ... and to introduce that element as part of an administration when we’ve got all of these other issues, I think I have the right to say that I won’t," Cain said. Cain’s opposition to Muslims in his Cabinet is not ironclad. After some prodding, he told Cavuto he might consider a Muslim who’s loyal to the Constitution but never met one he would choose for his Cabinet. Still, contrary to his claim on Beck’s program, Cain did say he would not have Muslims in his Cabinet. Not once or twice, but three times in as many weeks to ThinkProgress.org, Cavuto and Fischer. When scrutiny grew stronger, Cain backtracked. During Beck’s program, he parted ways with the truth. The heat is on, and Cain’s Pants are on Fire.

Bill Young "has accepted $737,000 from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/26/charlie-justice/bill-young-earmark-campaign-contributions/	U.S. Rep. Bill Young, R-Indian Shores, has never been bashful about directing federal money back to his constituents in the Tampa Bay area. But now those hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks are being criticized by his opponent's campaign. Democratic state Sen. Charlie Justice of St. Petersburg levied a series of allegations against the 20-term congressman in a two-minute web video airing on Justice's website. Among them is a claim that Young, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who served as its chairman for six years, has received more than $700,000 in campaign contributions from people, businesses and groups who received his earmarks. "Just this year, Bill Young put earmarks on the federal budget totaling $128 million," the ad says. "Young has accepted $737,000 from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks." (We should note that the "this year" reference is to FY 2010, not 2010 the calendar year. Republicans, including Young, have said they won't pursue earmarks in the FY 2011 budget). The ad, which began running April 14, 2010, has been criticized by the Young campaign, in part because it attempts to link Young to disgraced ex-lobbyist Jack Abramoff, even though Young says the two never met. As a longtime member of Congress and a high-ranking member of the appropriations committee, it's not surprising that Young would receive campaign contributions from the people and companies he's supported, especially those located in his district. But the number in Justice's ad caught our attention since Young has been easily re-elected every year he's run. (He's only received less than 60 percent of the vote once, in 1992.) Justice's campaign said the $737,000 figure includes campaign contributions going back to 1997. That translates to about $61,000 a year. Justice campaign manager Mitch Kates provided PolitiFact Florida with a 37-page document that purports to show the link between the contributors to his campaign and how Young helped their companies secure federal earmarks. The document says that it tracks earmarks -- federal projects that lawmakers designate for particular companies or other entities -- from budget years 2008, 2009 and 2010, and contributions since 1997. The math The Justice campaign traced earmarks sought by Young to the company or group that would receive the money. The campaign then searched the Federal Election Commission database and OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan campaign finance website, to see who from that company or group donated to Young. Justice's campaign also used OpenSecrets to match lobbyists to the company getting the earmark. The overall dollar figure in Justice's ad includes lobbyist contributions as well, and goes back to 1998. We checked their methodology by running a search for a company called DRS Technologies, a Largo company that Justice says has received more than $12 million in earmarks since 2008. We found their approach sound. But in the process of doing that, we found that the Justice campaign's numbers didn't add up. We extracted all the contributions from the document and found more than $1 million in contributions -- not $737,000. Kates said the published figure was conservative. That seems strange because of the specificity of $737,000. But then, as we kept looking, we saw that there was more wrong with the numbers. The Justice campaign counted the same bundles of contributions five times or more, which vastly inflated the figures we found. The multiple countings occurred most often in dealing with lobbyists, who often represented multiple clients that dealt with Young. One Washington lobbying firm Van Scoyoc Associates, for instance, had identical contributions counted at least five times by Justice, because the company represented multiple clients. Also counted multiples times were contributions by the PMA Group, a defunct Washington lobbying firm that was under investigation for funneling bogus campaign contributions to then-U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa. We created our own database that includes only unique contributions that Justice identified as coming from the beneficiaries of earmarks. The total? Closer to $600,000. Then Kates hastily provided PolitiFact Florida a second document showing another $1 million in contributions that he said was the result of additional research. But we found almost all of those contributions were duplicates as well. But, when you add both documents, the total is $795,000. So while the Justice approach was sloppy and full of double-counting mistakes, the number happened to be about right. Connections to earmarks Now we need to know if Young helped those companies get earmarks. We started by asking the Justice campaign how it tied Young to a specific earmark. Until 2008, earmarks in Congress were almost always requested anonymously. So Justice's campaign aides looked at earmark requests only from budget years 2008, 2009 and 2010, they said. They searched the Office of Management and Budget archives for Rep. Young’s earmarks from fiscal year 2008 and the Congressional Record for earmark declarations from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 (Those declarations are actually on Young's Congressional website). "Each procured earmark from FY 2008 or 2009 was verified in the bill’s explanatory statement, and FY 2010 earmarks were verified in committee reports wherever possible," Kates wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida. "We then cross-referenced the parties involved with his contributors in the Federal Election Commission database, searching specifically for each organization’s board of trustees and any executive leadership committees. Any contributions from the parties' lobbyists, as identified through the Open Secrets database, were also included." Young's earmark requests generally split into one of two categories -- either local projects in the Tampa Bay area, or defense projects for companies that have offices in Young's district. A few examples: In 2009, Young requested $4 million for researcher SRI International to continue a port security project in conjunction with the University of South Florida. SRI International announced plans to build a facility at the Port of St. Petersburg in 2006. Also in 2009, Young requested $6 million for Honeywell in 2009 to develop new ballistic missile technology (they have a location in Clearwater). For the 2010 budget year, Young requested $14 million for Pinellas County for beach erosion control, $250,000 for a business assistance project, $300,000 for a county substance abuse treatment program, and $250,000 for homeless medical care, among other requests. Young requested $4.8 million in 2009 and 2010 for St. Petersburg College for its National Terrorism Preparedness Institute, and $831,000 for terminal improvements at St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport. Young spokesman Harry Glenn questioned a few of the earmarks Justice had tied to Young, specifically money for defense contractor Northrop Grumman. But he agreed Young had requested most of the money -- mainly for companies doing business in the Tampa Bay area. Glenn rattled off a list -- DRS Technologies of Largo, General Dynamics of St. Petersburg, Lockheed Martin of Oldsmar, Science Applications International Corp. of St. Petersburg, Information Manufacturing Corporation of Clearwater, L-3 Communications of Tampa, General Electric of Clearwater, Alliant Techsystems of Clearwater, Honeywell of Clearwater, Marine Desalination Systems of St. Petersburg. "These are all constituent companies doing work and employing people in Congressman Young's district," Glenn said. So Justice seems to be on relatively firm ground that the companies and other entities have received earmarks. But he makes a big leap of logic in tying individual contributors to those companies. Who's a recipient First, it is not technically accurate to say "recipients of his earmarks" gave Young that money. The recipients of his earmarks were mostly corporations, but they are prohibited under federal law from making campaign contributions. Justice bases his claim on the fact that many individuals who contributed to Young's campaign are employed by those companies. But Justice has not proven that those many individuals directly received money from the Young earmarks. Indeed, in our cursory examination of the names, we see examples of people who may not work directly in projects that got the earmarks. Paul Sacco, the director of Pinellas County's real estate management department, donated $250 to Young's campaign in 2008, but we didn't find an earmark that would seem to relate to real estate. St. Petersburg College administrator Janice Buchanan donated $250 to Young in 2006 while working with the college's foundation. Thomas Miles, an engineer with Science Applications International Corp., donated $1,250 to Young in 2006 and 2008, but Miles isn't listed as an executive with the company. Justice's list also includes contributions from Pinellas County elected officials: $1,000 from County Commissioner Karen Seel and $250 from former County Commissioner Ronnie Duncan. Justice also makes a big leap in trying to tie the lobbyists to the companies and other entities that received the earmarks. For example, DRS Technologies, of Largo, spent $2.86 million with 13 different lobbying firms in 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Under Justice's calculations, a contribution from any employee of any one of those 13 firms would be linked to Young. But that can be misleading because companies hire lobbyists for specific projects. Some firms might have contact with Young and his office. Many won't. Glenn said several don't lobby Young on those earmarks, including the lobbying firm PMA Group. "PMA does work in Congress for DRS, but they never have come to our office to discuss an issue," Glenn said. "We never had any contact with them on this company." Our ruling Back to Justice's claim. In a web ad, he claims that U.S. Rep. Bill Young "has accepted $737,000 from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks," and offers two documents totaling more than 80 pages to back up his claim. We checked the research and, quite frankly, find it a little squirrely. We know that Justice can only track earmarks back to 2008 because prior to that they were largely inserted anonymously, but he includes campaign contributions dating back to 1998. That's not a true apples to apples comparison. And the numbers don't add up. We don't know where Justice got the $737,000 from -- originally we tallied more than $1 million in contributions (though a lot of that was double counted). Then, Justice's campaign provided us with a second document with another $1 million in contributions (and again, a lot of that was double counted). Granted, the number still totals nearly $800,000 when you add both documents together and only count unique contributions. But Justice's claim is shaky because he is relying on two leaps of logic -- that any contributor who happens to be employed by a company is a "recipient" and that any lobbyist with a firm that did work for a recipient is tied to the earmark. Both create holes in his claim. We find it Half True.	None	Charlie Justice	None	None	None	2010-04-26T15:51:57	2010-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-15261	"Our last budget committed the highest level of need-based financial aid in state history."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-his-last-budget-committed-more-n/	In what read like an introduction to a campaign platform, Gov. Scott Walker outlined a series of potential presidential talking points in a June 8, 2015 op-ed published in the Quad-City Times, an Iowa newspaper. Among them: A line about making higher education more affordable for low-income families. "Our last budget committed the highest level of need-based financial aid in state history," Walker wrote. Is he right on that point? Looking at the budget When Walker made the claim, the 2015-’17 budget was still being debated in Madison, so that means his "last budget" would refer to the one for 2013-’15. In Wisconsin, budgets are done in two-year cycles, with each of the fiscal years beginning July 1 and ending June 30. Funding for most programs is broken out on an annual basis, so the two years in a biennial budget will often receive different amounts. Complicating matters: the actual numbers for how much the state spent in a fiscal year are typically not final until the following October. Asked to back up his statement, Walker's office pointed to data from the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau that show the last budget spent $121,034,960 for need-based financial aid for 2013-’14. That is a larger number than any previous year, but it does not account for inflation. When earlier years are placed on the same inflationary scale, the data shows $370,000 more was spent on need-based financial aid in Fiscal Year 2011. That was part of the budget was passed in 2009, when Democrat Jim Doyle was still in office. But there is a second year in that "last" budget Walker referred to. Since the final numbers are not out yet, we don’t know exactly what was spent in 2014-’15, but we do know that budget set aside $121,263,400 for the program. That would be the most of any budget. When you combine the 2013-’14 actual amounts with the appropriated amounts for 2014-’15, the figures come out to about $8 million more for need-based financial aid than Doyle’s 2009-’2011 budget -- even when the numbers are adjusted for inflation. But there is a bit more to the story. Wisconsin Covenant In 2011-’12, the first year of Walker’s first state budget, funding for need-based financial aid decreased. Since then, the amount has increased every year. And some of the increased cost is due to a obligations from a program created under Doyle -- the Wisconsin Covenant -- that Walker discontinued. The Wisconsin Covenant program allowed an 8th grader to sign a pledge that he or she would maintain a B-average and graduate from high school. If the student did that -- and met several other requirements, including submitting a financial aid application -- he or she would get a scholarship of a varying amount. Students were first able to sign the covenant in 2007, when Doyle was still governor. In 2011, the first group of students were able to collect on that covenant, soon after Walker took office. When Walker cancelled the program, those who already signed the pledge were to receive scholarship money if they remained eligible, but no new applicants could enter the program after September 2011. The Wisconsin Covenant accounted for nearly $8 million of the need-based financial aid total in 2013-’14. Meanwhile, it was expected to account for more than $10 million in 2014-’15. If the money to support the program were subtracted from Walker’s budget, Doyle’s budget would have given more to need-based financial aid than Walker’s. Our rating Walker said: "Our last budget committed the highest level of need-based financial aid in state history." That is accurate, even when sliced different ways. But it is the worth noting that the spending levels are boosted significantly by spending required from a program created by Doyle -- the Wisconsin Covenant -- that Walker ended.

pomt-07335	Under President Barack Obama, the United States has "doubled our exports."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-doubled-exports-during-hi/	During a May 10, 2011, speech at a Democratic National Committee event in Austin, Texas, President Barack Obama offered a litany of accomplishments to a friendly audience. "We passed equal pay for equal work legislation," Obama said. "We made the largest investment in education in our history, but didn’t just put more money in, initiating unprecedented reforms that are having ramifications all across the country. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history and have created entire new industries, like the advanced battery manufacturing industry here in the United States of America, where we look like we'll have close to a 40-percent share of the market in the next few years. Doubled our exports. Ended a war, as promised, and are working another war in a place where we're going to start drawing down our troops this year and are in a position to help Afghans secure their own country." The claim that immediately caught our eye was that during Obama’s presidency, the United States has "doubled our exports." So we decided to take a look. We turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which produces monthly statistical tables on trade. One table offers data that begins in January 2009 -- when Obama was inaugurated -- and ends in March 2011. It shows imports and exports on a monthly, annual and year-to-date basis, all of them seasonally adjusted. Here are a few ways to slice and dice the numbers. Most recent month compared to January 2009: In January 2009, exports of goods and services were $125.5 billion. For March 2011, that number was $172.7 billion -- a 38 percent increase. Most recent month compared to the equivalent month in 2009: In March 2009, exports totaled $126 billion. For March 2011, that number was $172.7 billion -- a 37 percent increase. First quarter of 2011 compared to first quarter of 2009: In the first quarter of 2009, exports were $378.4 billion. For the first quarter of 2011, exports were $505.2 billion -- a 34 percent increase. Extrapolated amount for all of 2011 compared to the actual amount from all of 2009: For all of 2009, exports totaled $1.571 trillion. Multiplying the first-quarter 2011 results by four produces a full-year projection of $2.021 trillion for 2011 -- a 29 percent increase. All told, then, the data show an increase in exports of about one-third from the baseline Obama inherited -- not double. This isn’t the first time Obama has spoken of doubling exports. In his 2011 State of the Union address, he said, "To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -– because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home. Already, our exports are up." But Bryan Riley, a senior trade policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that the president hasn’t met the goal yet. "Exports are up but have not doubled," Riley said. When we presented the data to the White House, a spokesman did not dispute our numbers. "The president is committed to doubling our exports within five years and we have already made substantial progress toward that goal," said White House spokesman Adam Abrams. So Obama was getting ahead of the facts when he said that the United States has doubled its exports. That’s the goal, and progress toward it is being made. The doubling hasn’t happened yet. So we rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-05-11T16:10:42	2011-05-10	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-15200	Says "if the (Iran nuclear) deal gets rejected, they still get" $150 billion.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-gets-keep-150-billion-even-if-us/	Whether Congress approves it or not, Iran will still reap all the financial benefits of the nuclear deal, Donald Trump said on NBC’s Meet the Press Aug. 16. When asked by host Chuck Todd how he would work with the Iran deal if he becomes president, Trump, running for the Republican nomination, said he would be "tough" on the contract, but it would be hard given all the money Iran would already have acquired as a result of the deal. "The problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion," Trump said. "Do you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn't believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich." Does Iran actually get $150 billion from this deal? And if Congress rejects the deal, does Iran still get the money? Let’s take one question at a time. The $150 billion It’s true that Iran will reap significant economic benefits from the deal because many sanctions levied against Iran will be lifted as long as Iran complies with restrictions on its nuclear program. But it’s not like Iran will automatically receive a check or, as some critics have called it, a signing bonus. "Will some considerable portion get transferred to Iran? Sure. But not all of it will automatically. That’s not how this works," said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law and an expert on economic sanctions. First, the money already belongs to Iran; Iran just hasn’t been able to access it. The $150 billion figure, primarily thrown around by critics, typically refers to the dollar amounts of Iran’s foreign assets that could be unfrozen when sanctions are lifted. An example is money Iran has earned from selling oil but is held by a foreign bank. There’s also the many billions of dollars Iran has lost in revenues and opportunity costs because the country has not been able to fully participate in the global marketplace, Malloy said. But $150 billion is on the high end of estimates of the value of Iran’s foreign assets, which start as low as $25 billion, said Garbis Iradian, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. Most experts we interviewed, including Iradian, peg the amount of unfrozen assets at about $100 billion, but no one is 100 percent sure of the amount. You can probably get to $150 billion if you count up every possible type of money that sanctions have made difficult for Iran to access and use, said Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. Iran has financial obligations other than the sanctions, so even if all the sanctions are lifted, they won’t suddenly have all of these assets at their disposal. For example, Iran owes billions to China for infrastructure projects. Lower estimates take into account restrictions on the money other than the sanctions, Nephew said. So even if the total assets are $150 billion, it’s unlikely that that much will actually be available to Iran when sanctions are lifted. The Obama administration has said that after Iran pays its outstanding financial obligations, it will have about $56 billion at its disposal. What if Congress rejects the deal? While the exact amount of Iran’s unlocked sanctions is less precise than Trump describes, experts told us that Trump’s broader point is largely correct: Even if Congress does not approve lifting the United States’ sanctions, Iran will likely be able to get a good chunk of the money it currently cannot access. This is because other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and the United Nations, could decide to stop enforcing their own sanctions against Iran anyway. Iradian estimated that Iran would be able to access $40 billion of its currently inaccessible assets in that scenario, and the Iranian economy could get an even bigger boost if European companies decided to invest heavily in Iran. The United Nations, for one, has already passed a resolution to provide Iran with the funds withheld under the sanctions if Iran meets its end of the bargain, noted George Perkovich, an expert on nuclear strategy and vice president of studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Of course, Iran wouldn’t be able to access all of its assets in this scenario because much of them are tied up in the United States’ sanctions. "There would be some crumbling of the sanctions wall, but that does not on its own free up the entire $100 billion," Malloy said, adding that the United States controls much of the petroleum market, which is important to Iran’s economy. At the end of the day, the discussion entails a lot of speculation, but nearly every expert said there’s a reasonable likelihood that other countries would choose to stop enforcing sanctions no matter what the United States decides to do. It’s worth noting that it will be difficult for Congress to maintain the sanctions because there would have to be enough votes to survive a presidential veto. Our ruling Trump said of Iran that "if the (nuclear) deal gets rejected, they still get" $150 billion. Experts told us that even if Congress rejected the nuclear deal -- thus maintaining current U.S. sanctions -- other countries could stop enforcing their own sanctions anyway. As a result, Iran would be able to access at least some of its assets that have been frozen under international sanctions. However, experts said it’s highly unlikely that this would amount to $150 billion, the maximum estimate of how much Iran could benefit by the lifting of all international sanctions without regard to Iran’s outstanding financial obligations. Without United States participation, the best estimate we could find was $40 billion. Trump’s claim is partially accurate but cherry-picks the high end of estimates for the unfrozen assets. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-08-16T18:26:33	2015-08-16	['Iran']
pomt-11814	Says a Washington Post reporter is "calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore" for up to $7,000.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/15/anonymous-caller/no-washington-post-did-not-offer-7000-roy-moore-di/	A person purporting to be a Washington Post reporter left a voicemail on an Alabama phone number offering up to $7,000 to women willing to malign Republican senate nominee Roy Moore. The Nov. 14 message was received by Pastor Al Moore of Creola, Ala., who played the recording for local CBS affiliate WKRG. The news outlet described the message as a "robocall" and said "at least one person in our viewing area" received the message. (They did not respond when we asked how many people had received the call.) "Hi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I’m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5,000 and $7,000 dollars," the message stated. The caller then said the newspaper "will not be fully investigating these claims" but would make a written report, and said he could be contacted via email at albernstein@washingtonpost.com. This voicemail smelled fishy to us — so we decided to investigate further. It turns out the call was a hoax that appears calculated to undermine the work of real journalists. Voicemail comes on heels of Washington Post report The suspicious voicemail comes as top Republicans call for Moore to end his bid in the Dec. 12 special election after the Washington Post reported that Moore, while in his 30s, had sexual encounters with several teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl, according to the women. Since then, another accuser has alleged that Moore assaulted her in locked car when she was 16. Moore’s attorney, Trenton Garmon, seized on the phone call during a Nov. 15 appearance on MSNBC and floated the possibility of pursuing legal action. "Robocalls are now even being made asking for people to come forward against Roy, which I think is kind of an indication of the political climate that we're in, and we plan on even probably getting into some depositions related to that," said Garmon, who acknowledged that he did not know who was responsible for making the call. Washington Post's denial It’s unclear what relationship, if any, the voicemail bears to the Nov. 9 Washington Post report concerning Moore’s alleged sexual encounters. But for his part, Moore forcefully denied the allegations and threatened to sue the Post after their bombshell investigation led top Republicans to call for Moore’s exit. "The Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign," he said at a Nov. 12 campaign speech in Huntsville, Ala. "These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue -- and for which they will be sued." The Moore campaign did not respond to our request to comment on this story. Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron dismissed the voicemail as an effort to "discredit real journalism," saying the reporting methods described in the call bear "no relationship to reality." "The Post has just learned that at least one person in Alabama has received a call from someone falsely claiming to be from The Washington Post," Baron said in a written statement. "The call’s description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism." The Washington Post further noted in a Nov. 15 article that no Post newsroom employees are named "Bernie Bernstein" or "Al Bernstein." Additionally, Moore, the pastor who received the voicemail, told WKRG that his attempt to email the address provided in the message came back undeliverable. (The same was true of our efforts.) Our ruling A caller purporting to be a Washington Post reporter named Bernie Bernstein left a voicemail saying the newspaper was offering women up to $7,000 for damaging information on Roy Moore. The Washington Post denied having made the call and dismissed it as an effort to discredit journalism. Further, it said the reporting methods described in the call — offering cash in exchange for muck — runs counter to Post practice. We found no record of any Washington Post reporters or editors named Bernie Bernstein or Al Bernstein, and emails sent to the address provided in the message came back undeliverable.

pomt-07636	"Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/16/bill-kristol/bill-kristol-says-20-percent-us-electricity-comes-/	The extensive damage to Japanese nuclear facilities following the massive earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, has focused more attention on nuclear power than it has received in years. On the March 13, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, about how the situation in Japan could affect the use of nuclear power in the United States. "Bill, at a time when Democrats and Republicans were finally getting together and supporting nuclear power as safe, clean, non-polluting energy, and President Obama had $36 billion in loan credits in his 2012 budget to promote more plants, what happens now to the domestic industry?" Wallace asked. Kristol responded, "Well, we can probably save $36 billion from the 2012 budget because I think it's a bit of a setback to nuclear power here in the U.S. I'll go out on a limb and make that prediction. "But, you know, people will say, well, we build new plants. Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California. Very earthquake-resistant, but I guess there could be a tsunami there. It sounds like it's the tsunami that did the most damage in Japan. "So, on the one hand, it's impressive how resistant these things are to damage. On the other hand, I do think, as you say, these alarming fears, whether or not they -- certainly if they come to fruition, and let's hope they don't -- it's obviously a setback to nuclear power. And I think it makes even stronger the case for going after natural gas and oil domestically." We wondered whether Kristol’s statistics on electricity generation and the number of nuclear plants were correct -- and we figured our readers would be too. So we looked into it. We first turned to the Statistical Abstract of the United States, a compendium of statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau. It includes a table summarizing electricity generation by fuel type through 2009. Dividing net electric generation via nuclear power by net generation in the electric power sector as a whole, we get 20.9 percent. That’s close enough to Kristol’s comment to pass muster with us. Next, we turned to the website of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency has a page where you can find active nuclear generating facilities on a map and in alphabetical order. We counted them up, and there are exactly 104 sites listed. Kristol’s only error was in suggesting that there are 104 nuclear power plants; in fact, there are 104 nuclear power reactors. Because many plants have more than one reactor, the actual number of plants is 65. (This list doesn’t count military and scientific reactors, which are not overseen by the agency.) Finally, we checked Kristol's claim about nuclear facilities on the California coast. There are, in fact, two: Diablo Canyon, located 12 miles from San Luis Obispo, and San Onofre, located 46 miles from Long Beach. The photographs on the agency's website clearly show that the plants are located near the water. So Kristol was basically correct, only erring with his mislabeling of "reactors" as "plants." We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Bill Kristol	None	None	None	2011-03-16T11:07:32	2011-03-13	['United_States', 'California']

"Hollywood actor Bruce Willis: ‘Trump is the best U.S. president ever, anyone who dislikes him should move to..." read the headline on Global Headlines, a site pushing sensationalized stories. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. The story claims that Willis called Trump the "best U.S. president ever" and that anyone who doesn’t like him should move to Canada. The story revisits an interview Willis did with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon in 2015. But it doesn't make the story more credible. Willis joked with Fallon suggesting that his natural hair looked a lot like Trump’s, poking fun at the idea. Photos then circulated of Willis wearing the signature "Make America Great Again" hat on the show, leading to a stream of stories claiming Willis was a Trump supporter. The image even caught the attention of Trump, who tweeted that Willis was wearing his hat on the Tonight Show. In reality, Fallon never asked if Willis supported Trump, and Willis never expressed support for Trump as a candidate. The Global Headlines article also says Willis is conservative. Willis has shown mixed political leanings. In 2007, he told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly that he has just as many liberal ideas as he does conservative. When looking up the quotes credited to Willis in the article, we found no credible sources that proved them to be real. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-11707	"Breaking: Muslim New Jersey Mayor just banned the word ‘Christmas.’"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/20/thelastlineofdefenseorg/no-new-jersey-mayor-elect-didnt-ban-word-christmas/	A newly elected mayor in New Jersey has banned the word "Christmas" at government functions, prompting an angered man to toss a souffle at his head, a fake news article proclaimed. "Breaking: Muslim New Jersey Mayor just banned the word ‘Christmas.’" stated a Dec. 16 headline on the Last Line of Defense, a fake news website that identifies itself as satire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no such ban on the word ‘Christmas’ by Mayor-elect Ravi Bhalla. Bhalla, a city council member and lawyer, was elected mayor Nov. 7 out of a field of six candidates. He will be officially sworn in Jan. 1, 2018. The previous mayor, Dawn Zimmer, decided not to run again. Bhalla will be the first Sikh mayor of Hoboken. During the election, a flier with the phrase "Don't let TERRORISM take over our town" above a picture of Bhalla appeared on car windshields. The Last Line of Defense article stated that Bhalla received a Christmas gift from Zimmer: a chance to make one mayoral decree at the annual Christmas gala at the Patrick C. Farley Community Center at 5th and Brussels. The two politicians shook hands and then "Bhalla shocked the roughly 200 citizens in attendance with his decree that "the word ‘Christmas shall not be said at government functions,'" the article stated. Apparently that didn’t sit well with one man in the audience, according to the website which used a quote allegedly from the Hoboken Journal. "The crowd began to boo loudly and one man was escorted out after throwing a souffle at Bhalla’s head, knocking his turban off. Eventually, things returned to normal but there was a sense of displeasure the rest of the evening." We searched the website of the Hoboken Journal, a blog, and found no such quote. The Last Line of Defense article then stated that the "war on Christmas has gone on long enough." "If Mr. Bhalla doesn’t like it he can go back to his home country of IDontGiveAFuckistan and leave Americans to be Americans," stated the article. Hoboken spokesman Juan Melli said that the only truthful part of the article is that Bhalla will become the mayor in January. The photo accompanying the article is of Bhalla and Zimmer in front of City Hall. "Everything else is garbage," Melli told PolitiFact. "I don’t know how else to put it." There was no Christmas gala (there was a Christmas tree lighting that was indeed open to the public). Also there is no intersection of 5th and Brussels in Hoboken. And Bhalla isn’t Muslim -- he is a Sikh. Bhalla, a child of Indian immigrants, was born in New Jersey. Melli said that he sent the fake news article to Bhalla and that the mayor-elect laughed. A headline stated that a "Muslim New Jersey Mayor just banned the word ‘Christmas.’" Bhalla, the mayor-elect of Hoboken, didn’t ban the word ‘Christmas’ and he is not Muslim.

pomt-01589	ISIS is "right now crucifying Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees."	false	/texas/statements/2014/sep/05/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-isis-crucifying-christians-iraq-nail/	We were unaware of a horrible turn against Christians in Iraq until U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz brought it up. The Texas Republican, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, recently told a reporter for WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, that the Islamic State group, in the news for numerous acts including killings of two U.S. journalists, is "right now crucifying Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees." Crucifixions as in killing someone by nailing or tying his or her hands and feet to a cross or, as Cruz said, a tree? Cruz, news stories offer no evidence We emailed Cruz’s office about how he knew of the crucifixions and received no evidence in reply. Our own research did not uncover news stories confirming the crucifixion of a Christian in Iraq or elsewhere while U.S. advocates and experts on the bloody conflicts in Iraq and Syria expressed unfamiliarity with such actions. But Christians, along with people of other faiths, have been in the crossfire of the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. On Aug. 8, 2014, a CNN news story said Iraq's largest Christian town had been overrun by ISIS, causing thousands of Christians in the city to flee, just as other minority groups targeted by ISIS had done, as well as Shiite Muslims, the story said. CNN said the French government confirmed the Iraqi city of Qaraqosh had fallen into the hands of ISIS. The story said ISIS earlier took over Mosul, another city in Iraq, prompting many residents to flee to Qaraqosh. In Mosul, CNN said, ISIS issued an ultimatum to Christians living there: Convert to Islam, pay a fine or face "death by the sword." CNN’s story noted the Pope saying on Twitter Aug. 8, 2014: "I ask all men and women of goodwill to join me in praying for Iraqi Christians and all vulnerable populations." A few weeks later, CNN described young boys being trained by ISIS at a camp in Syria and, according to a participant identified only as Mohammed, witnessing a crucifixion. According to the Aug. 29, 2014, news story, some boys were forced to watch hideous things. "They used to bring young (kids) to the camp to lash them," Mohammed said. "When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings." "We saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for three days, and we saw a woman being stoned (to death) because she committed adultery," Mohammed said. Experts: Crucifixions possible, not observed yet Close observers of the turmoil in Iraq and Syria said they could imagine ISIS doing crucifixions. No one expressed awareness of Christians already being crucified. By email, Daniel Sullivan of a Washington, D.C.-based group, United to End Genocide, noted the CNN story before telling us he hadn’t seen "confirmed reports in either Iraq or Syria" of Christians being crucified. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Cruz’s claim went overboard, as far as he knew, though he said ISIS has been ruthless about hurting or killing resistant residents. "There have been people put on crosses," Landis said. "But it’s not Christians." Landis guided us to an April 29, 2014, Fox News story accompanied by photographs of men slung on crosses in Raqqa, a town in northern Syria. The story cited a Syrian opposition group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, saying ISIS jihadists were hanging the bodies of executed enemies on crosses crucifixion-style in the town. The story, citing "multiple reports," said ISIS had ruled over Raqqa for the previous year, killing its remaining rebel population and demolishing national relics. The news story said Ibrahim Alrquaoui of the opposition group said the killed men were rebels that had previously fought against the Syrian government of Bashir al-Assad. The story said that according to Alrquaoui, the ISIS charged the seven men with espionage and attempted assassination of the group’s leaders. According to the story, Alrquaoui said he witnessed the executions himself and took photographs, which were then posted on the group’s Facebook page and circulated on the Internet. The photographs showed different men bound to crosses in what appeared to be a public square area, though the Fox News story said it could not be independently confirmed the subjects were dead or, if they were, by what means the executions had been carried out. "The pictures do not show any apparent signs of the men nailed to a cross, nor are there any obvious, visible signs of fatal wounds," the story said. Landis also pointed out a Feb. 26, 2014, online post by Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, an Oxford University student, describing a traditional practice in Islam for a Jew or Christian living under the authority of an Islamic state agreeing to pay a jizya, or poll tax, in return for protection from the state. The Feb. 26, 2014, post, on Landis’ website devoted to Syrian politics, history and religion, said the tax is equivalent to Mafia racketeering; a failure to pay leads to the loss of protection. ISIS similarly imposes the tax, the post said, in northern Iraq and Syria. By telephone, Jeffrey White, a defense fellow at The Washington Institute specializing in the military and security affairs of the Levant and Iran, told us he monitors videos from Iraq and Syria and is familiar with the ISIS practice in Syria of hanging a body from a post after a killing. (That’s not a crucifixion as that act is commonly defined.) But, White said, he hasn’t seen videos of anyone nailed to a tree -- in Iraq or elsewhere. Cruz’s claim "doesn’t accord with what I’ve seen," White said. Our ruling Cruz said ISIS is "right now crucifying Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees." Earlier this year, ISIS strung up the bodies of individuals already executed on cross-like posts in a Syrian town. We did not confirm ISIS crucifixions of Christians in Iraq nor did Cruz give factual backup. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-13611	Says his father-in-law, former Gov. Linwood Holton, "integrated Virginia public schools."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-over-credits-his-father-law-linwood-holt/	Tim Kaine has a special place on his heroes list for his father-in-law, former Virginia Gov. Linwood Holton. "Linwood Holton, who turns 93 next month, was the Republican governor of Virginia from 1970 to 1974 who made the decision to desegregate Virginia schools," Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said during an Aug. 4 speech to the National Urban League. Kaine told the civil rights group that before Holton, Virginia governors had played "all kinds of tricks" to avoid complying with the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 that struck down public school segregation. "But Lin decided we want to be an aristocracy of merit; everybody’s equal," Kaine said. "He integrated Virginia schools." He gave the same credit to Holton during a speech in Miami on July 23, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton introduced Kaine as her running mate. Kaine also said Holton "integrated Virginia’s public schools" during his July 27 speech at the Democratic National Convention, when he accepted the vice presidential nomination. Was Holton really the force that broke Virginia’s history of school segregation? The answer, two historians and a political scientist told us, technically is "no" but symbolically "yes." "It is inaccurate to say Linwood Holton integrated Virginia public schools," said Robert Pratt, a University of Georgia historian who grew up in Virginia and in 1992 wrote a book about the desegregation of Richmond schools. "All of the desegregation that came about in Virginia came as a consequence of federal court action." Benjamin Campbell, author of "Richmond’s Unhealed History," agreed. "The integration of schools in Virginia was court-ordered," he said. But Holton’s public and personal reactions to the court orders, they added, set a tone of acceptance in Virginia for a new era of integration. A brief history Let’s start with the Brown v. Board of Education decision. At that time, Virginia’s government had been dominated for 28 years by a segregationist Democratic machine led by U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr. Rather than integrate public schools, Byrd led a movement to close them and set up publicly funded tuition grants to help white students attend private academies. The result was that some black students, most notably in Prince Edward County, were left with no schools to attend. Virginia lawmakers also created a three-person pupil placement board tasked with assigning all students in the state to schools. Black students seeking to transfer to white schools rarely received permission from the panel. Congress put pressure on Virginia and other Southern states by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among other things, it allowed Washington to withhold education funds to states that refused to integrate public schools. Massive Resistance and the pupil placement board gave way in the mid-1960s to a new ploy. Localities adopted "freedom-of-choice" plans that gave all students the right to select their schools, regardless of race. But this didn’t spur integration. Black and white parents were concerned about sending their children to schools where they would be minorities, Campbell said. In addition, the plans typically did not provide transportation for students who wanted to go to schools outside their neighborhoods. In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the freedom-of-choice plan in New Kent County wasn’t meeting the mandate of establishing "a unitary non-racial system of public education." It ordered federal district courts to devise school plans for New Kent and other freedom-of-choice localities in which "racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch." The combination of the 1968 high court ruling and the increasingly real threat of losing federal funds spurred many school systems toward serious integration. Richmond, however, dragged its feet. Enter Holton Holton’s election in 1969 was historic. It marked the first time since the Reconstruction days of 100 years earlier that Virginia elected a Republican governor. It also ended a 44-year era in which the Byrd Machine held the state’s top office. During his inaugural address in January 1970, Holton said "old dogmas have died" and called for a new era of integration. "Here in Virginia, we must see that no citizen of the commonwealth is excluded from participation in both the blessings and the responsibilities of our society because of race," he said. "We will have a government based on a partnership of all Virginians, a government in which there will be neither partisanship nor prejudice of any kind. As Virginia has been a model for so much else in America, let us now endeavor to make today’s Virginia a model for race relations." Holton’s calls for cooperation touched a special nerve in Richmond, where black parents filed suit to integrate the city’s schools. In March 1970, U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. ordered Richmond to draft a new integration plan. On Aug. 17 - just two weeks before schools opened - Merhige approved a plan for the busing of 13,000 students. In addition to Richmond, Roanoke, Lynchburg and Norfolk were under court-ordered busing plans for the new school year, sparking white flight in all of those cities. Amid the controversy, Holton and his wife, Jinks, had to make a choice. The Executive Mansion, while located in Richmond, is state property. So the Holtons could send their three children to any public school in Virginia. They chose to enroll them in the predominantly black schools that were closest to the mansion. On Aug. 31, 1970, Holton escorted his oldest daughter - 13-year-old Tayloe - into John F. Kennedy High School. The moment was memorialized by a photo that ran the next day in newspapers across the country, including just under the masthead of The New York Times. Kaine’s future wife, Anne, and her younger brother, Woody, were taken to Mosby Middle School on the first day by their mother. Experts who told us the courts integrated Virginia schools still heap praise on Holton. "Of course, the courts ordered everything," Campbell said. "But this was the first political leader in Virginia to advocate for integration. From the point of view of those of us living in the state, it was absolutely amazing. It was unheard of." "I have the utmost regard for Linwood Holton," Pratt said. "What he did played a very important symbolic role." Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said, "We had a history of governors and other officials ignoring orders on desegregation or tying them down on appeals. (Holton) obeyed the busing order, and that did result in integration." Sabato said Holton’s political career suffered from his stand. The state "Republican Party wouldn’t have anything to do with him after that," he said. In 1978, Holton sought the party’s nomination for the U.S. Senate and finished last among three candidates at the state GOP convention. We should note that Merhige also suffered consequences after ordering busing. The judge received death threats and sent his children out of the country. His dog was shot, and a guest house on his property was burned down. Our ruling Kaine often says that Holton, his father-in-law, "integrated Virginia public schools." He offers no qualifications and creates an inaccurate impression that Holton, as governor, ordered the opening of all state school doors to all students. The technical credit belongs to the courts, which outlawed segregated schools in 1954 and for years afterward closed loopholes fashioned by politicians in Virginia and other Southern states. Those efforts were stymied in Virginia in 1970 by court-ordered busing. Holton’s symbolic efforts, however, can’t be dismissed. Unlike Virginia governors before him, he embraced integration. Unlike his predecessors, he didn’t contest court orders. And in a small but significant way, it can be said that he helped to integrate Virginia schools by enrolling his three children in predominantly black schools. So on the whole, we rate Kaine’s statement Half True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-08-15T02:00:00	2016-08-04	['Virginia']
pomt-08452	Says state Rep. Patrick Rose votes 90 percent with liberals, backed the state's largest tax increase, proposed nearly $15 billion in government spending and supported "Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/15/jason-isaac/jason-isaac-says-state-rep-patrick-rose-votes-libe/	Playing on his foe's name, Republican Texas House nominee Jason Isaac calls fourth-term Democratic Rep. Patrick Rose a "liberal thorn in our side." In a video ad that debuted online Oct. 7, Isaac lists pointed reasons to yank Rose, who's in his fourth term. Rose, the narrator says, "votes with the liberals 90 percent of the time, ...backed the largest tax increase in Texas history... (and) proposed nearly $15 billion in new government spending." The narrator adds: "Rose even supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas." The Truth-O-Meter analyzed the biggest-tax-increase charge earlier this year when U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison laid it on Gov. Rick Perry. We rated False Hutchison's statement that the state's revamped business tax amounted to the largest tax increase Texas has ever had. In checking Hutchison's statement, we noted that her campaign said the revised franchise tax, often called the margins tax, cost taxpayers $8.8 billion in 2008-09. Her camp compared that figure with the estimated $5.7 billion tax package signed into law in 1987 by Gov. Bill Clements. At the time, that increase was widely reported to be the largest tax hike in Texas history. There were fatal flaws in Hutchison's math. For instance, the $8.8 billion figure is the total amount generated by the franchise tax, not the net increase resulting from the revision that became law under Perry. The actual increase — revenue above what the old franchise tax would have brought in — was about $3 billion, significantly less than what had been projected. We compared that with the largest single piece of the Clements-era tax package: a hike in the sales tax. After it was enacted, sales tax revenues went up $4.2 billion during 1988-89 compared with the previous biennium. Isaac's campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, cited the same 2006 tax law, House Bill 3, as the basis for Isaac's "largest ever" claim. Casteel also referred us to the same source referenced by Hutchison, a Dallas Morning News blog post that doesn't that doesn't specify how the paper compared 2006 changes in business and tobacco taxes to past tax hikes. Meantime, two experts we contacted--Dale Craymer of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and Talmadge Heflin of the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation--independently told us the 2006 tax changes did not amount to Texas history's largest increase. But what of Isaac's other not-rosy claims? Casteel said the reference to Rose voting with "the liberals" 90 percent of the time was backed up by an analysis of House votes by Mark P. Jones, who chairs Rice University's political science department. Casteel guided us to a Texas Tribune chart based on Jones' work showing that Rose is the 68th most liberal of the House's 150 members and the 7th-most conservative Democrat. We didn't find an indication Rose had mostly voted with liberals, so we called Jones, who said that there's nothing in his research, based on Rose's votes throughout his House career, to justify the 90-percent statement. While Rose "votes in a more liberal manner than any Republican in the House," Jones said, "he will be one of the five most conservative Democrats if he comes back." We alerted Casteel to Jones' interpretation; he then shared another way of breaking down Rose's voting record -- based solely on 561 Rose votes during the 2009 legislative session. A research sheet prepared for Isaac's campaign says the selected votes don't include opening-bell procedural votes or votes when no one voted "no." It doesn't specify each vote. The sheet says Rose voted with 11 Democratic colleagues identified as "most liberal" on the Tribune chart 87 to 92 percent of the time, voting 90 percent or more often with six colleagues in the "most liberal" category: Reps. David Leibowitz of San Antonio, Eddie Rodriguez of Austin, Jim Dunnam of Waco and Alma Allen, Garnet Coleman and Ana Hernandez of Houston. In contrast, Isaac's sheet says, Rose voted like the former Republican House speaker, Rep. Tom Craddick of Midland, 65 percent of the time. Back to the professor... Jones said via e-mail that Isaac's camp correctly identified the "most liberal" members using his research. But he said they used a less sophisticated approach by including votes not necessarily reflective of ideology. Casteel said Isaac's statement about Rose proposing nearly $15 billion in spending is based on the projected costs of proposals authored by Rose in the 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 legislative sessions; spreadsheets Casteel provided to us indicate that Rose offered 96 measures over those years that together would have cost the state nearly $14.4 billion through six years. But did they? We asked which of the Rose proposals passed into law. Casteel countered that Isaac was talking about what Rose wanted to spend--not what he passed into law. Why six years, since legislators typically only focus on two years of spending at a time? (That's the length of the budget adopted every odd-numbered year.) Casteel said Isaac's statement relies on the six-year spending forecasts because that's what Rose's ideas would have cost taxpayers over the longer term. Casteel said Isaac's statement that Rose "supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas" refers to a May 21, 2007 floor vote. Online legislative records show that Rose was among 51 members to vote against tabling a proposal by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, directing the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to prepare a report "detailing the means by which this state could insure the maximum number of people and eventually implement a system of universal health care." The motion to table prevailed, killing Burnam's amendment. All in all, does Isaac's prickly statement draw blood? Isaac's largest-tax-increase claim is incorrect. And while Isaac's method of counting votes indicates that Rose votes 90 percent of the time with House liberals, it's based on research conducted by a university professor who says Isaac's message -- that Rose's ideology swings liberal -- isn't justified by Rose's career voting record. Per Isaac's spending charge, the tally of what Rose's proposals would have cost is closer to $14 billion than the nearly $15 billion Isaac proclaims. Also, adding up projected costs over six years--rather than the two years covered by each budget--isn't how lawmakers usually weigh fiscal implications. Isaac's statement that Rose "supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas," reflects Rose's vote against ending debate on a proposal calling for a report on how the state could implement a "universal health care" system. Ordering a feasibility report on universal health care--in action, ahem, more than a year before Obama won election as president--is not the same as endorsing a particular system. We rate Isaac's four-part sally Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05060	Says state Sen. Paul Sarlo "said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget’" and "voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/08/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-state-senator-promised-no-ta/	The Democrat-led Legislature has promised to cut taxes if Gov. Chris Christie hits his revenue targets in the coming months, but the Republican governor has a warning for New Jerseyans: "Be very suspicious." After offering such advice at a June 26 town hall meeting in Ocean County, Christie suggested that Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, had broken a promise not to have any tax hikes in the new state budget. "Oh, and by the way, that same senator, Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget,’ voted – voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million," said Christie, according to a video posted June 26 on YouTube. PolitiFact New Jersey found that the governor’s statement is mostly accurate, but missing a couple of critical details. Sarlo (D-Bergen) vowed to not include new taxes in the upcoming budget during a February TV interview and then voted last month to raise income taxes by around $800 million in the new fiscal year. But the governor failed to mention two points: that tax hike technically was separate from the budget bill approved by the Legislature, and it only would have affected taxpayers with more than $1 million in taxable income. First, let’s discuss Sarlo’s earlier comments and recent vote. In a Feb. 22 interview on NJToday, Sarlo said the following in regard to the spending plan for fiscal year 2013, which started July 1: "There will be no new taxes in this budget." But at the June 21 meeting of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, Sarlo voted for a bill raising the state income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million. That tax hike -- known as the so-called "millionaires tax" -- would generate between $754 million and $836 million in fiscal year 2013, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. The money would be used to boost property tax relief payments. By June 28, the Legislature -- with Sarlo voting yes -- had approved the tax hike. Christie conditionally vetoed the legislation on July 2 and called on legislators to amend the bill to implement a tax cut. Democrats, who set aside $183 million in the fiscal year 2013 budget for a possible tax cut, have said the reduction only would occur if Christie meets his revenue projections between now and December. Now, let’s address the points missing from Christie’s claim. When discussing Sarlo’s vote "to raise income taxes $800 million," the governor failed to mention that the tax hike only would apply to taxable income exceeding $1 million. Unless they’re millionaires, the people at that town hall meeting would not pay higher income taxes. Also, Christie’s statement suggests that the tax hike was part of the budget sent to him by the Legislature. But it technically wasn’t. The millionaires tax bill was separate from the fiscal year 2013 budget bill approved by the Legislature on June 25. Christie approved the budget, with various changes, on June 29. The millionaires tax would have added money to the fiscal year 2013 budget, but it was still considered separately. In a statement issued before Christie’s conditional veto, Derek Roseman, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, said: "This bill was not considered in conjunction with the budget, is not part of the budget, and whatever happens to it will have no impact on the budget." The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling At a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Sarlo "said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget’" and "voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million." It’s accurate that Sarlo said "there will be no new taxes in this budget" and later voted to increase income taxes by around $800 million in the new fiscal year. But Christie failed to mention that the tax hike was considered separately from the budget bill and that it only would have affected millionaires. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-03494	"Our ranking in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago, and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/09/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsins-ranking-place-do-/	Faced with job growth lagging behind most states, Gov. Scott Walker chooses alternative measures to put a positive spin on the state’s economic performance. He touts falling unemployment. He highlights the rebound in manufacturing and the modest tax cuts he pushed through. And he points to improved national rankings for the state’s business climate. In a Milwaukee television interview that aired June 2, 2013, the Republican governor said liberals are pushing the idea that he’s more interested in running for president than being governor because they have no other argument to use against him. "They can’t argue with the success," Walker told host Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s Upfront show. "We went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower. The deficit was $3.6 billion when I took office. We now have a half a billion dollar surplus." He capped off his list with this talking point: "Our ranking in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago." Has the state’s business climate rank improved dramatically under Walker, who took office in January 2011? The rankings The governor points to CEO Magazine’s May 2013 ranking of Wisconsin as 17th best for business, based on a survey of chief executive officers nationally. In 2009, as Walker noted, the survey put Wisconsin at 43rd; A year later, the rank was 41. Just a few weeks into his term, early in 2011, the survey ranked the state as 24th. The CEO survey measures perceptions, not performance. It asks CEOs how conducive each state is for business based on taxes and regulation, workforce quality and living environment. What about other studies? We asked Walker’s office, and spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster pointed to: --CNBC’s "America’s Top States for Business," which moved Wisconsin up to 17th from 25th and 29th in the previous two years. That index uses 51 measures of competitiveness. -- Site Selection Magazine’s 2012 elevation of Wisconsin to its top 25 (rank of 13th) states for business climate for the first time since 1998. The study is based in part on surveys of corporate site selectors. Those back up the notion that the business climate has significantly improved under Walker. We found six other widely quoted business-climate rankings, and they show a much more mixed picture. --The Tax Foundation’s "2013 State Business Tax Climate Index" has Wisconsin in the 10 worst states (43rd), based on how 100 tax variables affect competitiveness. That’s typical; the ranking in this study was 43rd and 40th and 42nd in the previous three years. -- Forbes Magazine’s "Best States for Business" put Wisconsin at 42nd in December 2012, with particularly low marks for growth prospects and labor supply. The ranking was 43rd in the year before Walker took office. -- Beacon Hill Institute’s "12th Annual State Competitiveness Report" ranked Wisconsin 18th, an improvement from rankings of 22, 23 and 22 in the prior three years. --The American Legislative Exchange Council’s "2013 ALEC-Laffer State Economic Competitiveness Index" put Wisconsin’s economic outlook ranking at 15th, a big improvement over the 32, 30 and 23 rankings of recent years. The study put the state’s economic performance rank at 41st, a modest improvement over 42 in 2012 and 44 in 2011. Two prominent studies were new or significantly revised, preventing historical comparisons. They show Wisconsin in the bottom half of states for business. --The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked the state 27th in its "U.S. Small Business Policy Index 2012." --The 2013 "Enterprising States: Getting Down to Small Business" study sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranked Wisconsin’s business climate 39th. We should note that business-climate rankings have long attracted criticism from left-leaning groups. "Grading Places," a report by Good Jobs First, a labor-backed group, calls them pseudo-scientific attempts by business-friendly groups trying to justify corporate demands for lower taxes and suppressed wages. This item does not judge the rankings’ reliability, only Walker’s description of the state’s business climate as set out in these rankings. Our rating Walker said the state’s ranking "in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago, and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago." That’s correct, in one study of CEO perceptions, but the "state’s ranking" depends on which study you read. The governor cherry-picks the most favorable of three studies on his side, but ignores studies showing much lower rankings and little or no improvement, creating a misleading impression of dramatic improvement. In reality, the rankings are very mixed. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-06-09T09:00:00	2013-06-02	['None']

pomt-08933	Says that Lee Fisher once said, "I never met a gun control bill I didn’t like."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/25/rob-portman/lee-fisher-never-made-infamous-gun-statement/	It’s a quote that keeps on giving, campaign after campaign. It’s even slightly plausible, if you’ve followed Lee Fisher’s positions on gun control. The quote, cited since at least 1994 by gun-rights advocates, political opponents (including the campaign of at least one Democrat), blogs and websites: "I never met a gun control bill I didn’t like." But did Fisher really say it? We turned to groups that have used the quote against Fisher, including the Buckeye Firearms Association, the Ohio Republican Party and the campaign of Rob Portman, the Republican running against Fisher for U.S. Senate. They all suggest his support for the Second Amendment runs from weak to nonexistent. We spoke with people who dealt with Fisher two decades ago and opposed him on issues in the Ohio Senate. We asked the National Rifle Association -- twice -- to dig into its research archives, although the NRA didn’t follow up either time. We checked decades worth of of newspaper clippings and websites, and asked those who keep using the quote to check their records in case they’ve found it. No one has. This has been an ongoing examination ever since the Buckeye Firearms Association and an operative in the campaign of Jennifer Brunner, a Democrat, separately cited the quote during Ohio’s Democratic primary. Fisher won that primary against Brunner, who is Ohio’s secretary of state. They and others noted earlier references to the quote, and not just from this year. The quote was a piece of political folklore, and Fisher had not appeared to do anything to tamp it down until recently. We won’t speculate why, although it’s clear that any discussion of Fisher and guns can get sticky when he says he’s a Second Amendment supporter. Fisher has tried repeatedly to regulate guns, whether from his perch as a former board member of Handgun Control, Inc., or from his service in the Ohio Senate, or from his time as Ohio attorney general. Fisher says that Americans have the right to own guns for protection and sport. But as he said in May on a radio program, "we should do background checks to make it harder for bad guys, or people who have a serious mental illness to get a gun." He embraced assault-weapons bans. Prior to 1993, when Congress passed the so-called Brady Bill to require background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases, Fisher tried repeatedly to get a similar law passed in Ohio. Second Amendment absolutists and many other law-abiding sportsmen disagree with Fisher. Critics cite other statements he has made in support of gun regulation, such as this, from a 1993 memo when Fisher was Ohio attorney general: ''The right to bear arms is a very limited right..." That’s how the Portman campaign characterizes Fisher’s statement, anyway, although the full quote was actually: ''The right to bear arms is a very limited right and the state and its political subdivisions have the authority to regulate the possession and use of assault weapons." So we can stipulate that no matter what Fisher says about his support for the Second Amendment, he and the gun rights lobby are going to be far apart. But what of the "never met" quote? When a Brunner operative and the Buckeye Firearms Association used it during the spring primary, The Plain Dealer mentioned it, writing, "Gun rights advocates as well as Brunner loyalists like to cite Fisher's famous quote from 1994: ‘I never met a gun control bill I didn't like.’" Fisher’s campaign then said it wasn’t sure of the quote’s origin or whether Fisher actually uttered those words. But the Ohio Republican Party used the quote in an online video attack ad in June. Shortly after, Portman used the quote in a campaign news release. Told that The Plain Dealer was looking into the quote’s origins and questioned its authenticity, a Portman spokeswoman defended its usage, saying the quote had been in circulation for years without any record of Fisher disputing it. But Fisher’s campaign refutes the quote now. Fisher never said it, according to spokesman John Collins. We have searched and asked around widely and find nothing that contradicts him, nor did the Buckeye Firearms Association, which turned to its own sources and traced its usage to at least 1994. So where did the quote come from? That’s not entirely clear, but a 1989 column in the Columbus Dispatch sheds some light. Fisher was a state senator then, trying for the fifth time to pass a statewide gun-control law. This time, Fisher’s proposal was getting a second look, and then-state Sen. Paul Pfeifer, the Republican who chaired the Judiciary Committee, indicated he would give Fisher a hearing. Pfeifer, describing the political climate for gun control, told the Dispatch then that Fisher had a reputation of having "never met a gun-control bill he didn’t like." Those were Pfeifer’s words, however, not Fisher’s. Pfeifer, now an Ohio Supreme Court justice, told The Plain Dealer he doesn’t recall details of what he may have said in 1989, but "if you found the quote, then I probably said it." Pfeifer added, "It’s tough enough being responsible for the things you did say" in a long political career. "And it’s hell being blamed for something you never did say." Seems fair enough to us. That’s why we find this claim False. Comment on this item.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2010-07-25T06:15:00	2010-06-28	['None']
pomt-08900	"There's no negative advertising in my campaign at all."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/jul/29/bill-mccollum/negative-campaigning-not-me-says-bill-mccollum/	Bill McCollum tried to put his tougher-than-expected Republican primary for governor into perspective during a discussion with reporters in Tallahassee on July 29, 2010. Here's the upshot: Rick Scott has spent millions of dollars crafting a negative lie-filled television campaign that has distorted voters' impressions of both Scott and McCollum, and voters don't yet have the full story. Asked what he needs to do to turn his campaign around ahead of the Aug. 24 primary, McCollum told reporters, "I'm simply going to be telling the truth about myself. This man's been telling lies on television with millions of dollars for weeks now. And I'm going to get an opportunity to finally spend my own money where I talk about the governor's race." Later, when reporters suggested that McCollum hasn't exactly been Mr. Clean Campaigner himself, the candidate bristled. "Well, look, there's no negative advertising in my campaign at all," McCollum said. "Some of the outside groups have been running advertising that are pointing out the truth about Mr. Scott and that's not negative." No negative advertising at all? As slightly more than casual observers in the governor's race, we found McCollum's statement puzzling. To us, the Scott-McCollum primary duel has been filled with plenty of vitriol -- on both sides -- for the better part of three months. We decided to put our recollection to the test. Let's go to the tapes. First, we need to mention that McCollum's initial TV ad was plenty nice. It features the endorsement of former Gov. Jeb Bush and highlights parts of McCollum's record as attorney general and his 500,000 jobs plan. The ad, you can see it here, includes the traditional images of McCollum speaking with groups of voters and then walking and seemingly giving orders or instructions to worker-type folks. McCollum's second TV ad directly takes on Scott, a former health care CEO who is self-financing his tea party-inspired campaign. The ad starts by playing a soundbite from Scott's own ads. Then, McCollum jumps in. "Rick Scott, let's get real. While your hospitals were profiting from abortions, I voted 100 percent pro-life. "You cashed in helping illegals send American dollars to Mexico. I led the conservative fight to secure our borders and against amnesty. "And while you pocketed $300 million by ripping off taxpayers, as attorney general, I recovered record millions from Medicaid fraud. "You put profit over principle, and that's wrong." But it's McCollum's next TV ad that comes with all the hallmarks of negative campaigning -- namely grainy photos, haunted house-style music, text flying across the screen, and nary a mention of McCollum. The ad is labeled "Innertube" by the McCollum campaign. "He's a special interest insider whose company defrauded Medicare and taxpayers while he pocketed $300 million," a narrator says. In another frame of the ad, a narrator says that while Scott has publicly opposed the federal stimulus, he's involved in companies who received stimulus funds. The claim comes with three images -- stacks of money kind of flopping in a breeze, a screen grab of President Barack Obama and then a screen grab of Scott. There's more: June 10: The St. Petersburg Times gets a hold of a McCollum mailer that is attempting to attack Scott on his abortion position. The front of the mailer has a woman slumped with her back against an industrial style wall, covering her face and pulling her hair. In big red letters that could give a voter the impression of blood, the mailer begins, "It's a shame," then continues in white lettering, "it's clear when it comes to pro-life issues, Rick Scott is ruthless -- his bottom line comes first." The mailer continues on the back, with more blood-red type, by saying that Scott profited from abortions as CEO of the hospital chain, Columbia/HCA. June 27: A robocall from the McCollum campaign: "Meet Mr. Slick -- Rick Scott. "He's been busted twice this week by Florida newspapers for telling whoppers about Bill McCollum. According to the experts, Mr. Slick -- Rick Scott -- and his campaign have been lying about Bill McCollum's position on the issues of abortion and immigration. "Between Obama and Crist, Floridians are tired of typical politicians willing to say anything to be elected. In August Republicans have a choice. Let's restore principled conservative leadership to Tallahassee. Vote for Bill McCollum." June 28: A fundraising letter by McCollum calls Scott a "disgraced" and "lousy manager" whose hands are "filthy" regarding Medicaid fraud at Columbia/HCA. "He's lucky he's not in prison," McCollum writes in the letter. "And now with a shameless audacity that would make Bill Clinton blush, he says he wants to bring his business savvy and acumen to Tallahassee." July 2: In a web ad, the McCollum campaign says Scott's excuse -- that he didn't know about the fraud at Columbia/HCA -- is "like saying a mafia kingpin doesn't know about his henchmen's crimes." As the narrator says the line, a floating head of Scott is given a black fedora and a trench coat. Then money starts flying through the frame of the ad. Then Scott starts to spin in circles and gets bigger. Then someone starts laughing. July 15: A new mailer, called the Two Faces of Rick Scott doesn't include any mention of McCollum. Instead, it claims that "Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy" (which PolitiFact Florida rated Barely True) and that "Rick Scott's company creates products for the gambling industry." July 27: A new web ad attacks Scott's time at Columbia/HCA, saying he got a $310 million golden parachute "courtesy of American taxpayers." The $310 million represents Scott's severance package when he left Columbia/HCA. The ad is set to Rick Astley's song, "Never Gonna Give You Up," which has become part of a Internet fad called "Rickrolling," where people think they're watching one thing, then get bait-and-switched with Astley's song. We should note that these are all advertisements by McCollum's campaign, and not the 527 groups that are supporting his candidacy. That means McCollum has final approval over their content. And we should make clear that Scott's hands aren't clean himself (See here, here and here, for starters). Determining whether McCollum's ads are all truly "negative," or rather what politicians like to call "contrast" ads, is something of a subjective exercise. Contrast ads typically say things like "Candidate A is for this, well I'm for that." Or, "Candidate A says he'll be tough on crime, but he voted for this." Leaving some room for leeway, we don't want to make a blanket statement that everything we found should be classified as negative. But calling your opponent Mr. Slick, or dressing him up in a fedora and trench coat meets a common-sense definition of negative advertising. So does an abortion mailer with blood-red type, or a TV ad that focuses entirely on your opponent, and uses gimmicks like spooky music and grainy photos. McCollum said "there's no negative advertising in my campaign at all." But there's plenty of evidence to the contrary, and a seasoned campaigner like McCollum has to know it.

pomt-08094	"[State Rep. Doug McKillip’s] donors deserve a refund."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/15/jane-kidd/party-switchers-anger-leaders-dont-have-refund-con/	The 2010 election didn’t put an end to the growth of the Georgia Republican Party, which now dominates state government. After the ballots were counted, six members of the state House of Representatives and one state senator who raised money, ran for office and were elected as Democrats jumped to the GOP. "Foul!" cried Democrats. And when state Rep. Doug McKillip of District 115 in Athens bolted for the Republicans earlier this month, party officials ramped up the rhetoric. McKillip switched parties after he was elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. Party officials were outwardly angry with McKillip, the No. 2 Democrat in the House. Democrats openly called McKillip a "turncoat" and ended one press release about the defection with the formal definition of a "Traitor: One who betrays another's trust or is false to an obligation or duty." "His donors deserve a refund; his voters deserve a recall," state Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kidd pronounced in the Dec. 7 press release, a day after McKillip's party change. But do they? We at PolitiFact Georgia specifically wondered if there is anything that mandates a party-switcher to reimburse the folks who gave the candidate money. After all, most of those donors probably assumed McKillip would serve the party whose banner he carried during the election. McKillip said he has no immediate plans to make refunds. "No one has asked me to refund any money," he said in a telephone interview. "I would certainly discuss it with anyone who asked for a refund. "I’m getting five-to-one positive reaction." Kidd was not among the positive. "I used the word ‘deserve’ because I believe it," Kidd told PolitiFact Georgia. "I think it’s a dishonest act to run in one party and then switch after you win." But Kidd admitted she knew of nothing that would mandate a refund to donors. Michael Jablonski, general counsel for the state Democratic Party, said he was unaware of anyone who has refunded donor money after a party switch. "He has a moral obligation to return money to donors who thought he was a Democrat," Jablonski said. "He should also resign so there can be a special election so people can determine if they want a Democrat or Republican in that office." Jablonski pointed PolitiFact to the Democratic Party’s bylaws, which address any money given to a candidate by the party. Section BL1.8.2 states: "The State Party shall seek reimbursement of any contribution, whether real or in-kind, made to a candidate who qualifies for office as a Democrat and, after qualification, switches to another party." A review of McKillip’s campaign contribution reports on file with the State Ethics Commission, however, do not show any direct contributions by the state party to his campaign. Kerwin Swint, political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said he was unaware of anything that would force a party-switcher to return campaign cash. "There have been instances of officials returning money," he said, "but it’s totally voluntarily." Democratic Party spokesman Eric Gray predicted McKillip’s donors will seek revenge during the next election cycle. "There will be political repercussions for Doug as the people in his district vote him out in two years," Gray said. "It’s a liberal Democratic district." Perhaps. But the state Legislature also will be redrawing its new political boundaries as part of the 10-year redistricting cycle before the next election. And McKillip’s newfound party will be in charge of that effort. Democratic officials are entitled to the belief that party defectors should refund donors' campaign contributions. But the idea that a party-switcher actually owes refunds to his donors has no grounding in party rules or in state law. We rule the claim False.

pomt-01792	U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn "earned as much as $300,000 running a nonprofit that had laid off 90 workers."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/25/ending-spending-action-fund/super-pac-goes-after-nunn-layoffs-raise/	Even before David Perdue’s snatched the GOP U.S. Senate nomination from longtime Congressman Jack Kingston on Tuesday, the Ending Spending Action Fund was out with a television ad attacking the Democrat in the race, Michelle Nunn. Nunn, the daughter of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, is viewed as one of the party’s best hopes for reclaiming a high-profile statewide office and for helping the party retain its majority in the U.S. Senate. The Ending Spending Action Fund is a conservative, well-funded super political action committee that originally focused on earmarks but has expanded its message and targets. It was founded by Joe Ricketts, the former CEO of TD Ameritrade and a known conservative backer whose family owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Brian Baker, the group’s president, was an adviser to former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. The group’s attack ad on Nunn began running last weekend and is being aired statewide. The 30-second spot tries to tie Nunn to President Barack Obama (opening with an image of the two of them) and the Affordable Care Act. It also criticizes her leadership as CEO of the nonprofit Points of Light Foundation. "Come on -- Nunn earned as much as $300,000 running a nonprofit that had laid off 90 workers," the ad states. "Do you really think she’ll look out for us in Washington?" PolitiFact Georgia decided that was a claim worth checking. The Ending Spending Action Fund’s current attack ad makes some of the same charges that the group’s pre-primary spots did. Among them is a claim that Nunn supports higher taxes. PolitiFact in April rated that specific claim Mostly False. We reached out to Baker this week on the latest ad. He told us the PAC has spent about $900,000 on two anti-Nunn ads -- the one before the primary and the current spot. "We opposed no other candidates besides Nunn and (Republican U.S. Rep. Phil) Gingrey," he said in an email. Gingrey lost in the crowded May 20th GOP Senate primary that landed Perdue and Kingston in the runoff. Baker sent us a summary of the PAC’s ad research, including excerpts from articles in Politico, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and National Review about the merger of HandsOn Network, a nonprofit Nunn helped establish and ran, and the Points of Light Foundation, a service-oriented organization inspired by President George H.W. Bush. The research also focused on the layoff of 90 to 95 of the two groups’ combined 175 employees, as well as a jump in Nunn’s salary from $120,00 at Atlanta-based Handsn Network to $250,00 at Points of Light. Tax records show that Nunn’s salary was $250,000 in 2007, the first year she took over as CEO at Points of Light. Her total compensation three years later exceeded $300,000. Those same tax records show that her Points of Light predecessor, Robert K. Goodwin, earned $325,000 during his last full year on the job. Nunn told Politico that an executive committee set her salary and that she had argued for it to be lower than Goodwin’s because "of the tough times we were going through." Of the layoffs, Nunn said, they were necessary "in order to have the strength and success we’ve had today." Two years after the two groups merged, Neil Bush, a son of the first President Bush and chairman of the Points of Light board, described to the Chronicle of Philanthropy why the merger was needed. "The Points of Light Foundation, honestly, being an inside-the-Beltway Washington institution, became a little too dependent on federal funding, a little too bloated for the work it was engaged in," Bush told the Chronicle. Others said they initially wondered whether Nunn would make the hard decisions needed to make the merger work -- including the layoffs. "She clearly came through," Walt Shill, a managing director at Accenture Management Consulting, told the Chronicle in October 2009. The Chronicle of Philanthropy recently described Nunn as one of the most visible faces in a burgeoning national movement to promote volunteerism. Under her leadership, Points of Light has a $30 million-plus budget and 250 affiliates across the country, according to the group. Nunn’s on leave from the organization while she campaigns. She and Perdue face off in November to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. At Points of Light, Nunn’s annual salary has fluctuated. It was $197,506 in 2008 and 2009, according to the organization’s Form 990s. The annual filings show Nunn received $322,056 in total compensation in 2010, with a base compensation of $285,533. She took a cut in compensation in 2011, down to $299,346, with a base salary of $274,793. To sum up our findings on the new ad: The Ending Spending Action Fund is correct that about 90 jobs were abolished when HandsOn Network and Points of Light joined forces. It is also correct that Nunn has earned as much as $300,000 annually as head of the charity, getting a significant raise after the merger. Nunn got a huge raise while some employees were getting pink slips. But a bit of context is needed. Layoffs following mergers are common. And a nonprofit’s success can hinge on whether the public believes that it’s operating as efficiently as possible. Nunn’s salary at Points of Light, meanwhile, was less than her predecessor’s. We rate the statement in the ad as Mostly True.	None	Ending Spending Action Fund	None	None	None	2014-07-25T00:00:00	2014-07-20	['United_States']

Gallo’s claim caught our eye because we remembered the incumbent giving a different explanation in August 2016 when she asked council colleagues to remove Alison Alter from the all-volunteer panel after Alter, a philanthropic adviser, signaled plans to challenge Gallo, who worked as a real estate agent before her election to the council. Just the year before, Gallo nominated Alter to represent the district on the board. The 11-member City Council accepted her recommendation in May 2015 and Alter was eligible to begin her service a couple months later. When Gallo made her motion to remove Alter from the board, Gallo said she was acting after Alter refused to resign. On Aug. 4, 2016, Gallo’s colleagues approved Gallo’s request without discussion as part of the meeting’s consent agenda, which typically consists of uncontroversial items that are passed in a single council vote. "I asked Ms. Alter to resign from the Parks and Recreation Board because of her inherent conflict of interest due to her intention to run against me for City Council," Gallo said in an Aug. 4, 2016, statement. "It would be difficult for her to represent both me and the District 10 office in good faith while actively campaigning against me." Gallo made no mention then of Alter’s attendance. For this fact check, we reached out to Gallo’s campaign by phone and email, seeking the factual basis for her claim that Alter’s "F" for attendance preceded her removal from the board. Gallo’s campaign cited those two missed 2016 board meetings in an email to PolitiFact, defending the claim. Separately, we checked on Alter’s attendance history by reviewing meeting minutes for the 11-member parks board. From January to July 2016, the period claimed by Gallo, the minutes indicate the board had six meetings, and a subcommittee Alter served on also had six meetings. Alter missed two of each--meaning she missed one-third of the year’s meetings. But that’s an incomplete accounting. The year before, Alter was absent from her initial full board meeting on July 28, 2015, according to that meeting’s minutes. Yet she was present at each of her next eight meetings of the year--from Aug. 25 through Dec. 8, 2015--including three committee meetings, according to respective meeting minutes. All told then, Alter was present at 16 of 21 parks board or subcommittee meetings until her removal. That breaks out to a 76 percent attendance record, arguably a ‘C’ letter grade. We wondered if the city in any way grades or ranks board members on attendance. At our request, city spokesman David Green emailed us the city’s log of attendance for the parks board; it didn’t include attendance grades or such. Green said too that the city clerk’s office, which tracks board and council absences, doesn’t rank or grade members on attendance. Our ruling Gallo said Alter "got an F in attendance in 2016 as a Parks Board member and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council." This claim gets events flat wrong in that we found no evidence that Alter’s removal from the board--which occurred at Gallo’s behest--had anything to do with missed meetings. Austin volunteers who serve on city boards don’t get graded on attendance. Still, if Alter were graded on her entire tenure rather than a cherry-picked stretch, she’d merit a passing grade of ‘C.’ We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01977	It would be illegal for the Fulton County Commission to raise the county tax rate.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/18/john-albers/it-illegal-if-fulton-skirts-law/	The curious image of Fulton County commissioners being led away in handcuffs – for the crime of voting on their annual budget – recently popped into PolitiFact’s head. The reason? Fulton is taking steps to raise its countywide tax rate for the first time since 1991. Leaders in Georgia’s largest county say the state constitution was on their side when they voted last year to repeal a property tax cap that affects only Fulton. That set the stage for this year’s proposed increase. But state lawmakers point to House Bill 604, which bars Fulton from raising taxes until 2015. Any tax increase above the rollback rate – the millage that would raise the same money as last year – violates that law. "Contrary to law, the Fulton County Commission has taken preliminary action to move forward to increase property taxes," state Sen. John Albers, R-Roswell, wrote in an email blast to constituents. "This is both illegal and immoral." Illegal? That gives us the image of time in the clink – and makes it necessary to vet this one quickly since Fulton is taking up the issue of advertising the tax increase at its meeting Wednesday. Fulton Commission Chairman John Eaves says the law created by HB 604 violates the state constitution by singling out the county and removing the job of its leadership to set taxes. Moreover, advertising a rate increase doesn’t mean the County Commission will move forward to raise taxes, he said. The commission could lower the rate from the one advertised when it adopts the final rate this summer. "A final millage rate will not be set until our citizens have had an opportunity to be heard," Eaves said. "We are duly elected to ensure that the services our citizens have come to expect are available to them." The tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.211 mills. That’s about $817 on a $275,000 home with the $30,000 homestead exemption. The proposed rate of 11.781 mills – a 17 percent increase above the rollback and a 15 percent jump from the existing rate -- would add about $125 to the bill from last year and $140 from the rollback rate. State lawmakers from north Fulton have battled with the Democratic-led County Commission for years, saying their constituents do not get their money’s worth for those taxes. After unsuccessfully pursuing state legislation to split Fulton into two counties by lopping off the northern part, lawmakers drove home their belief that county government spends too much money by passing HB 604. "Fulton County already has a bloated budget, and this is us trying to make them responsible and follow the law," Albers said. "If not, we will seek a court battle, and that just means taxpayers will be paying even more to fight themselves. That makes no sense." But does disagreeing with a law mean acting against it is illegal? Reminding us of why people hate lawyers (and reporters), the legal experts say no. Unlawful, and illegal, are not synonyms in the technical sense, said Jack Williams, a professor of law at Georgia State University. The legislative branch of government – whether it’s the Legislature at the state level or a county commission locally – can adopt laws and speak to whether something is lawful, Williams said. But in our separated system, it’s up to the courts to decide whether a law is legal. For instance, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But not until 2012, when the Supreme Court upheld what’s become known as Obamacare, did it become legal. "It’s a political statement. It’s not a legal one," Williams said of the "illegal" claim. "He may be right in the end, but we don’t know yet. That’s why we pay taxes to build courthouses." But does it matter that most people aren’t attorneys and therefore have a different understanding of what "illegal" means? Maybe. After all, elected officials are sworn into office promising to act in accordance with state law and the constitution, said Mary Dudziak, a professor of law at Emory University. "Acting contrary to (the law) would be a law violation, whether or not a court has ever ruled on it," Dudziak said. "And it is not out of line for a lawmaker to say that a local tax is ‘unlawful’ because it is in conflict with a state statute." Ah, which brings us back to the difference between unlawful – something that violates a law – and illegal – a court’s decision on whether a law can be enforced. In that sense, parsing words matter. Albers said it would be "illegal" for Fulton to raise its taxes. That isn’t up to him any more than it is to the commission, regardless of common understanding of the word. For that reason, we rate his statement as Mostly True.	None	John Albers	None	None	None	2014-06-18T00:00:00	2014-06-14	['None']

pomt-08920	"We've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/27/timothy-geithner/geithner-claims-us-had-six-months-positive-job-gro/	During the July 25, 2010 segment of ABC's This Week, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner defended President Barack Obama's economic track record. He specifically brought up the successes that the administration has had in boosting activity in the private sector. "But right now, the best thing the government can do...is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again. Now, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good." We don't have the expertise to evaluate what constitutes "pretty good" job growth, but we can check the claim that the growth has been positive for the last six months. We visited the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of our favorite federal number crunchers. On July 2, 2010, the bureau released its monthly Current Employment Statistics Highlights report. On page five, the report contains statistics on seasonally adjusted private sector employment going back to January 2000. Geithner specifically referenced the last six months of the current year, so that's where we focused our attention. In December 2009, the private sector shed 83,000 jobs. That was significantly smaller than the average drop for the year, since the private-sector employment losses averaged 388,000 per month during 2009, according to the report. And so we come to 2010. How have we fared for the past six months? Here's a quick monthly summary of jobs added: January: 16,000 February: 62,000 March: 158,000 April: 241,000 May: 33,000 June: 83,000 Data for the month of July --which wasn't over when Geithner spoke -- won't be released until August, so that's the most up-to-date data available. The report notes that data for the two most recent months are preliminary. But unless there's an unusually big after-the fact correction for either month, it's pretty clear that Geithner was correct. We've seen positive job growth in the private sector from January to June. We rate this True.	None	Timothy Geithner	None	None	None	2010-07-27T12:01:22	2010-07-25	['None']
pomt-15126	"Almost 40 percent of all (undocumented) immigrants come by plane and they overstay their visas."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/08/jorge-ramos/ramos-40-undocumented-immigrants-come-air/	Depending on which poll you believe, between 40 and 50 percent of Americans support building a wall or fence along the border with Mexico. Jorge Ramos, a news anchor on Univision and Fusion, makes no secret of his disdain for the idea. A few days after attracting widespread notice after being thrown out of a Donald Trump press conference while asking a question on immigration policy (he was later allowed back in), Ramos accepted an invitation to appear on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor on Sept. 2, 2015. Host Bill O’Reilly’s first question pressed him on the issue of a border wall. O’Reilly: "You don’t want a border wall. You don’t want that. Why not?" Ramos: "It’s a completely absurd idea. Why would you want to build a 1,900-mile wall between Mexico and the United States if almost 40 percent of all immigrants come by plane and they overstay their visas?" Ramos is far from the first person to deploy the statistic that 40 percent of unauthorized immigrants come into the country under a legal visa and then stay beyond its expiration date. Two Republican presidential candidates, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have said the same thing. When we checked Rubio’s claim, we rated it Mostly True. However, Ramos’ statement adds the wrinkle that these people typically arrive by plane to rebut the notion that a wall would stop unauthorized immigration. As it turns out, it's hard to prove how they travel. Actually, 40 percent might be too low The key research on "overstays" -- the working term for this group of unauthorized immigrants Ramos had in mind -- was undertaken in 1997 by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS estimated that overstays accounted for 41 percent of the undocumented. Here we’ll add a bit of complexity. Immigration researchers divide the undocumented into two groups -- overstays and "entries without inspection." The first group might have a student, temporary work or tourist visa. The second group never went through any review. Robert Warren -- who helped with that work at the INS and now is a senior fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, a research group founded by Catholic missionaries -- told PunditFact that not only does the balance between the two still hold, it has likely tilted toward the overstays. "Since 2000, arrivals from Mexico, who are about 85-90 percent 'entries without inspection,' have plummeted, while overstays have increased, or stayed at about their historical levels," Warren said. Warren said the shift likely stems from U.S. efforts that have made it harder to enter by land. He sent us this graph from his latest research at the center. Source: Center for Migration Studies Analysts with two other organizations, the Pew Research Center and the Migration Policy Institute, largely back Warren’s overall estimates. "It is likely that the 40 percent figure is still valid and, if anything, the share of unauthorized immigrants who are visa overstayers is probably higher than 40 percent," said Jeffrey Passel at Pew. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said his group uses a wider range for overstays of one-third to one-half. While he’s comfortable with that, he noted it ultimately goes back to data collected by Pew in 2006. "It’s widely cited and generally accepted as accurate, but it should be taken with a grain of salt because the estimate is old and characterized by some uncertainty," he said. Rosenblum said the Department of Homeland Security has developed a way to count overstays who arrive by air or sea, but so far, the department doesn’t seem to have settled on an approach for people who enter at a land port of entry, such as the southern border. We reached out to a couple of agencies within the department, but did not get any information. Guesstimating the fliers If the 40 percent stat is defensible, the point that all those people arrive by air is much less so. In fact, the limited data we have suggests that whatever fraction flies into the country, it is less than 40 percent. When we asked Ramos for his source, he pointed us to a 2006 report by Pew. However, while that assessment provides the 40 percent figure, it gives no details on the fraction that arrived in an airplane. All of the experts we asked said they could only provide a gut assessment on this question. "I have no information" on the form of transportation used by overstayers at the time of their entry, Pew’s Passel said, "but I suspect that most of them do arrive by plane." But Rosenblum noted that overstays represent about 16 percent of unauthorized Mexican immigrants, about 27 percent of unauthorized Central Americans, and about 91 percent of all other unauthorized immigrants. Using his group’s estimates of the unauthorized population, that translates into about a third of all overstays coming from Mexico and Central America, and about two-thirds coming from the rest of the world. "Many, but not all, of the Mexican and Central American overstayers likely arrived legally by land," Rosenblum said. "Almost all of the other overstayers likely arrived by air." So let’s assume that none of the Mexican and Central American arrivals came by air, but all of the other arrivals did fly in. Since two-thirds of the overstays come from places other than Mexico and Central America, that would mean that two-thirds of the overstay population (the 40 percent figure) came by air, or about 27 percent. That’s not far from the result Warren got using a slightly different approach. He estimated that at least one-third of the undocumented population arrives by air. Ramos acknowledged the lack of hard data behind his statement. "The important fact is that around 40 percent came legally and then overstayed their visas," he said. "How they got here is another matter." A final note: The rationale for building a wall between the United States and Mexico is strongly linked to the idea that illegal immigration is fundamentally a problem of a porous southern border. Ramos, Rubio and Bush use the 40 percent figure to highlight that a large portion of the problem lies elsewhere. However, Rosenblum noted that does not make the two groups equivalent. "One difference between overstayers and those who enter unlawfully is that overstayers have been screened and found admissible at least once, while those who enter another way -- mostly by crossing the border, or passing illegally through a port of entry -- could include people who would be inadmissible, because they have committed serious crimes or are on a security watchlist," Rosenblum said. "This is a legitimate reason to be more focused on illegal entries than overstayers." Our ruling Ramos said that about 40 percent of undocumented immigrants fly into the country and overstay their visas. While there is some evidence that overstays represent about 40 percent of the unauthorized population, and perhaps more, the best estimates of those flying in -- which are admittedly a bit shaky -- could be as low as one-quarter or somewhat more than one-third. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. Editor's note: Shortly after we published this fact-check, we added the word "undocumented" in parenthesis to our ruling statement to clarify the context of Ramos' remarks, specifically that he was speaking of undocumented immigrants, not all immigrants. The rating remains the same. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jorge Ramos	None	None	None	2015-09-08T13:19:23	2015-09-02	['None']

pomt-04775	"In 2008, candidate Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/26/mitt-romney/romney-ad-says-obama-attacked-mccain-medicare-08/	As the presidential campaigns trade attacks about Medicare, a new TV ad from Mitt Romney accuses President Barack Obama of hypocrisy. The ad says that in 2008, Obama attacked his opponent, U.S. Sen. John McCain, for wanting to cut Medicare -- and then did so himself to to pay for Obamacare. The ad uses a clip of Obama speaking at a campaign rally in October 2008. "Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth," Obama says from a podium. The ad then says Obama "cut $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare" -- a claim PolitiFact previously rated Half True -- and concludes with another clip of Obama saying "it ain’t right." "No, Mr. President," the announcer says, "it ain't right." Here, we’ll rewind to 2008 to see how candidate Obama handled the delicate topic of Medicare. It turns out we fact-checked Obama's claim back then. Rallying voters in Virginia We went back to a transcript of the 2008 event to make sure Obama's comments were not taken out of context. Speaking before a crowd of more than 8,000 on Oct. 17, 2008, Obama unloaded on McCain’s Medicare proposal, according to a transcript of the event: "It turns out, Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth, $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care, to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall. "Now, this should come as no surprise. It's entirely consistent with Sen. McCain's record during his 26 years in Congress, where time and again he's opposed Medicare. In fact, Sen. McCain has voted against protecting Medicare 40 times -- 40 times, he's failed to stand up for Medicare. "So what would Sen. McCain's cuts mean for Medicare, at a time when more and more Americans are relying on it? It would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in Medicare benefits next year. "If you count on Medicare, it would mean fewer places to get care and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll pay more for your drugs. You'll receive fewer services. You'll get lower-quality care. "I don't think that's right. In fact, it ain't right. (Cheers.) When you've worked hard your whole life and pay into the system and done everything right, you shouldn't have the carpet pulled out from under you when you least expect it and can least afford it." An ad, and ensuing criticism Back in 2008, the Obama campaign released a television ad making the same basic claim. "How would your golden years turn out under John McCain?" the announcer said in the 2008 ad. "His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion. That means a 22 percent cut in benefits. Higher premiums and co-pays. More expensive prescription drugs. Nursing home care could suffer. ... After a lifetime of work, seniors' health care shouldn't be a gamble. John McCain's plan? It's not the change we need." PolitiFact examined the claim from Obama’s speech about McCain’s Medicare plan and rated it False. "McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps," we wrote. While not the same in every detail, McCain’s ideas for cost savings sound an awful lot like the ones Obama has pursued as president. The New York Times was similarly critical of the 2008 ad, saying it "does mischaracterize Mr. McCain's plan by stitching together vague language from a news report with back-of-the envelope calculations by a partisan policy group." Our ruling Romney’s new ad says "candidate Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare." That's an accurate description of what Obama said. We rate Romney's claim True.

pomt-12672	The proposed state budget contains "an additional tax cut for the middle class."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2017/mar/17/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-budget-does-not-include-new-tax-cuts/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says tax rates will drop for the middle class as long as they remain high for the rich. As state budget talks begin to heat up, that is his pitch for extending what’s called the millionaires’ tax - an 8.82 percent income tax on those earning more than $1 million annually. That rate will fall to 6.85 percent if the tax is not extended. The additional tax bracket was created under former Gov. David Paterson and then extended by Cuomo and the Legislature in 2013. It's due to sunset at the end of this year. But Cuomo wants to extend it for another three years. In return, he promises lower taxes for the middle class. "We want to start right out of the box by doing an additional tax cut for the middle class because the best thing we can say to our middle-class brothers and sisters is, 'You know what, government is going to take less of your paycheck every week.' " Critics say Cuomo is misleading the public. They say the tax cuts Cuomo is talking about were already passed in last year’s budget. Those rates are scheduled to be the lowest in 70 years when phased in. "Senate says drop the millionaires’ tax. Assembly says raise the millionaires’ tax. I say, continue it as is," Cuomo said. "I also propose in my budget a middle income tax cut. But if you allow the millionaires’ tax to expire, that $3.5 billion loss of revenue devastates the budget. And forget all the proposals." So, which is it? Are there new tax cuts in Cuomo’s budget, or were they already passed last year? A promise or threat? It is true that state tax rates for the middle class are slated to go down. Last year's budget included tax cuts for married filers making between $27,750 and $321,050, as well as for single filers making between $13,850 and $214,000. The cuts are scheduled to be phased in from 2018 through 2025. But Cuomo’s proposed budget legislation doesn't contain any additional cuts. It extends the millionaires' tax through 2020. A Cuomo administration spokesman says that still counts as a tax cut this year. Without an extension of the millionaires’ tax, last year's cuts could be amended or eliminated to balance the books, the spokesman said. "That’s not the governor fighting for a middle-class tax cut. That’s the governor threatening to take away a middle-class tax cut," said Ken Girardin of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a non-partisan, non-profit think tank based in Albany that calls for policy reforms based on free-market principles, personal responsibility and effective and accountable government. Cuomo’s budget proposal won’t change anything for the middle class compared to last year’s agreement, Girardin said. "The legislature could take a one-year hiatus to Saint Lucia and middle-class tax rates would still go down," Girardin said. Our ruling Cuomo said he’s proposing "an additional tax cut for the middle class" in this year’s budget. The tax rates in Cuomo’s proposed budget are not new. They were approved in last year’s budget but are not scheduled to begin until 2018. Middle-class tax rates will decline as scheduled if lawmakers leave them alone. Granted, everything is up for negotiation in a state budget, including tax rates. Legislative leaders could agree to change tax rates as part of this year’s spending plan. But Cuomo’s statement ignores facts and gives a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2017-03-17T18:10:38	2017-02-23	['None']
pomt-13055	Ed Gillespie "would not mention (Donald Trump’s) name unless he was condemning him."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/nov/21/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-stretches-ed-gillespies-statements/	Although Corey Stewart was ousted as Donald Trump’s campaign chairman in Virginia this fall, he’s still anchoring his gubernatorial campaign to the GOP president-elect. In the wake of Trump’s victory, the chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors took aim at Ed Gillespie who, like Stewart, is seeking the Republican nomination for governor. "Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid," Stewart said in a post-election interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "He would not appear with him on stage. He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him." The record on the first part of Stewart’s statement - that Gillespie would not appear with Trump - doesn’t lend itself to a fact-check because it requires us to get into Gillespie’s head. Gillespie never did appear on stage with Trump in Virginia, but there’s no evidence he refused to do so. Gillespie’s campaign says he was never invited by Trump’s camp and we’ve found no information to contradict that. So we’ll fact check the second part of Stewart’s statement - that Gillespie only mentioned Trump’s name when he was "condemning him." When we reached out to Stewart, he repeated that Gillespie kept Trump at an arm’s length and "never mentioned Trump" in a positive light. Stewart said that early in the campaign, Gillespie simply made a generic vow to support the GOP nominee. The only time Gillespie mentioned Trump by name, Stewart said, was to take the him to task following a release of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump made vulgar comments about groping women. Gillespie did criticize Trump for that, calling the candidate’s comments "incredibly offensive and demeaning." But contrary to Stewart’s statement, there were a few times when Gillespie did mention Trump’s name - tepidly - while voicing support for the GOP ticket. Matt Moran, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, pointed out those occasions. •A May 4 article in The Washington Post that noted Gillespie issued a one-sentence, prepared statement of support for Trump. The statement said, "Republican voters have nominated Donald Trump for president, and I will vote for him against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in an election that will not only affect control of the White House but the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation or more." •A May podcast interview with Bearing Drift, a conservative blog. Gillespie said, "It’s very important that we help Donald Trump carry the commonwealth against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because we play a critically important role in the Electoral College." •An Aug. 23 interview with the Loudoun Times that was recorded by Gillespie’s campaign. "I’m voting for Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton," Gillespie said. "That is our choice in this election. It’s not just about the control of the executive branch for the next four years, but control of the judiciary for the next 30 years." No doubt, Gillespie’s actions on Trump will be an issue in next year’s GOP primary for governor. Stewart isn’t the only Trump supporter accusing Gillespie of shunning the president-elect this fall. John Fredericks, who served as chairman of Trump’s campaign during the final month after Stewart was ousted, also said that Gillespie kept Trump at arm’s length. "This was a cold, calculating political decision that he made that he’ll have to live with now," John Fredericks said of Gillespie. Fredericks became chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign in October, after Stewart was fired for making unauthorized comments. But Fredericks also acknowledged that he never asked Gillespie to appear with Trump and, therefore, can’t say definitively if Gillespie "would not" do so. Fredericks told us that that Gillespie did attend two rallies held by Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. They were held in Harrisonburg on Oct. 5 and at George Mason University on Nov. 5. At the latter event, Fredericks said he introduced Gillespie, who never mentioned Trump in his speech. While Gillespie is taking hits from Republicans for distancing himself from Trump, the state Democratic Party is trying to tie him to the president-elect. The Democrats started a "Trump for Virginia governor" website that claims Gillespie, Stewart and other GOP gubernatorial candidates are "YUUGE Trump supporters." Finally, we should finally note that Stewart was fired as the Trump campaign’s Virginia chairman on Oct.10 after joining a rally in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington where he accused GOP "establishment pukes" of failing to sufficiently support Trump’s campaign. Our ruling Stewart said Gillespie "would not mention" Trump’s name "unless he was condemning him." Gillespie certainly did not praise Trump, and he did criticize the presidential nominee for making a vulgar statement about women. But there are several instances where Gillespie mentioned Trump while voicing support of the GOP ticket, saying it was important to keep conservative control of the U.S. Supreme Court. So we rate Stewart’s statement False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cf171a22-e911-49e7-868b-1a84bf9498e4	None	Corey Stewart	None	None	None	2016-11-21T02:00:00	2016-11-09	['Ed_Gillespie']

pomt-10260	McCain "said he was 'stumped' when asked whether contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/26/planned-parenthood/this-condom-speaks-the-truth/	With Sen. John McCain aggressively courting supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton, some of the most fervent of which are especially concerned with women's issues, the advocacy group Planned Parenthood has been spreading the word about why it believes women should oppose McCain. To that end, the group employed one of the more attention-getting novelty items of the campaign thus far on Aug. 25, 2008, handing out condoms at a party near the Democratic National Convention in Denver, each bright-pink package bearing the message "Protect Yourself from John McCain" and one of 10 reasons the group believes voters — especially women — shouldn't vote for him. The group said it plans to distribute 30,000 of the condoms at the convention. The 10 reasons were various claims about McCain's stances on women's issues, such as the well-known fact that he opposes Roe vs. Wade , and the opinion that he opposes certain "commonsense" funding for contraception and education. We decided to look at Reason 9: McCain "Said he was 'stumped' when asked whether contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV." The claim is rooted in a comment — arguably a gaffe — that came during one of the freewheeling conversations with reporters aboard the Straight Talk Express that McCain commonly held earlier in the campaign. Here's a transcript of part of the conversation, which took place in Iowa on March 16, 2007. And here's the crucial exchange: Planned Parenthood condoms carrying statement about candidate John McCain. Q: "What about grants for sex education in the United States? Should they include instructions about using contraceptives? Or should it be Bush's policy, which is just abstinence?" McCain: (Long pause) "Ahhh. I think I support the president's policy." Q: "So no contraception, no counseling on contraception. Just abstinence. Do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV?" McCain: (Long pause) "You've stumped me." Q: "I mean, I think you'd probably agree it probably does help stop it?" McCain: (Laughs) "Are we on the Straight Talk Express? I'm not informed enough on it. Let me find out. You know, I'm sure I've taken a position on it on the past. I have to find out what my position was. Brian, would you find out what my position is on contraception — I'm sure I'm opposed to government spending on it, I'm sure I support the president's policies on it." Q: "But you would agree that condoms do stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Would you say: 'No, we're not going to distribute them,' knowing that?" McCain: (Twelve-second pause) "Get me Coburn's thing, ask Weaver to get me Coburn's paper that he just gave me in the last couple of days. I've never gotten into these issues before." So yes, McCain said he was "stumped" when asked whether he thinks contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV. This is one truth-telling condom.

pomt-10100	"One percent of the American people make over 21 percent of all the income in America. That wasn’t the way before George Bush became president."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/27/joe-biden/the-rich-are-in-fact-getting-richer/	In an interview making the rounds on the Internet due to its, let’s say, aggressive tone of questioning, Barbara West of WFTV in Orlando grilled Sen. Joe Biden about Sen. Barack Obama’s tax plan and at one point cited Karl Marx to ask whether Obama’s plan to "spread the wealth around" amounted to Marxism. She also asked this doozy: "Sen. Obama now famously told Joe the Plumber he wanted to spread his wealth around. A Gallup poll showed 84 percent of Americans prefer government focus on improving economic conditions and creating more jobs in the U.S. as opposed to taking steps to distribute wealth. Isn’t Sen. Obama’s comment a potentially crushing political blunder?" "Absolutely not," Biden answered. "The only person who has spread the wealth around has been George Bush and John McCain’s tax policy. They have devastated the middle class. ... For the first time since the late 20s, 1 percent of the American people make over 21 percent of all the income in America. That wasn’t the way before George Bush became president." In highlighting the growing income disparity for the very wealthy, Biden is citing an analysis of U.S. tax returns published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2005. Updated versions of the report show that in 2006 (the most recently available year) the top 1 percent made 22.8 percent of all the income in the United States. And Biden is correct that it hasn’t been that high since 1928. End of story? Not quite. When Biden says "that wasn’t the way before George Bush became president," some context is in order. The increase became evident long before Bush took office. In 2000, the year Bush won election, the top 1 percent made about 21.5 percent of all the income in the United States. So, 21.5 in 2000 to 22.8 in 2006. An increase, but not huge. And the percentage of income captured by the top 1 percent has risen steadily since the 1970s (when it hovered around 9 percent) and through several presidencies. It began to soar in the 1980s, and reached new heights and grew more quickly during the 1990s administration of Bill Clinton, a Democrat. The number dropped in the early 2000s with the burst of the dot.com bubble, and then steadily increased until 2006. So while some of Bush’s policies have favored the rich, economists say it is not fair for Biden to lay the entire rising income gap at Bush’s feet. "The big picture is that we have seen dramatic increases (in the percentage of income for the top 1 percent) over the last couple decades," said Emmanuel Saez, professor of economics at University of California and a co-author of the study. Saez thinks more attention is being focused on the figures now because during the Clinton administration expansion, the bottom 99 percent captured more than half the growth. During the Bush expansion, real incomes for the bottom 99 percent remained fairly stagnant, while the top 1 percent captured 73 percent of the growth. Bottom line, says Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, the bottom 99 percent fared better under the Clinton administration than they did under Bush. Under Clinton, the very rich got richer, as they have under Bush. The difference is that under Clinton, the average salary for the bottom 99 percent increased from $35,500 to nearly $42,000; while under Bush the average salary for the bottom 99 percent has actually gone down $1,100. Economists point to several reasons for the growth in disparity between the very rich and everyone else, including the decline of labor unions, the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs to cheap labor overseas, rising executive pay, and the relative drop of the minimum wage from 1981 to 2007. While goods and services became more expensive, the minimum wage stayed the same. Bush has, however, exacerbated the after-tax income inequality with tax cuts that disproportionately help the rich, economists said. He also has resisted congressional attempts to cut costs for the working poor, such as by opposing an expansion of a popular children’s health insurance program that he says helps some who don’t need it. Biden cites the number accurately for the amount of income captured by the top 1 percent, and he’s technically right when he says "that wasn’t the way before George Bush became president." It went from 21.5 to 22.8. We allow that there is a more stark difference in how well the lower 99 percent fared, which backs up Biden's overall point about income disparity growing under Bush. It has, some. But the percent of income caputured by the top 1 percent has risen fairly steadily for decades, and we think it's misleading for Biden to suggest this disparity didn't exist before Bush. And so we only give him a Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-10-27T00:00:00	2008-10-23	['United_States', 'George_W._Bush']

"CNN to permanently close its doors as ratings plunge 30 percent," said a May 18 headline on Your News Wire. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. Your News Wire, a website that often posts misleading and fake news, repeated information from the conservative website Breitbart, which celebrated a recent drop in CNN’s ratings. Your News Wire used real data from Ad Week to show a 29 percent primetime rating drop during the second week of May compared to the same week last year. Then the story declared that as a result of the "nosedive" in ratings "the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end." The story included a photo of what appears to be a CNN studio going up in flames but had no evidence that the network has shut down or plans to do so. CNN spokespersons didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. While a ratings drop or spike by a network can be used by networks to boast about their position, ratings for a short period of time don’t reveal much about a network’s viability. Networks sell ads on longer-term data, so a drop in ratings over a couple of weeks may not mean much. Ratings also must be examined based on news events during the time period in question -- it's built into the business model that some news weeks are slower than others. For example, during the week of May 8-14, 2017, President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified to a Senate panel about Michael Flynn, a former Trump adviser, in the Russia saga. The idea that CNN would shut down is a bit of a fantasy for conservatives who share Trump’s allegation that the network is "fake news." While Trump uses the term "fake news" to describe news coverage that is unsympathetic to his administration and his performance, at PolitiFact we refer to fake news as fabricated content that intentionally masquerades as news coverage of actual events. Statements by Trump have been named PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year award twice. Your News Wire said in a headline "CNN to permanently close its doors as ratings plunge 30 percent." While the ratings drop during the second week of May compared to a year ago is real, the conclusion that CNN is going out of business is nonsense. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10039	"The Congressional Budget Office has found that (the stimulus) bill will lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product by 2019."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/23/mark-sanford/sanford-distorts-impact-stimulus-bill/	A week after the economic stimulus bill was signed into law, it continues to come under fire from Republicans who say it won't do enough to jump-start the economy. In an op-ed in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, Mark Sanford, the Republican governor of South Carolina, wrote that the bill would not only fail to boost the economy, but that it would actually make things worse. "Now that the so-called stimulus plan is law, we're left with one question: Will this package help us or hurt us? Unfortunately, I believe it is the latter, for a few reasons," wrote Sanford. "First, this package will ultimately mean less, not more, economic activity. The Congressional Budget Office has found that this bill will lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product by 2019. That translates into our economy losing tens of billions of dollars." When we asked Sanford's communications director to provide the source for his data, he pointed us to a Feb. 4 letter from CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf to senators and House members that projects the impact of the stimulus bill. We should note that the CBO is a nonpartisan agency that has the thankless task of projecting the cost and impact of bills being considered by Congress. CBO does not take a position on legislation and its estimates are widely quoted (and occasionally, misquoted) by both parties. The Feb. 4 letter that Sanford cites is about the Senate version of the stimulus bill. It gives an overview of CBO's estimates. (It's worth noting that there is a newer estimate written Feb. 11 that has slightly different numbers, but the patterns are the same. And CBO is likely to update that estimate in the near future.) The letter says, in the cautious language of government economists, that the stimulus bill would indeed stimulate the economy. It says that the Senate version of the bill would boost GDP — the key measurement of the economy's output — by 1.2 percent to 3.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010. The bill would add 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. And it would reduce the unemployment rate 0.7 percentage points to 2.1 percentage points below the baseline forecast of 8.7 percent. The letter says that the stimulus, intended as a short-term program to get the economy moving again, would have short-term effects. So if the letter shows the stimulus bill will boost the economy, how can Sanford claim there is a decline in 2019? He's quoting a single number out of context and distorting what it means. His office pointed us to a section of the letter that discusses the long-term impact. It says that by 2019 the Senate legislation "would reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent on net." That's not worded very clearly and it has led many people — including many conservative critics — to misunderstand what CBO meant. Bill Beach, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that was referring to the long-term impact of the debt from the stimulus bill on the economy. CBO estimates that all of the debt from the stimulus could have effect of "crowding out" private investment, meaning that investors wouldn't put as much of their money into private capital, which has an negative impact on the economy. But the effect is relatively small. It would lower the GDP from its "baseline" level by only 0.1 to 0.3 percent. And contrary to the way Sanford said it, the economy is still growing by 2.5 percent annually at that point, according to CBO. It's just wouldn't grow as fast because of the big debt. Sanford is quoting the number out of context and neglecting to point out that it is a reduction from the baseline, which itself was going up. So he gives the impression it is a decline in the real GDP, when it's really a decline in GDP growth. Big difference. To say Sanford is cherry-picking the letter would be too generous. He has taken one number from a letter that seems to support his thesis and distorted it. And he's ignored several more prominent measurements that show the stimulus bill would help the economy. So we find his claim to be False.	None	Mark Sanford	None	None	None	2009-02-23T16:36:59	2009-02-23	['None']

pomt-05892	"No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008, especially in the general.’’	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-no-candidate-has-run-more-negative-ads/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spoke to CNN on the state's primary day and predicted that the winner of Florida -- which turned out to be Mitt Romney -- would likely be the nominee of the Republican Party. On CNN, Rubio was asked about the many negative ads that ran during the campaign and if it was a preview of what was to come in the general election. "I think that's been a part of every campaign," Rubio said. "Unfortunately, it's only gotten worse. No candidate in American history has ever run more negative ads than Barack Obama. I don't think that will change in 2012. Unfortunately people have to get used to it. I think voters see through that." Did Obama earn the mantle of running the most negative ads in American history? Detailed data on campaign advertising has been kept since the 1996 founding of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which is part of Kantar Media, said Erika Franklin Fowler, assistant professor of government at Wesleyan University and co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. The predecessor to the Wesleyan Media Project, the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, did an analysis of that data for the 2008 campaign. The 2008 presidential campaign set a record for political ads; television ads totaled nearly $600 million. Combined, the candidates aired more than 1.1 million campaign ads. Obama aired 141,541 spots and spent more than $74 million on television ads during the Democratic primary. During the Republican primary, McCain aired 19,581 ads at the cost of approximately $12 million. These are figures for candidates’ spending -- not that of other groups. Between June and election day, Obama far outspent McCain: Obama spent more than $226 million to McCain’s expenditure of over $162 million. Obama aired more than 436,000 ads, while McCain aired 337,000 ads. The report concluded that Obama bought significantly more ads, but that more of McCain's ads were negative. "During the final presidential debate Sen. John McCain argued that Obama had ‘spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history,’ while Barack Obama accused Sen. McCain of running an entirely negative campaign," the report said. "In a way, both candidates were correct. .... At certain points in the campaign Barack Obama aired nearly as many negative or contrast ads as John McCain aired altogether. As a proportion, however, it is clear that most of McCain’s ads were negative in tone." The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker examined the same claim and cited a study by University of Missouri professor William Benoit who is now a professor at Ohio University. We also spoke to Benoit. "It is true (Obama) ran more negative ads or ran them more often than McCain, but if you look at the content of the ads to see what they were saying, it was really about the same,’’ in terms of what percentage were negative, Benoit said. Benoit said he examined specific negative and positive statements in TV ads by the campaigns. One ad could have both negative and positive statements. During the primary election, 19 percent of the statements he examined in McCain ads were negative, while for Obama 20 percent of statements were negative. During the general election, Benoit found that 68 percent of the statements in Obama’s ads were attacks while McCain’s were 62 percent attacks. (Benoit did a separate analysis of Obama’s 30-minute ad near the end of the campaign and found that only 18 percent of the statements were attacks as Obama tried to end on a mostly positive note.) Benoit said that the difference in the general election in terms of percentages wasn’t significant, concluding that about two-thirds of both campaigns' statements in the general election were attacks. Benoit said he has analyzed TV ads back to 1952, and the only campaign that came close to that was Dwight Eisenhower’s 1952 campaign -- 69 percent of his statements were negative. "Obama and a Republican -- Eisenhower -- are about virtually tied," Benoit said. "Eisenhower had one percentage point more." Benoit told us that Obama ran more negative ads because he ran many more ads overall, both positive and negative. "He ran more simply because he had more money not because of the tone of the ads he had were more negative. There was no significant difference in the tone of ads both campaigns created," he said. Rubio responds Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told us in an e-mail: "(Obama) spent way more on TV ads than any other campaign in history, and they were predominately negative." Conant also sent a few articles that appeared during the campaign about Obama’s rampant spending including Washington Post article that stated that Obama and Democratic Party committees spent nearly $105 million the first two weeks of October compared to just over $25 million by McCain and Republican entities. Our Ruling Rubio said. "No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008, especially in the general.’’ In sheer numbers, that statement is correct: Obama bought many more ads than McCain did, both positive and negative. Nevertheless, two studies suggest that, overall, Obama's ads were not significantly more negative than his rival. He ran the most negative ads because he ran the most ads. We rate Rubio's statement Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2012-02-06T16:44:12	2012-01-31	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-09521	Says the Texas Education Agency follows up to make sure undocumented immigrants paying in-state tuition at Texas colleges are applying for permanent residency.	false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/14/rick-perry/perry-says-tea-checks-whether-undocumented-student/	In 2001, Gov. Rick Perry proudly signed legislation into law allowing illegal immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates. The law lets undocumented students who have graduated from a Texas high school and lived in Texas for at least three years qualify — if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so. As of 2008, 22,697 non-U.S. citizens and permanent residents had attended Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates. More than 10,000 were enrolled in fall 2008 — the latest count available. Tuition varies among Texas public colleges and universities, which make their own tuition policies and set their own rates on top of the base tuition set by statute: $50 per semester credit hour at four-year universities for Texas residents and $327 for non-residents. Perry, responding to a reporter's question, recently said that the Texas Education Agency verifies that undocumented students are making good on their sworn promise to apply for permanent residency. We wondered if that was so. During the second GOP gubernatorial debate Jan. 29, Len Cannon, KHOU-TV Houston news anchor, asked Perry: "You pointed out that for illegal immigrants to get the in-state tuition they have to apply for legal residency, correct?" Perry: "Yes, sir." Cannon: "According to the bill it says you have to promise to apply. Does the state then follow up to verify that the application has been made for residency?" Perry: "It is my understanding, yes, sir, absolutely." Cannon: "And what agency?" Perry: "TEA." Twice, Cannon repeated the question, with the same result. He tried again one more time. Cannon: "TEA does that?" Perry: "Yes, sir. Texas Education Agency." Clearly, Perry believes the TEA follows up on public college students who enroll as illegal immigrants. But is it true? Not according to Suzanne Marchman, TEA spokeswoman, who said the agency oversees primary and secondary public education. "The law (at issue) applies to colleges and universities," she said of House Bill 1403, the measure Perry signed in June 2001 permitting undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at higher education institutions. "Our agency doesn't oversee any of that." Catherine Frazier, deputy press secretary at the Perry campaign, immediately conceded the governor's misstatement. Frazier said: "Each university is supposed to follow up on whether undocumented immigrants are pursuing citizenship and report to the (Texas) Higher Education Coordinating Board." That so? Not exactly, at least not at the University of Texas at Austin: "There's no requirement in the law that we follow up on that," said Deana Williams, UT's assistant director of admissions. Williams, a UT admissions official since before the 2001 law took effect, said the coordinating board, which oversees colleges and universities statewide, has told the schools to collect undocumented students' affidavits and check their transcripts to confirm that they've lived in Texas for at least the three years required to be eligible for in-state tuition. Williams said UT keeps the affidavits on record indefinitely but it's "never required to report or check" whether those students are actively pursuing permanent residency . Andy Kesling, the coordinating board's director of communications, said the board doesn't follow up with benefiting students at all. Indeed, there's nothing in the statute requiring it to. Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, carried the legislation in the Senate that had been authored in the House by then-Rep. Rick Noriega. Van de Putte told us: "There's nobody checking, but they technically could — there's nothing prohibiting them from checking and there's nothing that mandates them to check." And while undocumented students can apply for permanent residency, current immigration laws generally preclude them from obtaining a green card without an employer's sponsorship. The DREAM Act, proposed federal legislation that has several times failed to pass Congress, would allow undocumented students to obtain permanent residency after two years of college or military service.

pomt-11954	"White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/06/newsweek/are-white-males-responsible-more-mass-shootings-an/	As details about the Las Vegas shooter’s identity emerged, media outlets noted some of the characteristics fit neatly within a familiar profile of prior mass shooting perpetrators. Newsweek, for instance, ran a story with the headline, "White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group." The article builds on this claim, stating that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white males. We’ve covered the demographics of mass shootings before but had not heard this specific claim. So we decided to take a closer look at who’s behind mass shootings. Tracking mass shootings No U.S. government entity specifically tracks mass shootings — much less, the shooters’ race and ethnicity, experts told us. But some media organizations and nongovernmental groups have taken up the task in various forms. Some of the differences in the datasets are the result of having no universally accepted definition of mass shooting. The number of mass shootings a group tallies can vary dramatically based on how the term is defined. For example, the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks gun-related injuries and deaths, defines a mass shooting as "four or more shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter." According to that group, there have been 274 mass shootings so far this year, or nearly one per day. Another widely cited source comes from the progressive media outlet Mother Jones, which created a database in 2012 after the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater. Mother Jones defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. This language is similar to a 2013 statute that defines "mass killings" as three or more killed in a single incident, though that applies to any weapon. The Mother Jones database, which dates back to Aug. 20, 1982, counts 91 mass shootings. Of these, 50 were carried out by white men — hence, where Newsweek and other outlets got the statistic that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white men. For comparison’s sake, Mother Jones' data show African-Americans accounted for 15 mass shootings, while Latinos and Asians were responsible for seven each. Three attacks were carried out by women, including one of the two perpetrators behind the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. We should note that some experts expressed concern that if the public debate around gun violence focuses too much on mass shootings, there’s a risk of overlooking the fact that gun murders disproportionately affect minorities, especially African-Americans. Assessing the data Because Newsweek’s claim derives from Mother Jones’ data, we asked experts about the reliability of this count. Grant Duwe, author of Mass Murder in the United States: A History, considered a leading scholarly book on the subject, has long criticized Mother Jones’ accounting. Duwe pointed us to an essay he penned for Reason magazine in 2014, in which he argued Mother Jones has low-balled its tally of mass shootings as a result of relying solely on news coverage as its source of data. Duwe believes this creates a false impression that mass shootings have been on the rise (a claim that’s beyond the scope of this fact-check). "The main concern is an underreporting problem that gets worse the farther back in time we go," Duwe told PolitiFact. "This creates problems when it comes to drawing conclusions about trends in the prevalence of mass public shootings." Nevertheless, Duwe said his own research dating back to 1900 corroborates that white men have committed more mass shootings than any other group, though he believes white men make up an even larger share than the Mother Jones data show. "There have been at least 184 mass public shootings in the U.S. since 1900, including the Las Vegas attack," Duwe said. "Among these mass public shooters, non-Hispanic whites make up 63 percent, which is close to what we see for the U.S. population in general. So, the Mother Jones data actually underreport the extent to which whites are involved as mass public shooters." The vast majority of mass shootings is committed by men. Looking only at the male population, some have argued that statistical claims based on Mother Jones data on the racial makeup of mass shooters leaves out important context. Critics argue that when you consider that non-Hispanic white men make up about 63 percent of the male population, white men appear proportionally less likely to commit a mass shooting, according to the Mother Jones statistics showing white men account for 54 percent of mass shootings. (Duwe’s finding that non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of mass shooters is roughly in line with the white portion of the male population. White men make up roughly 31 percent of the overall U.S. population.) Duwe defines "mass public shooting" as an incident that occurs in the absence of other criminal activity, in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period. Mother Jones national affairs editor Mark Follman praised Duwe’s dataset as valuable, but he pushed back on the notion that they’d underreported attacks, saying that to the best of his recollection some of the shootings Duwe flagged as deserving to be included in Mother Jones' database did not fit their criteria. He also said that while most of Mother Jones’ data is initially culled from media reports, they have also relied on primary source documents, interviews with law enforcement and tips from the public about more obscure cases going back further in time. For more on how the group calculated the frequency of mass shootings, he pointed us to a 2014 Mother Jones article claiming the rate of mass shootings tripled since 2011. Our ruling Newsweek said, "White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group." Newsweek based its claim on data from Mother Jones, which defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. Under this definition, Mother Jones found that non-Hispanic white men have been responsible for 54 percent of mass shootings since August 1982. Another tally, with a longer timeline and a different definition of mass shooting, found non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of these attacks. Under both definitions and datasets, white men have committed more mass shootings than any other ethnicity group. Newsweek's claim is literally accurate. But it's worth noting the imprecision of this data, and the percentage of mass shootings by white men is lower than their share of the male population, according to Mother Jones.

pomt-09449	"Florida's new fingerprint identification system is improving our rate of solving cold cases by 300 percent."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/08/charlie-crist/new-fingerprint-technology-results-solve-rate-300-/	In the crime portion of his final State of the State speech, Gov. Charlie Crist touted the success of a new technology that he says is helping police close unsolved cases. The technology -- an advanced fingerprint and palm print identification system -- has increased solve rates on cold cases three-fold, Crist said in his 43-minute address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 2, 2010. "Florida's new fingerprint identification system is improving our rate of solving cold cases by 300 percent, benefiting victims hurt by previously unsolved crimes," Crist said. Is this new technology putting that many more bad guys behind bars? The new system Crist is talking about is called the Biometric Identification System, or BIS for short. According to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which manages the new system, BIS is more precise and has more capacity than previous systems. Here's how it works: Law enforcement officials from across the state upload fingerprint and palm print information from crime scenes and from people they arrest. The computer then tries to match the two, looking for people in the system who may have committed unsolved crimes. The concept isn't new -- FDLE has been matching fingerprints electronically for years -- but the state is now able to match palm prints for the first time. The new system also improves accuracy in fingerprint searches, said FDLE spokeswoman Kristen Chernosky. The new statewide BIS system has been up and running since May 2009 and has paid great dividends, Chernosky said. In fact, the FDLE spokeswoman said it was the state law enforcement agency that provided Crist's office the 300 percent figure he cited in his speech. But the number isn't calculating what Crist said it was. "There has been an approximately 300 percent increase in the number of fingerprint hits that have been provided to our local law enforcement agencies," Chernosky said. "That means there was some kind of match, but not necessarily the number of cases solved." Put another way, the new system is increasing the number of fingerprint and palm print matches to aid local law enforcement, but it's yet unclear if those matches are leading to a similar increase in arrests. The FDLE hasn't tracked that number, Chernosky said. Bill Schade, who manages Pinellas County's fingerprint records department, sings the praises of the new system. He said it produced 20 fingerprint hits on cold cases in February 2010, and already has produced a handful of matches in the first week of March. Some hits lead to arrests -- he pointed to one case in Clearwater where a fingerprint match tied a suspect to a string of local burglaries. But many do not, Schade says. A recent example involved a stolen washer and dryer. Forensics investigators were able to get prints at the home where the crime occurred, and eventually, law enforcement officials got a match. But in between the crime and finding a fingerprint match, the washer and dryer were returned to the home. In that case, no one wanted to press charges and the investigation stalled. That's an important distinction in assessing Crist's claim. He said the new technology is "improving our rate of solving cold cases by 300 percent, benefiting victims hurt by previously unsolved crimes." Crist is right that the new BIS system is helping police and sheriff's deputies. But he's making it sound like the new technology is having a dramatic impact on the number of cases solved. In fact, fingerprint matches are up 300 percent, but that doesn't correspond to a similar percentage of additional cases being solved. That data doesn't exist, and system users acknowledge that fingerprint matches don't always lead to arrests. As a result, we rate Crist's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11767	Says the tax bill "is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/30/donald-trump/will-gop-tax-bill-cost-donald-trump-fortune-no/	President Donald Trump said he wouldn’t benefit financially from the Republican tax legislation on Capitol Hill. In fact, he said he would get socked by it. "So right now, America's tax code is a total dysfunctional mess," Trump said in a speech in St. Charles, Mo., on Nov. 29, 2017. "The current system has cost our nation millions of American jobs, trillions and trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance. It is riddled with loopholes that let some special interests -- including myself, in all fairness. This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me." Trump’s claim sounded dubious. The analyses of the bills we have seen show advantages, not disadvantages, for the wealthy as well as corporations. When we asked the White House for additional details about how the law would hurt Trump, they cited the repeal of the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct all or some of their state and local tax burden from their federal taxable income. As a wealthy resident of New York City, Trump would likely face high tax state and local rates. (At the Nov. 30 press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited the elimination of deductions as one possible source of a tax increase for the president.) The White House also cited "anti-abuse" provisions within the changes being made to the "pass-through" tax rates for business income that is taxed within individual tax filings. Trump may indeed get hit by some of the tax bill’s specific provisions. But independent analyses of the bill’s potential impact on his own tax situation agree that, after all is said and done, he should come out far ahead compared to the status quo. It is impossible to pin down the benefits that would flow to Trump's tax situation due to his own refusal to follow the decades-old presidential precedent of releasing his tax returns. (He broke his promise to release them). Any projections depend on a leaked, partial tax return from 12 years ago, and a lot may have changed since then. For instance, there's no way of knowing whether 2005 was an unusual year for Trump’s finances. Analyses by the New York Times and NBC attempted to understand how Trump's finances would be impacted by the House bill rely on the partial 2005 return. The Times based its calculations on a framework that preceded the official release of both chambers’ bills. The NBC analysis was based on the House version of the bill. (The framework is different than the House bill in its details, but they share many common elements.) The elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the lowering of the pass-through tax rate for certain types of business income -- minus tax increases from eliminating many existing deductions -- would leave Trump $42 million better off, according to the New York Times analysis. (The alternative minimum tax requires that taxpayers with many deductions pay at least a minimum amount of taxes.) The NBC analysis — undertaken by Maury Cartine, the partner in charge of tax and business services in the New York City office of the Marcum Group — found net savings of $22.5 million for Trump, primarily from eliminating the alternative minimum tax. Trump’s myriad ventures could enable him to benefit from several changes. The House version would allow "pass-through" business income to be taxed at 25 percent, rather than the current maximum of 39.6 percent. The Senate bill would use a different mechanism for such income that is less advantageous. Trump’s 2005 return showed more than $109 million in income from businesses that would potentially benefit from a tax break on pass-through income. So, at the very least, two independent estimates came up with immediate savings in the low tens of millions of dollars. Even if the actual savings for Trump end up being a small fraction of that amount, that would be more money than most Americans make in a year, and more than some make in a lifetime. Meanwhile, this doesn’t include the potentially massive benefits Trump could see from changes to the estate tax -- albeit savings that would take longer to materialize. The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. Due to generous exemptions, the tax generally hits wealthy taxpayers. The House bill would end the estate tax after 2024. The Senate bill would keep it, instead doubling the current exemption for individuals to $11 million. The approach that prevails in the final version of the bill is unknown for now. Both the Times and NBC estimated that the House version of the estate tax could save Trump more than $1.1 billion. Neither analysis looked specifically at the Senate’s version; that approach would likely provide Trump with some savings, but on a much smaller scale. (It’s worth noting that any potential savings from the estate tax would come only after the death of Trump or his wife Melania, presumably years down the road.) Trump’s possible gains from the bill are hardly unique for the wealthiest Americans. According to analysis of the Senate bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, American households with incomes in excess of $1 million -- a threshold Trump is almost certainly far above -- would see a tax savings of $41,819 in 2019 and $36,259 in 2017. And an analysis by an independent group, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, estimated that for the top one-tenth of 1 percent of earners -- those with incomes of at least $3,439,900 -- 72 percent would see tax cuts and 28 would see a tax increase in 2018. The average tax cut for this group would be $174,620 in 2018. Our ruling Trump said, "This (tax bill) is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me." While there is uncertainty about the exact scale of Trump’s potential gains -- both because of the lack of a final version of the bill and because of big gaps in the public knowledge about his personal finances -- either of the GOP bills would almost certainly give Trump a big windfall. Two independent analyses suggest that it could be in the low tens of millions of dollars immediately. His family also could get as much as $1.1 billion over the longer term if the estate tax is fully repealed, as the House bill would do. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07267	The Paul Ryan budget proposal would "privatize Medicare."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/25/agenda-project/throw-granny-cliff-ad-says-paul-ryan-plan-would-pr/	Amid discussion of the Medicare overhaul proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., an ad created by the Agenda Project, a liberal group, cut through the clutter quite dramatically -- though with critics saying it was literally over the top. The ad, set to "America the Beautiful," shows a man pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair toward a scenic overlook. At first, the woman is happy, enjoying the sights. But then the man picks up the pace, veers past warning signs and rushes toward a cliff. When he reaches the edge, he tips over the wheelchair, and the woman falls dramatically over the ledge. The man walks calmly away. The ad contains no dialogue, so its point is made through a series of superimposed statements. "In 1965, Americans made Medicare into Law. Today, Medicare provides the health insurance for 46 million Americans. More than half of Americans on Medicare live on less than $28,000 a year. Now, Republicans want to privatize Medicare. Is America beautiful without Medicare?" We decided to check two claims in this ad. One, which we’ll look at in a different item, is whether the Ryan plan would leave the country "without Medicare." The second, which we’ll investigate here, is whether the Ryan budget proposal would "privatize Medicare." First, we’ll provide a summary of the Ryan plan, which was passed by the House in a near-party-line vote and which has more recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters will not be comfortable with its approach. Ryan’s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline. One of its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, although they would receive "premium support" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people the same age. The plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provides smaller premium support to high earners. In analyzing the claim that Ryan's plan privatizes Medicare, we see at least three questions to consider, based on our discussions with a range of policy experts: How do you define "privatization"? When we contacted Erica Payne, the founder and president of the Agenda Project, she defended the use of "privatization" by arguing that under the current system, the purchaser is the government and the vendor is the health provider, while under the Ryan plan, the purchaser would be the patient and the vendor would be the insurance company. "Because the choice of vendor is now in the hands of an individual who will in essence ‘shop’ for an insurance plan provided by a private company, this change will have the effect of transforming Medicare into a private insurance system," Payne said. "As such, we conclude that this plan seeks to ‘privatize’ Medicare. Supplanting a government system that pays directly for benefits with a plan that inserts private companies into the exchange of goods and services seems like a fairly standard interpretation of the privatization concept." Is she right? There are actually a number of definitions of privatization, but Steven Berry, a Yale University economist, said that at least one common definition does seem to fit what he calls "Ryancare." In what Berry says is an oft-cited 1988 law journal article, Paul Starr, a liberal professor of sociology and public policy, wrote that one acceptable definition of "privatization" is, "Instead of directly producing some service, the government may finance private services, for example, through contracting-out or vouchers." While the Congressional Budget Office has followed Ryan’s lead in calling the subsidies "premium supports" rather than "vouchers," Berry said the definition still applies. "The Ryan plan takes some functions the government currently provides and transfers these to private sector insurance companies, providing a government subsidy to pay for the private sector services," he said. "Ryan is clear about this -- he thinks the private sector will do a better job in these activities as opposed to the ‘monopoly’ government agency. This is a traditional argument in favor of this kind of privatization." Is Medicare fully public now? In many important ways, Medicare is a public program today. Payments to doctors are made with government money, collected through mandatory tax assessments. There’s a large bureaucracy called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that sets standards for the program and carries out enforcement. But Robert Moffitt, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, points out that Medicare -- despite its reputation as an exemplar of single-payer health care -- has some noteworthy aspects that are more accurately considered private. "The entire Medicare delivery system -- doctors, hospitals, home health care agencies, nursing homes, hospice care facilities -- are almost all private agents or institutions," Moffitt said. "Exceptions would include county or public hospitals that are reimbursed for treating Medicare patients." In addition, most Medicare enrollees have supplemental insurance to cover costs the program doesn't, and most of this supplemental coverage is either bought on the private market or secured through employers. The Medicare Advantage program, which accounts for roughly a quarter of Medicare enrollees, is run by private insurers using Medicare funds. About 60 percent of seniors are enrolled in private drug plans in the Medicare Part D Program. Finally, the federal government already administers Medicare through private contractors, usually large private insurance carriers that process Medicare claims. So while the Ryan plan would shift the needle further toward the private sector than it is today, it’s important to remember that Medicare today is not simply a government program without a private-sector role. How much of a government role would remain under the Ryan plan? Ryan’s spokesman, Conor Sweeney, emphasizes that under the proposal, Medicare will retain significant government aspects. "The government continues to collect payroll taxes to fund Medicare for future seniors," Sweeney said. "It provides financial support to guarantee that future seniors are covered. And it tightly regulates the plans among which future seniors get to choose, so that they are protected from discriminatory pricing. Under our plan, Medicare remains a government program dedicated to help fulfill the health security for America’s seniors. The real question on Medicare is not whether government should be involved, it is how much power should the government have over individual health care decisions?" Several economists with experience in privatization issues told us there’s enough evidence to call the Ryan proposal a privatization plan. "I would have to say that (privatization) is a correct characterization of the plan's operation," said Ellen Dannin, a Penn State law professor. "It isn't private in the sense that a mom-and-pop store is private but, rather, it would operate more or less as a regulated and heavily subsidized private industry. Because someone reaching the age for enrollment in Medicare after the bill's threshhold date would have no ability to enroll in Medicare (as currently structured), their best and only option seems likely to be taking the plan's payment and enrolling in a private plan provided by an insurance company." Roger Noll, a Stanford University economist, said that the Ryan plan would clearly shift the duties for paying expenses from a federal agency to a private insurance company. The act of the government providing regulatory oversight, he said, isn’t the same as the government providing a service. Noll added that confusion on this issue may stem from an imprecise understanding of how Medicare actually works. "Health care and insurance are separate services," he said. "Medicare always has relied on privatized health care. What's being privatized in the Ryan plan is health insurance services." So where does this leave us? It’s true that under the Ryan proposal, the government will retain important duties in running Medicare. But "privatization" does not have to mean that the government has nothing further to do with the enterprise. Under longstanding definitions, privatization could take place without the government giving up its right to regulate a privately provided service, such as an electric utility. That said, we think it’s fair to note that Medicare already provides some types of coverage through private insurance now, so the shift toward the private sector prompted by the Ryan plan would be more a question of degree than kind. On balance, we conclude that the idea that the Paul Ryan budget proposal would "privatize Medicare" is Mostly True.

pomt-09108	"We have a director of homeland security who cannot use and will not use the term 'terrorist attack' but instead substitutes 'man-made disaster.' "	false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/21/jerry-patterson/patterson-says-napolitano-wont-say-terrorist-attac/	Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson fired up the crowd during a speech at the state GOP convention June 11 by declaring that “we’re besieged today by political correctness.” To illustrate his point, he singled out Janet Napolitano, the former Arizona governor who joined President Barack Obama’s Cabinet. “We have a director of homeland security who cannot use and will not use the term ‘terrorist attack’ but instead substitutes ‘man-made disaster,’ ” Patterson said. Has the leader of an agency charged with keeping the United States safe indeed scrubbed “terrorist attack” from her vocabulary? When we contacted Patterson, he pointed us to congressional testimony that Napolitano gave in early 2009 and media accounts of the criticism that followed. On Feb. 25, 2009, Napolitano made her debut appearance before the House Homeland Security Committee. Before delivering her prepared statement, the committee’s ranking Republican, Peter King, R-N.Y., noted correctly that the word “terrorism” did not appear in the text of her remarks. King said that he was “not trying to get into semantics on this” but that “it’s important for us in positions of leadership to constantly remind people how real that (terrorism) threat is … and if we don’t do it, it’s going to be hard for us to get legislative support for the measures that we think have to be taken.” In an aside to King as she addressed the committee, Napolitano then invoked the “T” word to describe the agency’s mission: “to confront and prepare for threats that face this nation, be they man-caused -- and terrorism, Rep. King, I believe falls into that category and is central to that category -- or be they caused by nature.” The phrase “man-caused” deviated from Napolitano’s prepared text, which used “man-made” instead. The first instance we found of Napolitano pairing the man-made concept with “disaster” occurred a month earlier, in remarks prepared for her Senate confirmation hearing. Republicans, conservative commentators and other critics pointed to Napolitano’s word choice as evidence that the Obama administration was tip-toeing around the threat of terrorism. Patterson told us that he sees it as “some kind of reluctance to use words that others may take offense at even if those terms are accurate and truthful.” Napolitano was asked about her terminology in March 2009 by a German news magazine, Der Spiegel. Using the term “man-caused disasters,” she replied, “demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur." In April 2009 remarks to an Anti-Defamation League conference, Napolitano offered further explanation for her use of “man-caused disaster.” She said that “so often we think of terrorism and the mindset is just al Qaeda … But it is not the only such group, and so to use a different phrase is an effort to cause people to think more broadly about what we are dealing with, and that is those who seek to commit violence to impact broader societies through their economies, through the exercise of their freedoms, and the like.” In early 2010, a writer for The New York Times cast the dust-up over Napolitano’s language as an example of how the Obama administration has rejected some of the Bush administration’s terrorism-related rhetoric (such as Bush references to “evildoers” and “Islamo-fascist”). So Napolitano says she’s trying to expand the public’s thinking about the kinds of threats the U.S. faces. Does that mean she cannot and will not say “terrorist attack,” as Patterson claims? It doesn’t look that way. During her January 2009 confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Napolitano spoke the word “terrorism” five times and “terrorist” once; we counted. In March 2009, at a conference in Kansas City, Mo., she employed “terrorist attack” in response to a question about the role of the private sector in so-called “fusion centers” enabling law enforcement agencies to analyze and share intelligence information. And in a July 2009 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, Napolitano used “terrorist attack” twice and “terror attack” once. An example: “Make no mistake, Americans continue to be targeted in terror attacks,” Napolitano said. “Just two weeks ago, American hotels were the target of bombings in Jakarta that killed eight people and injured six Americans.” More recently, Napolitano told CNN on May 2, 2010 – the day after a sport-utility vehicle holding a bomb was found in New York’s Times Square – that the incident was being treated “as if it could be a potential terrorist attack.” And on Friday, Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said: “The secretary speaks publicly about terrorism often, including in a speech less than 90 minutes ago to the American Constitution Society.” Patterson said Friday that Napolitano’s continued use of “man-made disaster” proves his point. We disagree. The essence of his charge at the convention was that the secretary can’t and won’t say “terrorist attack.” News accounts, congressional testimony and speeches prove otherwise. We rate Patterson’s statement as False.	None	Jerry Patterson	None	None	None	2010-06-21T06:00:00	2010-06-11	['None']

pomt-03527	A bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline "is an earmark" under House rules.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/31/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-bill-clearing-way-keystone-xl-pi/	Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., recently took an unusual approach to opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,700-mile project to bring heavy crude from Canada’s oil-rich tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico. He says it’s an earmark, and earmarks aren’t in line with current House rules. "The Keystone XL Pipeline deal is an earmark to a foreign corporation, plain and simple," Grayson said in a news release. "House Republicans claim to have been incredibly keen on ridding our legislative system of congressional earmarks — yet here they are — hypocritically sneaking one in for a foreign corporation. They seem to believe that the ‘no earmarks’ rule does not apply to them. That’s just unacceptable." For years, environmentalists have battled pipeline supporters over the construction of the new pipeline. This year, supporters turned to the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives to essentially waive a variety of regulatory hurdles that have so far delayed the project’s groundbreaking. A bill, H.R. 3, would effectively sidestep the key governmental reviews delaying the project, which is to be built by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P., a Canadian company. H.R. 3 declares that a presidential permit is not required to advance the project. It also clears the project under the the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, among other laws; and prevents the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator from blocking the project. On May 21, 2013, as H.R. 3 was moving toward a vote in the House, Grayson wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in which he argued that the bill was an earmark. We were intrigued by Grayson’s argument and wanted to look in detail at whether the Keystone project fit the definition of an earmark. What is an earmark? Generally speaking, an earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics say earmarks serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group rather than the national good. That's why congressional Republicans -- and President Barack Obama -- have promised to curb their use, with some degree of success. To make his case that H.R. 3 was an earmark, Grayson pointed to the section of the House’s rules that define what constitutes an earmark. House rules are written by the chamber’s majority party every two years and approved, typically on a party-line vote, when a new Congress is sworn in. House rules do not have the force of law, but they are binding for the procedures used in the chamber. The current version of the House rules says earmarks are a specific authorization of spending, targeted to a specific purpose or place, and made without a competitive award process. Here’s the exact definition: "For the purpose of this clause, the term ‘congressional earmark’ means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process." To sharpen his case to Boehner, Grayson streamlined this language by removing some of the extra words. Grayson’s shortened earmark definition was: "a provision … included primarily at the request of a Member ... providing (or) authorizing … a .. grant ... to an entity … other than through a statutory or administrative … or competitive award process." H.R. 3, Grayson wrote, provides a special benefit, "outside of established statutory, administrative or competitive award processes, and it does so to only one entity -- explicitly named in this bill, ‘TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P.’" Grayson went on to argue that the "requirement that this provision be included ‘primarily at the request of a Member’ is surely satisfied by the act of a Member drafting and offering this bill. It was the conscious choice of a Member from the state of Nebraska to offer this legislation, as well as explicitly mention Nebraska or Nebraskans six separate times, while no other state receives a single mention." We checked with several experts on House procedure to see what they thought of Grayson’s argument. They were not convinced. They said their concerns go beyond H.R. 3’s superficial differences with classic earmarks, though it has some of those, too. Typically, earmarks are narrow provisions of larger bills inserted and supported by a small number of lawmakers and advancing a highly localized purpose, such as a local road or construction project. By contrast, H.R. 3 is a stand-alone bill, it has been co-sponsored by 134 House members and it would clear the way for a project that runs from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico. But the more important problem, the experts said, is that the bill does not affect federal spending -- something the House rule explicitly requires. Grayson, they said, got around this by dropping most of the following clause from his streamlined definition: "providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority." Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, cited the Congressional Budget Office in arguing that H.R. 3 "comes nowhere near being an earmark as defined by House rules, period." When CBO -- Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal-analysis arm -- weighed the bill’s fiscal impact, it found that "implementing H.R. 3 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates that the proposed changes to administrative procedures would not significantly affect federal spending for such activities relative to current law. The bill would not affect direct spending or revenues." Roy T. Meyers, political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who has studied budgeting and earmarks, said he was "astonished to see how (Grayson) selectively and misleadingly edited the definition of earmark, then compounded the fault by drawing a bizarre inference regarding the bill's effective approval of a permit. This bill is about administrative regulation, or more accurately, the lack of it. The earmark definition restricts its application to spending, and lists different types of spending, including grants. Grayson cuts the words on spending and the other types of spending besides grants and replaces these missing words with ellipses, which completely changes the meaning." Two other experts -- Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist -- agreed with this analysis. "There has to be a dollar figure associated with the provision, and this bill does not have that," Ellis said. Grayson’s office stands by its classification of the bill as an earmark, arguing that the House voted on a measure that amounts to a special favor to one entity, for one project, and that was requested by a Member of Congress, Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb. Despite Meyers’ deep skepticism of Grayson’s claim that the bill is an earmark under House rules, he said Grayson has a point. "Earmarks have been criticized, often justifiably, for not being subject to sufficient scrutiny on their policy merits," Myers said. "Unlike most research grants that are subject to demanding peer reviews, or many contracts that must undergo extensive agency review and competitive bidding, earmarks are awarded only after cursory reviews, typically by committee staff. Congress substitutes its judgment on a particular case, cutting agencies and other experts out of the loop." The similarity here, Meyers said, is that the bill prevents agencies from doing their job -- to assess the impacts of a proposed project. Still, that’s not the same thing as arguing that H.R. 3 actually qualifies as an earmark under House rules. "Grayson would be smarter to argue that the bill violates the spirit, not the letter, of the earmark moratorium and the philosophy that supposedly backs it," Meyers said. We should note that the House -- the only body that can officially determine whether a bill fits the earmark definition under the chamber’s rules -- has not passed judgment on Grayson’s claim. When Grayson raised his argument on the House floor, the lawmaker chairing the proceedings ruled that Grayson’s request was improper, dismissing it before allowing any discussion of the substance of Grayson’s complaint. Grayson’s office added that they have not received ruling determination on the merits of his arguments from the House parliamentarian’s office. This result is not surprising. Grayson wasn’t going into court to argue to an impartial judge; in the House, whichever party happens to be in the majority controls the chamber to a near-dictatorial degree. And to nobody’s surprise, the measure passed by a 241-175 margin when it came to a vote on May 22, 2013. No Republican broke ranks by opposing it, while 19 Democrats sided with the majority in supporting the bill. Because the Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to agree, the bill is not expected to become law. Our ruling Grayson said a bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline "is an earmark" under House rules. Officially, the House -- the only entity that can make this ruling -- has not rendered a judgment on Grayson’s claim. But several experts on earmarks that we checked with were unanimous that Grayson was wrong by the clear language of the rule. The House’s definition of "earmark" is based on the notion that the provision in question spends federal money, which the bill in question does not -- a difference that Grayson carefully edited out when he made his argument to Boehner. We rate Grayson’s claim False.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2013-05-31T15:14:17	2013-05-21	['None']
pomt-13088	"Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military" ... "When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers?"	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/nov/07/ohio-republican-party/gop-mailer-uses-tricky-wording-smear-oh-candidate-/	A PolitiFact Ohio reader suggested that we look into claims found on a mailer that appears to question the patriotism of Democratic House District 37 candidate Casey Weinstein. So we obliged. "Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military," reads one side of the flier, which was paid for by the Ohio Republican Party. On the opposite side: "Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers? Vote no on Casey Weinstein." We wanted to know more about the story behind this claim, so we reached out to the Ohio Republican Party. Though the flier literally reads, "Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military," Ohio’s GOP spokesperson Brittany Warner told PolitiFact Ohio, "Under no circumstances is this written to imply that Mr. Weinstein has no faith in the service of our men and women in uniform." The candidate’s military background makes the words in this ad all the more puzzling. Weinstein, 34, is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. He is an Air Force Reserve captain currently separated from active duty. His father, his brother, and his wife are also graduates. Confused? Turns out, "no faith in our military" is a paraphrase of Weinstein’s stance in a 2004 lawsuit against the Air Force Academy. The lawsuit asked for renewed enforcement of the constitutional separation of church and state on the military campus. The lawsuit was filed by Weinstein’s father, Mikey Weinstein, a former Air Force officer. Four cadets at the Air Force Academy, including the candidate Casey Weinstein, joined the suit, and claimed that the Air Force Academy imposed a hostile environment by pushing Christianity on the non-Christians in their ranks. One of the incidents detailed in the suit was an Air Force Academy-promoted screening of Mel Gibson’s film, The Passion of the Christ. (Weinstein is Jewish, and Gibson’s movie has been criticized for portraying Jews as enthusiastic participants in the crucifixion of Jesus.) The movie screening was not the plaintiffs’ only example of pervasive religious activities occurring on duty. We contacted Mikey Weinstein, who wanted to be clear that his participation in this fact-check is not an endorsement of his son nor an opinion on the race. The elder Weinstein is the founder and president of the nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, dedicated to restoring "the obliterated wall separating church and state in the most technologically lethal organization ever created by humankind: the United States armed forces." He is a 1977 graduate of the Air Force Academy who went on to serve for ten years in the Judge Advocate General Corps (as a "JAG" officer), and as legal counsel to President Ronald Reagan's administration in the White House. Mikey Weinstein pointed out that the campaign flier gets the "sued our soldiers" claim wrong on two points. First, it implies that the suit targeted individuals for their individual acts, which is not accurate. A lawsuit filed against a military branch and its highest civil servant -- in this case, the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force -- is an action against the institution, not the individual. Secondly, the servicemembers of the U.S. Air Force are referred to as airmen and airwomen, not soldiers. "Soldiers" applies to members of the Army. Mikey Weinstein said that his organization has represented over 48,000 service members across every branch of the military and any faith (or lack thereof). As for the lawsuit against the U.S. Air Force, it was dismissed by a federal judge after Weinstein and his co-plaintiffs graduated, losing their legal standing against the institution. An internal Air Force investigation later substantiated the claims brought by the Weinsteins’ lawsuit and prompted the issuance of new religious tolerance policies. Our ruling A GOP-funded campaign flier stated, "Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military," and, "When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers? Vote no on Casey Weinstein." The mailer twists many facts about a lawsuit to present Weinstein, an Air Force reservist from a military family, as hostile to the armed forces. There is an element of truth in that Weinstein did sue the Air Force Academy, asserting that the institution unconstitutionally promoted the evangelization of Christianity by its leadership and cadets on duty. His lawsuit did not target fellow "soldiers," but the institution itself (also, Air Force members are not called "soldiers"). The flier further capitalizes on the two possible interpretations suggested by the phrase "no faith in our military." A cursory read of the flier could easily leave voters with the impression that Weinstein was critical of the armed forces. For manipulating the real narrative, we rate the claims in the mailer Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4264508e-222a-4309-9db5-ccf92962ff8b	None	Ohio Republican Party	None	None	None	2016-11-07T13:44:35	2016-10-28	['United_States']

pomt-08425	Says Russ Feingold supported a stimulus plan that allowed a company to create 3,000 jobs in China.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/19/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-russ-feingold-supported-stimulus-/	Stung by a TV ad from Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold portraying him as anti-worker for supporting foreign trade deals, Republican challenger Ron Johnson is striking back. In a new TV ad, Johnson tries to tarnish Feingold’s pro-labor credentials by casting him as a desperate hypocrite on trade. Where Feingold has touted his opposition to what he calls unfair trade deals with China, Mexico and other countries, the Johnson ad links Feingold to job creation in China -- not through trade deals, but his vote on the 2009 stimulus package. The Johnson ad begins with a narrator saying: "Russ Feingold ... desperate ... running a misleading, negative campaign." The video pans across headlines from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about PolitiFact Wisconsin items that rated past Feingold claims as Half True and Pants on Fire. Then it turns to trade. "Feingold says one thing, does another," the ad’s narrator charges. "Feingold voted the party line for the stimulus bill that allowed U.S. tax dollars to go to foreign companies to create manufacturing jobs overseas." A large graphic then pops up and lingers -- "Create 3,000 jobs in China" -- as the narrators says: "Democrat senators said the bill will create 3,000 jobs in China alone." So by supporting the stimulus bill, did Feingold sell out his stance on trade and pay for 3,000 jobs in China? That’s a big charge. Let’s dig in. While there is no question Feingold supported the stimulus bill, the ad’s claims turn on whether the measure supports overseas jobs in general, and the jobs in China specifically. With the China reference, the ad echoes spots by various congressional candidates across the country that -- according to an Oct. 9, 2010 New York Times article -- play on fears about China’s economic ascendancy. As backup, the Johnson campaign cites two sources: a March 3, 2010 press release by Democratic senators, including Charles Schumer of New York, and a story the same day by Politico that picked up on the press release. The controversy arose after a report by the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University found that overseas firms had received 79 percent of $2.1 billion in renewable-energy grants under the stimulus plan, as PolitiFact National later recounted. That $2.1 billion piece is a tiny portion -- not even 1 percent -- of the overall $787 billion stimulus deal. Only U.S. energy projects can be funded under the stimulus plan, but overseas companies were ahead of America on wind-turbine production, so many of those projects are being developed by the American subsidiaries of foreign companies, PolitiFact National has reported. This detail is glossed over in the ad, which suggests the stimulus money is primarily aimed at creating jobs overseas. The Investigative Reporting Workshop report included reference to a west Texas wind farm proposal that would use made-in-China wind turbines, which would potentially create up to 3,000 jobs in China. That prompted Schumer and the other Democrats to condemn that prospect in a news release. The release described the Texas project as "on the verge" of receiving $450 million in stimulus funds. That release overstated the case. News accounts at the time quoted project officials in the U.S.-China joint venture as saying they would apply for stimulus funding, and the China jobs would total 2,400 to 3,000 jobs, with a much smaller number created in the United States. But much has changed since fall 2009, when the project was announced. The outcry over the investigation led to negotiations between the U.S. Steelworkers union and the U.S.-China joint venture. In March 2010, the project announced that its Chinese manufacturing partner would build turbines at a plant in Nevada, creating up to 300 jobs there. The plant, which will have other manufacturing uses, could create a total of 1,000 jobs, project officials estimated. In August, 2010, the United Steelworkers announced a deal with the wind-farm partners that they say will assure that major components for the project will be made in the United States. According to United Steelworkers national spokesman Wayne Ranick, under the deal, a total of 1,000 U.S. jobs could be created by establishing a domestic supply chain for the project. Wind machines require hundreds of parts and even when key parts are made overseas, much of the work can be done domestically, renewable energy officials say. Project officials now say that a minimum of 70 percent of each wind turbine, including the massive towers and blades, will be wholly manufactured in the United States and made of American steel. Project officials no longer put an estimate on the Chinese manufacturing jobs, saying that the "vast majority" of all jobs created by the wind farm will be in the United States. Finally, the Texas project, which is in its early stages, has not applied for or received any stimulus funding to date, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. They are eligible to do so, however, and have not ruled out applying later. In any case, the Johnson ad twists the reality of the Democratic news release it cites. The senators were opposed to the prospect of the jobs going to China. The Johnson ad presents their statement as some sort of virtue of the Democratic-backed stimulus plan. The ad also leaves a false impression of Feingold’s views on Buy American provisions, including in relation to the stimulus, and on trade with China. Feingold is a longtime advocate of Buy American provisions. In the stimulus debate, it was largely Republicans and business groups, as well as multinational companies and U.S. trading partners, who objected to including strict Buy American rules they viewed as overly protectionist. Feingold voted against a Republican amendment that would have killed the Buy American provision in its entirety, roll call records show. He did support the compromise version that survived. In the Senate, Feingold has voted consistently against foreign trade agreements he deems as damaging to Wisconsin jobs because he believes they favor foreign competitors. This includes a 2000 vote against granting China permanent most-favored nation status for trade. Let’s take stock: In making his claim, Johnson notes that a side effect of the stimulus bill, which Feingold backed, was that in limited cases -- particularly in renewable energy -- foreign companies would benefit from some of the money. The approach spurs job growth in America as well, but undeniably would create some overseas jobs, too. Johnson tries to bolster this claim by citing a specific Texas project involving China and some 3,000 related jobs to be created there. But he twists Democratic objections to the possibility into alleged support for it. And the outcry itself has prompted revisions that mean more jobs here -- and so far no application has been made by project officials for any stimulus money. What’s more, Feingold backed the Buy American provisions that were included in the bill, saying they were a step forward. We rate Johnson’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04259	Half the lottery directors across the country had not run a lottery before they were hired.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/nov/13/brian-robinson/its-good-bet-your-lottery-director-doesnt-have-lot/	Georgia’s $3.8 billion lottery is big business for the state, responsible for funding almost $1 billion for college scholarships and pre-kindergarten programs each year. With so much at stake, such a large enterprise is closely watched by the state’s top politicos. The spotlight fell last month on the Georgia Lottery Board when one of its members resigned because she thought the panel was feeling pressured to hire Gov. Nathan Deal’s budget director as the next lottery chief. The new chief, Debbie Dlugolenski Alford, a former director of the state’s Office of Planning and Budget and a member of the lottery board, had never worked for a lottery. Some officials, including a state Senate leader, questioned the selection and Alford’s qualifications. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson dismissed the criticism, telling an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter that half the lottery directors across the country had not run a lottery before they were hired. Ultimately, the state lottery board unanimously confirmed Alford for the job Oct. 25. We wondered whether Robinson’s claim was accurate. How many of the jurisdictions operating lotteries had directors without previous lottery experience? Was this an acceptable practice in the industry to roll the dice on an untested leader? And did a background in other professional fields qualify as related experience? The Georgia Lottery Corp. has been in operation for 19 years and has sales exceeding $45 billion, according to information on the lottery’s website. Of that amount, more than $13.8 billion has been transferred to the state’s Lottery for Education Account. At any given time, Georgia’s lottery operates nine online or computerized games and about 40 instant ticket games. We asked Robinson for any documentation to support his claim. The governor’s office provided a chart of lottery directors in 43 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The data, compiled by the governor’s office with a July 24 date, included a list of lottery CEOs and their former or concurrent occupation. The chart also included a background column on whether the CEO had lottery experience. When asked, an office spokeswoman did not explain how the office qualified lottery experience, and whether it was based on any specific requirement such as length of time in office, training or related professional work. Not content to take the governor’s office chart at face value, we did our own research on the 46 lottery chiefs listed on the chart. PolitiFact Georgia’s research found that 22 directors on the list appeared to have no previous lottery experience, including the directors for the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands lotteries. The limited background information found on those two directors did not appear to include any previous lottery experience. For the most part, the governor’s office was accurate in its assessments, if previous lottery experience included sitting on a lottery board or commission, or serving in some other job for the same state lottery, such as legal counsel. In a few cases, the chart information was incorrect based on our research of online biographies, related media articles or announcements and the lotteries’ websites. For example, the chart lists former Georgia Lottery chief Margaret deFrancisco as having no previous lottery experience. In fact, DeFrancisco had been director of the New York Lottery before coming to Atlanta. And the governor’s office listed Arizona’s lottery executive director, Jeff Hatch-Miller, as having previous experience, but his biography included no mention of previous lottery work. Hatch-Miller’s experience included time served on the state commission in charge of regulating utilities and time spent in the Arizona Legislature. Overall, the operation of lotteries is done at the state level. There is no overarching organization or federal department with regulatory authority. Within the industry, the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, based in Geneva, Ohio, acts as the trade group for lotteries and provides support to lottery administrators. Membership consists of jurisdictions operating lotteries, including 43 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, five Canadian provinces and Mexico. Qualifications for lottery directors or CEOs are determined by the states, said David Gale, the NASPL’s executive director. The NASPL does not keep statistics on lottery directors’ backgrounds. "With past experience you’ll find a mix. There are some directors without previous lottery experience, but they have some business, budgeting and security experience that is significant in operating a lottery," Gale said. Also notable, he said, some of the top lottery positions are appointed positions that can be political appointments. Direct experience in operating a lottery is not irrelevant, but it is only one of many qualities to consider in a CEO’s role, said Paul Jason, director of the Public Research Gaming Institute. A director with ties to the governor’s office or state legislature could be important in navigating between those offices and personalities and the lottery corporation, he said. Georgia’s lottery has a "deep bench" of talented top management that can deal with the management of the lottery and can help the incoming director, making direct experience unnecessary [for the director], Jason said. So let’s review. Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, shunned criticism about the state’s new lottery director having no previous lottery experience when selected for the job last month. Robinson told a newspaper reporter that half the country’s lottery directors had not run lotteries before taking the top job. Robinson’s claim is correct -- in most cases. There is some room for interpretation. Still, we rate Robinson’s statement Mostly True.	None	Brian Robinson	None	None	None	2012-11-13T06:00:00	2012-10-11	['None']

Asked in an NPR interview on Nov. 8, 2010, about the public grumblings from some Republican officials about RNC fundraising, Steele dismissed the criticism, saying it was "about the fact that they don't want me in this job, to put it rather bluntly." Steele defended his tenure as RNC chairman, saying, "I have won more elections than any chairman since 1938. In fact, none of my predecessors have been able to put together the kind of combination of wins." The battle for RNC chairman promises to heat up quickly in the coming month, so we decided to check Steele's talking point, that he has "won more elections than any chairman since 1938." We e-mailed the RNC press office for backup, and they pointed us to a story in the Cook Political Report that characterized the Republicans' gain of 63 House seats in the 2010 midterm elections as "the most seismic shift of House seats in a midterm election since 1938." We checked it out, and if Steele had specified that he was talking only about seat changes in the House, he'd be accurate. The 64-seat gain by Republicans this year is more than any year since 1939 (when Republicans picked up a whopping 81 seats). But Steele didn't say seat changes. And, in fact, Republicans won more seats in the House -- 246 -- in 1946. The number of Republican House wins this year is actually still unsettled, as a handful of very close races are still being sorted out. But provided the Republicans currently leading in those races are ultimately declared the winners, the final tally would be 243 Republican seats. That's awfully close but not quite as many House wins for Republicans as in 1946. More importantly, though, Steele didn't say he was talking only about the House. The RNC also supports Republican candidates in U.S. Senate, governor and state legislature elections. To be clear, Republicans did very well in all of these areas in the 2010 midterms. But the GOP has had better years in Senate and gubernatorial elections. An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute of 100 years worth of midterm election gains made by the party out of power shows that the six seats picked up in the Senate this year are fewer than in 1942 (10 seats); 1946 (13 seats); and 1994 (nine seats). And when it comes to governor elections, you also don't need to go back as far as 1938 to find a year in which Republicans picked up more state capitals. This year, six governors' seats changed to Republican, but 11 governors' seats changed to Republican in 1994. As for state legislature elections, it was a banner election for Republicans this year, with about 690 seats switching to Republican. Because some states hold state legislative elections in odd years, the National Conference of State Legislatures prefers to look at two-year cycles. By that measure, Republicans have gained 724 seats, Tim Storey, an elections analyst with the NCSL. There are now more Republicans holding state legislative seats than at any point since 1928, Storey said. Of the 7,382 total state legislative seats, 53 percent are now occupied by Republicans. "It's definitely an historic high-water mark," Storey said. But strictly speaking, Republicans gained even more state legislative seats in 1966 (when they picked up 762 seats -- 38 more than in this two-year cycle). The authors of the AEI analysis, James Fortier and Jennifer Marsico, also calculated a midterm power ranking (based on the average of their rankings in four categories -- House, Senate, governor and state legislature elections). The Republican gains in 2010 ranked sixth. That's behind 1994 (a year of major Republican gains) and 1958 (which Democrats dominated). "Overall, it was one of the best years for Republicans in the last 60 years," Fortier said. If Steele decides to seek another term as chairman of the RNC, he can certainly boast about significant Republican gains in the midterm election. But when he said, "I have won more elections than any chairman since 1938," that's only true if you were to consider just the seat changes -- as opposed to the actual number of wins -- in the U.S. House. Republicans also picked up seats in the Senate this year, but they gained more in 1942, 1946 and 1994; Republican gains in governor elections were greater in 1994; and GOP gains in state legislatures were greater in 1966. And so we rate Steele's claim Half True.	None	Michael Steele	None	None	None	2010-12-03T13:16:01	2010-11-08	['None']

pomt-00246	"I voted to defund sanctuary cities."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2018/oct/06/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-has-voted-and-against-defunding-sanctuar/	While Democrats nationwide have embraced sanctuary cities, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill is touting the opposite on the campaign trail. On Sept. 10 in a question-and-answer session at Truman State University, the senator said she "voted to defund sanctuary cities" when asked whether she supported them, according to a transcript by the Columbia Daily Tribune. She then talked about the importance of cooperating with law enforcement but said she empathized with children and parents separated at the border. So-called "sanctuary cities" are jurisdictions that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement particularly when concerning undocumented immigrants. But McCaskill, who is defending her seat against state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has been attacked by many conservative groups for helping sanctuary cities. So who is telling the truth? This isn’t the first time McCaskill expressed her opposition to sanctuary cities. In response to an ad by One Nation, her campaign released a fact check of its own in August, stating she "voted to crack down on sanctuary cities." It referenced the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which reported in February that "McCaskill was one of four Democrats who, this month, voted with Republicans to clamp down on so-called ‘sanctuary cities’ during a string of failed immigration votes in the Senate." PolitiFact looked into the specific vote in February as well as others, and we found six votes which can be grouped into three types. • One vote on the "cloture motion": This is the vote just mentioned, where on Feb. 15, McCaskill voted yes on the cloture motion for an amendment that would not allow sanctuary jurisdictions to receive various economic grants. A "cloture motion" is a move to end the debate and hold the final vote. This amendment failed to get enough votes to do that. • Two votes on "cloture on the motion to proceed": This move essentially puts the bill onto the floor for debate and consideration in the first place. In October 2015 and July 2016, McCaskill voted no on this move for two bills that would prohibit sanctuary cities from receiving certain grants. Both bills failed to get past this step. • Three votes tabling an amendment: In 2007, 2008 and 2009, McCaskill voted to table three amendments sponsored by former Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana that would prohibit funding for sanctuary localities to develop their community policing. By definition, tabling legislation is to simply postpone consideration. But tabling legislation also effectively kills it. All three of Vitter’s amendments were tabled. It should be noted that all six votes were procedural, and none were explicitly on the actual issue itself. The question is now whether these votes should count as voting for or against an issue. Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, said that ultimately these are just procedural votes. But, he added, "procedures often help determine substantive outcomes." It’s along these lines that political science professor Gregory Koger of the University of Miami argues the procedural votes mentioned, by proxy, count as votes on the actual issue. "The key question is what these votes mean in context," said Koger. "What do senators think they are voting on? What are the consequences of a ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ vote?" Wolfensberger said procedural votes can be merely partisan rather than substantive in some cases. In the House, members of the minority party often try to delay the process even though in the end, they end up voting with the majority party. "In deciphering procedural votes, one should look at what the legislator says, not just what they do," he said. It is clear, regarding the February 2018 vote, that McCaskill intended to defund sanctuary cities, citing this stance because of the murder of a Missouri man by a person staying in the country illegally. But what about the other five votes that seemed to be against defunding those cities? What was her intent back then? In a 2017 Joplin Globe article, McCaskill was reported as saying that she voted against defunding sanctuary cities because it would deter immigrants from reporting crimes. PolitiFact Missouri also reached out to the McCaskill campaign to ask for the reasoning behind those five votes. The campaign cited the community policing funding cuts and how law enforcement was against them as a reason for one of the votes. The campaign did not outrightly deny her past votes against defunding, saying that "how she voted on other proposals does not change that fact" she voted to defund sanctuary cities. Our ruling McCaskill said she "voted to defund sanctuary cities." The vote her campaign references, despite being procedural, had the proxy effect of voting for the defunding, experts point out, especially considering the context where McCaskill has explicitly stated she takes that stance. The rest of her voting record, however, is against defunding sanctuary cities, and her intent back then supports the idea that those votes were substantive, too. So groups who attack her on this stance have a point. In short, she voted most recently to defund, but other votes show her defending sanctuary cities. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-02792	"44% of homeless people are employed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/04/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-44-percent-homeless-people-are-/	As President Barack Obama used a Dec. 4, 2013, speech to turn the national conversation to economic inequality, we thought it might be a good time to check into a Facebook post a reader recently sent us. The post said: "44% of homeless people are employed. Shouldn't work be an escape from poverty?" We wondered if that was accurate. Sourcing the claim We began by looking into the source of the Facebook post. The meme being circulated was created by a website called Occupy*Posters, which provides eye-catching "memes" for supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement to share on social media. Occupy*Posters did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, but the group footnotes its sources, and it urges caution when people share them. "While some of the posters here are expressive of only opinion," the group’s website says, "great care is taken to ensure that the many posters here which present data mesh with solid facts. Still, due to human imperfections, you should independently verify information in the posters here before using them in any important way. Toward that end, it is the normal practice here to diligently, almost obsessively, cite all sources." The footnote provided in the meme pointed to a fact sheet from the National Coalition Against Homelessness, an advocacy group. The document says, "44% of homeless people ... have jobs and can't escape homelessness." However, this document doesn’t provide the original source of the 44 percent figure, and the group did not respond to an inquiry. After some digging, however, we feel comfortable in saying that the statistic comes from a report by the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. The report -- "Homelessness: Programs and the People They Serve: Findings of the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients" -- found that "almost half (44 percent) of homeless clients did some paid work during the 30 days before being interviewed." So that would give the Facebook post a measure of truth. Still, we uncovered two important caveats. The data’s age First, the data is old. The report was published in 1999, and the data it used were collected in 1996. That makes the statistics nearly 18 years old, which is practically ancient by social-science standards. That said, despite this advanced age, there are no more recent statistics that address the question of how many homeless people are earning money from working, said Mary Cunningham, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute who specializes in homelessness and housing. "It would be much better if we had up-to-date data, but that is not always possible," said Gary Burtless, an economist specializing in employment for the Brookings Institution. "When using 17-year-old data, however, we have to ask ourselves whether other critical factors have changed in the intervening years." In this case, a key issue is whether there’s reason to think that the nature of homelessness and employment has changed in the intervening years. And experts say it may have. The Great Recession and the slow recovery have squeezed job prospects even for people who aren’t homeless and have extensive work histories. Nationally, the unemployment rate is about 2 percentage points higher now than it was when the data was collected in the mid 1990s. So it’s certainly plausible that homeless people today would be less likely to secure a job than they were back then, during an era of robust economic growth. "You could argue that the employment picture for homeless people might be worse today due to the recession, though it’s hard to say with any amount of certainty," Cunningham said. The definition of "employed" The other issue we’ll note is what the Facebook post communicates by its use of the term "employed." When we first read it, we assumed "employed" meant that someone held a regular job. Certainly the meme’s message would be powerful if it said that almost half of homeless Americans aren’t getting paid enough from their regular jobs to be able to afford a home. However, the Urban Institute defined its figures somewhat differently. The report said that "of those who report working in the last 30 days, 20 percent did so in a job lasting or expected to last at least three months." The remainder worked temporary or day-labor jobs or peddled or sold personal belongings. The language of the report is a bit unclear; either the figure to pay attention to is 20 percent (rather than the meme’s 44 percent), or even as low as 9 percent (if it’s one-fifth of 44 percent). Either way, the number cited in the Facebook post is too high if you’re looking at homeless people who have a traditional, longer-term, steady job. "I agree that taking an odd job is not the same as having a steady job," said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair, which suggests that the smaller number seems "more relevant." But not all experts agreed. Burtless noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics counts an "employed person" as someone who, during the time period studied, "did any work at all as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession or on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers in a family-operated enterprise." Since this more expansive definition is as close as we can get to an official government definition, Burtless said, it seems like a reasonable standard to use, even if other plausible definitions exist. In addition, "even ‘uneven’ employment is a sign of willingness to work," said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. "So it depends on the point one is trying to make." Our ruling The Facebook post said that 44 percent of homeless people are employed. On the one hand, the data is 18 years old, and the percentage who have a regular job is, at most, less than half that. Still, this is the most recent data available, and some experts say a broader more generous definition of "employed" is defensible. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02288	Says the goal of the Affordable Care Act was to get 30 million people insured, but it only got 7 million.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/04/marco-rubio/rubio-says-health-care-law-fell-short-goal-30-mill/	The White House celebrated earlier this week when 7.1 million Americans signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act marketplaces since they opened in October 2013. Predictably, the law’s critics were not as thrilled. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., spoke on Hannity Tuesday night about what he sees as the reform’s shortcomings. "I mean, the purpose of Obamacare was not to get 7 million people or 6 million people, or whatever the number now is, to sign up on a website," Rubio said. "The purpose of Obamacare, according to them, was to get more people insurance. And by all accounts, it's going to fall woefully short. You're still going to have 30-some-odd million people in this country uninsured." We wanted to know if Rubio’s claim was correct that the health care law was falling short of its goals. Rubio’s office didn’t return our request for comment. One thing that struck us is that Rubio is mixing up numbers for the law’s first year and what policy makers hope the law achieves over the long run. No one expected to see the law’s full effects in the first year after the health care marketplaces opened. The best authority on health care numbers is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which regularly publishes independent estimates of the law’s effects. In February 2013, months before healthcare.gov launched, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 7 million people would sign up on the marketplaces by March 31, 2014, after the marketplace had been open for six months. The CBO estimated that by 2019, 27 million people will have signed up on the marketplaces. There will still be roughly 29 million people uninsured by that time, which is close to the number Rubio mentioned. But that’s down from 55 million uninsured in 2013. Not everyone will end up with health insurance for a variety of reasons. Undocumented workers aren’t eligible to shop on the marketplaces. People living in states that have decided not to expand Medicaid will also be among the uninsured. The law also has a hardship exemption. That means homeless people, domestic violence victims, people caring for disabled family members and others can apply to have the penalty fee waived for not purchasing insurance under the reform’s individual mandate. Our ruling Rubio claimed the Obama administration’s goal for the Affordable Care Act was to get 30 million Americans insured, not the 7 million who enrolled by the March 31 deadline. Down the road, there are targets to insure millions more via the online marketplaces. But the clearly stated goal for 2014, that the White House hit just in time, was 7 million signups. By 2019, that number is expected to jump to 27 million. Rubio does have a point that many Americans will remain uninsured under the reform, but his claim twists the administration’s timeline for enrolling uninsured Americans. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2014-04-04T10:13:29	2014-04-01	['None']

pomt-07922	Mitchell International Airport is the "the third busiest airport in the world and the number one busiest in the country."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/30/lee-holloway/acting-milwaukee-county-executive-lee-holloway-say/	One of Lee Holloway’s first acts after becoming acting Milwaukee County executive was to put his name on the monthly press release about passenger counts at Mitchell International Airport. Holloway, the County Board chairman, is running to fill the job in the spring election and -- like his predecessor, now-Gov. Scott Walker -- touts success at the airport at campaign appearances. At a Jan. 21, 2011 forum at the Marquette University Law School, he called Mitchell the "third busiest airport in the world and the number one busiest airport in the country." That stopped a few scribbling pens. And some in the audience scratched their heads. Busier than O’Hare, Atlanta or LaGuardia? Third busiest in the world? In the debate appearance -- viewed by a standing room only audience, aired on television and available on YouTube -- Holloway got it wrong. Mitchell is the nation’s fastest growing airport and -- at least for a while last year -- was the third fastest growing airport in the world. It’s not the busiest. Holloway has gotten his airport facts right on several other occasions, including a Journal Sentinel editorial board visit, two press releases, and his Jan. 26, 2011 "State of the County" speech. Well, close to right -- the world ranking is based on outdated statistics. The most recent airport stats: A little more than 9.8 million passengers traveled through Mitchell in 2010, according to airport data. That’s a 24.1 percent increase over the year before. In December, there were 774,341 passengers, up 6.4 percent from the same month in 2009. More than 2 million passengers changed planes at Mitchell last year, a 25 percent increase over the year before. However, Mitchell’s status as among the fastest growing in the world is waning. The airport was fourth fastest growing in the world in the first quarter of 2010 and third in the second quarter, but tumbled to 16th in the third quarter, according to Airports Council International, an industry trade group. (Fourth quarter numbers aren’t yet available.) Milwaukee was the only U.S. airport on the list, and in the second quarter trailed only Istanbul, Turkey and Moscow. In the third quarter, airports in several South American countries surged ahead of Milwaukee -- seven of them landed in the top 15. "We anticipate that MKE will continue to grow, but that the rate of growth will flatten as we begin comparing to growth rates of 30 - 40 percent" in the fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2010, said airport spokeswoman Patricia Rowe. PolitiFact Wisconsin checked a similar airport statement made in September by Walker, then a candidate for governor. In his victory speech on primary election night, Walker said the airport was the fastest growing airport in the country and responsible for 1,000 jobs. Airport consultant Michael Boyd, of Boyd Group International in Evergreen Colo., told us then that passengers were enjoying more flights and comparatively lower fares because three airlines -- AirTran Airways, Southwest and Republic -- are "trying to kill each other." "It has nothing to do with county government," Boyd said. "It has to do with airline economics." Some of the large increases are the result of the year-to-year comparisons. Midwest Airlines, for instance, dramatically slashed the number of its destinations from Mitchell before it was bought by Republic. The airline now operates as Frontier and has steadily added flights. Walker’s statement, which mixed in job growth, earned a Half True. Where does Holloway’s nation’s-busiest statement land? Holloway has made a more precise airport claim on other occasions. But he was wrong when he said at the candidates’ forum that Mitchell was one of the world’s "busiest" airports, and the busiest in the nation. Those rankings relate to passenger growth, not busy-ness. What’s more, the world ranking he used (third) came from the second quarter data from 2010 -- and that’s old data. We’re now No. 17 according to the latest figures. Holloway’s incorrect message went out to a wider audience and was echoed by media outlets covering the event. Holloway’s claim is False.

pomt-07563	"Before this (federal health care) law was enacted, Florida parents ... were able to purchase inexpensive 'child-only' coverage for their children. The law’s 'consumer protections' have now eliminated that choice in Florida."	false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/31/rick-scott/scott-says-new-federal-health-care-act-eliminated-/	To mark the one-year anniversary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010, Republican leaders have been rallying their voices and calling for a repeal of the health care measure. From television advertisements like this one featuring Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee to newspaper opinion pieces, Republicans continue to drum their talking points against the health care overhaul. Likewise, Democrats have also been using the anniversary to grow support for the measure by hosting events like community picnics and forums. Gov. Rick Scott was among those adding to the Republican chorus of dissent against the law. On March 23, 2011, he penned an opinion piece for the Tampa Tribune decrying "ObamaCare." "As important as health insurance is, most people need a job more than they need health insurance," Scott wrote. Scott, a former hospital chain CEO, ran on a platform opposing health care reform, and has supported the Florida-led lawsuit against the law. Before becoming a candidate, Scott founded Conservatives for Patients' Rights, a group dedicated to opposing federal health care reform. "Before this law was enacted, Florida parents who were laid off or who couldn't get dependent coverage at work were able to purchase inexpensive 'child-only' coverage for their children," Scott wrote. "The law's 'consumer protections' have now eliminated that choice in Florida and 17 other states." We wondered about Scott's claim. Did the federal health care law really eliminate all inexpensive child-only insurance options in Florida? We turned to Scott's press office to request materials that would support the governor's claim but never received a response. Our research, however, found that child-only insurance programs do still exist, and the state runs one of them. The health care law Let's start with the law and its consumer protection provisions. The law was signed by Obama on March 23, 2010, and is aimed at ensuring that all Americans have access to health insurance by barring health insurance providers from refusing coverage for folks with pre-existing conditions. The entire law is set to go into effect by 2014; however, there are elements of the law, namely those geared toward children, that were launched in 2010. For example, children can now remain under their parents' insurance until age 26, when previously most had to be off the plan by age 19 or when they stopped being enrolled full-time in college. Another measure set into motion in 2010, the one referenced by Scott, bans insurance providers from refusing to insure a child based on pre-existing conditions. The child-only provision was set to demonstrate on a smaller scale what the law aimed to do when it is fully launched in 2014 -- ensuring coverage for everyone, healthy or sick, who applied for health insurance. Except, unlike the "health care for all" provisions set for 2014, the child-only provisions did not include language requiring insurers to write insurance policies for children. In other words, they couldn't deny a child coverage based on a pre-condition -- but the law doesn't require them to sell a child-specific policy in the first place. "Nothing in the Affordable Care Act, or any other existing federal law, allows us to require insurance companies to offer a particular type of policy at this time," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius acknowledged in an Oct. 13, 2010, letter to Jane L. Cline, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Leading up to the Sept. 23, 2010, start date of the child-protection provisions, some of the nation's leading providers -- including WellPoint, UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, Cigna and Humana -- stopped selling the child-only policies. Several cited concerns that the law did not provide guarantees that parents wouldn't wait until a child was gravely ill before purchasing a plan. "The regulations provide a very powerful incentive for parents to wait until their children are sick to buy coverage, which drives up costs for everyone else," said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a leading lobbyist group for insurers. Doug Lynch, vice president of actuary for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, likened the measure to letting a person purchase homeowners insurance once their house is on fire. "As an example, on the way to the hospital, a parent could call from the ambulance to get coverage," Lynch said in a March 28, 2011, telephone interview. "There was no waiting period … this type of system lends itself to abuse. If you do cover that case, then you would need to charge everyone for that abuse." Sebelius offered some suggestions so that private insurers would continue to sell the child-only plans -- imposing a surcharge if a parent dropped their child's coverage and subsequently reapplied for it, and adjusting rates based on health status as permitted by state law (though by 2014, they will no longer be allowed to charge rates based on health status). She also noted in her letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that insurance companies could set enrollment periods, so that parents could not just sign up at any time, so long as the periods they set are consistent with state laws governing enrollment periods. Some providers say that they may be willing to return to selling child-only policies in Florida if the kinks of the law's language are ironed out before 2014. "For us, it's a market issue," Gwyn Dilday, spokeswoman for Cigna, said. "If the market dynamics change in Florida, it's something that we would consider." Dilday said Cigna did not stop selling child-only policies solely because of the health care law, but also because the child-only policies accounted for a tiny portion of their overall business. "There were a lot of factors in our decision," Dilday said. "We’re such a small player in this line of business. It's a very, very small amount of policies, less than 1 percent of the 100,000 policies we have nationally. We had to take that into consideration." Other options While private providers have stopped selling the child-specific policies in Florida, there are still two other government-funded options available to parents -- KidCare and the newly formed Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) Established by the state Legislature in 1998, KidCare, a program run under the Florida Department of Health, provides health insurance not only for low-income children, but for parents of all income levels. Parents pay a monthly premium based on their income, so they can pay anywhere from $15 a month per child to $159. "We did realize when they started leaving, that we were probably it," said Jennifer Lloyd, chief external affairs officer for KidCare, referring to the private providers no longer selling child-only policies. As of January 2011, there are 1.7 million children enrolled in KidCare, the bulk of those insured through Medicaid. Those not covered by Medicaid amount to 281,000 children as of March 2011, according to Lloyd. Lloyd said the program is open for enrollment throughout the year, but it must cap enrollment once the program reaches its annual funding limit. For the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the program received $510 million in state and federal matching funds. Still, Lloyd noted that the last time the program had to close enrollment because of financial limitations was in 2002-2003. Despite private providers no longer selling child-specific policies in the state, Lloyd said enrollment in KidCare has "remained steady." "I cannot say that we've seen a spike in enrollment," Lloyd said. "We saw a spike in applications in January, a little spike, but we think with all the chatter surrounding the health care act, it just got people thinking about health insurance more." Lloyd said that while the program does outreach at schools to inform parents, it isn't as widely advertised as plans from private insurers who may have more advertising money at their disposal. "People might forget that we’re an option," Lloyd said. Another option for parents of children with pre-existing conditions is enrollment in the federally funded Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). The plan was created by the health care law, which allotted $5 billion to help fund high-risk insurance pools run by the states or the Department of Health and Human Services until 2014. In Florida, the plan is administered directly by the Department of Health and Human Services, with plans for those under the age of 18 ranging from $196 to $263 a month. (For a full breakdown of how each state administers the PCIP program, check out this HHS website.) "The PCIP program is available for eligible children with pre-existing conditions who have been uninsured for at least six months," Sebelius wrote in her letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Our ruling So back to Scott's claim: Did the federal health care law eliminate an inexpensive insurance option for children in Florida? While elements of the law that took effect in 2010 have prompted private insurers to stop selling child-only policies, the state continues to offer a viable option for parents in the form of KidCare. For parents who are laid off or low-income, the KidCare rates are inexpensive. And children with pre-existing conditions can also seek enrollment in the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) created by the federal law -- though the rates are higher. Without private insurers participating, the choices for parents have certainly been reduced. But eliminated, as Scott said? No. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03686	Right now, if Rhode Island police come across a young person with a gun, "they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/23/linda-finn/state-rep-linda-finn-says-rhode-island-police-who-/	In the wake of the Newtown, Conn., shootings, the Rhode Island General Assembly is considering a package of bills intended to tighten the state’s gun laws, including restrictions on assault weapons and harsher penalties for gun violations. WPRI’s "Newsmakers" explored the topic on a program featuring state Rep. Linda D. Finn, D-Middletown, who has argued for more gun restrictions, and state Rep. Michael W. Chippendale, R-Foster, who has argued that laws already in place can address concerns if only they were properly enforced. At one point, Tim White, the show’s host, brought up one of the proposed bills, which would make it illegal for anyone under 18 to possess a gun, aside from exceptions such as hunting, rifle ranges and competitive target shooting. Chippendale called the proposal "well intended, but poorly drafted," saying it would contradict another law on the books that provides for licensed hunting by young people. Finn countered that the proposal is intended for police on the streets of Providence and other cities when they come upon a minor with a firearm. "Because right now, if they [the police] come across a [young] person with a gun, they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them," Finn said. We wondered whether Finn’s statement was accurate. The legislation in question is actually an amendment of Rhode Island statute 11-47-33. The statute currently says "possession and use" of certain firearms by someone under age 18 is prohibited in Rhode Island unless he or she has had a permit issued -- under 11-47-34 -- by the Rhode Island State Police or by a local police chief. And that permit can only be issued, the law states, "upon satisfactory proof of being engaged in a course of training in the use of firearms at a regular and recognized camp or rifle range, and provided that the person has the written consent of a guardian." The bill in the legislature calls for dropping the words "and use" from 11-47-33. The reason? According to Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin’s office, the bill was filed because "currently, for a minor to be guilty of possession of a firearm they must possess and use the firearm." Steven M. Pare, the Providence public safety commissioner, said police chiefs support the revision of statute 11-47-33 that would remove the words "and use," making it illegal in most cases for juveniles simply to possess a firearm. Despite Finn’s assertion the the police can’t take guns away from minors, Pare, said that police can and do charge young people with possession of handguns, using another statute, 11-47-8, which prohibits minors from obtaining a carry/conceal permit. But there’s another issue in current law, that gives some credence to Finn’s claim. The Attorney General’s office says that due to what it calls a loophole, the law does not cover shotguns, rifles and other long guns, Kempe said, which could include such weapons as an AK-47, AR-15 and an M-16 -- so long as those are not fully automatic. (Possession of automatic weapons is illegal in all cases.) In other words, if the police see a juvenile carrying such a weapon, they can’t confiscate it under current law. Kempe said the "long guns" at issue are rarely something the police encounter on the streets involving minors; pistols and revolvers, which are already covered under current law and for which the police can arrest and seize the guns, are much more common, she said. Our ruling State Rep. Linda D. Finn said that if the police come across a young person with a gun, "they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them." Under current law, police can seize handguns from juveniles, the weapons most commonly used in street crime. But they can’t seize rifles and other so-called long guns. New legislation could change that. But for now, we rate Finn’s claim Half True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-09212	California Republican gubernatorial hopeful Meg Whitman "contributed to, and campaigned, for" Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/20/steve-poizner/poizner-says-whitman-supported-liberal-icon-barbar/	The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two GOP frontrunners for the nomination. One ad, aired by Poizner beginning in April, argues that Whitman "contributed to, and campaigned, for" Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer -- a serious failing to those in the GOP primary electorate, who view the liberal Boxer as an ideological nemesis. The part about contributing to Boxer is easy enough to check. A search through the campaign donor database of the Federal Election Commission shows that Whitman made three donations totaling $8,000 to entities linked to Boxer, all in November 2003. The question of whether Whitman campaigned for Boxer is a bit more complicated. There's no question that she lent her name to Boxer's cause. Whitman joined 14 other Silicon Valley executives -- including John Chambers of Cisco, venture capitalist John Doerr and Chuck Geschke, co-founder of Adobe Systems -- in signing a letter written on "Barbara Boxer for Senate" letterhead dated April 30, 2003. In what was labeled "An Open Letter to California’s Technology Community," the signers of the letter wrote, "We ask you to join us in supporting U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer in her campaign for re-election in 2004. Senator Boxer is a dynamic and courageous leader for high technology and biotechnology communities, and she is making a difference for us every day." The campaign has argued since last fall that Whitman supported Boxer for pragmatic reasons, in order to help her company. “As CEO of an online commerce leader, Meg backed Sen. Boxer because of her efforts with Republican Sen. George Allen to fight taxes on the Internet," said Dan Comstock, a spokesman for the Whitman campaign. Boxer actually wasn't alone in that stance: In a Sacramento Bee column, senior editor Dan Morain wrote that all of Boxer's Republican opponents that year joined Boxer in opposing the tax. Still, it's clear that Whitman not only supported Boxer financially but also by lending her name. Does that count as having "campaigned for her"? We'd bet that most people would think the definition of "campaigning for" a candidate means to stump with them, canvass neighborhoods, make fundraising phone calls or speak to audiences on the behalf. Signing on to a letter, by contrast, is a more passive kind of support, something closer to an endorsement statement. The Whitman campaign said she did nothing more active for Boxer than to sign the letter, and no evidence has surfaced to contradict that. The closest she came in the letter to "campaigning" was writing, "Join our effort to keep Senator Boxer in the U.S. Senate by adding your name to the growing list of her supporters in the high-tech community." Ultimately, whether that constitutes "campaigning" is a judgment call, and our view is that it probably would have been more appropriate for the Poizner campaign to have used the word "endorsed" rather than "campaigned." But it's unquestionable that Whitman supported Boxer financially and rhetorically in 2003, so on balance we rate Poizner's claim Mostly True.

pomt-10979	"An elderly British politician has been savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he ‘welcomed’ the U.S. president to the United Kingdom."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/17/blog-posting/no-evidence-political-motives-ambassador-attack/	The former British ambassador to the United States was hospitalized after being attacked in a tube station. Police are still investigating the altercation, which left Sir Christopher Meyer bloodied but in stable condition. Some bloggers have connected the attack with President Donald Trump’s visit the next day and the protests that went alongside it. On July 13, protesters gathered in the city, guiding a large, baby Trump balloon past Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Meanwhile, Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May at a military demonstration. Earlier that week, Meyer was beaten in the Victoria London Underground Station. An article, posted on clickbait site Neon Nettle, claimed that Meyer was "savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he ‘welcomed’ the U.S. president to the United Kingdom." This seemed out of line with other reports of the event, which did not mention political motives. We decided to investigate whether Trump’s visit was tied directly to Meyer’s attack. The editorial A few days before the protests, the Independent published an editorial written by Meyer. That same day, he was attacked. In the piece, Meyer cautioned protesters against angering Trump. "Our security and prosperity depend in large measure on keeping our close and long-standing partnership in good working order," he writes. Meyer argued that in spite of Trump pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement on climate change, engaging with the president and maintaining close ties between the countries is imperative. Neon Nettle hypothesized that this show of support was enough to rile up "a gang of anti-Trump protestors." The attack Meyer’s wife told The Times that she suspected the attack was politically motivated: "He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions." However, London police said it is more likely that Meyer’s assailants wanted to rob him. There has been no evidence released thus far to tie the attack to the protests or to suggest that Meyer was targeted. The Neon Nettle article says that Meyer was attacked by "a mob of thugs" involved with the protests against Trump. However, only two suspects were arrested: a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy. They were released from custody while the investigation into their involvement continues, according to a press release by the British Transport Police. Additionally, the attack took place on Wednesday, July 11, two full days before the official protests and a day before Trump arrived in the country. The Neon Nettle also alleges that "violent riots" have occurred throughout London in response to Trump’s visit. While there were massive protests against Trump in the capital, there were few news reports of violence. In a single altercation outside of a pub, one man was arrested for hitting a Trump supporter. Our ruling There has been no evidence released linking the attack of a former ambassador to Trump’s visit to the United Kingdom. Meyer was beaten by two teenagers, not a "gang of anti-Trump protestors," as Neon Nettle alleges. The protests against Trump, which took place two days after the attack, were relatively uneventful as far as violence goes. Because police are still investigating the incident, we cannot conclusively say that it was not motivated by politics. However, for that same reason, Neon Nettle goes too far to say that it was. Further, it is an overstatement to say that the anti-Trump protests were "violent riots." Our ruling is Mostly False.

pomt-13390	"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-chicago-has-experienced-thousand/	Lester Holt asked the major presidential candidates in their first debate how they would heal the nation’s racial divide, exacerbated by police shootings of unarmed African-Americans. Democrat Hillary Clinton called for a top-to-bottom re-examination of the criminal justice system to prevent uneven treatment of minorities under the law. Republican Donald Trump, stuck to his "law and order" approach, painting a bleak portrait of life for African-Americans and Hispanics "living in hell because it’s so dangerous." He zeroed in on Chicago, President Barack Obama’s hometown. "In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings," Trump said. Has Chicago had thousands of shootings so far this year? Trump’s campaign showed us an article published on Forbes Sept. 8 that says of Chicago, "In 2015, 2,988 people were shot and 2016′s figure already stands at 2,949." The Chicago Tribune, which tracks neighborhood crimes through its Crime in Chicagoland project, has data supporting that shooting count for 2015. And as far as this year goes? From Jan. 1 to Sept. 26, there have been 3,210 shooting victims, according to the Chicago Tribune. The publication says the data it compiles is not the same as what the city offers, so numbers will not match those tracked by the city. "One shooting incident may have multiple victims, but it still counts officially as only one shooting," the Chicago Tribune site says. Even then, data released by the Chicago Police Department also shows there have been 2,521 shooting incidents in the city up to Sept. 18. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel delivered a speech Sept. 22 addressing high levels of crime in his city and ways to combat it, outlining a need for more policing, more jobs and crime prevention. "Gun violence in Chicago is unacceptable. ... It is pulling us apart at the very moment that our city needs us to come together," Emanuel said, according to the Tribune. "For all the things that make Chicago great, for all the things that make us proud to call ourselves Chicagoans, the violence that is happening corrodes our core. It is not the Chicago we know, and it is not the Chicago we love." While the number of shooting victims so far this year have surpassed 2015, it’s important to note that they do not represent homicides, experts told us. (However, the Tribune’s count of 550 homicides so far in 2016 also outnumbers the 2015 tally of 492 homicides.) "The word ‘shooting’ does not distinguish based on severity of the wound or the type of crime," said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. Shooting statistics also include people who shot themselves by mistake. A shooting is simply a gun being fired, not someone being shot or killed, said Dewey Cornell, director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia. The city’s numbers are striking, but Cornell said violent crime in Chicago is much lower than it was 20 years ago, mirroring the national trend. When you have a flare-up in gang warfare in any community, there will be large increases in gun homicides, and Chicago has for more than a century had a gang problem that is much greater than other cities like New York, Cornell said. "There has been an increase in gun violence in Chicago in recent years, but Chicago does not represent the U.S. and is atypical of other large cities, so it does not make sense to use Chicago as an example to understand crime in the U.S.," Cornell added. A plausible explanation for the rise in shootings in Chicago is that gangs have been displaced from their former turf by the demolition of some housing projects, said George A. Mocsary, an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University School of Law. "Violence has ensued as the displaced gang members try to move into new territory claimed by other gangs," Mocsary said. Our ruling Trump said, "In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings." There have been more than 3,000 shooting victims in Chicago so far this year, according to media reports and gun violence experts. The count of shootings includes all types of shootings, including shootings of more than one person and on accident, and it should not be taken as a substitute for "homicides."

pomt-07227	"Gerry Connolly and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/02/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-gerry-connolly-maxed-out-us-debt/	Uncle Sam is sitting on a $14.3 trillion credit card bill, better known as the federal debt. Republicans and Democrats are squabbling about which party is to blame for the epic spending spree. The argument is part of a debate over how much -- or whether -- to raise the federal debt ceiling. The U.S. has hit its borrowing limit and the Treasury Department says the country could default on its loan payments if the limit is not raised by Aug. 2. The National Republican Congressional Committee pins the blame for the mess on Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents a Northern Virginia district, and his Democratic colleagues. He is among 60 House Democrats being targeted with similar attacks by the NRCC, which works to elect Republicans to the chamber. "Gerry Connolly and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out," the NRCC said in a May 18 email and press release. Was it really Connolly -- or even all the House Democrats -- who maxed out America’s credit card? Let’s take a look. Connolly took office on Jan. 3, 2009 and narrowly won re-election in 2010. On the day he entered Congress, total federal debt stood at $10.63 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. On May 31 the debt stood at $14.34 trillion. That’s an increase of $3.72 trillion, or 35 percent, since Connolly became a Congressman. So right away it’s apparent Connolly himself couldn’t have maxed out the credit card. He simply hasn’t been around long enough to do so. How did the nation pile up so much debt? You might remember tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush during happier budget times -- tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say these were needed to give the economy a kick, they also meant less money came in from tax revenue. Before the most recent extension, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits. Some will argue that tax cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth, but PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office last year said extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits. Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. Those began during the Bush years and continue under Obama. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that just two policies dating from the Bush Administration — tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — accounted for more than $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 "and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs." What do conservative economists say? Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio asked Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, what he thought of the CBPP analysis. He was blunt. "Basically, their analysis fails basic statistics," he said in an email. Riedl referred us to his own blog, in which he wrote, "Imagine a basketball team that loses 100-98. It would make no sense to cherry-pick one single basket by their opponent and blame it for 100 percent of the loss – letting all other baskets scored off the hook. Yet that is essentially what CBPP is doing." Riedl’s broader point is that "one could cherry-pick" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire problem. "CBPP chose to pick the tax cuts, wars, stimulus/bailouts, and economic downturn to equal the sum of the deficit. One could have just as easily singled out Social Security and Medicaid (combined cost: $13 trillion), Medicare and net interest costs ($13 trillion), or discretionary spending ($15 trillion) for blame. There is no mathematical reason to single out the programs CBPP selected while ignoring the other costs." Where does this leave us? Each side is cherry-picking the numbers. The liberal think tank puts nearly all the blame on the wars, the tax cuts and the recession and its associated costs. The conservative think tank says the blame base is larger and involves entitlements as well as discretionary spending. DNCC spokeswoman Haley Morris cited a 2009 PolitiFact item that noted that when Bush took office in 2001, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left eight years later, it was $10.7 trillion. "Pretty hard for GOP to argue about maxing out (the) credit card," she said. Let’s review. Yes, the nation’s debt has gone up rapidly during the two and a half years Gerry Connolly has been in office. Liberal economists blamed the big deficits on wars and tax cuts that were started under Bush, a Republican, but continued by Obama, a Democrat. Connolly supported the stimulus bill in 2009 and the tax cut extension in December 2010, and he has backed other measures that added to the federal deficit. But two-thirds of the federal deficit already existed when Connolly came into office. Why should he be held responsible for that? Going one step further, why should Democrats take the full hit? Republicans deserve blame here as well. The nation’s current financial situation is a rare bipartisan feat. At the same time, 35 percent of the nation’s debt has come during Connolly’s two-and-a-half years in Congress. We rate the NRCC’s attack Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00839	Under New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, homicides are up by 20 percent, and subway delays have soared 45 percent.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/23/greg-gutfeld/nyc-mayor-de-blasio-responsible-uptick-murders-and/	Fox News host Greg Gutfeld is no fan of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and he laid bare his complaints in a personal commentary. "Unless you’re a well off liberal, it’s been a bad year for New York City," Gutfeld said on March 10, 2015. "Shootings are way up, homicides too by 20 percent. Subway delays have soared by 45 percent." "Is it any coincidence this is happening under the most progressive leader since Marx?" Gutfeld continued, "If he were a Republican with these stats, he'd be hog-tied, bobbing in the Hudson." We’ll take Gutfeld’s factual assertions about murders and subway waits in order and see how well they fit the data. Fox News sent us items from the New York Post that backed up Gutfeld. A March editorial noted that "homicides are up 20 percent in New York the first two months of this year over the same period in 2014." That is in line with New York Police Department statistics. As of March 8, 2015, there had been 59 murders, compared to 48 by the same time last year. But Candace McCoy, a criminologist at the City University of New York, urged a bit of caution in drawing conclusions too quickly. "Two months is not a trend," McCoy said. The danger of jumping on the latest figures is that the numbers can bounce around. Back in February, the city set a new record of 10 days without a single homicide but no one was ready to say that the Big Apple had cured itself of murder. McCoy also noted that in 2014, the city had the lowest number of slayings since 1963 -- just 333. That was de Blasio’s first year in office. "We can definitely say that homicides are not up 20 percent since de Blasio took office," McCoy said. "In fact, the trend is the opposite." If Gutfeld wanted to look at 2-month snapshot, it’s instructive to see what happened in 2013. By early March that year there had been 58 deaths, or just one less than in the same period in 2015. But having 58 or 59 deaths by March doesn’t necessarily translate into high numbers overall for the entire year. In 2013, the year closed out with just two more murders than in the record low year of 2014. So the number of murders by March doesn’t tell you much about how the entire year will turn out. Even the editorial that Fox News cited as a source was more restrained. "We’re reluctant to draw big conclusions from such limited data," the New York Post said. Subway blues Gutfeld said that delays for subway riders have shot up 45 percent. The New York Post reported that the average number of delays each month rose from about 29,000 in 2013 to over 43,000 in 2014. We went to the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s monthly reports for its Transit and Bus Committee, and there’s no problem with the numbers. The average number of delays is up, as Gutfeld said. We note that there are other ways to measure how well the system is running, such as looking at how often the trains run on-time. That also is worse compared with 2013, but not as dramatically -- just about 8 percent. John Raskin is executive director of Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for the people who rely on the city’s buses and trains. Raskin agreed that performance has dropped. He said it’s due to equipment breakdowns, repair work left over from Hurricane Sandy, and chronic underinvestment by New York state. But Raskin’s overarching point is that it makes no sense to blame de Blasio for the decline. "The subway system runs as an independent authority that reports to the state," Raskin said. "Someone connecting subway delays with the change in administration is showing they don’t understand how the transit system runs and is misleading people." While it might sound odd that the transit system of New York City isn’t controlled by the city, in fact the governor nominates the 17 members of the board that governs the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the state Senate confirms them. The mayor recommends four people for that board. One could argue that the city is free to put more money into the Metropolitan Transit Authority. The municipal budget contributes about $100 million each year, and one advocacy group, the NYPIRG Straphangers Campaign, wants that to rise to $125 million saying "the city should do better by the riding public." But the senior attorney for NYPIRG (New York Public Interest Research Group) Gene Russianoff told PunditFact that despite that stand, he puts real responsibility at the feet of the governor and the state Legislature. Our ruling Gutfeld faulted the performance of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and noted that murders are up 20 percent and subway delays are up 45 percent. Gutfeld’s numbers are correct, but he commits extreme cherry picking with the murder statistic. A full year assessment of de Blasio’s administration would show that the murder rate is holding about steady compared to the year before he took office. As for the increased suffering of subway riders, it is real, but a large portion of that falls outside of de Blasio’s direct control. The state wields final authority over the trains. While de Blasio could press to add more city funds, he doesn’t control the budget and his representatives represent less than a quarter of the votes on the MTA board. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

mpws-00010	During a state House debate on a jobs and energy bill this week, Democrats offered an amendment that would put the Legislature on record saying that climate change is real and that humans are causing it. Late in the debate, House Minority Leader Paul Thissen, DFL-Minneapolis, quizzed a number of Republican representatives on their views on climate change. Among them was Rep. Glen Gruenhagen, R-Glencoe, who has said in the past that he’s skeptical climate change is real. Thissen asked him if he thinks climate change is caused by human activity. “I believe there are eminently qualified scientists who would disagree [that climate change is caused by human activity], and I agree with those scientists,” Gruenhagen said. Gruenhagen has a right to his opinion, but his comments – and comments made by other Legislators during the debate – suggest the scientific community is divided on the topic. 	false	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/04/poligraph-gruenhagen-climate-claim-doesnt-hold-up/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Gruenhagen climate claim doesn’t hold up	April 24, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-01625	Wisconsin is "dead last in income growth" among midwestern states during Gov. Scott Walker’s term.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/28/blog-posting/bloggers-say-wisconsin-ranks-last-income-growth-/	In the heat of a political campaign, no advantage gained by one side goes unnoticed by the other. We saw that again after rating True a very narrow and specific claim by Gov. Scott Walker that Wisconsin leads 11 other Midwestern states in personal income growth over the one-year period that ended with the first quarter of 2014. Shortly after Walker blasted out that news, readers and Internet bloggers were contending the picture is not nearly so bright if more of Walker’s tenure is considered. "What if you examine the entire span of of the Walker administration?" reader and frequent commenter Jim Spice asked in a comment Aug. 14, 2014, on JSOnline.com and on Facebook. His conclusion: "I downloaded the data set from the BEA web site, and ran the numbers using 2010 Q4 as the starting point, and HEY, what do you know?! WI ranks DEAD LAST in income growth among those 12 states!" Others made similar claims, including a blogger on the liberal Daily Kos site. Are they right? Digging into the numbers We started with data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, the same source Walker used. The data counts wages, property income and government assistance as "personal income." We crunched the numbers using that starting point at the end of 2010, the last quarter before Walker took over from Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. The end point was the first quarter 2014, the latest for which data was available. First, there is no "Midwest" category in the agency’s geographical breakdowns. Two of the regions the agency uses include states often associated as Midwestern peers for the Badger State. One is the "Great Lakes" region (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). The other is the "Plains" region: (Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota). Here's what we found: State Personal Income growth since 4th quarter 2010 Rank among 50 states North Dakota 32.81% 1 Iowa 15.70% 10 Nebraska 15.23% 11 South Dakota 13.53% 18 Ohio 13.42% 19 Kansas 12.61% 31 Indiana 12.48% 33 Minnesota 12.29% 34 Michigan 12.01% 37 Illinois 11.73% 39 Missouri 10.91% 43 Wisconsin 10.87% 44 By comparison, in Doyle’s last term, which coincided with the Great Recession, Wisconsin ranked 7th of the 12 states and ranked 26th nationally, one point above the U.S. average. When we asked the Bureau of Economic Analysis if the 2010 starting point makes sense for judging 2011 and forward, spokesman Thomas Dail said it was correct to use the fourth quarter of 2010 as the baseline. That allows a comparison of the pre-Walker income level to Walker’s first full year in office, 2011 and forward, he said. We asked three experts to examine the BEA figures. They were Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management; Laura Dresser, a labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy; and Dale Knapp, research director at Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. All three cautioned that comparing quarters can lead to distortions -- and we noted that the last quarter before Walker saw an unusually large jump in personal income. That was due in part to an early shift in Medicaid payments to that quarter, the Walker campaign correctly points out. The statistical effect is a bigger starting point for Walker, meaning any gains on his watch look smaller than they would otherwise. Another defensible starting point is the first quarter of 2011, our experts said, which takes in Walker’s first three months. But that distorts in the other direction because the Medicaid payments -- having been shifted earlier -- look much lower. Using that baseline, Wisconsin’s growth was second-best in the Midwest. The Walker campaign doesn’t argue for using the 2011 base. They, and our experts, prefer to look at annual growth rates which smooth out the volatility you see in quarterly data. From 2010 to 2013, we found Wisconsin ranked 9th of the 12 Midwest states. To be sure, anomalies pop up in the numbers once in a while due to governmental policies. In his claim of "We’re #1," Walker reached back one year from the latest quarter to a quarter that saw the biggest single-quarter loss in personal income in three years. That of course made the state look better in the comparison he chose. The loss was partly due to Washington’s "fiscal-cliff legislation," which served to artificially boost incomes in late 2012, thereby depressing personal income in the quarter that was Walker’s one-year base. And partisans pick the presentation that best makes their case -- in this case, both Walker and his critics chose to compare quarterly figures rather than annual rates. Walker could have chosen an annual comparison -- 2012 to 2013, which is the most recent for which a full calendar year is available. But by that measure Wisconsin is middle of the pack on growth. There’s no one right way, our experts said. "I think it is perfectly honest and accurate to say income grew 10.9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2014," Jacobsen said, referring to the comparison that shows Wisconsin last in the Midwest. Our rating After Walker correctly pointed out that personal income growth is the best in the Midwest for the last year, commentators alleged that Wisconsin is "dead last in income growth" during Gov. Scott Walker’s three-plus years in office. The quarterly figures do put Wisconsin at the bottom, based on the starting point endorsed by the agency that compiled the information. Reader beware: Any such quarterly comparison has its flaws, as we’ve seen in these related claims. But by the numbers, the blogosphere’s claim is on target. We rate it True.

pomt-15205	"A minor cannot get a tattoo without parental consent but can get an abortion without parental consent."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-minor-can-get-abortion-not-tattoo/	Teenagers getting inked is apparently subject to greater parental say than getting an abortion, according to U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. In an Aug. 4 interview with Southern Baptist Convention President Russell Moore, Rubio joined other Republicans in criticizing Planned Parenthood amid the release of videos by an anti-abortion group that accuse the group of harvesting fetal tissue for profit. A day earlier, Florida’s Republican senator had been among those who voted to defund Planned Parenthood, a measure that failed to get the required 60 votes to advance. In his interview, Rubio raised concerns about nationwide access to abortions for minors: "The idea that a minor can go get a tattoo," he said, before quickly correcting himself to say "cannot get a tattoo without parental consent -- but can get an abortion without parental consent -- is just mind-shattering for the vast majority of Americans. ... People who believe that a young child, a minor, should be able to get an abortion easier than a tattoo -- they are the extremists." We decided to check whether minors need their parents’ permission to get a tattoo, but don’t need permission to get an abortion. Parental consent laws First, the laws about parental consent for abortion and tattoos vary from state to state, so it’s not possible to make a blanket statement as Rubio did and apply it to the whole country. According to data through March 2015 compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 45 states have laws prohibiting minors from getting tattoos, with the majority of those states allowing it if there’s parental consent. For example, Florida law requires written, notarized consent of a minor's parent or legal guardian in order to tattoo a minor. Now let’s look at whether minors need their parents’ permission to obtain an abortion. There are two different categories of parental involvement: one is consent, which means a parent has to sign off on the abortion, while the other one is simply notification which can mean the parent receives a letter or a phone call about the abortion. According to Guttmacher Institute, a group that tracks abortion policy and statistics, a majority of states require consent and/or notification. In 38 states, minors either have to get consent and/or notify their parents, while in 12 states they don’t need either. We asked Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, which states require parental consent for a tattoo but not for an abortion. Using information from Planned Parenthood about abortion laws and the National Conference of State Legislatures about tattoo laws, Conant pointed to seven states: State Abortion law for minors Tattoo law for minors California No parental involvement required It is a misdemeanor to tattoo anyone under age 18. Connecticut No parental involvement required Requires permission of parent or guardian. Hawaii No parental involvement required Requires written consent of parent or guardian Maine No parental involvement required It is illegal to tattoo anyone under age 18. Montana No parental involvement required Requires explicit in-person consent of the child's parent or guardian. New York No parental involvement required It is unlawful to tattoo the body of a child less than 18 years old. Vermont No parental involvement required Requires written consent of his or her parent or guardian. Sources: Planned Parenthood and the National Conference of State Legislatures Conant included two states that flat-out ban tattoos for minors: California and Maine. So that leaves five states that require parental consent for tattoos but have no parental involvement required for abortions. However, Rubio used the more narrow term of "parental consent" in his interview -- not "parental involvement" or "notification." There are some states that require only parental notification for abortion but do require consent for tattoos -- for example Florida. So that means that a Florida teenager doesn’t need her parents’ permission to get an abortion -- but does for a tattoo. State Abortion law Tattoo law Colorado Parental notification only Requires express consent from the minor's parent or guardian. Delaware Parental notification only Requires prior written consent of the adult parent or legal guardian. Florida Parental notification only Requires written, notarized consent of a minor's parent or legal guardian in order to tattoo a minor. Minnesota Parental notification only Requires written parental consent. South Dakota Parental notification only Requires signed consent form from the minor's parents West Virginia Parental notification only Requires prior written consent from a parent or guardian Source: Guttmacher Institute and National Conference of State Legislatures So in all, Rubio has a point for about 11 states. Complicating matters is that there is a way to avoid parental involvement. Since the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states may not give parents an absolute veto over whether their daughters have an abortion, 37 states that require parental involvement include a "judicial bypass" procedure. This allows a minor to receive court approval for an abortion without her parents’ knowledge or consent. Use of judicial bypass could increase the number of states where Rubio’s scenario would be valid. A spokeswoman for Americans United for Life, told PolitiFact that "even in states with the most stringent parental consent requirements, a minor who can demonstrate (with the assistance of free counsel) to a court that she is either mature enough to make an abortion decision, or that obtaining parental consent is not in her best interest, can bypass the parental consent requirement." However, it’s worth noting that, despite the existence of judicial bypass, a majority of pregnant minors who seek abortion report that their parents are aware that they are doing so, according to a literature review by Guttmacher in 2009. Helena Silverstein, a government and law professor at Lafayette College who wrote a book in 2007: "Girls on the Stand: How Courts Fail Pregnant Minors," suggested that rather than compare parental consent for tattoos to abortion, it is more useful to compare other minors’ consent law as they relate to sexual and reproductive health. All states allow minors to consent to get treatment for sexually transmitted infections while 32 states allow minors to consent to prenatal care without their parents’ permission. J. Shoshanna Ehrlich, an expert on reproductive rights at the University of Massachusetts, was also skeptical of Rubio’s comparison. While it "must suck to be 16 and wait until you are 18 to get a tattoo, you can postpone the decision," unlike abortion, she said. Our ruling Rubio said "a minor cannot get a tattoo without parental consent but can get an abortion without parental consent." Rubio has a good argument for about 11 states, but that’s a minority. More commonly, parents by law need to be at least notified -- and in many cases give their consent -- for a minor to have an abortion. There is a significant exception, however: 37 states allow a minor to go through a judge without notifying parents. As for tattoos, most states either ban them for minors or require parental consent. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-08-13T11:01:05	2015-08-04	['None']
pomt-12359	Says an Internet meme shows people rejoicing over the Paris agreement.	false	/florida/statements/2017/jun/07/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-facebook-meme-climate-accord-uses-unre/	It’s clear that Sarah Palin hates the Paris climate agreement. What’s unclear is why she used a photo of Florida lawmakers to make her point in a Facebook meme. "Don’t be fooled! The Paris climate accord is a scam," stated the headline at the top of Palin’s Facebook post June 6, 2017. (By June 7, the Facebook meme was no longer available but PolitiFact had taken a screenshot of her post, which had been shared at least 8,000 times.) Beneath the headline is a photo of an unidentified group of mostly men cheering. The Facebook post doesn’t identify the people in the photo, but they are Florida House members at the state Capitol in Tallahassee. Beneath the photo Palin shared is text that says: "They pretend it’s about fixing our environment ... But it’s really about stealing billions from the American people and giving it to foreign countries, governments and lobbyists!" The Facebook meme, posted after President Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement, could leave the impression that the people in the photo are rejoicing over using the agreement to steal billions from Americans. That's not the case. PolitiFact fact-checked Palin’s photo as part of our effort to debunk fake news on Facebook. Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, were unsuccessful. (Palin’s post was previously debunked by other news outlets including the Miami Herald, a partner along with the Tampa Bay Times in PolitiFact Florida, and Politico.) Real origin of the photo: Florida The photo is actually from the 2011 Florida legislative session. We interviewed four of the Republican politicians in the photo: state Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, and former House members Will Weatherford, a former speaker from Wesley Chapel; Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary, and Rachel Burgin of Riverview. We also interviewed a Democrat in the photo: Jeff Clemens, now a state senator of Lake Worth. Not all of the legislators recalled the particulars of the photo, but all of them said that their cheers had nothing to do with the Paris climate accord -- which was signed years later -- or about climate change. Plakon directed us to search the Florida House website to show the real reason behind the cheering. The website showed that the photo was taken by House photographer Mark Foley. The cutline states: "From the left, Speaker-designate Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, signaled that session was coming to a close as members celebrate on the House floor, May 7, 2011." Plakon recalled some late night (which led to early morning) back-and-forth maneuvering between the House and the Senate in the final hours of that session. "It was a famous night," Plakon said. The final hours of the 2011 legislative session on Saturday, May 7, were chaotic, according to a Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times timeline. As the hours stretched on, lawmakers played songs such as "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help" by the Beatles and "The Final Countdown" on the public speaker. At 11:30 p.m. after the House unanimously rejected a Senate bill related to rules for the state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the chamber erupted into cheers and shouts of, "It’s us versus the Senate." At 1 a.m., senators went home. At 2 a.m., the House passed a bill that included tax cuts and adjourned as Handel's Hallelujah chorus played on the public address system. Minutes later the senators had to return -- looking tired. One member came in wearing no shoes, another with no socks and a third in jeans and a T-shirt. The session finally ended at 3:35 a.m. We were unable to confirm by deadline with House officials exactly what time Foley’s photo was taken during the conclusion of the session. But some of the members recalled the image from the conclusion of the session. "We were all clapping because it was finally finished," Burgin said. She described the situation as "humorous" but said it was a bad choice for Palin to use a 2011 photo of the Florida House for a post about the 2015 climate accord. "It's kind of bad taste to label Florida legislators as being involved in that, especially in 2011," she said. "Everybody and their brother has been tagging me since it published, it’s kind of funny." Many of the legislators got a chuckle about the use of the photo in Palin’s meme. Plakon, a publisher of a website used by insurance claims professionals, quipped, "As a publisher I object to the use of low-resolution graphics." For the record, Burgin said she has no opinion on the climate accord. Weatherford declined to express his opinion. Plakon called the accord a "bad deal" and sided with Trump’s position. Dorworth, who lost an election in 2012, said he didn’t support the Paris accord. "Most of the persons in that picture probably would not have supported the Paris climate accord either," he said. Clemens, the Democrat, was the only lawmaker we interviewed who told us he supports the climate accord. "Of course I support the world coming together to solve serious problems. Who wouldn’t?" Our ruling Palin posted a viral image that purportedly shows a group of people clapping as a result of the Paris agreement, presumably about the billions they will earn. Except, it’s not that at all. The photo is of Florida lawmakers elated at the long-awaited close of the 2011 legislative session. The text and photo pairing is inaccurate. We rate it False.

pomt-02574	Nearly 90% of Travis County government races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/30/wayne-thorburn/only-3-republicans-19-travis-county-races/	If you think most of Travis County’s next batch of elected leaders will be chosen in November, you’re wrong, according to Wayne Thorburn. The Austinite, a former director of the Republican Party of Texas whose book "Red State: An Insider’s Story of How the GOP Came to Dominate Texas Politics" comes out this spring, wrote in a Jan. 8, 2014, opinion column for the Austin American-Statesman: "There are 27 county government offices up for election in 2014. Of these, only three have the potential of being settled in the November election. ... Nearly 90 percent of all county races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary" on March 4, 2014. Travis County’s pretty blue, as Thorburn noted and as PolitiFact Texas explored in a recent fact-check of U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett’s claim that its surrounding counties are red (True). Is it so blue that most of the county’s votes cast in the Nov. 4 election won’t really decide anything? By email, Thorburn pointed us to the state elections website and said, "Please realize that I did not say 90 percent of all races that will appear on the November ballot in Travis County (which would include state, multi-county district, and state legislative positions). What I specifically said is county offices, including county judge, commissioners from precincts 2 and 4, several justices of the peace, and several county court at law positions." The only assumption he made, Thorburn said, is that no Libertarian or Green Party candidates will win. "The secretary of state's web site does not include any Libertarian or Green Party candidates who may be nominated by a convention, rather than a primary," he said. County elections official Michelle Parker guided us by phone to a breakdown of races on the county’s election website. Next, from the state secretary’s elections web page of candidates who filed for the primary by the Dec. 9, 2013 deadline, we pulled the Travis County names. After setting aside the candidates for Congress, governor and other federal or state offices, we came up with 32 candidates running in 19 races and only three Republicans in the lot. District Judge 201st District Court Amy Clark Meachum DEM District Judge 250th District Court Karin Crump DEM District Judge 419th District Court Orlinda Naranjo DEM County Judge Andy Brown DEM County Judge Sarah Eckhardt DEM County Judge Mike McNamara REP County Court At Law Judge #1 Todd Wong DEM County Court At Law Judge #2 Eric Montgomery Shepperd DEM County Court At Law Judge #3 John Lipscombe DEM County Court At Law Judge #3 Paul Evans DEM County Court At Law Judge #4 Mike Denton DEM County Court At Law Judge #5 Nancy Hohengarten DEM County Court At Law Judge #6 Brandy Mueller DEM County Court At Law Judge #7 Elisabeth Earle DEM County Probate Court Judge Guy Herman DEM District Clerk Velva L. Price DEM County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir DEM County Treasurer Dolores Ortega Carter DEM County Treasurer Ramey Ko DEM County Commissioner Precinct 2 Raymond Frank REP County Commissioner Precinct 2 Brigid Shea DEM County Commissioner Precinct 2 Garry Brown DEM County Commissioner Precinct 2 Richard Jung DEM County Commissioner Precinct 4 Darla Wegner DEM County Commissioner Precinct 4 Margaret J. Gomez DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 1 Yvonne M. Williams DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 2 Randall Slagle DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 2 Glenn Bass REP Justice of the Peace Precinct 3 Susan Steeg DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 4 Raul Arturo Gonzalez DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 5 Herb Evans DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 5 James Braxton Forrest DEM After we inquired, Thorburn said he had miscounted the number of races, and now tallied 19. "The percentages are still valid if 84.2 percent is acceptable as "nearly 90 percent,’ " he said. Travis County Republican Party spokesman Andy Hogue confirmed by email that three Republicans are running for three Travis County offices, though he pointed out that more are bidding for offices Thorburn did not include: state House districts 47 and 50, both within the county’s boundaries. Most Travis County candidates are, so far, unopposed, so that unless a Green or Libertarian files, Democrats are set to claim 12 offices without having to campaign for them. Four more races will be settled in the Democratic primary in March (unless a Green, independent or Libertarian files) because they feature two Democrats facing off: county treasurer; county commissioner Precinct 4; county court at law judge No. 3; and justice of the peace Precinct 5. The three races with a Republican contender: county judge, Precinct 2 county commissioner and Precinct 2 justice of the peace. Our ruling Thorburn said "nearly 90 percent" of the Travis County government races this year will be settled by the March Democratic primary, thanks to the paucity of Republicans who filed to run. His declared count was too high. Still, 16 out of 19 races for county office lack a Republican candidate, which suggests that 84 percent of the positions will be all but settled once the primaries are over.

pomt-03854	Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/13/donzella-james/gun-law-claim-goes-awry/	PolitiFact Georgia is usually interested when an elected official claims the Peach State is first or worst in a particular category. State Sen. Donzella James, a Democrat who represents portions of Douglas and Fulton counties, had us listening closely when she made a specific statement about guns and Georgia. The lawmakers were discussing Senate Bill 101, which would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they’ve completed basic military training, as long as the person has not been dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless required by federal law or regulation. Senate Bill 101 passed by a 41-10 margin and is now in the hands of the House of Representatives. James had serious concerns about the bill and went into the well to speak in front of her colleagues. "We know that Georgia has the most lax laws (for) carrying guns," said James, a self-described gun owner, who prefaced her remarks by saying she hadn’t planned to speak. James was referring to Georgia’s gun laws in general, not just permits to carry firearms. We wondered: Does Georgia have the most lax gun laws in America? Some gun control organizations regularly rank each state based on its gun laws. The most prominent group, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, gave Georgia an 8 on a scale of 100 in terms of the toughness of its gun laws in 2011. Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Senate Democrats, sent us a link to that report. To clarify, 8 is not considered a good score as far as gun control advocates are concerned. Georgia received points for not allowing guns on college campuses, requiring a license, record-keeping and retention and police inspections. For those who are distressed by Georgia’s score, take comfort. Twenty-seven states received lower scores than Georgia that year. Alaska, Arizona and Utah received not one point. In 2009, the Brady Campaign also gave Georgia a score of 8. There were nearly 20 states that received a lower score. The National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action has been unimpressed with the Brady rankings. It notes only a handful of states receive passing marks from Brady and say states that score high have higher crime rates. The NRA complains the Brady Campaign gives points to states with gun laws that supplement federal gun laws. Another group, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, gave Georgia a D for the toughness of its gun control laws. Again, many states did far worse. Twenty states received a grade of F from the group. The center gives best practices for policies such as laws prohibiting gun dealers from residential areas, laws requiring a license to purchase ammunition and those that require gun safety training. UCLA Law School professor Eugene Volokh, who has been writing and teaching about U.S. gun laws for several years, says it is difficult to completely determine which states have the most lax gun laws because there are so many ways to examine the claim. For example, he said, it can be examined by the types of weapons permitted in each state. Some criteria he prefers are examining how easy it is to carry a concealed gun or at what age you can get a permit. Four states -- Alaska, Arizona, Vermont and Wyoming -- allow law-abiding adults to carry a concealed firearm without a permit, The Washington Post noted. The Post also reported that Vermont allows people as young as 16 to buy a handgun. Georgia laws are not as permissive, Volokh observed. "Georgia is not the most gun-friendly state in the nation, but probably not the most hostile, either," Volokh said. So where does this all leave us? The senator said, "We know that Georgia has the most lax laws (for) carrying guns." From our review, Georgia is considered to have some lax gun laws. It’s possible from some of the changes proposed, Georgia could score lower in the future. But, for now, there are other states that are far more permissive. We rate James’ claim False.

pomt-15312	"In a few months, this deal would give Iran $150 billion" for its $300 billion to $400 billion economy, which is "like $8 trillion flowing into the United States treasury."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/17/ron-dermer/israeli-ambassador-uses-odd-logic-relate-irans-fro/	While President Barack Obama has hammered the point that the sole goal of the nuclear accord with Iran was to prevent it from building a bomb, many of America’s allies in the region are at least as concerned about a more immediate threat. They fear that an economic revival in Iran would allow it to build its military and boost its funding of proxy fighters who oppose Israel and key Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia. Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, raised that issue July 13, 2015, at a major gathering in Washington of Christians United for Israel, an evangelical group. "That deal will not bring peace closer. It will bring war closer — making conventional war more likely today and the horrors of nuclear terrorism more likely tomorrow," Dermer said. He posted the speech on his Facebook page. A short bit later, Dermer talked about the impact of unfreezing Iranian assets. "The promise of phased sanctions relief looks more like a one-time jackpot for the Ayatollah regime," he said. "In a few months, this deal would give Iran $150 billion. Iran has a $300 (billion) to $400 billion economy. A $150 billion infusion of cash into Iran’s coffers is like $8 trillion flowing into the United States treasury." Dermer did not say where he got his numbers or elaborate on his analogy. We asked the Embassy of Israel in Washington to clarify Dermer’s statement but did not hear back. Absent hearing from the source, we assume that the underlying math runs as follows: $150 billion is half of $300 billion (the low end of Dermer’s estimate of Iran’s GDP). The U.S. economy is over $16 trillion ($18.1 billion in 2015), so half of that gives you the $8 trillion Dermer cited. The reality of the deal's effect is much more complicated than Dermer's math lets on. And though there are issues with his numbers, the fundamental flaw is his logic. He treats GDP, which is the sum of all goods and services generated by a nation’s economy, as if it were the same as the government’s bank account. This is sort of like saying your yearly income is the same as your checking account. Most Americans would like that to be true, but it isn’t. The two are completely different, and so are GDP and national treasuries. So even though it would be fair to note that Iran’s state-owned oil company accounts for a huge chunk of the country’s economy, Iran's access to that money is not like the U.S. treasury getting an infusion of $8 trillion. A government and its economy are not one and the same. Dermer would have been on slightly firmer ground if he had said unfreezing Iran's assets would be like injecting $8 trillion into Iran's economy. But he didn't, and the analytic issues don't stop there. There’s also a problem with the numbers Dermer used. There are different ways to estimate Iran’s GDP, but according to the World Bank, Iran’s economy is $415 billion. If we re-do Dermer’s math, that would mean the equivalent impact in the United States — regardless of Dermer’s troubled metaphor — would be about 30 percent lower than he said. It’s also likely that Dermer inflated the size of Iran’s assets that were frozen under sanctions. The U.S. Treasury Department estimates the value of Iran’s foreign currency reserves at $100 billion. An article in Foreign Policy magazine cited $120 billion. We don’t know where Dermer got $150 billion. The Institute of International Finance, a trade association representing banks, insurance companies and other financial entities worldwide, ran its own numbers and settled on $100 billion. Garbis Iradian is the association’s chief economist for Africa and the Middle East. Iradian told us that the money in those overseas accounts does belong to the government of Iran and about two-thirds of it comes from oil sales. Sanctions imposed in 2012 forbid the repatriation of those dollars to Iran. If the deal goes into effect, there will be a delay of at least a few months before Iran’s accounts are unfrozen. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify that Iran is doing what it promised. That certification is being called "Implementation Day," and when that happens, Iran will gain access to its foreign reserves. Does that mean that all of the money will go back to Iran in a great rush? No one knows for sure. Michael Malloy is a law professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento and the author of The Structure of Economic Sanctions to be published next spring by Cambridge University Press. Malloy said the funds smooth the process when Iran needs to buy things on the international market. The hard currency is in place to transfer to the foreign seller. "The Iranians will need those facilities," Malloy said. "Those account relationships will continue and a lot of that money will stay." Iradian said that in theory, Iran could decide to bring all the money home, but he too suspects that is unlikely. While Tehran might tap $10 billion or even $20 billion, Iradian said the money is a hedge against shifts in the international market, especially the price of oil. (A quick term of art: A country’s current account is the balance between money going out for imports, and the money coming in from exports.) "If oil prices drop below $50 a barrel, then the current account of the country will be negative," Iradian said. "How will they finance the gap? They will tap their official reserves." Iradian described the Iranian central bank managers as prudent. "The official reserve is a fall back position," he said. "It’s like you keeping money in your checking account in case you lose your job. For Iran, it has security for whenever it has difficulty meeting its foreign exchange needs." Iradian has written that the lifting of sanctions, of which unfreezing Iranian bank accounts is a part, will provide a major boost to the Iranian economy. Again, the effects on the economy are different from the money in Iran's treasury. Our ruling Dermer said that for an economy the size of Iran, unfreezing $150 billion of Iranian assets would be like pumping $8 trillion into the U.S. treasury. There are several problems with this claim. It exaggerates the value of Iran’s frozen assets, underestimates the size of the Iranian economy, and confuses the concepts of a country’s economy and the money in its treasury. While Iran would gain access to foreign currency reserves worth about $100 billion, it is far from certain that the money would go directly into government spending. On the other hand, an amount of money on that scale would have a significant impact on the nation’s finances. The numbers are off and the logic is flawed, but this statement has an element of accuracy. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13717	Independent analysts "found that Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-donald-trumps-plan-would-add-30-tri/	Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., criticized Donald Trump’s fiscal proposals during his debut convention speech as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Independent analysts, Kaine said, "found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt." We’ll take a look at this statement in two parts. Trump ‘would rack up $30 trillion in debt’ As we have previously reported, this figure originated in an analysis from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that, among other things, regularly analyzes the broader economic effects of presidential candidates’ tax proposals. In its report, the center found that "including interest costs, the proposal would add $11.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $34.1 trillion by 2036." This estimate assumes no major spending cuts would be made, which tracks with the historical pattern, the authors said. The Clinton campaign also noted that Trump has not specified any cuts to offset his plan. So Kaine has a point that the $30 trillion-plus figure has been used by an independent organization. Still, it’s worth noting a couple caveats. • That analysis uses a 20-year time frame. When groups like the Tax Policy Center analyze the budgetary impact of policy proposals, they typically use a fixed "window" of time to measure the effects. Usually, it’s a 10-year window. In this case, the center offered both a 10-year window and a somewhat more unconventional 20-year window. Over 10 years, the center projected, Trump’s policies would increase the debt by $11.2 trillion. Over 20 years, they would increase the debt by $34.1 trillion. So Kaine, like Clinton before him, cherry-picked the biggest number for his talking point — a figure that was three times as big, and which used an unconventional window of time. • Kaine overlooked a study with a smaller projected debt increase. Another study of Trump’s policies, by the economic forecasting firm Moody’s, offered three scenarios, depending on whether one takes Trump’s policy proposals at face value, whether he enacts them with some compromises, or whether he ends up unable to enact much of his agenda. All the scenarios look at the impact of the resulting policies over 10 years. The first scenario produces additional debt of $9.7 trillion above current policies. The second produces a debt increase of $6.9 trillion above current policies. And the last produces a debt increase of less than $1 trillion above current policies. That final scenario is about 3 percent of the amount Kaine cited in the speech. ‘Given to the wealthy and big corporations’ The benefits of Trump’s plan skew toward the top of the income heap, independent experts have concluded. As we have noted, Trump’s proposal would consolidate the existing seven income brackets (with rates from 10 to 39.6 percent) into three with rates at 10, 20 and 25 percent. He would also increase the standard deduction from $6,300 to $25,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $50,000 for joint filers and phase out most itemized deductions, except for charitable giving and mortgage interest. And he would eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, the Affordable Care Act taxes, and the marriage penalty. Meanwhile, Trump’s reforms to the corporate tax code would collapse the eight tax brackets ranging from 15 to 35 percent into a flat rate of 15 percent and to tax the foreign income of U.S. companies abroad. While virtually everyone would pay less under the Trump plan, it offers particularly big benefits to the richest taxpayers. The Tax Policy Center calculated that the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent would be $275,000, or 17.5 percent of after-tax income, and for the top 0.1 percent, they would be $1.3 million, or nearly 19 percent of after-tax income. Middle-income households, meanwhile, would get a cut of $2,700, or a 4.9 percent reduction. Those making the least would see a cut, too, but only of $128 or so, working out to roughly 1 percent of after-tax income. Our ruling Kaine said that independent analysts "found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt." Kaine is on pretty solid ground with the substance of his assertion, but he’s cherry-picked the biggest figure of several that were available.

pomt-07975	The health care law is "job killing."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/20/eric-cantor/health-care-law-job-killer-evidence-falls-short/	Poll after poll shows Americans' top concerns are the economy and jobs, which explains why Republicans have labeled the health care law as "job-killing." On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a repeal measure that Republicans formally titled the "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act." It is sponsored by House Republican leader Eric Cantor. We've read a number of critiques that say the law isn't quite the "job killer" that Republicans claim it is, so we wanted to investigate for ourselves and evaluate the evidence. The Republican leadership recently published a document titled, "Obamacare: A budget-busting, job-killing health care law," which cites several pieces of evidence for its job-killing claim: "Independent analyses have determined that the health care law will cause significant job losses for the U.S. economy: the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that the law will reduce the 'amount of labor used in the economy by … roughly half a percent...,' an estimate that adds up to roughly 650,000 jobs lost. A study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the nation's largest small business association, found that an employer mandate alone could lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs, with 66 percent of those coming from small businesses." We first turned to the Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analyses to members of Congress on how legislation will impact the federal budget and the economy as a whole. In August 2010, it published a new outlook that considered the jobs impact of the new health care law. The Republican report is right that the CBO has determined that the law will reduce "the amount of labor used in the economy," but the GOP report leaves out many important qualifiers. The CBO report actually says: "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount—roughly half a percent—primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law." Basically, the CBO is saying that some people right now are working mostly to keep their health insurance. Once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The CBO describes this as a "small segment" of the population. And, because the CBO is describing reduced hours rather than lost jobs, it never uses the 650,000 number that the Republican document cites. The Republican extrapolated that number from the CBO's estimate of one-half percent of the labor supply. Finally, we should point out that a person who voluntarily chooses to work less is not having their job "killed" by federal legislation. Now let's turn to the other piece of evidence, the study that claims that the health care law will result in 1.6 million lost jobs. That number comes from a study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. The problem with this study is that it isn't based on the law that passed. It was published on Jan. 26, 2009, before a finalized House or Senate bill had even been proposed. In the NFIB study, "Small Business Effects of a National Employer Healthcare Mandate," the authors made hypothetical assumptions based on what they thought the law might include. Specifically, the study assumed that all companies would be required to offer private health insurance to their employees, and that the employers would have to pay for at least half of the cost of the insurance premiums. "The results indicate that without major reductions in the cost of healthcare, the employer mandate would cause the economy to lose over 1.6 million jobs within the first five years of program implementation. Small firms would be most adversely affected by the mandate and account for approximately 66 percent of all jobs lost," the report said. But the report's assumptions don't match up with the final version of the health care law. The law actually exempts companies with 50 or fewer workers from any mandate, so many of the small firms "most adversely affected" in the NFIB study are not required to offer insurance. According to the study, firms with 19 or fewer jobs accounted for 467,182 of the 1.6 million job losses. Those companies would be exempt from the mandate, so the 1.6 million figure is at least inflated by 467,182. The next category was firms with 20 to 99 employees, estimated to shed 420,600 jobs as a result of a hypothetical employer mandate. Presumably a good percentage of those are companies with 50 or fewer employees, and again, are exempt from the health care law. One of the authors of the NFIB study, Michael J. Chow, acknowledged there are "material differences" between the assumptions made in the study and what actually became law. The NFIB did not produce an updated study based on the realities of what ended up in the health care law. The organization continues to oppose the health care law. "We still have concerns about the employer mandate and the final law in general," Chow said. We should note here that the final law did not include a direct mandate. Rather, it enacted a fairly complicated way to fine employers if any of their workers qualify for new federal tax credits aimed at helping people buy insurance. Health care experts we've interviewed conclude that most large employers will be fined if they do not offer insurance. In evaluating this statement, we should reiterate that the health care law is a complicated piece of legislation. Large employers who do not currently offer insurance or who offer limited coverage will see greater costs under the bill, either because they will have to buy their employees new or additional coverage or they get hit with fines. We asked Cantor's office about whether the bill was "job-killing." A spokesman insisted that it was, pointing to individual business owners who said they would face increased costs under health care. He also pointed us to a letter organized from the American Action Network, a conservative think tank. The letter, signed by 200 economists, said, "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains expensive mandates and penalties that create major barriers to stronger job growth. The mandates will compete for the scarce business resources used for hiring and firm expansion." To be clear, the health care law will cost some employers money, particularly large ones. The CBO says that fines imposed on large employers will affect low-wage workers the most. But it also says the effect will be somewhat limited. We should also note that the major part of the legislation does not go into effect until 2014, and even after that, it will take time for workers and employers to see how it plays out. "To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced," the CBO said in its report. "It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives." Republicans have used the "job-killing" claim hundreds of times -- so often that they used the phrase in the name of the bill. It implies that job losses will be one of the most significant effects of the law. But they have flimsy evidence to back it up. The phrase suggests a massive decline in employment, but the data doesn't support that. The Republican evidence is extrapolated from a report that was talking about a reduction in the labor supply rather than the loss of jobs, or based on measures that weren't included in the final health care law. We rate the statement False.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2011-01-20T11:54:13	2011-01-19	['None']

pomt-09437	"We are the only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/11/dianne-feinstein/feinstein-says-us-only-nation-rely-heavily-profit-/	In February, amid the heated debate over health care reform, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation to bar insurance companies from implementing "unfair" hikes in health plan premiums. In a March 8, 2010, New York Times story, Feinstein explained why she cares so much about the issue. "We are the only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care," Feinstein said. "I believe, fundamentally, that all medical insurance should be not-for-profit." We thought it would be worthwhile checking if Feinstein was right that no other nation "relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care." As it turns out, some other countries do have private, for-profit insurance companies operating in their health care sector, and there are some indications that this sector is growing. But the business, legal and regulatory environment in which they operate is quite different than it is in the United States. A good example is the Netherlands. Dutch plans may be either non-profit or for-profit, as in the U.S. But children are fully covered using public funds, and premiums for adults are set at 50 percent of the expected costs, with the remainder paid through a national "risk equalization fund" -- essentially funds collected from the public at large. As a result, health insurers in the Netherlands aren't really able to compete for adult customers on price. By law, insurers must accept and renew all applicants, and a basic package of services must be offered. By contrast, U.S. insurers are free (for now, at least) to reject applicants on the individual market if they have pre-existing conditions, and insurers offer a panoply of plans with different premium levels and benefit packages. So, in the Netherlands, even the for-profit insurers don't typically make much of a profit on their basic health care lines. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, any profit that insurers make on basic services must be plowed back into reducing premiums. So why even call these companies for-profit? In many of the European countries with a for-profit health insurance sector, the companies make their profits not on basic health care -- the kind that Feinstein specifically referred to -- but by up-selling their health care customers on supplemental health coverage, such as dental care, eyeglasses, cosmetic surgery or more luxurious hospital rooms, or other product lines altogether, such as life or homeowner's insurance. "There's no developed country where insurers can make a profit on basic coverage," said T.R. Reid, the author of The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care. "Their mission is to pay for health care, not to pay investors." Maggie Mahar, a fellow who specializes in international health care policy at the Century Foundation, agrees. "I usually say that the U.S. is the only country in the developed world that has chosen to turn health care into largely unregulated, for-profit enterprise," she said. Technically, for-profit companies do provide basic medical care in countries such as the Netherlands, and there's enough of it going on to say that such countries "rely" on those insurers to serve that need. But the profit these companies make -- or at least the vast majority of it -- is made from lines of business other than basic health care. Because there is no official definition of "basic health care" in the U.S. system, it is hard to calculate exactly how much profit American insurers are making off basic services. But whatever it is, most experts expect that it is higher than the margins being made on basic health care by for-profit insurers in other countries. We believe that Feinstein is right that the U.S. for-profit insurance industry's role in basic health care is fundamentally different than what goes on in other countries, and that this outweighs her technical error in saying that no other country relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care. So we rate Feinstein's statement Mostly True.	None	Dianne Feinstein	None	None	None	2010-03-11T18:35:04	2010-03-08	['None']

pomt-09391	The Associated Press called Charlie Crist's attacks "over the top," "out of context," and "not true."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-fires-back-charlie-crists-attack-ad/	Hours after Gov. Charlie Crist launched a television ad attacking Marco Rubio, the former House speaker responded with a pair of 15-second TV spots to discredit Crist's claims. The ads -- "Yes," and "Better" -- feature Crist and his now-infamous embrace of President Barack Obama while the two campaigned for the federal stimulus in February 2009. The ads say Crist's attacks are false. The evidence: A March 13, 2010, Associated Press article. The ads claim that the article labeled Crist's attacks "over the top," "out of context," and "not true." "Why is a desperate Charlie Crist attacking Marco Rubio?" a narrator asks. "Can't Florida do better?" We'd expect to hear the phrases "over the top," "out of context," and "not true" from Rubio supporters. But would they come from the AP, a news organization that is well-respected and known for its impartiality? In this case, yes. The Associated Press article, written by its Florida political writer Brendan Farrington, appeared in newspapers and on Web sites across the state on March 12 and 13. The AP sells its content to news organizations across the country. That means Farrington's piece could be edited differently and have a variety of headlines in different publications. The original story was labeled as an analysis, and it appears most newspapers considered the piece as such. On the Miami Herald's Web site, it ran with the headline, "Analysis: Crist's Rubio attacks often go too far." The story, which you can read here, highlights six instances where Farrington says Crist's attacks are questionable: A suggestion that Rubio may have paid for a back wax with Republican Party of Florida American Express card. An accusation that Rubio, while speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, hired 20 aides at $100,000 salaries and spent $500,000 to renovate his office and a cafeteria for legislators. The claim that Rubio is a lobbyist. The charge that Rubio flip-flopped on whether he would have accepted federal stimulus money. Claims about Rubio's spending habits on the state GOP credit card. Charges about Rubio's $900,000 family debt. PolitiFact Florida has addressed several of those Crist attacks, including the lobbyist claim, the claim about accepting federal stimulus money, and the charge about Rubio's GOP credit card. In the AP story, Farrington makes a case that the accusations require asterisks or are overstatements. Farrington writes: "Crist, who calls himself a 'happy warrior,' still smiles, but he is proving he will throw anything and everything at Rubio to try to win what is becoming one of the closest watched races in the country. Many of Crist's attacks are exaggerated, take words out of context, aren't true or over the top. Rubio has also exaggerated or taken out of context some of Crist's statements or actions, but not to the same extent." The paragraph, the second in the story, includes each of the phrases Rubio cites in his television ad -- "out of context," "over the top," and "not true" (the actual wording in the article was "aren't true"). It's worth noting that Crist's new TV ad references only two of the six attacks Farrington focused on in the AP article - about spending of GOP political donations and that Rubio was a lobbyist - and it's unclear from the article how Farrington would describe those specific attacks. In two short television ads, Rubio tries to soften Crist's attacks with the help of the respected and impartial Associated Press. He uses the AP's words correctly to help make his case.

pomt-00673	An audit shows "there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older,"	true	/virginia/statements/2015/may/11/mark-warner/warner-says-millions-social-security-numbers-still/	People die, but their Social Security numbers often linger on. So says U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who recently introduced a bill that would require the Social Security Administration to do a better job of tracking the departed to make sure their federal benefits don’t survive. "The SSA (Social Security Administration’s) Office of the Inspector General reported last month that, according to the agency’s own records, there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older," Warner said in an April 23 news release. That’s more than twice the of population of Chicago -- filled with people at least 112. It’s especially remarkable when you consider that the Gerontology Research Group says it knew of 42 people in the world who were alive last October at 112 or older. Fifteen of them lived in the U.S. The immortal Social Security numbers, Warner said, open avenues for fraudulent benefit claims. We wondered whether the senator’s Social Security figures were correct. Warner’s office pointed us to a March 4 report issued by Patrick O’Carroll Jr., the Social Security Administration’s inspector general. O’Carroll testified about the agency’s death records during a March 16 hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He stated that the agency maintains an electronic record on each person given a Social Security number and is supposed to update it when they die so their number can no longer be used. The agency gets its death information from a variety of sources, such as family members, funeral homes and financial institutions. It maintains a "Death Master File" with nearly 90 million electronic records that’s shared with other federal agencies to prevent erroneous benefits and sold to credit reporting companies to guard against fraud. Sometimes the Social Security Administration prematurely declares people dead, as recently reported on CBS’ 60 Minutes, causing bureaucratic nightmares when those people try to open bank accounts or do myriad other things requiring a valid Social Security number. The agency’s internal auditor found in 2008 that 20,000 people had been wrongly listed as dead. And sometimes the opposite is true, O'Carroll said in his testimony, and the agency fails to take away Social Security numbers from the dead -- even when the agency has been informed of the deaths. It all came to a head a few years ago when O'Carroll’s office learned that a bank reported that a man had opened accounts using the Social Security numbers of two different people -- one born in 1886 and the other in 1893. The auditors did a little research and found that the world’s oldest living man at the time was 112. So they chose the age as the entry point of their investigation. The auditors indeed found, as Warner claimed, that 6.5 million cardholders were listed in Social Security records as being at least 112. All but about 100,000 of the numbers were issued prior to 1972, when the agency started using electronic records. The good news is that the auditors found no instances of people illegally collecting Social Security through one of these old numbers. The bad news is that the potential for abuse is high and, according to the report, "thousands" of the numbers "could have been used" to commit other types of identity fraud. Auditors found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011. One of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports. That means people were using the numbers in job applications and 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S. Final notes: If you’re wondering, the verified oldest person in the world at this writing is Jeralean Talley of Michigan, whose 116th birthday is on May 23. The oldest man is Sakari Momoi of Japan, who turned 112 in February. The verified oldest person ever was Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years, 164 days old. The oldest man was Christian Mortensen of Denmark, who died in 1998 at 115 years, 252 days. Our ruling Warner said the Social Security Administration’s Inspector General found "there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older." The audit Warner cites indeed found that there are an implausible 6.5 million active Social Security numbers belonging to people who would be at least 112. We rate Warner’s claim True.

pomt-02951	Says Ken Cuccinelli wants "to eliminate all forms of birth control."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/27/next-generation-climate-action-committee/no-basis-nextgen-claim-cuccinelli-wants-ban-all-co/	As the campaign reaches its final stretch, Democrats and their allies continue to accuse Ken Cuccinelli of holding extreme views on everything from climate change to birth control. NextGen Climate Action Committee, a Democratic-aligned super pac, has fired out a series of mailers during the last two weeks accusing Cuccinelli, among other things, of "wanting to eliminate all forms of birth control." We asked Brian Mahar, a spokesman for the super pac, for proof of the claim. He cited a Sept. 4 editorial in The Washington Post criticizing Cuccinelli’s support of a 2007 bill in the General Assembly that would have extended to human embryos a "right to the enjoyment of life" from the moment of fertilization. The editorial said the failed legislation would have "provided an opening to prohibit common methods of birth control, including the pill and intrauterine devices." The Post editorial, however, made no claim that every form of birth control -- including condoms and spermicides -- would have been banned under the bill. Debate over the impact of legislation that confers personhood from the moment of conception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that devices that merely prevent fertilization wouldn’t be affected by personhood laws. The issue is that some forms -- including the intrauterine device, emergency contraception and birth control pills -- may also work by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. Some people say those methods go beyond mere contraception and are tantamount to causing an abortion. In 2012, as Virginia was debating another personhood measure, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a statement saying laws that bestow rights from the moment of fertilization would restrict contraception choices. The group wrote, "some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,, and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt ‘personhood’ measures." But the organization’s statement, which was cited in editorial NextGen references, never said all forms of contraception would be banned. It said personhood laws would leave "condoms, natural family planning and spermicides the only legally allowed forms of birth control." In a September Truth-O-Meter, we gave a Half True to Cuccinelli’s statement that he’s never supported legislation that invades contraceptive choices. We noted that while the personhood bills he’s backed never explicitly sought to ban birth control, they could have opened legal avenues to challenge certain forms of contraception. Cuccinelli has repeatedly said he would not seek to restrict contraception. We asked his campaign how he defines birth control but did not receive a clear response. As a state senator in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a bill that would have specified that contraception that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg is not an abortion. Our ruling NextGen Climate Action Committee says Cuccinelli wants to "eliminate all forms of birth control." The group cites an editorial that said personhood legislation Cuccinelli supported could have fostered legal challenges to types of contraception that prevent the implantation of fertilized eggs. But the editorial made no assertion Cuccinelli wants to ban all birth control devices. Cuccinelli has repeatedly said he has no interest in restricting contraception, which generally works by preventing ovulation or the fertilization of a human egg. NextGen doesn’t have a speck of proof to bolster its incendiary claim that Cuccinelli wants to ban all forms of birth control -- even condoms and spermicides. We rate it Pants of Fire.

pomt-06578	Says that illegal immigrants get a $100,000 break on University of Texas tuition over four years.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-says-illegal-immigrants-get-10000/	The Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Orlando delivered more criticism of Texas Gov. Rick Perry for his stance on offering certain illegal immigrants in Texas the same college tuition that legal residents pay. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney gave a number that especially resonates in Austin: "To go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount. You know how much that is? That's $22,000 a year." Romney added: "Four years of college, almost $100,000 discount if you are an illegal alien (and) go to the University of Texas." On Tuesday, Romney's campaign featured that debate moment in a web ad hammering Perry on the issue. Conveniently, we recently completed a related fact-check on a claim that Rick Santorum made in the Sept. 12 Republican presidential debate, so we had a few numbers ready to hand. Based on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the average gap between in-state and out-of-state tuition at Texas public universities in 2011 was $9,800: A non-resident, full-time student would be expected to pay an estimated $17,000 in tuition and fees, while an in-state resident would pay $7,200. That $9,800 is much smaller than the "discount" Romney cited for UT, but the board confirms that UT’s tuition rates are higher than average and the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition is higher. The in-state costs at UT were the second-highest and UT’s out-of-state tuition was the highest among Texas’ 37 public universities that reported 2011 estimates to the board. Romney’s campaign cited U.S. News and World Report UT tuition figures for 2011-12 of $9,794 in-state and $32,506 out-of-state. When we inquired, the coordinating board cited the same figures, rounded, from UT in calculating its averages: $9,800 in-state and $32,500 out-of-state tuition. Those numbers yield a "discount" of $22,700 -- the biggest gap between in-state and out-of-state resident tuition among the 37 Texas public universities that reported 2011 estimates to the board. The next biggest differences: UT-Dallas, $17,026; Texas A&M University, $15,390; and University of Houston-Clear Lake, $10,838. Nearly all the rest report a difference of $9,400 or less. So, Romney’s "discount" of $22,000 for a year at UT holds up, but his extrapolation of "almost $100,000" across four years is a bit dodgier. The real difference (presuming the 2011-12 tuition charges hold for four years) would be $90,800. Probably most college students would find the $9,200 difference to be significant. However, not only is UT one of the most expensive schools Romney could have picked for this example, but very few of the illegal immigrants receiving this tuition break choose to attend UT. To get the in-state rate, illegal immigrants must have a Texas high school diploma or GED, have lived in Texas for at least three years and sign an affidavit of their intention to apply for permanent residency. Only 16,476 students in Texas took this affidavit route in 2010, and only 612 of those — about 4 percent — went to UT, said Dominic Chavez, senior director for external relations with the higher education board. Most of the "affidavit" students in Texas, by far, choose community colleges, he said; 73 percent of the total 16,476 affidavit students did so in 2010. (The breakdown: 4,403 went to public universities; 12,028 chose community colleges; the remaining 45 students went to public health-related institutions, where the average "discount" was $10,800 -- an example is the UT Medical Branch at Galveston.) And for those community college students, the in-state reduction on tuition is smaller: between $1,600 and $2,600. Though the residency requirements and categories differ from those at public universities, the lowest rate for which students (including affidavit students) can qualify is the "in-district" rate. Among the 53 community colleges reporting 2011 estimates to the Texas coordinating board, the average in-district tuition was $2,200; the average out-of-district tuition was $3,200; and the average non-resident (out-of-state) tuition was $4,800. To take a step back and view the big picture: Of 1.3 million college students in Texas in 2010, 1.2 percent (16,476) were illegal immigrants receiving tuition breaks through the affidavit route. (The even bigger picture: Texas’ 1.65 million illegal immigrants made up 6.7 percent of the state’s total population in 2010, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.) Stated another way, only 1 percent of Texas’ illegal immigrants got the in-state rates in 2010. And of those, 73 percent got an average reduction of $2,600 or less; the remaining 27 percent average closer to $10,000 per year. So let’s return to Romney’s statement: "Four years of college, almost $100,000 discount if you are an illegal alien (and) go to the University of Texas." For the 612 affidavit students at the University of Texas last year, Romney’s figure of $22,000 per year is approximately correct, even a bit low; but quadrupling the real average adds up to $90,800 over four years, not $100,000. Not only is that UT tuition break the very highest that Romney could have cited among Texas public universities, it went to only 4 percent of the illegal immigrants who received in-state tuition rates last year. The vast majority of affidavit students in Texas last year got an average in-state tuition reduction of $1,600 to $2,600. If they got that rate for four years, the total "discount" would be $6,400 to $10,400. And that group of 12,028 community college affidavit students made up less than 1 percent of the 1,364,911 college students enrolled in Texas last year. Romney’s $100,000 figure is only $9,200 off the mark for the University of Texas, but with 73 percent of affidavit students receiving $10,400 or less over four years, his choice to use UT as an example gives a skewed representation of the reality of illegal immigrants seeking college education in Texas. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-09-28T06:00:00	2011-09-22	['University_of_Texas_at_Austin']
pomt-09198	Says Gov. Rick Perry is “spending Texans’ hard-earned money to live like Louie XIV.”	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/may/25/boyd-richie/la-bonne-vie-democratic-chairman-says-perry-living/	Boyd Richie, who chairs the Texas Democratic Party, took a fresh swing at Gov. Rick Perry and his sweet state-funded digs, saying in a May 20 e-mail blast: “He’s spending Texans’ hard-earned money to live like Louie XIV.” Quelle horreur--really? Not really, replied Kirsten Gray, the party’s spokeswoman. “It was a humorous analogy, not based in fact,” she told us in an e-mail. We guessed as much. Allow us to have some fun, too, by taking a look back at France's Sun King. First: How did the king, who lived from 1638 to 1715, make it day to day? Like his father before him, biographies suggest, he often was on the move, waging war (the “natural condition of nations” in the era, recapped Nancy Mitford, in her book, “The Sun King”) or hunting while staying in palatial abodes capped by his beloved chateau at Versailles, which he proclaimed the seat of government in 1682. Versailles, of late a spectacular tourist attraction, grew on the king’s watch to include picture-perfect gardens, a theater holding 3,000 spectators, a vast hall of mirrors, hundreds of imported orange trees (many planted indoors in silver tubs)--all of that a far cry from the rustic hunting lodge his father had enjoyed there. That building, which his son preserved, consisted of just (only) (barely) 20 rooms plus a men’s dormitory. Tuneful aspect of the king’s lifestyle: He was seldom without music, awakening each morning to the playing of a live band, according to Mitford. So, how does Perry fare comparatively? We’re unaware of live bands playing as Perry awakens. And the governor doesn’t routinely hunt (though he recently said he shot and killed a coyote during a jog) nor is he known to bounce from palace to palace nor has he declared war -- except on Washington. Then again, Perry incorrectly maintained last year that Texas could secede; his intimation could be seen as war-like. Yet Perry's temporary home, in a gated community in the hills 11 miles southwest of downtown Austin, hardly compares to the spread at Versailles, which Placesinfrance.com describes as having 700 rooms, over 1,200 fireplaces and 67 staircases. PolitiFact Texas noted in April that the monthly rent for the 4,600-square-foot home--where Perry and his wife settled in fall 2007 so the Governor's Mansion could be renovated--is $9,000. This month, the Associated Press reported that total monthly costs for the seven-bedroom, five-bathroom house exceed $10,000, counting rent, utilities and upkeep. The house has a gourmet kitchen, three dining rooms and seven bathrooms, the AP reported. That gives Perry more private thrones with plumbing than the king who, given his times, was limited to chamber pots. The AP's article itemizes various state-covered expenses at the rental home: $18,000 for "consumables" such as household supplies and cleaning products, $1,001.46 in window coverings from upscale retailer Neiman Marcus, a $1,000 "emergency repair" of the governor's filtered ice machine, a $700 clothes rack, and a little more than $70 for a two year subscription to Food & Wine Magazine. Maintenance on a heated pool on the property’s three acres has cost taxpayers at least $8,400, the AP said, and the tab for grounds and lawn maintenance has topped $44,000. All told, taxpayers have spent at least $592,000 for rent, utilities, repairs, furnishings and supplies since Perry moved in. By comparison, the AP noted, the governor's mansion is wholly owned by the state — there is no rent or mortgage to pay. As configured, it has about 9,900 total square feet, but most is public space packed with historic artifacts. Only 2,750 square feet is dedicated to the governor's residence. Perry critics have floated alternative temporary housing ideas. The governor could occupy a mobile home (as Mike Huckabee boasted of doing while governor of Arkansas). Of late, the Texas AFL-CIO offered to rent a manufactured home to the governor for $1 a year. Or Perry could bunker in at a hotel. At the La Quinta Inn at the Texas Capitol, the nightly rate for a suite, starting June 1, would run $120 plus tax, though a room with a standard King bed, plus a refrigerator and microwave, would cost $90 plus tax, according to the assistant general manager, Zina Carter. There's also a pool, the hotel website says; we'll guess it's not heated. Summing up: Louis XIV had it all for his age. He gamboled, he hunted, he warred; lived large. Though Perry’s hardly giving the king a run for his money, he has had a bonanza of a run as well--healthy wife, children, multiple elections with nary a loss. He’s often said he has the world’s best job. We’ll speculate he’s good with his rental quarters. But ça suffit, as they say in France. The Democrats said Richie was joshing. We’ll grant they’re kidders. We rate his statement Pantalon en Feu.	None	Boyd Richie	None	None	None	2010-05-25T23:03:06	2010-05-20	['Rick_Perry', 'Texas', 'Louis_XIV_of_France']

pomt-07621	The state of Wisconsin pays plumbers, engineers and other attorneys "much, much more" than it pays attorneys to represent poor people.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/20/marla-stephens/former-wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-marla-ste/	Who deserves the least sympathy: lawyers, politicians … Illinois toll booth operators? The first group seems to make pretty good coin. But when doing work for the State of Wisconsin, private-practice lawyers who take public defender cases haven’t gotten a raise since 1992. The fact the so-called "private-bar rate" -- $40 an hour -- hasn’t been raised in more than 18 years outraged Marla Stephens, head of the appellate division of the state public defender’s office. Stephens, who lost in the February 2011 primary election for state Supreme Court, raised the issue at a candidates forum on Jan. 27, 2011, saying: "The State of Wisconsin pays attorneys that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case. The State of Wisconsin pays plumbers that it hires and engineers that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour to do work for the state." OK, we’ll pause here for this acknowledgement: Stephens’ claim was made weeks ago, before that little budget-repair bill from Gov. Scott Walker caught our attention. But her claim still stands and it provides some insight into how the state provides legal representation for poor adults who are facing jail or prison. First, a little background. The Legislature created the state public defender’s office in 1978. Public defenders, who are state employees, represent the indigent in every county in Wisconsin. They mostly handle adult criminal cases, but they also work civil matters such as paternity cases. At the time, the Legislature created a two-tier pay system for private-practice attorneys who put themselves on a list to be assigned cases by the public defender. The hourly rates peaked in 1992 -- $50 for in-court work and $40 for out-of-court work. The current, single rate of $40 an hour has been in place since 1995. Despite the lack of raises, some 1,300 private-practice attorneys take public defender cases. In 2010, they handled 53,380 cases, two-thirds of them criminal, according to Deborah Smith, the assigned counsel division director for the public defender’s office. So that’s the lay of the land. Now let’s examine what Stephens said. Her first claim was: The state pays private-practice attorneys "much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case." We asked Stephens’ campaign manager, Jon Lipshutz, for evidence to support her two claims. On this point, he cited two Milwaukee Journal Sentinel articles. An August 2009 article said a Madison attorney was paid $175 an hour to represent the state in a lawsuit over the state’s registry for same-sex couples. And a July 2010 article said the state paid another Madison attorney up to $665 an hour in a complex insurance case involving the receivership of Ambac Assurance Corp. Obviously, those attorneys were paid far more than $40 an hour -- but their cases were considerably different than the typical public defender case. To get a more comprehensive picture, we went to Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration. She said the lowest rate a state agency paid for an outside attorney over the past year was $95 an hour, for legal services to college students. The state Office of Lawyer Regulation, however, pays what is known as the Supreme Court rate of $70 an hour to attorneys it hires to prosecute lawyer misconduct cases. The Supreme Court rate is also used when judges appoint lawyers to cases for any reason. So, the lowest rate we could find that the state pays to lawyers for non-public defender cases is $70 an hour. That’s $30, or 75 percent, more than what the state pays for public defender cases. Stephens’ second claim was: The state pays plumbers and engineers "much, much more than $40 an hour." Lipshutz confirmed that Stephens was referring to plumbers and engineers hired on contract. He referred us to the state’s VendorNet website but did not provide evidence of what the state pays contract plumbers and engineers. We again went to the Department of Administration. Vigue said engineers are paid $80 an hour -- twice the rate paid to private attorneys on public defender cases. Plumbers, meanwhile, are paid the prevailing wage, which varies by county and by the type of job. Vigue provided plumber rates for Milwaukee, Dane and Brown counties. The lowest rate for typical jobs, in Brown County, is $46.69 -- the basic hourly rate of $31.65, plus $15.04 per hour for fringe benefits. So, the state does have a rate it pays for certain plumbing jobs that is lower than the $40 public defender rate -- at least if benefits are not considered in the plumber rate. Of course, Stephens’ larger point is that the amount paid for public defenders should be increased. Two attempts to force this to happen are pending. A March 2010 petition asks the Supreme Court to raise the court-appointed rate to $80 an hour and to index it to inflation. And the 2011-2013 state budget request by the public defender’s office asks that the rate be raised to $70, at an estimated cost of $16.4 million per year. Let’s return to the claim at hand. Attorney Marla Stephens said the state pays hourly rates to most lawyers, as well as to engineers and plumbers, that are "much, much more" than the $40 it pays private-practice attorneys to handle public defender cases. That kind of characterization is subjective. But the rates paid to other attorneys and to engineers are considerably higher. The rate paid to some plumbers is lower, and only when benefits are not included. We rate Stephens’ statement Mostly True.

In fact, the clause has never been litigated in the courts. And experts in the field disagree over whether Clinton’s situation is a violation. We’ll tell the truth The Emoluments Clause was designed to prevent the government and its leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free from external influence. The clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads: "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." The clause does ban U.S. government employees from accepting presents or emoluments (salary or compensation) from foreign governments, but it doesn’t say anything about spouses or "foreigners" generally, as Gingrich said in his claim. In terms of gifts, the Clinton Foundation did accept millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments while Clinton was secretary of state. The money was to be used for charitable work. But there is no proven evidence that she, as a person holding office, personally solicited or received such gifts. Hillary Clinton has never received a salary from the foundation, nor did she have an official role in the organization while she was secretary of state. (It does appear that some of her aides, at least, mixed department and foundation business.) "Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing," said University of Texas Law professor Stephen Vladeck. "Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they’re formally — and, thus, legally — distinct." Whether Clinton violated the Emoluments Clause through her association with the Clinton Foundation is ambiguous because there are no specific instructions for how to handle foreign government donations to a charity that has ties to a State Department employee. The department’s own rules don’t address this scenario, either. Dave Kopel, a constitutional law professor at Denver University and research director at the libertarian Independence Institute, said he believed the clause’s intentionally broad phrasing about gifts of "any kind whatever," would cover indirect gifts via the foundation. But Gingrich argued it as a certainty, which it most certainly is not. What about Bill Clinton? Gingrich is also wrong to say the Emoluments Clause speaks of spouses. It does not. But there is a corresponding law to the Emoluments Clause, the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act, that says federal government employees and their spouses can face a civil penalty if they accept gifts from foreign governments. But it’s also unproven that Bill Clinton received such gifts. Bill Clinton does not take a salary from the foundation. There are some companies and organizations that have paid him six-figure speaking fees and have also donated to the foundation — including companies with ties to foreign governments. But a government employee’s spouse receiving income from a foreign entity is not directly covered under the Emoluments Clause, nor the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act. A spokesman for Gingrich sent us a Defense Department memo about the Emoluments Clause, but it was directed at employees of that department, not the State Department. Our ruling Gingrich said, "There’s a section in the Constitution called the Emoluments Clause that says no one, nor their spouses, can take money from foreigners. (Hillary Clinton) has to be guilty of 70 or 100 counts just on that one charge." The Emoluments Clause talks about foreign governments, not foreigners, and doesn’t speak of spouses. Whether Hillary Clinton is guilty of violating the Emoluments Clause is unproven. Some experts say the layers of separation between Hillary Clinton and the foundation mean she likely did not violate the Constitution. Others say the clause is so vague that it could be broadly interpreted to include a scenario like the Clinton Foundation. A case has never been argued in court. Gingrich’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cf33ef1-87bf-4133-8c29-44928f7b5ef7	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2016-11-06T17:18:49	2016-11-06	['Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution']
pomt-09085	Georgia has “more illegal aliens than the state of Arizona.”	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/25/jeff-chapman/does-georgia-have-more-illegal-immigrants-arizona/	(Update: The Pew Hispanic Center recently emailed PolitiFact Georgia its latest numbers on “unauthorized immigrants” that update numbers in the original report below. It does not impact our ruling since that was based on numbers from the Department of Homeland Security. The report is entitled: “A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States.” It can be found at http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=107. Pew found California had the greatest number of “unauthorized residents” and estimated that number at between 2.5 and 2.85 million. Arizona came in sixth on the Pew Hispanic Center list with between 475,000 and 550,000 unauthorized immigrant residents. Georgia came in seventh on that list with 425,000 to 500,000.) Cracking down on illegal immigration has become a mega-mantra for Republicans who want to be Georgia’s next governor. That became evident at a June 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, sponsored by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the Georgia Press Association. The five Republican candidates who showed up for the GOP debate all favored Georgia adopting a get-tough measure like the one passed in Arizona. But candidate Jeff Chapman, a state senator, went further. He stated that Georgia has actually surpassed Arizona in the number of immigrant residents who broke the law to enter the United States. “Georgia having more illegal aliens than the state of Arizona is clearly taking away jobs,” Chapman said at the debate. Georgia, a state in the Deep South, has more illegal immigrants than Arizona, a state that sits on the Mexican border and is at the epicenter of the illegal immigration political storm? We at PolitiFact Georgia were dubious. Chapman made the statement not only at the debate; he repeats it in detail on his campaign Web site. On the site, Chapman states: “Officially, we have 480,000 illegal aliens in the state of Georgia. Officially, Arizona has 460,000.” Georgia is, of course, a much bigger state, population-wise, than Arizona. It has a total population of 9.8 million residents, while Arizona has about 6.6 million residents. To check the numbers of illegal immigrants, we first went to the Pew Hispanic Center, which keeps a wide array of statistics on illegal immigration. Pew’s Web site numbers indicated California had the greatest number of illegal residents and estimated that number at between 2.5 million and 2.7 million. Arizona came in fifth on the Pew list with between 400,000 and 450,000 illegal immigrant residents. Georgia came in seventh on that list with 350,000 to 450,000. But there was a problem with the Pew numbers. They were from 2005, nearly five years old. We also checked the Web site Statemaster.com, which listed Georgia seventh with 228,000 illegal immigrants and Arizona sixth with 283,000. But those numbers turned out to be 10 years old, based on a report done in 2000. So we called a Washington-based organization known as FAIR -- Federation for American Immigration Reform. Spokesman Jack Martin said their numbers show Arizona ranks sixth with 500,000 and Georgia seventh with 495,000. But Martin said the latest numbers are kept by the Department of Homeland Security. And he recommended we contact that agency for the most updated information. That sentiment was echoed by Tom Edwards of the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau, he said, just keeps numbers on immigrants who live in the U.S., with no distinction of their legal or illegal status. If you want the most updated numbers, Edwards said, go to the Department of Homeland Security. So we did. What we found was a report titled: “Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2009.” It was authored by Michael Hoefer, Nancy Rytina and Bryan C. Baker. The report said its estimate began with the American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates the total foreign-born residents in the U.S. From that report, using various filters, the DHS estimated the number of illegal residents. It’s a bit art, a bit science. And even the report itself cautioned that estimating the number of illegal residents is a slippery business. “Annual estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population are subject to sampling error in the ACS and considerable nonsampling error because of uncertainty in some of the assumptions required for estimation,” the report cautioned. Still, it is a highly regarded number by those in the business of counting people. And it comes up with some interesting conclusions. “The greatest percentage increases in the unauthorized population between 2000 and 2009 occurred in Georgia [115 percent], Nevada [55 percent], and Texas [54 percent],” the report noted. The DHS report still listed California in the top spot, with 2.6 million illegal immigrants. But it placed Georgia at the No. 6 spot with 480,00 illegal residents and Arizona seventh with 460,000. Interestingly, just 10 years ago, Arizona was far ahead with 330,000 illegal immigrant residents while Georgia had only 220,000. Chapman appears to have done his homework on this subject.

pomt-10232	"Governor Palin is the most popular governor in the country."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/john-mccain/she-wins-popularity-contest/	In a press release responding to a story in the National Enquirer, the McCain campaign declared that "Governor Palin is the most popular governor in the country." It's a line that has clearly become a campaign talking point — repeated by staffers and supporters alike such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. If the limit of your interest on this issue is whether it's true that Palin is an extremely popular governor in Alaska, we'll save you some time: the answer is an unqualified yes. But we wanted to find out if she is the most popular, as the McCain campaign said. That's a more complicated — and ultimately squishy — issue. You won't find a poll that on one day asked a large sample of residents in every state to rate their governor. What you have is a hodgepodge of polls taken on different days in different states, often asking people different versions of whether they like their governor. For example, you might have one poll asking simply whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the governor; and another that asks you to rate the guv's performance as excellent, good, fair or poor. It'd be unfair to compare those head-to-head. And not to make your head hurt, but there's a difference between personal approval ratings and job approval ratings. Bill Clinton, for example, had high job approval ratings but low personal approval ratings. So what do we know about Palin's approval ratings among Alaskans? They are remarkably high. A May 2007 poll taken by Ivan Moore Research in Alaska put Palin's positive rating at 89 percent. That's off the charts high. But Moore's survey wasn't a traditional approval rating or job performance measure. Rather, respondents were asked to rate their feelings toward public figures as very or somewhat positive or very or somewhat negative. The verys and somewhats were then combined. A poll two weeks before that one, from Dittman Research, gave Palin a 93 percent approval rating. The Moore poll numbers hit a low of 76 percent in mid July — in the midst of "Troopergate" coverage — but bounced back to 80 percent in mid August. That mirrored a Hays Research Group poll on July 24 and 25 in which 80 percent rated Palin's performance as somewhat or very favorable. Moore hasn't polled similar questions in other states, so he wouldn't say categorically that Palin's are the highest in the country. "But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know 89 percent is going to be at the top of the list," Moore said. On Sept. 3, the McCain campaign released results of an American Viewpoint poll on Sept. 2 — after the announcement of Palin as McCain's running mate — that found Palin had an 86 percent overall job approval rating. That was a poll commissioned by the McCain campaign, so take that for what it's worth. Again, these are extraordinarily high numbers by any measure. But according to Rasmussen polls, Palin gave up her crown as "most popular" in July, overtaken by North Dakota's Gov. John Hoeven. A Rasmussen poll on July 30 found 64% of voters rate Palin's job performance as excellent or good versus 14% who view it as poor. On July 8, Hoeven clocked 72 percent at excellent or good against just 6 percent who rated his performance as poor. Scott Rasmussen, founder and CEO of Rasmussen Reports, said people shouldn't get hung up on whether someone ranked No. 1 or 2. Those numbers change with the political winds of the day. "In a broader sense, she (Palin) is one of the very top," Rasmussen said. The polling firm SurveyUSA has in the past conducted governor's approval ratings in all 50 states, but not since Palin took office. In 2006, the highest ratings were around 80 percent. The ratings being reported in Alaska for Palin are "extraordinarily high," said Jay Leve, editor of SurveyUSA. "Those kinds of numbers are unprecedented." And based on the previous highs for approval ratings, he said, it's highly likely Palin is now top dog. Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor for The Cook Political Report, and John McIntyre, managing editor at Real Clear Politics — two groups that pay close attention to such things — also believe Palin's numbers rank her as the most popular. "It's difficult to make a categorical statement like that," McIntyre said. "But generally, they are on pretty solid ground. If I was a betting person, I bet that's an accurate statement. Once your approval rating is over 80 percent, it's a little silly." Bottom line, most experts say the McCain campaign is probably right. We rate it True.

pomt-04613	"Portland Schools spend $500K to deem PB&J sandwiches racist."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/18/education-action-group/portland-schools-spending-half-million-dollars-dec/	This is something PolitiFact Oregon never thought we’d have to do: Search online for the terms racist sandwich. And what pops up? A Portland Tribune news story about a Portland Public Schools equity program that focuses on diversity as a way to boost student learning. We repeat the first four paragraphs of the story as is: Verenice Gutierrez picks up on the subtle language of racism every day. Take the peanut butter sandwich, a seemingly innocent example a teacher used in a lesson last school year. "What about Somali or Hispanic students, who might not eat sandwiches?" says Gutierrez, principal at Harvey Scott K-8 School, a diverse school of 500 students in Northeast Portland’s Cully neighborhood. "Another way would be to say: ‘Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?’ Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta. Or pita." The online response has been tremendous. From Huffington Post: "Peanut Butter And Jelly Racist? Portland School Principal Ties Sandwich To White Privilege." And from WTBX/FM in Hibbing, Minn: "PBJ- the racist sandwich?" (Summary: Yup. Your childhood staple is guilty of hate crimes against humanity.) Even the liberal Daily Kos weighed in with "Oregon school principal: Peanut Butter sandwiches RACIST?" and complained of political correctness gone amok. And here, posted on conservative breitbart.com: "Portland Schools spend $500K to deem PB & J sandwiches racist." We acknowledge some level of hyperbole. But we still wanted to know: Did the principal in question declare the sandwich racist? And did Portland Schools spend half a million dollars to do so? The article posted on breitbart was written by the Education Action Group, a Michigan-based organization that dislikes public unions. We called and got Ben Velderman, a communications specialist who wrote the story. Velderman said he doesn’t know if the principal actually called the sandwiches racist -- which the headline claims. But he points to The Portland Tribune news article, which clearly talks about race and the privilege of the white mainstream. "So if a peanut butter sandwich is the ‘subtle language of racism,’ I don’t think it’s a stretch that she thinks a peanut butter sandwich is racist," he said. "I try not to be inflammatory. I try to keep it as reasonable as possible, by not making outlandish claims. She went out on a limb herself." Gutierrez declined to speak with PolitiFact Oregon, but Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby answered questions on her behalf. He said she did not use the word "racist" in a meeting with staff cited in the news article. He said that the "subtle language of racism" phrase included in the story was the reporter’s wording, and not hers. The point of the example, Shelby said, was to encourage teachers to widen their range of food samples to include more students. "It’s not that the PB&J sandwich is racist. That’s silly," he said. The reporter "asked her about the goal of this work and what her desire was, and she told her that it was to have culturally relevant instruction in every classroom, and what that might look like. "The work is not to point fingers and figure out what is racist." In other words, accusing the sandwich of oppression is quite different from saying that it would be useful to include other foods when talking to students who don’t eat sandwiches for lunch. Let’s turn briefly to the money involved. Portland Public Schools has an ongoing contract with Pacific Educational Group, whose founder is author of the book, "Courageous Conversations About Race: A Strategy for Achieving Equity in Schools." The district has spent more than $1 million since 2007 for diversity and equity training in the classroom. In other words, it’s for more than just the rebranding of a sandwich. (Tigard-Tualatin and other districts use the program as well.) How fair is it for pundits to take a news story that includes the word racism in the first paragraph and boil that down into a headline about a racist sandwich? The Education Action Group says it’s fair game, given the story and the fact that an educator singled out the sandwich in a lesson about cultural competency. But come on. Read the original story. Gutierrez is quoted as suggesting to staff: "Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?" That’s not an indictment of the sandwich. Portland Public Schools did not spend half a million dollars to label the sandwich "racist." The principal never called the sandwich racist. The Portland Tribune never said the principal called the sandwich racist. And yes, we don’t usually weigh in on lunch, but who could resist? The statement is inaccurate and silly.

pomt-09399	"There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/23/bart-stupak/stupak-says-there-no-federal-funding-abortion-sena/	With the health care bill teetering in the balance, antiabortion Democrat Rep. Bart Stupak's announcement hours before the final vote that an agreement had been reached on the abortion issue marked a momentous shift. For weeks, Stupak insisted he and a group of other abortion foes in the House could not support the Senate bill because it would result in federal funding of abortions, contrary to longstanding federal policy. But on the afternoon of March 21, 2010, Stupak said in a news conference that the promise of an executive order on abortion from President Barack Obama convinced him "there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation." Stupak's comments several hours later on the House floor provided some of the most emotionally charged moments of the late-night health care debate. "It is the Democrats who, through the president's executive order, ensure that the sanctity of life is protected," Stupak said. His comments were interrupted by catcalls from the bill's Republican opponents, one of whom was heard to yell "baby killer!" Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer later said he was the one who shouted. But he said he yelled "It's a baby killer," referring not to Stupak (to whom he apologized), but to the agreement Stupak helped forge with the president. The abortion issue in the health care reform debate has been thorny from the start. From early on, legislators on both sides of the abortion issue professed a desire to maintain the status quo on abortion in the health care bill. But that quickly proved difficult, if not impossible. Here's why: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care reform bill proposes a health care exchange in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question then: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do)? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? In the House, Stupak helped add an amendment that bars anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment does let them choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still buy an abortion "rider" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money. The Senate took a different tack. The Senate language on abortion, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., would allow companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums, not federal subsidies. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill requires that anyone who selects a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. One plan in every state exchange must offer coverage that does not include abortions, so there would be an option for those who morally object to $1 of their premiums going toward abortion services. Legislators supporting the bill -- along with President Obama -- insist that segregation of funds stays true to the Hyde Amendment restriction on federal funds for abortions. The Senate bill's proposal on abortion is opposed by activists on both sides of the abortion issue. Abortion rights groups like NARAL Pro Choice America, the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood all put out statements denouncing the requirement that policy owners or their employers write separate checks -- one for abortion services and one for everything else. NARAL called the provision "unacceptable bureaucratic stigmatization (that) could cause insurance carriers to drop abortion coverage, even though more than 85 percent of private plans currently cover this care for women." Abortion foes like the National Right to Life Committee and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also vehemently opposed the Senate bill's abortion language, arguing that if you send federal subsidies to a person who then chooses a plan that cover abortions, that's federal funding of abortion. They called the plan to segregate money so that abortions are paid only through premiums -- not government subsidies -- nothing more than a bookkeeping scheme. Until March 21, 2010, that was Stupak's consistent position. In a Fox News interview on March 17, 2010, Stupak said of the Senate bill, "It is very clear that abortion is, for the first time ever, a funded benefit by the federal government." So, what changed on Sunday that prompted Stupak to say "there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation"? In the hours leading up to the vote, he and several other antiabortion Democrats in the House agreed to back the health bill after Obama promised to sign an executive order reinforcing the commitment that no federal funds would be used for abortions. The Senate bill already spelled out strict payment and accounting requirements to accomplish that, but Obama's executive order went one step further, putting the president's weight behind specific measures to ensure that funds are properly segregated. By our reading, the order mostly restates and reinforces the intent of the Senate bill. But it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that people getting government subsidies for health care will be able to buy a policy on the exchange that covers abortions. That's why some abortion foes -- not all -- believe Stupak essentially traded his vote for a handful of beans. "It was issued for political effect," said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. "We don't see any value in the order." We don't think Rep. Stupak can credibly claim one day that the bill is federal funding of abortions, and then the next day, after getting the agreement on the executive order, that it does not. Stupak's issue all along was that if federal subsidies went to someone who could then choose a plan that covers abortions, that was federal funding for abortion. And that hasn't changed. The president's order spells out safeguards to ensure the funds are segregated. But if you thought that was a bookkeeping trick before, there's nothing in the executive order that would change your mind. At the climax of the health care debate from the floor, House Republican Leader John Boehner said that even with the executive order from the president, the Senate bill would provide "taxpayer funding of abortions for the first time in 30 years." We don't agree. It's understandable that abortion foes opposed a proposal that gives more people the opportunity to obtain insurance that cover abortions. But it's another thing to say those abortion services would be paid with federal dollars. The Senate bill states very clearly that public funding through tax credits and government subsidies for elective abortion services offered in the exchange is prohibited. But more than that, the bill sets up a mechanism to ensure that abortion services offered in the exchange are paid entirely from patient premiums, premiums paid by people who have chosen a private plan that covers abortion. The executive order puts the weight of the president's word behind providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. We think that's enough to back up Stupak's claim, "There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation." But that's a conclusion we reached before the president promised an executive order, back when Stupak disagreed with us and insisted the bill would have had federal dollars subsidizing abortions. We don't understand how the executive order changes Stupak's logic on this issue, but no matter how he arrived as his conclusion, we think he's right now. And we rule his claim True.

pomt-02977	"Mark Herring voted to allow sex offenders, including rapists, to serve shorter sentences."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/21/mark-obenshain/obenshain-says-herring-voted-shorten-prison-senten/	The front of the campaign brochure has a mug shot of a grimacing, heavyset man in a undershirt. He’s holding a prisoner identification tag that says, "There are 1,268 convicted sex offenders in the Richmond area." Under the photo, Mark Obenshain, the Republican nominee for attorney general, asks, "Which candidate for attorney general will protect your family?" Open the glossy brochure and you get this answer: "Mark Herring voted to allow sex offenders, including rapists, to serve shorter sentences." Obenshain made the same charge against Herring, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, in a TV ad that began airing Oct. 7. So we checked whether Herring really did vote to ease prison sentences for sex offenders. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Obenshain’s campaign, said the claim centers on a bill that came up in the General Assembly earlier this year. Both Obenshain and Herring are state senators. The bill concerned about 155 crimes that, under Virginia law, must be punished with mandatory minimum sentences in prison. As introduced by Del. Robert Bell, R-Albemarle, the measure would have required that each count of a mandatory-sentence conviction be fully served in prison -- as opposed to allowing an inmate to serve several terms concurrently. Lets say, for example, a person is convicted on three counts that each carry a mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years. Bell’s legislation would have required the criminal to serve at least 30 years. The bill grew out of a criminal case concerning Charles Lordell Jefferson Jr., who in 2011 was convicted in Fauquier County on six counts of production of child pornography, each carrying a mandatory minimum of of five years. Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey W. Parker imposed a six-year sentence for each count, but allowed allowed the prison terms to be served concurrently. So Jefferson faced only six years behind bars for child pornography crimes. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli contested the result, arguing it was the legislature’s intent in passing mandatory minimum sentence laws that prison time would be tacked on for each count. The Court of Appeals of Virginia rejected Cuccinelli’s argument. A three-judge panel noted that state laws specified consecutive prison terms for some mandatory-minimum crimes but not for others, including production of child pornography. The panel said that it must assume the General Assembly had a reason for setting the condition for some mandatory-minimum offenses and not for others. Bell introduced his bill to end the controversy, but the Senate stripped out the blanket provision that sentences for all mandatory-minimum counts be served sequentially. Instead, the Senate simply added a specification to child pornography laws that perpetrators would serve consecutive sentences for each violation. The House agreed to the change. But Gov. Bob McDonnell was unhappy with the amended bill. He sent it back to the General Assembly with a recommendation that consecutive-sentencing stipulations be added to laws of the nine mandatory-minimum crimes that were not covered, including rape and production of child pornography. Also on that list were various offenses involving gang activity, violating protective orders, shooting or throwing missiles at vehicles, transferring firearms, forcible sodomy and object penetration. McDonnell’s version of the bill flew through the House on a 95-3 vote, but narrowly passed the Senate on a 23-17 vote. Obenshain voted for the bill and Herring voted against it. "Sen. Herring did not support the Governor's recommendation because it deprived judges of too much of their existing discretion and made the justice system less flexible," Kevin O’Holleran, a Herring spokesman, said in an email. "Sen. Herring has supported mandatory minimums and strong penalties for crimes against children in the past (including life sentences) and this bill did not affect the length of any sentence for any crime." A study by the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission suggests the new law will cause little change in the actual time offenders spend in prison. The research examined 130,531 criminal sentences imposed in the state between mid 2005 and mid 2010. Of those crimes, only 18,659, or 14.3 percent, involved mandatory-minimum offenses. Only 3,225, or 2.5 percent, involved convictions on multiple counts of mandatory-minimum offenses. And of those 3,225 cases, the report says judges imposed sentences below consecutive-term standards only 3.1 percent of the time. That breaks down to about 100 cases over five years, or 20 cases annually. Now, keep in mind that those 20 annual cases in which judges used sentencing discretion could have involved nine different offenses -- not all of them sex crimes. Meredith Farrar-Owens, director of the sentencing commission, said her agency lacks data to break down by each offense the instances when judges used discretion in passing out sentences on multiple count, mandatory-minimum convictions. "It’s a small percentage of a small percentage of cases where judges elected not to give consecutive sentences," she said. Our ruling Obenshain said Herring voted to allow sex offenders to "serve shorter sentences." Herring voted against a bill that ended the sentencing discretion judges had in rare cases when some sex offenders and a few other types of criminals were convicted on multiple counts. Because judges occasionally invoked their option to allow inmates to serve multiple prison terms concurrently, there’s a slight basis for the claim that Herring’s vote would allow some offenders to serve shorter terms than they would have if the judges had no choice. But for the most part, Obenshain’s claim is misleading. Herring’s vote would not have shortened the prison time faced by sex offenders, it merely would have continued the the sentencing procedures in place. And Obenshain, in his broad reference to sex offenders, omits the fact that only a tiny percentage of them had circumstances in their cases that allowed for discretion in sentencing.

pomt-03853	"The majority of my contributions have been from private individuals" giving $125 on average, "not from PACs, not from groups."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/13/ed-fallone/ed-fallone-says-majority-his-contributions-supreme/	In his bid to unseat Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Pat Roggensack, challenger Ed Fallone is embracing the underdog role. That, he said, shows up in his campaign contributions. "We don’t have deep pockets," Fallone told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors March 6, 2013. "I am very proud of the fact that, through my first campaign finance report, the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals, not from PACs, not from groups." Fallone, a Marquette University law professor making his first bid for office, said "the average size of my contributions to date has been $125." Roggensack, considered part of the court’s conservative wing, did dominate the fundraising game before the Feb. 19, 2013, primary. She raised nearly three times Fallone’s total from Jan. 1 to Feb. 4 of 2013, though the amounts were modest for a statewide race, the Journal Sentinel reported. The two face off in the April 2, 2013, election. Let’s examine Fallone’s assertion that "the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals" giving $125 on average, "not from PACs, not from groups." The money trail Fallone reported raising about $75,000 for the period. His two largest campaign gifts came from political action committees (PACs) organized by unions representing Madison teachers (the maximum $8,625 donation) and other public employees ($8,500). The third biggest, an individual donation from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, was $5,000. In all, Fallone’s four PAC contributions made up about 24 percent of his receipts, roughly $18,000. Donors who gave as individuals made up more than three-fourths of his cash gifts. Looked at another way, by the number of donors, all but a handful of his 500 givers were individuals, not PACs. So the guts of Fallone’s claim is on target. To be sure, Roggensack can make the same claim; less than 5 percent of her pre-primary donations came from PACs that included two county-level Republican Party units, the Milwaukee Police union, bankers, builders and utilities. She raised about $202,000 in 2013 before the primary. Case closed? Not entirely. In his claim, Fallone said "PACs" and "groups." And there is a nuance here that alters the picture a bit. About one-sixth of Fallone’s money was given by individuals, but bundled up by special-interest groups and sent to the candidate in one check from the group. These are known as "conduit" donations. The approach allows corporations, unions and other groups to present larger checks to candidates than they could under the rules for PACs. By state law, the donors are publicly disclosed and listed as individual donors on campaign finance reports. And in media accounts they are typically counted as individual donors. So Fallone has cause to count them that way. But they are not just individual donors. In Fallone’s case, Wisconsin trial lawyers banded together as the "Justice Fund" conduit, and education union employees in the United Staff Union, combined to make up 71 of his slightly more than 500 donors. When those are combined with PAC contributions, they represent 41 percent of his total contributions. That’s a far bigger amount than PACs alone. However, even if you count the conduit bucks as group gifts, individuals still make up almost 60 percent of Fallone’s donations. And his claim was simply they made up a majority. For her part, Roggensack received a small number of conduit donations, most notably from the Fund for Parent Choice, whose backers support the school voucher program. As for the average size of the donations from individuals, Fallone said it was $125. Our calculation came up with $114. So he’s a bit high, but on the right side considering his point is the modest amounts of his typical gifts. Of course, third-party interest groups are allowed to spend independently on behalf of the Supreme Court candidates. Those amounts are reported separately from the candidate’s campaign funds and they are not supposed to coordinate their campaign efforts with the candidates. Before the primary, two union-funded groups spent modestly on campaign literature in support of Fallone. The Wisconsin Club for Growth spent on behalf of Roggensack’s campaign. Our rating Fallone said "the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals" giving $125 on average, "not from PACs, not from groups." Not all private individuals are created equal, we found, but Fallone’s analysis is reasonable, his numbers are on target and his claim about average gift size is slightly off but in his favor. His statement is accurate with those clarifications. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Ed Fallone	None	None	None	2013-03-13T09:00:00	2013-03-06	['None']
pomt-15263	Russia and China "absolutely said pretty clearly" they would not keep economic sanctions on Iran if the United States "walked away from the deal."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/30/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-tells-huckabee-russia-china-said-clea/	The Obama administration says the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran is a significant improvement over the status quo. Critics say the opposite — that no deal would be better. A recent exchange between Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly and Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee pivots around this point. O’Reilly argued that the alternative to an agreement was war, which Huckabee dismissed as an Obama talking point. To Huckabee, the better play was to continue and strengthen economic sanctions on Iran, forcing them into a position of weakness. O’Reilly equally dismissed that idea. "Russia and China told us if we had walked away from this deal that they were not going to obey the sanctions any longer," O’Reilly said. Huckabee said that wasn’t "for sure." But O’Reilly doubled down. "They absolutely said pretty clearly," O’Reilly replied. Russia and China certainly could knock the teeth out of any economic sanctions if they pulled out. Did they signal those intentions to the United States? Conventional wisdom As part of the nuclear agreement, the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany agreed to phase out various economic sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy in exchange for concessions in Iran’s nuclear program. Lifting sanctions against Iran was a top concern for Russia, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in April. "In general, we are principled opponents of the use of methods of pressure in international relations, of restricting lawful rights of states in selfish, lucrative interests," Lavrov said. "It is a short-sighted policy, which, as a rule, has a boomerang effect on its authors." News articles cited by O'Reilly's staff highlight U.S. concern that if a deal was not reached, then some countries, including Russia, China and India, would no longer observe sanctions because they were not seen as a permanent solution. Experts share that view. "It was unlikely the coalition supporting sanctions could have been kept together indefinitely to maintain pressure on Iran, and there was little appetite either domestically or internationally to use force to disable Iran’s nuclear program," said Francis Gavin, the Frank Stanton Professor in Nuclear Security Policy Studies in MIT’s Department of Political Science. Vipin Narang, an MIT associate professor of political science and author of Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era, said, "A more stringent sanctions regime would have been virtually impossible to construct and sustain." Obama repeated these concerns in April. "If it is perceived that we walked away from a fair deal that gives us assurances Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon, then those international sanctions will fray," he said. "And it won’t just be Russia or China. It will be some of our close allies." In fact, Russia and China were barely acknowledging sanctions as they were. The United States’ sanctions on Iran can be traced back to the 1979 hostage crisis, while sanctions by the United Nations go back to 2006. Additional sanctions have been placed on Iran since then by the United States, European Union and United Nations. Together, these sanctions affected Iran’s nuclear, missile, energy, shipping, transportation, and financial sectors, according to the Department of State website. The hope of these sanctions was to starve Iran of the resources it needed to proliferate its nuclear and missile programs, and encourage Iran to sit down for talks. Before the Iran deal was even struck, both Russia and China had already ignored some of the U.S. and E.U. sanctions. Based on their past actions, it is unlikely that either country would have had a sudden change of heart and supported continued sanctions against Iran if the deal had fallen through. Russian leaders have said they only recognize the U.N. Security Council sanctions. Richard Brennan, senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation, said even though he does not know of any explicit mention of Russia or China saying they would stop sanctions against Iran, O’Reilly’s "meaning is accurate." Records of sanctions against Iran compiled by the Jewish Virtual Library show that in spite of the sanctions, both Russia and China have profited from Iranian oil, and Russia has continued to sell weapons to Iran. Our ruling O’Reilly said that Russia and China "absolutely said pretty clearly" they would not keep economic sanctions on Iran if the United States "walked away from the deal." Russia and China certainly have given signals that they both wanted sanctions against Iran removed. Both Russia and China have a history of ignoring sanctions that have been placed on Iran. Experts say that if the United States, one of the strongest supporters of these sanctions, had abandoned the deal, then it is likely that China, Russia and possibly other countries would have disregarded these sanctions. O'Reilly is pushing the envelope when he said "absolutely" clear, as they haven't issued formal statements. But all of their actions indicate that what O'Reilly said is substantially accurate.

pomt-05612	"Up to 80 percent of small businesses will be forced to give up their current plans due to new Obamacare regulations."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/27/senate-republican-conference/senate-republican-web-video-says-obamas-health-car/	Senate Republicans focused on what they called the president’s "broken promises" near the two-year anniversary of the health care law. A Web video posted March 22, 2012, by the Senate Republican Conference details eight promises it says President Barack Obama has broken, countering with claims of its own. We’re checking a few of them -- for example, the claim that Obama didn't keep his promise about reducing health care premiums. (We found Republicans’ response Mostly False.) In this check, we’re focusing the Republicans' response to Obama's statement on Aug. 15, 2009: "No matter what you've heard, if you like your doctor or health care plan, you can keep it." Back then, we found a similar claim by the president just Half True. In this case, we’re fact-checking the response, offered by the Senate Republican Conference video in text on the screen: "Reality: Up to 80% of small businesses will be forced to give up their current plans due to new Obamacare regulations." We wondered, is that the case? ‘Relinquishing their grandfathered status’ We talked with Kyle Downey, communications director for the Senate Republican Conference. He pointed us to a table that includes an 80 percent figure. The table was published as part of the government’s interim final rules on "grandfathered status" for group health plans and health insurance coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It matches a table published by Health and Human Services, also in June 2010. Grandfathered status means that employer plans are allowed to remain largely as they were before the law was enacted. As long as a health care plan doesn’t substantially change, it won’t have to comply with all parts of the new health care law, for example, the requirement that preventive health services be covered without any cost sharing. That provision was the subject of the recent contraceptives debate. (All plans will have to meet some of the law’s requirements, such as no coverage exclusions for children with pre-existing conditions, no lifetime limits on coverage and extending parents’ coverage to young adults under 26.) An employer may even switch to a similar plan with a different insurer, as long as it doesn’t make changes such as cutting benefits or increasing out-of-pocket spending. If employers made such changes, say, by raising co-pays by more than $5, it would have to comply with the rest of the law, triggering requirements for a wider range of benefits that could cost more. The 80 percent reflected the high-end estimate of the number of small employer plans that may "relinquish" grandfathered status by 2013. By comparison, the mid range estimate was 66 percent. The low-end estimate was 49 percent. 'Forced' Is giving up grandfathered status the same thing as small businesses being "forced to give up their current plans"? Not necessarily, said experts we spoke with on both sides of the health care debate. Timothy Jost, a health care law expert at Washington and Lee University School of Law, argues that small employers won’t be "forced" to give up their plans under the new law. They would have to change their plans themselves to lose their grandfathered status. "If a small business (or individual, or large business) keeps its current plan, it is grandfathered, period," he said. Eighty percent of small businesses may lose grandfathered status "simply because they change their plans so much that they are no longer the same plan," he said. Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a consultant to both the Gov. Mitt Romney and Obama administrations in designing their health care plans, also takes issue with the word "forced." "A key thing to watch out for in this debate is mixing up voluntary actions with ‘forced’ actions," he said. "What the (Health and Human Services) memo says is that almost 80 percent of small firms will move out of grandfathered plans. It doesn’t say that they will be forced out — most of the moves will be voluntary as firms move to plans that they prefer. We don't know what the split is between voluntary and involuntary moves. Even before Obamacare, most small firms change plans over time." Downey, the Senate Republican Conference spokesman, and health care expert Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute, argued the law will force employers to change plans. Downey disagrees with Jost’s assessment that a plan change by an employer that would trigger loss of grandfathered status makes it a different plan. "The idea that losing grandfathered status means the plan has changed is a bit silly — a $5 co-pay increase is enough to trigger loss of grandfathering," Downey said. "The idea that such a small co-pay is tantamount to changing one's plan is frankly absurd." In other words, he argues that since a small change can trigger the requirement to comply with the health care law, it’s essentially forcing employers to comply. Tanner, the author of the report "Bad Medicine: A guide to the real costs and consequences of the new health care law," argues that changes would be forced because "if you lose grandfathered status, when you renew, you have to come into compliance." And the law will make it harder for employers to maintain their current plans, his report says. Insurers won’t be able to enroll new business customers in plans that don’t comply with the law, meaning they may stop offering them. That would "force" companies to lose their grandfathered status, he argued. "There's no doubt that a significant number of them will have to because of the new law," he said. "... I think 80 percent is the high end of the range, but there's no doubt that a lot of people will be impacted in that way." How many businesses might change because they have no choice compared with those that shift voluntarily to pursue cheaper, better coverage? "It's really hard to tell," he said. Health and Human Services argues the switches will be primarily voluntary. "The new health care law creates an online marketplace where small business owners can easily compare plan benefits and costs and determine if they qualify for a new tax credit for health insurance, which brings greater transparency and competition and affordability to the market," said Erin Shields, communications director for health care for HHS. "When this new marketplace is online, it will be easier for small businesses to compare their options and choose the best private insurance plan for themselves and their employees. "Of course small business owners also have the option to keep the plan they had before the law was passed as well." Our ruling A Senate Republican Conference video argues that "up to 80 percent of small businesses will be forced to give up their current plans due to new Obamacare regulations." In doing so, it is choosing an estimate that is at the high end of a range that also includes estimates of 66 and 49 percent, but the video does say "up to." Businesses give up that status by changing their plans, whether by choice or because of the exigencies of the market. The health care law doesn’t directly force businesses to give up their plans, which makes the statement only partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-03228	Under Obamacare, "The IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2013/aug/19/eric-cantor/cantor-says-obamacare-gives-irs-access-personal-he/	During a recent floor debate, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor warned of dire consequences from the IRS implementing portions of Obamacare and collecting taxes to help pay for the health care reforms. "The IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information," Cantor, R-7th, said Aug. 2. He expressed distrust of the IRS, referring to disclosures earlier this year that the agency gave special scrutiny to the Tea Party and other conservative groups seeking tax exemptions. Giving the IRS access to personal medical records "is nothing short of an unwelcome big government overreach into the most personal aspect of our lives," Cantor said. Shortly after his comments, the House, in a party-line vote, approved the "Keep the IRS off your Health Care Act" that would bar the IRS from any involvement in Obamacare. The measure, like 39 other House-approved bills that would end or dismantle the health care act, is expected to die in the Senate. Cantor made a similar statement during a July 27 broadcast, saying, "The doctor’s office is the last place anyone would want to find the IRS. Your health care information is private and should remain so." We wondered whether Obamacare really would give the IRS access to records of our illnesses, surgeries and prescriptions. We asked Cantor’s office for proof. His spokesman, Rory Cooper, cited a June 18 article in the conservative Breitbart.com about a rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Starting in January, Obamacare will require people who can afford health insurance to buy coverage or pay a tax penalty. Many who are now uninsured are expected to buy policies through insurance exchanges that are being set up. The rule requires private companies participating in the exchanges to submit information about new customers to HHS so the agency can assure that these people have bought at least the minimum levels of coverage required by Obamacare and verify those receiving federal assistance buying their policies fall into qualifying income categories. The Breitbart article discusses concerns by some conservative organizations and publications that HHS might share that information with the IRS. But the story stops short of Cantor’s claim that the IRS will have access to the data. HHS officials repeatedly have said they will not be seeking intimate details from medical histories and guaranteed the department will not share the information with the IRS, as reported by this spring by our colleagues at PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org. Again, it should be noted that the data will not be collected on everyone, just those who buy coverage through exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 26 million people living in the U.S. in 2020 -- less than 8 percent of population -- will be insured by the exchanges. Twice since May, IRS officials have testified at House hearings that they will not have access to private medical records. The agency’s website states, "Nothing in (Obamacare) allows the IRS to access individual’s health information, including information about individuals’ health status and any health care services received." The IRS will share tax information to help HHS determine whether low-income families and individuals qualify for assistance in purchasing insurance. A computer system is being developed that will give HHS instant access to that information. But it will be a one-way system, and the IRS will not be able to view HHS records. So how will the IRS identify uninsured Americans who must pay Obamacare’s penalty tax? "Taxpayers will get a form at the end of every year from their insurer to use when they prepare their tax returns," then-IRS Deputy Commissioner Steven Miller told a House subcommittee in September 2012. "It is important to note that the information that insurers provide to the IRS will show the fact of insurance coverage, and will not include any personal health information. In most cases, taxpayers will file their tax returns reporting their health insurance coverage, and/or making a payment, and there will be no need for further interactions with the IRS." Our ruling Cantor said that under Obamacare, "the IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information." But he offers no hard proof, just speculation on a blog. The IRS will play a major role in Obamacare by collecting a variety of taxes that will help support the program. But contrary to Cantor’s claim, IRS officials have repeatedly testified before Congress that they will not have access to the intimate details of anyone’s health records. Cantor’s unfounded statement does nothing more than amp up public fear for his ongoing fight to repeal Obamacare. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-09181	The American Power Act "would cut our dependence on oil in half."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/03/votevetsorg/votevetsorg-claims-cap-and-trade-bill-would-halve-/	A recent TV ad from the left-leaning VoteVets.org, which represents American veterans, takes a circuitous route to its real agenda: a plug for the American Power Act, the latest version of the cap-and-trade bill introduced on May 12, 2010, by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. The ad begins with nasty images from the oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico. Then we are introduced to Evan Wolf, a Louisiana National Guardsman who was assigned to Gulf Coast clean up. "When I signed on to the National Guard, I did it to help protect Americans from our enemies, like in the Persian Gulf, not to clean up an oil company's mess here in the Gulf of Mexico," Wolf says. He holds up a freezer bag filled with a murky goop. "We'll do whatever mission we're given and do it well," Wolf says. "But America needs a new mission. Because whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas, our dependence on oil is threatening our national security. "Thing is, a clean American energy plan would cut our dependence on oil in half. It's more power for America, made here in America. Putting our people to work using all the resources we have." We then get images of solar and wind farms. "Some folks in Washington say now is not the time to clean American power," Wolf says, and then dabs at oil staining a Louisiana beach. "I've gotta ask -- if not now … when?" By way of background, Wolf was a Democratic candidate for the Louisiana House in 2007. He lost, but a Democratic National Committee web page suggests he's at least mulling another run. VoteVets explained that the ad is advocating for the American Power Act, and that it is that bill that "would cut our dependence on oil in half." That's the claim we are checking here. The American Power Act is the latest version of the cap and trade bill that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Obama put in a plug for the bill in a speech on June 2, 2010, in Pittsburgh. "The time has come, once and for all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future," Obama said, and vowed it would become an administration priority. "The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months," Obama said. VoteVets backs up the ad's claim that the American Power Act would "cut our dependence on oil in half" by citing a 2009 analysis from the National Resources Defense Council of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which was passed by the House on June 26, 2009. The bill sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of market-based (cap-and-trade) mechanisms, incentives for energy efficiency and the development of clean energy. The Council's report on the House bill last year concluded that if the bill passed, America's dependence on foreign oil would be cut in half by 2050. But the same report projected that while oil imports would be halved, overall oil consumption would drop by about 12 percent between 2010 and 2050 (from 17.1 million barrels per day to 15 million barrels per day in 2050). We note that in the ad, Wolf doesn't say the bill would cut consumption of foreign oil in half, it says the bill would "cut our dependence on oil in half." There's a difference. VoteVets, which is backing the video with a $1.5 million ad buy, contends the context of the ad makes clear that they are talking about oil imports, but we don't agree. The ad is set against the backdrop of an oil drilling catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. In his setup, Wolf frames the discussion as "whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas." That seems to us like he's talking about oil consumption in general and the need for the United States to ween off it. Reducing dependence on foreign oil would not reduce drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. It's also worth noting that the government did an analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill and didn't paint quite as rosy a picture as the Council. The U.S. Energy Information Administration would only project to 2030 (not 2050). But the EIA's report projected relatively little change in overall liquid fuel consumption. The report did forecast that U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports would decline, from 8.26 million barrels per day in 2010 to 6.3 million barrels per day in 2030. That's a roughly 24 percent decrease. But the report also projected a decline in foreign oil imports even without the bill. There are a numbers of reasons for that, said Jonathan Cogan, spokesman for U.S. Energy Information Administration: a slight increase in domestic oil production; increased use of bio-fuels; tighter fuel efficiency standards; and an expected rise in oil prices. The EIA has not yet finished its analysis of the American Power Act, Cogan noted, though it should be completed in mid to late June. The goals of the Senate bill and last year's House bill may be the same, but the mechanisms are a little different, so using the EIA report on the 2009 House bill to judge the 2010 Senate bill is an "imperfect comparison," Cogan said. However, Daniel Lashof, director of the Council's Climate Center, said the basic provisions are similar enough that the 2009 analyses are legitimate. Therefore, he said, the Council is comfortable with the projection that the American Power Act has the potential to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by 50 percent by 2050. Lashof said part of the reason the Council's projections differed from the EIA's is that EIA did not account for the potential boost to domestic oil production by capturing carbon dioxide from power plants. Recovered carbon dioxide -- encouraged by the bill -- can be injected into depleted oil fields to enhance oil production, Lashof said. As a result, he said, the NRDC projects a slight increase in domestic oil production between now and 2050 under the bill, but in a safer way "not subject to the kinds of risks of going into deeper and deeper water offshore." In summary, the ad claims that if the American Power Act is passed, it would "cut our dependence on oil in half." VoteVets says they were talking about cutting dependence on foreign oil in half. And they point to a credible report from the Council that projects a similar bill would cut foreign oil imports in half by 2050. A spokesman for the EIA says basing a projection of the effect of the 2010 Senate bill on an analysis of a similar, but different, 2010 Senate bill is an "imperfect comparison." We also note that the EIA's analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill is less optimistic than the NRDC. But most significantly, we think the context of the ad suggests Wolf is talking about cutting overall oil consumption -- not just foreign oil imports -- in half. If they were only talking about oil imports, why would Wolf be standing on an oil-stained beach in Louisiana? Perhaps newer reports will ultimately back up the VoteVets claim, but they based their claim on a 2009 report that actually projects a much smaller reduction in overall oil consumption. And so we rate the claim Half True.	None	VoteVets.org	None	None	None	2010-06-03T18:28:08	2010-05-26	['None']
pomt-14685	Says Chris Christie "instituted an Internet sales tax."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/conservative-solutions-pac/marco-rubio-superpac-says-chris-christie-imposed-i/	New Jersey's Republican governor and presidential candidate Chris Christie is under attack for his tax policies by the Conservative Solutions PAC, a political action committee that supports GOP Sen. Marco Rubio for the presidency. It is not directly tied to the Rubio campaign. In a 30-second TV commercial, the super PAC said that "Christie could well be (President) Obama's favorite Republican governor." One reason given by the narrator: "He instituted an Internet sales tax." The accompanying graphic, beneath a photograph of Christie with a smiling Obama, shows a Wall Street Journal headline from July 16, 2012, which says, "Christie Embraces Online Sales Tax." Republicans tend to be passionately opposed to new taxes so we wondered if that was the whole story. First, some background. Currently, under a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision, if a customer lives in a state with a sales tax, online companies only have to collect that tax if the company has a physical presence -- such as a warehouse -- in that state. Otherwise, it's up to the consumer to directly pay the tax to the state in the form of a "use" tax. The use tax, which nearly all consumers ignore, will become important later in this fact check. The absence of a sales tax on Internet purchases puts local brick-and-mortar businesses at a competitive disadvantage, which is one reason some states would like to tax Internet sales. Another reason, obviously, is that it brings in extra revenue. But critics point out that it can be a nightmare for companies that do business over the Internet to keep track of the widely-varying rules and rates in all the states, counties and municipalities that have a sales tax. So what's Christie's role in all of this? When we contacted the Tampa-based Conservative Solutions PAC, spokesman Jeff Sadosky sent us several links to articles showing that Christie supports an Internet sales tax, including federal legislation designed to standardize the collection system for all states. We also found the 2012 Wall Street Journal report, cited in the commercial, reporting that Christie was one of several Republican governors pushing for a tax on online purchases to help deal with their fiscal crises. But the super PAC didn't just say he supports the tax. It says he instituted it, and here it gets a bit more complicated. New Jersey started getting serious Internet money when Amazon, the online retail giant, decided to build two distribution centers in New Jersey as part of an effort to improve delivery. But Christie didn't have to do anything to get that revenue. (In fact, the state delayed Amazon's requirement to collect New Jersey sales taxes for two years.) "By building a warehouse, Amazon then has physical presence in the state and must automatically begin collecting sales tax on sales to residents in the state. This is automatic, unless a state passes legislation to exempt them (as one or two have, for a limited transition period of time)," said Joseph Henchman, vice president for state projects at The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues. Amazon also negotiates deals with individual states. It currently pays sales taxes to 27 of the 44 states with such a tax. What Christie -- and the state legislature -- did was institute was a "click-through nexus" tax law, commonly called an Amazon tax. It makes Internet companies responsible for collecting the sales tax from New Jersey customers if they, in essence, have middlemen in the state. Said Henchman: "These are laws that expand the definition of physical presence to something beyond having employees and property in the state. For example, the New York law said that any non-present retailer, who has contracts with in-state people to refer potential customers for compensation, is physically present." Nineteen states now have such laws, he said. They're becoming popular after the New York Court of Appeals upheld that state's law and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. New Jersey's law was part of the 2015 budget signed by Christie. It applies to out-of-state online retailers who meet two basic criteria. First, their cumulative income from sales to New Jersey consumers must exceed $10,000 per year. Second, the retailer must have a referral program. That's where a person or business in New Jersey gets a cut of the profits when sending a consumer to the retailer's out-of-state website and the consumer makes a purchase. A true Internet sales tax, one unencumbered by all of these rules, would require federal legislation. But there's a final twist, as acting state treasurer Ford Scudder pointed out. None of this adds to the tax burden of New Jersey residents. Remember the "use tax" we mentioned earlier? Residents were already required to pay that sales tax directly to the state on all Internet purchases. "From our way of thinking, this is not a new tax," Scudder said. "All this is saying is, rather than putting the onus on individual (to pay the use tax), it's on the company" to pay the same amount as a sales tax. Henchman of the Tax Foundation agreed, "It's a different way of collecting an existing tax, albeit a tax that wasn't being paid." Our ruling Conservative Solutions' attack ad says Chris Christie "instituted an Internet sales tax." Internet businesses with a physical presence in the state were required to collect a New Jersey sales tax long before Christie took office. For businesses outside the state, Christie did expand the requirement that online businesses pay taxes when they have an agreement with an individual or a business in New Jersey to promote their products. The ad says "implemented," which implies that Christie imposed a new tax burden on residents. In fact, the money New Jersey is collecting through Internet sales is, by law, already owed to the state -- either through the sales tax collected by the business or the use tax that's supposed to be paid by consumers. Because the statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context, so we rate it Mostly False..	None	Conservative Solutions PAC	None	None	None	2016-01-14T17:00:00	2016-01-04	['None']

pomt-02145	"For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/05/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-40-times-more-kentuckians-have-gott/	Now that more than 8 million Americans have signed up for coverage under Obamacare, the White House has all but declared victory after the law’s initially troubled rollout. But many of the law’s critics continue to see the law as a disaster. A reader sent us a newsletter to constituents released by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a critic of the law and a potential presidential candidate in 2016. Here’s an excerpt from the newsletter, which was dated May 2, 2014: "Since the implementation of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians have received cancellation notices from their current health care providers. For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage. Obamacare has been presented to the American people through twisted rhetoric, smoke and mirrors. Obamacare is not good for America and it certainly (is) not good for Kentucky. I would like (to) hear how Obamacare affected you, your family or your small business. Share your story by visiting my website." The claim that leapt out at us was, "For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage." Could that really be true? We took a look at the data. How many Kentuckians have received cancellation notices? Tracking cancellations isn’t so easy, because cancellations are issued by private health insurance companies, and regulations differ in each state. The Associated Press assembled a comprehensive, 50-state look at Obamacare-related cancellations and concluded that, in Kentucky, 130,000 people received cancellation notices. Meanwhile, the Kentucky Department of Insurance has put the number at 168,000. So a reasonable number for cancellations in Kentucky is probably between 130,000 and 168,000. How many Kentuckians have signed up for Obamacare? The answer depends on your definition of "Obamacare." The broader measure includes both signups for private insurance at the state-run Kynect insurance marketplace, as well as signups for Medicaid, the longstanding government-run health insurance program for the poor that Kentucky chose to expand under Obamacare. In late April 2014, the state announced that 82,795 Kentuckians had purchased private plans on Kynect and 330,615 others had qualified for Medicaid coverage, for a total of 413,410. Data from the federal Department of Health and Human Services that counts a few more weeks of signups had slightly higher numbers. Comparing the two numbers Using just these numbers, Paul is either wrong or very wrong. The smaller number -- private-insurance number of signups (82,795) -- is exceeded by the number of cancellations (up to 168,000), but at most, the discrepancy is only twice as big, not 40 times as big. But it’s not clear that this is the right number to use. Paul’s newsletter didn’t only refer to private plans, and the Medicaid expansion was just as much a part of Obamacare as the marketplaces for private health insurance plans. So if you include both types of signups (413,410), then the combined Medicaid and private-insurance signups in Kentucky actually exceeded the number of cancellations by more than double. So Paul’s claim is not just off-base, it’s actually going in the opposite direction. In fact, the 40-times-higher claim is ridiculously off-base. If you take the smallest possible number of signups (82,795, counting just the new private plans) and multiply it by 40, you’d need more than 3.3 million cancellations to make the math work. Yet as of 2011-12, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were only about 2.2 million Kentuckians who had insurance that could even theoretically be canceled -- either insurance purchased individually or provided by employer. The remainder either had government-provided insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid or were uninsured. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that the number of employers who drop coverage in the future "could be a real issue," but for the 2014 statistics, she said, Paul’s calculation seemed "wildly off base." Our inquiries to Paul’s office were not returned. Our ruling Paul said that "for every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage." That’s not mathematically possible. If you take the narrowest definition of "sign-ups," there would have to be 3.3 million cancellations in the state for Paul’s statement to be accurate -- and there aren’t even that many Kentuckians with private insurance plans that could theoretically be canceled. In fact, it’s reasonable to argue that more people in Kentucky have coverage through Obamacare than have been canceled. Paul’s statement is so wildly off that we rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE, May 6, 2014: After we published this item, Paul’s office contacted us to explain how they calculated the 40-to-1 ratio of cancellations to signups. The office said that "the numbers he used were accurate as of November of last year" but that staffers failed "to update the numbers for the newsletter." Specifically, Paul’s office said that a Nov. 8, 2013, news release from the Kentucky governor’s office reported that 7,011 Kentuckians had enrolled in a private health plan through Nov. 8, compared to the 280,000 Kentuckians who the state believed at the time might be subject to cancellation notices. However, in the six months since, the number of private-plan signups has soared by a factor of 10, while the state released a smaller estimate of cancellation notices (168,000). Even in November, Paul’s estimate was cherry-picked; it excluded the 33,561 Kentuckians who enrolled in Medicaid, a program that saw its eligibility expanded under Obamacare. Even though the new numbers were available to Paul’s staff at the time the newsletter was put together, Paul’s office counted only the first two months of signups and ignored the final six months, a period when enrollment rose steadily. Our ruling stands: Pants on Fire.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2014-05-05T17:38:23	2014-05-02	['None']

pomt-08737	"Florida is 49th in per capita spending on mental health care."	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/31/bud-chiles/chiles-says-florida-ranks-49th-capita-mental-healt/	Florida has long had a poor reputation for spending on social services. Bud Chiles, running as an independent for governor, criticizes the state's spending on mental health care. On his website Chiles said: "Nearly $3 billion dollars -- 10 percent of our state’s general fund -- is going to pay for Florida’s prisons. Meanwhile, Florida is 49th in per capita spending on mental health care, and 65 percent of inmates need substance abuse treatment and aren’t getting it. The only way to end this cycle is through community solutions. Let’s stop using a prison cell to solve problems when an ankle bracelet and drug counseling is proven to be more effective. Let’s get resources to communities so that they can provide services locally at less taxpayer expense, creating local jobs and real results." In this Truth-O-Meter item, we wanted to explore Chiles' claim that Florida is 49th in per capita spending on mental health. We spoke to Chiles on Aug. 31, 2010, who directed us to campaign spokeswoman Katie Ottenweller. She said the source of their information was a July 4, 2010, editorial in the Tallahassee Democrat by David L. Miller, a retired senior vice president of Florida Power Corp. who had been chair of the Florida Substance Abuse and Mental Health Corp. The editorial stated that during the 2010 session, Florida legislators cut the $190,000 needed to continue the corporation, which was an independent, nonprofit created by the Legislature. "The lack of services in Florida is shocking and embarrassing, as well as very costly," Miller wrote. "Our state ranks 49th in per capita spending for mental-health care, an abysmal ranking borne out by the thousands of people who cannot get treatment and end up in our jails, prisons and on the streets." Miller did not attribute the per capita spending comparison. PolitiFact Texas looked at a similar claim made by a candidate for lieutenant governor earlier this year. Marc Katz said that Texas ranked 50th -- last -- in per capita mental health spending. PolitiFact ranked that claim Mostly True because one state was lower than Texas: New Mexico. That item cited a report by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, Inc., posted on a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation website statehealthfacts.org that compares 50 states' and the District of Columbia per capita mental health spending. The chart ranked Florida 49th with $38.17 per capita followed by Texas at $34.57 and New Mexico in last place at $25.58. That report was based on fiscal year 2006 data, said Ted Lutterman, director of research analysis, in an interview. The 2007 report showed Florida 48th but Hawaii did not report and if it had, Florida would have been 49th, Lutterman said. The report based on 2008 data will be finished soon, said Lutterman, who said he is missing Alaska. But Alaska has always been ahead of Florida so he expects Florida to rank 49th again. "It's been consistent for several years," Lutterman said. We reached out to several other organizations in the mental health field to determine if they had any other information about Florida's mental health spending ranking. The National Alliance on Mental Illness gives states a grade, and in 2009 gave Florida a "D." The "Grading the States 2009" report evaluates measures such as the number of programs delivering evidence-based practices, emergency room wait-times, and the quantity of psychiatric beds by setting and whether Medicaid reimburses providers for all, or part of evidence-based practices; and more. In 2009, the organization gave six states an "F" and 21 states a "D." The report card is not based on per capita spending but gives us a general sense of how Florida compares -- somewhere in the bottom half of states. The nonprofit Mental Health America published a report in December 2007 called "Ranking America's Mental Health: An Analysis of Depression Across the States." Appendix B, which compares state mental health authority expenditures per capita for 50 states plus the District of Columbia, stated that Florida spent $35.96 while three states were lower: Arkansas $35.96, New Mexico $27.78 and Kansas $23.14. That report was based on 2004 data, said spokesman Steve Vetzner. A Sept. 10, 2009, letter to the editor in the Sun-Sentinel from Bob Sharpe, CEO and president of the Florida Council for Community Mental Health, states that Florida is 49th in per capita mental health spending but does not attribute the source of the ranking. We left a message for Sharpe but did not hear back. So how does Chiles' claim stack up? He said that Florida was 49th in per capita spending on mental health. The campaign cites an editorial that does not provide the source for the 49th figure. The Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, Inc., concluded in a 2006 report that Florida ranked 49th and that figure has been quoted several times by mental health experts such as Sharpe. Mental Health America wrote in a 2007 report that Florida was 48th -- but it was based on earlier 2004 data. Based on the information we could find, we rate this claim True.

pomt-03284	"They’ve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after this law (Romneycare) was implemented."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/04/elizabeth-roberts/theyve-seen-employer-supported-coverage-increase-m/	One of the defining public policy debates of our time has been about Obamacare, formally the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010. So PolitiFact Rhode Island was listening closely to the July 28, 2013 broadcast of Channel 12 "Newsmakers," on which Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts appeared. She is a leading figure in the debate, as chairwoman of the state Healthcare Reform Commission, which is charged with implementing Obamacare in Rhode Island. Providence Journal reporter Felice Freyer, one of the panelists, asked Roberts a hot-button question about Obamacare, which calls for the creation of state health insurance exchanges where individuals who don’t have health insurance or are seeking an alternative to plans provided by their employers may buy their own coverage. Since World War II, employer-paid coverage has been a cornerstone of health care insurance in the United States. Any possibility that the cornerstone will crumble has been a major topic in the debate. The Obamacare exchange is scheduled to open for enrollees in Rhode Island Oct. 1. After that happens, Freyer wanted to know, might employers just cancel their own insurance -- in order to save money and trouble -- and fob off their employees on the exchange. In reply, Roberts pointed to "Romneycare." That is the seven-year-old health care insurance program in Massachusetts nicknamed for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and often cited as the model for Obamacare. "They’ve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after [Romneycare] was implemented," Roberts declared. "I think lots of people were worried [that employers might drop coverage] but it hasn’t been what has happened." Are more Massachusetts employers providing coverage now than before "Romneycare?" First, a little background. Obamacare requires businesses with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. In Massachusetts, a penalty that applied to businesses with 11 or more employees was in force until July 1, when it was abolished in anticipation of the implementation of the Obamacare penalty. But then implementation of the federal employer mandate and accompanying penalty unexpectedly were delayed until 2015. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has warned employers in his state not to take advantage of the hiatus by dropping their insurance. A trip to the website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority, the agency that oversees Romneycare, showed that Roberts had her facts right. In 2001, well before Romneycare took effect, 69 percent of Massachusetts employers offered insurance, according to the Connector. As of 2010, four years after Romneycare was enacted, 77 percent offered insurance, the Connector says. Fresher data from another government body, the Center for Health Information and Analysis of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, confirmed the trend. From 2005, the year before Romneycare was signed into law, through 2011, the percentage of employers offering insurance increased from 70 percent to 76 percent, according to a survey of employers. And a study by the independent Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, "Massachusetts Health Care Reform: Six Years Later," found that employer coverage had not decreased. When we checked with Roberts’ office about the basis of her statement, her spokeswoman, Maria Tocco, referred us to the Health and Human Services survey, albeit from a companion report. Nationally, according to Massachusetts authorities, only 60 percent of employers offer health insurance. Asked why more Massachusetts employers offered insurance even though an alternative had been created, Jason Lefferts, the Connector director of communications, said the business community responded to a call to duty from government when health care reform was enacted. "We saw great buy-in from the business community" and an acceptance that health care is a shared responsibility of the individual, business and government, Lefferts said. "There was a message that everyone was in this together." The Massachusetts authorities went even further on the Connector website, to predict that as employment rebounds in their state, "reliance on public sector insurance will decrease." Lefferts said the business community’s track record makes that a safe prediction. Our ruling Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts said that Massachusetts has "seen employer-supported coverage increase" since "Romneycare" was implemented. Massachusetts officials have published figures that back her up. The judges rate her claim True.	None	Elizabeth Roberts	None	None	None	2013-08-04T00:01:00	2013-07-28	['Massachusetts', 'Massachusetts_health_care_reform']

pomt-02950	Wisconsin sold fresh water to California, helping that state's dairy industry, and "lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/28/amardeep-kaleka/wisconsin-sold-fresh-water-california-potential-de/	After their father and five other worshippers were shot to death on Aug. 5, 2012 at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., brothers Amar and Pardeep Kaleka became active with Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Pardeep said in a video for the national group, of which the Oak Creek and Milwaukee mayors are members, that 34 Americans are murdered with guns every day. We rated his statement Mostly True. Ten months later, Amar (also known as Amardeep) stepped into an even more public role, announcing plans to run in 2014 against eight-term U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate. Kaleka, a 35-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker, was interviewed about his planned candidacy on the Oct. 20, 2013 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. When Gousha asked Kaleka what he would say to people who might view him as a one-dimensional candidate focused on guns, Kaleka turned the conversation to the economy. "I mean, gun legislation is just one of the many things that are holding us down economically. A number of other things, immigration reform, the economic disparity that we’re experiencing, has to do with our thoughts and models that we’ve had in place for now, well over two decades," he said. "I mean, the Midwest is a great example of how we’re losing so many factories and manufacturing jobs and agricultural jobs. For example, we used to be called America's Dairyland. Now, California is called America's Dairyland. We sent them fresh water, and we sold it to them. Ultimately, we didn't get anything in exchange. We lost a bunch of jobs, a bunch of farmland." It’s been two decades since California eclipsed Wisconsin in milk production, although Wisconsin still calls itself America’s Dairyland. But we’ve never heard that Wisconsin had sold fresh water to California to boost their dairy industry -- and lost jobs and farmland in the process. Wouldn’t there have been a titanic hue and cry if that had ever happened? Big ideas To be sure, there have been some grandiose proposals to sell Great Lakes water to faraway places. In 1998, a Canadian company actually obtained a permit from Ontario to ship fresh water by tankers from Lake Superior to Asia. But after a backlash in Canada and the United States, the permit was canceled two weeks later. In 2007, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Richardson raised the possibility of exporting Great Lakes water to the Southwest, calling for a national water policy and saying "states like Wisconsin are awash in water." But less than two weeks after Richardson’s comments rattled Midwest politicians, his campaign issued a statement saying Richardson "in no way proposes federal transfers of water from one region of the nation to the other." The following year, the eight Great Lakes states reached agreement on the Great Lakes Compact, which bans Great Lakes water from being "diverted," or piped out of the basin, with a few exceptions, such as the possible sale of Lake Michigan water from Oak Creek to another Milwaukee suburb, Waukesha, which is under consideration. Even then, Waukesha would have to return 100 percent of the water by volume to the lake by discharging treated wastewater to the Root River in Franklin. Even with the compact, officials remain wary of outsiders coveting Great Lakes water, said Tim Eder, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate agency that promotes the development, use and conservation of water in the Great Lakes basin. So, was there a Wisconsin sale of fresh water to California before the 2008 compact? "No way. It's really simple," Eder said of Kaleka’s claim. "He’s wrong. I don’t know where he’s getting his information, but it’s not based in fact." Two other experts -- Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water use section chief Eric Ebersberger, and Peter Annin, managing director of the University of Notre Dame Environmental Change Initiative, which does research on water resources -- were also dumbfounded and emphatic: No water sale to California has ever occurred. And if it never occurred, it certainly didn’t boost the dairy industry there, or mean lost jobs or farmland here. Indeed, federal figures show that in 2012, Wisconsin produced 27.2 billion pounds of milk, a record for the state, and led the nation by producing 2.79 billion pounds of cheese. Said Annin, author of "The Great Lakes Water Wars": "I’m not aware of any instance where the State of Wisconsin, or anybody in the state of Wisconsin, sold water to California. There’ve been a lot of weird proposals, but they’ve never actually happened." We also checked with the federal Mississippi River Commission, which assured us that water from the Mississippi River was never sold to California. Kaleka, meanwhile, told us he meant to say "we thought about sending them fresh water." He added: "I'm going to have to take my hit on this. It was a sloppy response to a very big problem of local and national economics." But on even that he is off. None of the information Kaleka provided us indicates that Wisconsin even considered selling water to California. And we could find no record of it. Our rating Kaleka said Wisconsin sold fresh water to California and "lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland." There’s no evidence of such a water sale, something that would have made for countless front-page stories, let alone it leading to a loss of jobs and farmland in Wisconsin. The statement is false and ridiculous: Pants on Fire. You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's web site.

pomt-06421	Congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but "zero on job creation."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/25/facebook-posts/blog-post-says-gop-has-sponsored-zero-job-creation/	A reader recently sent us a post circulating on Facebook and on blogs that blames the House Republican majority for focusing their legislation on lots of topics -- except for job creation. Here’s the text of the chart: "The numbers: Republicans have introduced 44 bills on abortion, 99 on religion, 71 on family relationships, 36 on marriage, 67 on firearms/gun control, 522 on taxation, 445 on ‘government investigations,’ and zero on job creation." It cites as its source a post on the liberal website Daily Kos written on Oct. 21, 2011, by Minnesota-based blogger and self-described "unrepentant liberal" Myles Spicer, "Given that these Representatives were elected to pass job creation bills so needed by our country, what has the House been doing this past year?" Spicer asked in his post. "Well, mostly they have occupied themselves with a variety of social, moral and value issues. ... The Congressional Research Service (CRS, a non-partisan arm of Congress that tracks such things) offers an appalling look at our current Congress’ activities. "They have introduced 44 bills on abortion (one just the other day reaffirming existing legislation on this subject). 99 on religion. 71 on family relationships. 36 on marriage. 67 on firearms and gun control. 552 on taxation—and though most were to reduce taxes, there have been no significant changes on tax law with all time invested and bills introduced. And finally a massive 445 bills on ‘government investigations.’ There is a category labeled ‘job creation legislation’ originated by Congress, and tracked by the CRS. In that category the CRS reported: ‘No bills at this time. The Congressional Research Service has not tagged any bills in the current session of Congress with this issue area.’ If ever the analogy of ‘rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic’ was apt, this is it!" We wondered about the accuracy of the post based on Spicer’s argument, so we took a look. We didn’t find anything about legislative subject headings at CRS’ own website, but we did find a list of subjects for current legislation at THOMAS, the legislative-tracking website run by the Library of Congress. Using THOMAS, you can search bills that have been offered during the current Congress -- the 112th -- by their CRS subject matter. The list of subject areas begins in alphabetical order here. When comparing the numbers, we allowed for some variation due to the list being continuously updated as new bills are introduced. That said, we found that the numbers in the Internet post were quite close to what was listed in THOMAS for abortion, religion, family relationships, marriage, firearms, taxation and government investigations. What about "job creation"? As it turned out, we couldn’t find a topic area by that name at all. We located Spicer and asked him for his sourcing. He told us he had used the website opencongress.org, a non-profit, non-partisan database of legislative and other congressional data. He pointed us to this page, where a category of bills categorized under "job creation" is listed. "Job creation" had zero entries. We quickly noticed two things about the database. First, the numbers cited on opencongress.org for the social issues and other topics in the chart were close to what THOMAS had -- in other words, they closely followed the CRS subject headings. And second, "job creation" was only one of many, many topics that had zero bills associated with it in the opencongress.org database. We reached David Moore, executive director of the Participatory Politics Foundation, which runs opencongress.org. He said that his website displays not only CRS issue labels used for bills pending in the current Congress but also labels that have been used at least once in the past three Congresses, even if none have been applied yet to bills in the 112th Congress. By Moore’s count, opencongress.org includes 4,795 issue areas in all. But only a fraction of these subject headings have any bills listed under them, because CRS has not tagged any bills with those headings during the current Congress. We did not hear back from CRS or THOMAS, so we don’t know why CRS has used the "job creation" label in the past but not this year. However, our research suggests that the lack of bills labeled "job creation" this year doesn't mean there have been no bills aimed at promoting employment introduced in the current Congress. Why? The House version of President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act -- which we’re sure the president and his supporters would characterize as a "job creation" bill -- doesn’t even get slapped with that subject heading. The bill -- officially H.R. 12, introduced on Sept. 21, 2011, by Rep. John Larson, D-Conn. -- is listed under no fewer than 68 separate subject headings, including "aviation and airports," "Buy American requirements," "electric power generation and transmission," "Internet and video services," "metals," "solid waste and recycling" and "water use and supply." But it doesn’t carry the label "job creation." Instead, several closely related subjects have been applied to H.R. 12, including "economic development," "economic performance and conditions," "employee hiring," "employment and training programs," "labor and employment," "unemployment" and "wages and earnings." And how many bills have been introduced under these other headings? Here’s the list. (Some bills may be included in more than one category.) Economic development: 64 bills Economic performance and conditions: 55 bills Employee hiring: 24 bills Employment and training programs: 172 bills Labor and employment: 151 bills Unemployment: 107 bills Wages and earnings: 143 bills In reality, then, six of these seven jobs-related categories included more bills than either abortion or marriage, and four of the seven included more bills than religion, family relationships or firearms. We see a few additional problems with the post. It’s wrong to say that only Republicans sponsored bills on social issues, taxation and government investigations. For every legislative subject cited in the ad, the THOMAS list includes bills introduced both by Republicans and Democrats. We checked each topic area to make sure that Democrats had offered bills on those topics, and in each case, they did. So it’s wrong for the post to say that "Republicans have introduced" that many bills. Both parties have. (Spicer, to his credit, did not make this mistake; the creator of the subsequent post did. "When I state that these folks were elected to get us more jobs, I did not exclude the Democrats," Spicer told PolitiFact.) It’s wrong to point to this data as evidence that Republicans are going hog wild on "government investigations." To be sure, Republicans are using their control of House committees to probe government operations, including potential corruption and scandals. (The Democrats did the same after 2006 when they controlled Congress and George W. Bush was in the White House.) But it’s wrong to suggest that the 445 "government investigation" bills amount to evidence in support of this tendency. Most of the bills tagged with this category are there because they contain some sort of oversight mechanism, such as defining who will oversee a newly created federal program and how. So most of these bills involve run-of-the-mill government oversight mechanisms, not an effort to gin up high-profile administration scandals. Keep in mind that these categories are very broad. Labeling a bill with a subject category doesn’t mean the bill is primarily about that issue. For instance, a very, very large number of congressional bills have some impact on the tax code, even if it’s tangential. That’s why so many bills get categorized as being tax-related. To one degree or another for the other, this pattern holds for subject headings, too. The "religion" category doesn’t just include bills of interest to conservative Christians, as someone reading the post might assume. It also includes the "Noose Hate Crime Act of 2011," sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas and the "Veterans, Women, Families with Children, and Persons With Disabilities Housing Fairness Act of 2011," sponsored by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas. "Job creation" means different things to different parties. Most conservatives today are dead-set against traditional forms of government-based economic stimulus known as Keynesian economics, primarily spending initiatives. So if "job creation" is defined to primarily include Keynesian initiatives, then Republicans aren’t going to be sponsoring any "job creation" bills. Instead, Republicans argue that tax cuts and budget cutting will help the economy prosper. Our ruling While congressional Republicans have certainly introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, the claim that the GOP has focused on issues other than job creation just isn't supported. The numbers cited in the post include Democratic bills, and the definition of what constitutes a "job creation" bill is open to significant debate. But the post’s most important flaw is the contention that Republicans have offered "zero" bills on job creation. This number stems from a methodology that also excludes Obama’s American Jobs Act from the category of "job creation" bills. If you look at alternative job-related subject headings, the number of bills offered by lawmakers from both parties actually exceeds most of the social-issues listed in the blog post.

pomt-10768	He received "A" ratings from "every conservative organization that gives ratings."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/22/tom-tancredo/many-but-not-every/	During a Republican debate in Orlando, Fla., on Oct. 21, Rep. Tom Tancredo boasted about his high ratings from conservative groups. "The American Taxpayers Union, for one, gives me the highest rating; the American Conservative Union, highest rating of anybody running for president of the United States; an A rating from the National Right to Life; an A rating from every organization -- every conservative organization that gives ratings to those of us who are here on this stage." Tancredo consistently ranks near the top of Republicans when measured by conservative organizations, oftentimes earning an "A" grade. The American Conservative Union indeed gives him the highest rating -- last year alone and by lifetime average -- of any presidential candidate. Still, Tancredo manages to be a bit misleading about his credentials when claiming the "highest" rating from other groups or that "every conservative organization" has given him an "A" rating. First- there is not, to our knowledge, an organization called the "American Taxpayers Union." Since Rep. Tancredo cites his "A" grade from the "National Taxpayers Union" on his website, we'll assume he meant them. While he did garner an "A" from the National Taxpayers Union, it wasn't the highest grade among the Republicans seeking the presidency. Tancredo's 2006 score was 76%, an "A." His average score over the past 8 years was 78.4%. Rep. Ron Paul has him beat on both counts, with a 2006 score of 84% and an average of 86.9% over the past 10 years. On Tancredo's website, there's a voting record scorecard showing his receipt of "A" grades from seven conservative organizations. Omitted from that list, however, is the powerful, fiscally conservative group, The Club for Growth. The Club for Growth, known for mounting serious primary challenges against Republican incumbents it feel aren't conservative enough, has been keeping tabs on Members of Congress since 2005, said Club for Growth spokesperson Nachama Soloveichik. Tancredo's score, on a scale of 0-100, was an 88 in 2005 and an 80 in 2006. Soloveichik tells PolitiFact that although they haven't translated the numerical scores into letter grades, members must score a 90 or above to earn their "Defender of Economic Freedom Award," and Tancredo fell short of that. So overall, we give his claim a Mostly True.	None	Tom Tancredo	None	None	None	2007-10-22T00:00:00	2007-10-21	['None']

pomt-05097	Says Rep. Charles Bass "supports privatizing Social Security, risking trillions more on Wall Street."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/29/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-kuster-distorts-bass-record-social-security/	Social Security may not be in the news as much as it has in past elections, but congressional candidate Ann McLane Kuster wasted no time this month making it one of the first talking points in her 2012 election bid. Just minutes after filing her election papers, Kuster, a Concord Democrat, accused her Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Charles Bass, of supporting the privatization of Social Security. "Unfortunately for New Hampshire, my opponent is part of the problem," Kuster told supporters during a June 7 rally outside the Statehouse. "He supports privatizing Social Security, risking trillions more on Wall Street," she said. "Our country and our state cannot support more of the same from Congressman Bass." Kuster and Bass know each other well. In the 2010 race, Bass defeated Kuster by a tight 2 percent margin. But, how well does Kuster know the Congressman’ stance on Social Security? We decided to check the records. To support Kuster’s claim, her campaign staff pointed us first to a series of votes and statements Bass has made on the matter over his years in office. Bass, a Peterborough Republican, served six terms in Congress between 1994-2006 before returning to office in 2010, and the matter of Social Security came up several times during his first years in office. In 2001, President George W. Bush launched the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security to look into the future of the institution. In December of that year, the 16-member panel issued its final report, which urged Congress to incorporate a system of private accounts for personal investment. Opposed by Democrats, the commission’s recommendations never reached the floor of Congress for a vote. But, the House did consider a number of proposed resolutions and amendments on both sides of the issue. Bass joined each of his Republican colleagues in voting against H.AMDT.245, a Democrat sponsored amendment that would have prohibited any funding of the commission’s recommendations. Kuster’s staff pointed to the amendment, which failed 188-238, as evidence of Bass’ support for privatization. But, according to analysts, the amendment was more of a partisan pre-emptive strike than a true endorsement of privatization. "He may have (supported privatization)," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute. "Republicans generally did at that point, but this vote was certainly not a vote that could be read that way." Over the years to follow, several efforts to push a privatization bill fell short at the committee level. But, Bush brought the issue to the forefront once again when he included it in his 2005 State of the Union address. In the Feb. 2, 2005 speech, the president outlined a plan for partial privatization, which he pledged to make a key part of his second term agenda. Immediately following the speech, Bass issued a written statement supporting the President’s plan, which reflected one of the recommendations of the 2001 commission. "I am an advocate of the President's call for Social Security reform and will work with him in the next two years to save and protect this important program," Bass wrote, according to the National Journal and Project Vote Smart. Six weeks later, Bass further endorsed Bush’s plan during stops in Claremont and Lebanon, N.H. "I support the establishment of private savings accounts because it allows low- and middle-income workers the chance to get ahead," Bass said, according to the Eagle Times, of Claremont. President Bush’s plan, to allow workers under 55 the option of directing up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into private accounts, came as close as political discourse has reached in recent years to a debate over privatization. "Virtually no one has proposed replacing all of Social Security with private accounts," said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "Given the way the debate has evolved, being for ... privatization doesn't mean you’re for privatizing the whole darn thing." In past rulings, PolitiFact has determined that the private accounts proposal does not meet the definition of full privatization. In August of 2010, President Barack Obama earned a Mostly False ruling on a similar claim about Congressional Republicans, and later that month, Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln earned the same rating on a claim about her opponent, Rep. John Boozman. Bass’ position on Social Security, like those of other Republicans addressed in these past PolitiFact pieces, is in support of giving taxpayers the option of investing in private Social Security accounts, according to campaign spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne. "To address this financial crisis facing the Social Security program, one such idea Congressman Bass has supported would create a program that would allow individuals to voluntarily place a portion of their money that they currently pay as part of the payroll tax and place it into a personal account," Tranchemontagne wrote in an email to The Telegraph. "Saying that (he) supports ‘privatizing Social Security’ is pure political rhetoric devised by Democrat spin doctors to frighten seniors." Our ruling: Bass, like most other Congressional Republicans at the time, supported President Bush’s plan to introduce the option of private savings account into the Social Security equation. This partial privatization plan would have brought change to the system, but, as PolitiFact has ruled in the past, it would not affect people older than 55 and it does not meet the criteria for full privatization, as Kuster claims. We rate her statement Mostly False.	None	Ann McLane Kuster	None	None	None	2012-06-29T18:02:49	2012-06-07	['None']

pomt-02728	"We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/19/jack-roberts/does-oregon-lottery-show-people-playing-and-winnin/	The Oregon Lottery has churned plenty of money into the state’s coffers since its inception in 1984. It’s now a $500 million-a-year cash cow, with 86 percent of that coming from video slot and poker machines. Of course those proceeds also mean big losses for players. Many of them, as The Oregonian’s Harry Esteve showed in a recent series on the Oregon Lottery, are problem gamblers who lose thousands of dollars a year playing video lottery machines. Jack Roberts, who became the Oregon Lottery director Dec. 1, 2013, took issue with the series and its contention that the lottery uses "aggressive" marketing to get people to play video slots. In a Dec. 11, 2013, interview on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s "Think Out Loud" radio show, he defended lottery advertising. "We’re very careful in terms of our marketing," said Roberts, Oregon’s former labor commissioner. "We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games." But we had seen an ad that showed people playing and wondered whether that’s true. PolitiFact Oregon decided to get to the bottom of it. The lottery has several ads, including print, radio and television spots. Some talk about how money from the lottery helps parks or fish habitat, for example. Others encourage people to buy scratch-off tickets. PolitiFact Oregon also found two videos on the lottery website, one that is also being shown on television. The one that appears on television shows a young woman zipping up a life vest to paddle a kayak on the Willamette River. It also shows a man putting on a helmet for a motorcycle ride. A voice-over talks about gambling responsibly by setting a time limit and a budget as the video shows someone setting a smartphone timer for 20 minutes and circling "Entertainment" on a sheet of paper next to a "150." Then it shows the woman and man playing an Oregon Lottery video game and breaking into broad smiles, the man pumping his fists, after the woman pushes the button. The second video can be viewed only on the lottery’s website by clicking the words "Click here to see how much fun Video Lottery can be." It shows various people smiling and laughing as they play Oregon Lottery slot machines. In one scene, three people cheer and clap as they win; the video shows three fives lined up on the game screen. In another scene, two people brim with elation and high-five as they look at a video game screen. At the end, a voice tells viewers that "Lottery games are based on chance and should be played for entertainment only." Next we contacted Roberts’ office in Salem and asked about his assertion. Through lottery spokesman Chuck Baumann, Roberts provided this statement: "My reference to marketing referred to our advertisements for the lottery. I was not referring to our responsible gambling ads, where we believe it helps to show people gambling in order to demonstrate what responsible gambling means. Even these ads mainly show side shots of the machines and do not portray players winning a jackpot or celebrating their winnings. My statement was in response to accusations that we run ads glorifying gambling in order to attract more players. In fact, we do not." We called Jeff Marotta, who works with problem gamblers and who, until recently, belonged to a lottery advisory group. Marotta, president and senior consultant at Problem Gambling Solutions, said he had seen the "kayaking and motorcycling" ad on television for the first time the night before. However, it wasn’t the first time he’d seen the ad. He saw it in September, when lottery officials asked him to critique new responsible-gambling ads showing people playing "VLTs," -- or video lottery terminals. "The images in the final segment of these ads show men playing VLTs with attractive women by their sides, smiling at the man and the machine," Marotta wrote to lottery officials in a memo dated Sept. 25, 2013. "The message that VLTs are fun and attractive are further accentuated by the peppy music, announcer tone, choice of actors, association with cool activities…" He ended the memo by writing, "In sum, these responsible gambling ads could be viewed as wolves in sheep’s clothing and in my opinion should not be aired." Marotta told us his long-term contract to advise lottery officials was terminated soon after. "Was it this that burned my bridge with them?" he said. "Maybe. I’ll never know for sure." Roberts, in a follow-up email, noted that he became director after Marotta’s departure as a consultant. He added, "Our advertisements about responsible gambling are in fulfillment of our obligation to operate the lottery in a manner commensurate with the public interest." He did not elaborate on his earlier claim that the ads don’t show people playing or winning video games. But Baumann, in a later phone conversation, said Roberts had not seen the website-only video at the time of his OPB comments. It’s true that Roberts had been on the job less than two weeks when he made the statement on OPB and understandable that he had not seen one of the ads. The lottery has many ads, and the website has many pages. The kayaking ad is more problematic. The Oregon Lottery does classify it as a "responsible gambling" ad. But Roberts, on OPB, said of lottery marketing: "We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games." He didn’t mention a distinction. Neither would that distinction be clear to viewers. And as Marotta noted, the ad -- showing young, attractive people having a great time -- would be unlikely to dissuade people from gambling. Finally, despite Roberts’ statement on OPB, even the kayaking ad clearly shows people not only playing but enthusiastically smiling and reacting to an apparent win. We find Roberts’ statement False.

pomt-14571	Says she "is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors (John) Kasich and (Chris) Christie combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/08/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-her-campaign-has-more-cash-hand/	When Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was denied a spot in a debate just days before the New Hampshire primary, she took to Medium to argue her case. Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, compared herself to some other Republican candidates in the race, including Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. She wrote, "Despite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics — and the ones that actually matter: "In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich. "She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0. "Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined." Fiorina never managed to snag a spot at the debate, but we decided to take a look at the third of Fiorina’s bullet points -- the one about about her fundraising totals. (For the record, she was right on both of the previous two bullet points. Fiorina got 3,485 votes in Iowa, or 1.9 percent, which was ahead of Kasich by 11 votes and ahead of Christie by 201 votes. That translated into one delegate each for Bush and Fiorina and none for Christie.) For fundraising data, we turned to opensecrets.org for the latest presidential fundraising data. Here’s the table, in descending order, for hard dollars raised, defined as money raised by the candidate’s own campaign committee. The most recent data available at the time of her Feb. 6 statement was through Dec. 31, 2015. (Opensecrets.org does not have data for one Republican candidate still in the race, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore.) Candidate Hard dollars raised 1. Ben Carson $54,036,610 2. Ted Cruz $47,086,857 3. Jeb Bush $31,922,100 4. Marco Rubio $29,710,092 5. Donald Trump $19,405,217 6. Carly Fiorina $11,349,057 7. John Kasich $7,582,365 8. Chris Christie $7,159,329 So Fiorina was indeed sixth on the list. That’s not saying a whole lot -- she was ahead of only two candidates, and she had barely half the amount of the fifth-place finisher. How about cash on hand, which means money raised minus money already spent? Candidate Cash on hand 1. Ted Cruz $18,734,794 2. Marco Rubio $10,398,593 3. Jeb Bush $7,589,858 4. Donald Trump $6,964,325 5. Ben Carson $6,567,647 6. Carly Fiorina $4,484,307 7. John Kasich $2,537,301 8. Chris Christie $1,126,158 Fiorina was right that she had more cash on hand than Kasich and Christie combined; they totaled $3,663,459. Here too, that’s no great shakes -- she still ranks sixth of the eight candidates in cash on hand Our ruling Fiorina said she "is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined." While it’s worth noting the context that she ranks far back in the pack, Fiorina is right on both counts, according to the most recent public filings. We rate her claim True.

pomt-07258	Says state budget deal between Texas House and Senate leaders "funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities and provides financial aid for college students."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/may/27/joe-straus/speaker-straus-says-state-budget-deal-funds-nursin/	Joe Straus, the Texas House speaker, recently joined Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in announcing a compromise between House and Senate negotiators on the 2012-13 state budget. Straus elaborated in a May 20 press release: "The agreement that we reached with the Senate today funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities, and provides financial aid for college students while keeping substantial revenue in reserves and avoiding any new taxes." Check on keeping money in reserve and not raising taxes. But is it fiscally defensible to crow about funding education and nursing homes in this tight budget cycle? To our inquiry, Straus spokeswoman Tracy Young pointed out that specific numbers wouldn’t be available until the inked deal was published as the proposed budget. In the meantime, we turned to news reports on the budget deal, which was reached months after the state comptroller’s revenue forecast for 2012-13 left lawmakers grappling with a projected shortfall of more than $20 billion to maintain existing spending or services. First, let’s look at the public schools. The Austin American-Statesman noted May 24 that the agreement gives public school districts $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would get under current law. Lynn Moak, a lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, told us it allocates about $37 billion to districts -- "less money for schools than schools were counting on under the normal school formula process." But Moak said districts will be "a lot better off" than they would have been under the first House-approved budget, which would have given the schools at least $7.8 billion less than they stood to draw under existing formulas. And state support for higher education? Overall, the agreement cuts that funding about 10 percent in 2012-13, the Dallas Morning News reported May 23. Specifics include: a 25 percent reduction in a fund to help universities reach elite status as research institutions; a 5 percent cut in general academic funding formulas and a 10 percent cut in funding for the state’s nine health science centers, the newspaper said. Also, the number of Texas college students getting state-backed scholarships will drop by 41,000 from the 153,738 students now getting that aid, the News reported. That’s a 25 percent hit. That includes 29,000 fewer poor and lower-midde-income students who will receive TEXAS Grants, intended for poor and lower-middle-income children. Then again, the budget deal protects formula funding and scholarships at community colleges, state Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas told the Morning News. We ran the higher education numbers by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, whose spokesman, Dominic Chavez, said state aid to higher ed is actually slated to drop about 8 percent in 2012-13. He said all state-backed college financial aid will decrease 23 percent, with 43,258 fewer students benefiting. To gauge funding for nursing homes, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates at the Capitol for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. Spokesman David Thomason said the budget agreement maintains an already-imposed 3 percent reduction in the rate paid for serving nursing-home residents on Medicaid -- more than erasing the 2.7 percent rate increase approved by the 2009 Legislature. Thomason said the association doesn’t expect homes to close due to the lowered Medicaid rate, but he predicted staffing reductions and fewer nursing-home slots available to Texans on Medicaid. Summing up, public schools stand to field $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would have gotten under current law. Higher education, except for community colleges, is likewise due to sustain funding cuts plus a drop in state-supported scholarships. Nursing homes are left with lower rates than they had after the 2009 legislative session. Straus is correct the agreed-upon budget "funds" these items, but his statement fails to acknowledge the funding is mostly at lower levels than before. That’s vital missing context. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Joe Straus	None	None	None	2011-05-27T06:00:00	2011-05-20	['Texas_House_of_Representatives']
pomt-12416	Before Obamacare, Wisconsin’s "high-risk pool" for health insurance "had eight or nine" plans to choose from, people "could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted, and their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/19/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-claim-wisconsin-being-model-covering-pe/	The Affordable Care Act put an end to insurance companies charging higher health insurance premiums to people for having a pre-existing condition. But the Republican replacement for Obamacare would make that practice possible again. GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan says not to worry, just look at how his home state of Wisconsin took care of people with pre-existing conditions before Obamacare. So let’s see what case he's making. The claim On May 7, 2017, three days after the House of Representatives narrowly approved the Obamacare replacement, Ryan appeared on ABC’s "This Week." He said that under the bill, labeled "Trumpcare" by some Democrats, states could ask for a waiver from the federal government that would allow insurance companies to charge higher rates for a pre-existing condition for people who had a lapse in health insurance coverage. But those higher premiums could be charged only if states also established a so-called high-risk pool or provided some other type of financial assistance that would help those people buy insurance. Ryan held up the Badger State as a model for how things could work under the GOP bill, saying: In Wisconsin, we had a really successful high-risk pool. Ten percent of the people in the individual market in Wisconsin were in the state high-risk pool. They had eight or nine plans to choose from. They could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted. And their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today. We'll check Ryan’s three-part claim, which he repeated on the Fox News Channel. He’s essentially on target on the first two parts, but not on the third. What’s a high-risk pool? The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation helps explain the rationale for creating high-risk pools: the sickest 10 percent of the population accounts for nearly two-thirds of all health spending. But questions remain about the effectiveness of high-risk pools and whether there would be enough public dollars allocated to them under the GOP bill to make insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool "was a lifesaver" for those it served, Kaiser health reform and private insurance senior fellow Karen Pollitz told us. But it served only some of the people who were eligible, and for it to be viable nationally, "you would have to put down a whole lot of money, more than has been put in the House bill so far," she said. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool -- the Wisconsin Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan -- operated from 1979 through 2013. It was funded through policyholder premiums, reduced payments to health care providers and financial assessments on health insurance companies. At the end, it insured 21,000 people and was regarded as among the most successful programs in the country, even though not everyone with preexisting conditions who needed coverage could afford it. Also, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool did not contain the same coverages as Obamacare plans -- for example, it had a lifetime limit for benefits, whereas Obamacare does not. So, understanding the limited nature of Wisconsin’s high-risk pool, we go to the three parts of Ryan’s claim. Ryan’s claim Ryan was close on the number of plans available in Wisconsin’s high-risk pool. There were seven options (not eight or nine) in place with deductibles ranging from $1,000 to $7,500, although one was only for Medicare recipients seeking supplemental coverage. Ryan also was close on provider availability. All hospitals and doctors who were Medicaid-certified could be used by high-risk pool recipients. That included all hospitals in the state and the vast majority of doctors, said Sam Austin, a health policy analyst at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Population Health Institute and the author of a 2013 Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau report on the state’s high-risk pool. Finally, Ryan’s staff pointed out that Wisconsin’s deputy insurance commissioner has told Congress that people in the high-risk pool had to pay more for coverage under Obamacare. But it can’t be flatly stated that all premiums and co-payments in the high-risk pool were lower than those under Obamacare, Austin and other experts told us. As we noted, under options available in the high-risk pool and under Obamacare, premiums, deductibles, coverages and subsidies all vary. Kaiser’s Pollitz told us that if medical inflation were taken into account, the Wisconsin high-risk pool costs would generally be higher than the current Obamacare rates. And high-risk pools expert Jean Hall, a Kansas University health policy professor, told us that low-income people who qualify for subsidies under Obamacare are getting more coverage for less money than they were with Wisconsin’s high-risk pool -- even if there were cases where people with higher incomes got a better deal with the pool. Our rating Ryan says that before Obamacare, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool for health insurance "had eight or nine" plans to choose from, people "could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted, and their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today." The House speaker slightly overstates the number of plans and the availability of providers, but is generally on target. But it can’t be flatly stated that the high-risk pool plans were cheaper than Obamacare plans for comparable coverage. For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Ryan a Half True.

pomt-04767	Says the top 20 percent of income earners pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes.	true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/27/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-top-20-percent-income-earners-pay/	Speaking in Austin recently, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said he believes Congress will reach a compromise to extend the so-called "Bush tax cuts" before they expire at the end of this year. We were already working on a related fact-check of the San Antonio Republican: In an Aug. 1, 2012, press release, Smith touted his vote for the extension that day and said, "The top 20 percent of income earners (over $74,000) pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes." Smith, whose district takes in part of Travis County, gave similar figures in his Aug. 23, 2012, speech to the Austin-Oak Hill Rotary Club. We’ll describe those but stick to checking his earlier 20-percent claim. The Bush tax cuts are a mix of changes to tax rates, exemptions, deductions and credits enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush and extended in 2010. Smith’s press release credits its numbers to a July 22, 2012, Wall Street Journal chart, which in turn cites a July 10, 2012, study of 2008-09 data by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The Journal’s bar chart shows the top 20 percent of U.S. wage-earners made $74,000 or more and paid nearly 70 percent of federal taxes. Though there wasn’t a precise percentage on the bar chart, there was in the CBO’s report on its study: 67.9 percent. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told us by email that allowing for rounding, Smith’s full statement was correct except for some clarification needed on the $74,000 salary figure (which was also on the Journal’s chart). That’s how much a single person living alone would have had to earn to rank in the top 20 percent in 2009, Williams said, but the CBO adjusts its figures for household size. "A two-person household had to make $104,700 and a four-person household had to make $148,100 to hit the top quintile," Williams said. Whether to extend the Bush tax cuts for all taxpayers or for everyone except "rich" taxpayers is a major part of the battle in Congress, where Democratic plans have proposed extending the cuts for households with income below a cutoff point (which has ranged from $200,000 for individuals to $1 million). The Republican-majority House approved a plan extending the cuts for all taxpayers in the August vote Smith cited in his press release. During the debate, politicians have made a range of claims about how much of the nation’s revenue comes from the wealthiest households. Smith’s 20-percent statistic avoids a pitfall PolitiFact has found in some of those statements. In 2010 and 2011, Republicans fell foul of the Truth-O-Meter by claiming the top 1 percent of wage earners paid more than 40 percent of "the entire revenue" and "all taxes." That group paid more than 40 percent of all income taxes, but income taxes are only about half of the total federal revenue pie. Smith also cites "all federal taxes" -- the whole pie, including payroll, corporate income and excise taxes -- but includes a lot more taxpayers. According to supplemental data for the July CBO report, there were 23.6 million households in the top 20 percent of wage-earners and 1.1 million households in the top 1 percent. The top 1 percent, the report says, earned $282,900 or more per single-person household and paid 22.3 percent of all federal taxes. That’s closer to the stats Smith gave in his Austin speech, which included measures for the top 1 percent but referred only to share of federal income tax revenue. He told us he usually gives rounded versions of the percentages, and produced his reference material -- a chart he keeps in his wallet, based partly on Oct. 24, 2011, data from the business-backed Tax Foundation -- showing the top 1 percent earned 16.9 percent of 2009 income in the U.S. but paid 36.7 percent of federal income taxes. Our ruling Smith said the top 20 percent of taxpayers shoulder nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes. According to the CBO’s latest math, it’s 67.9 percent. We rate his statement True.

pomt-13259	"New York State has been horribly, horribly hurt by NAFTA"	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2016/oct/16/donald-trump/no-huge-impact-new-york-nafta/	New York State has less than half of the manufacturing jobs it did in 1990, state data shows. But experts disagree about why. Speaking to Fred Dicker on Talk 1300 in September, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blamed the decline on free trade. He specifically cited the North American Free Trade Agreement, a three-country accord negotiated by Canada, Mexico and the United States. He took a shot at his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by placing the blame on her husband. "Right now our jobs are being taken away from us like babies. They’re going to Mexico and other countries. We just can’t let it happen," Trump said. "New York State has been horribly, horribly hurt by NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton." New York State’s unemployment rate is almost half of what it was six years ago, and the state has more private sector jobs than ever. But the largest private sector employers in the state are retailers like Walmart and colleges like Columbia University according to the state Department of Labor. But is Trump right that the trade agreement "horribly, horribly hurt" the state? A decline in manufacturing Manufacturing jobs were already on the decline in New York State before NAFTA’s implementation in 1994. In 1990, New York State had slightly more than 1 million manufacturing jobs, according to the Department of Labor. By 1994, about 193,000 of those jobs were gone. The decline continued until 1996, when manufacturing jobs held steady for two years. Between 1998 and 2010, New York lost another 340,000 manufacturing jobs. That loss happened at the same, or slower, rate than the years immediately preceding NAFTA. Since then, the job losses have leveled off. The state has lost more than 6,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of 2010, but the rate of decline is much slower than it has been in the past two decades. Why the decline? Experts offer diverse answers on why New York State lost more than 360,000 manufacturing jobs since 1994. But none we talked to considers NAFTA the main cause. In 2011, the Economic Policy Institute released a report that found 34,300 of the state's jobs were displaced because of NAFTA. Teresa Fort, an expert in international trade from Dartmouth College, called automation the mostly likely cause. U.S. trade with other nations has affected some industries, she said. "International trade is unlikely to be the main cause of the aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment," Fort said. "But it has negatively affected workers in certain industries and areas that were displaced by foreign production." The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan research arm of the federal government, also said in a report last year that NAFTA did not have a significant impact on the United States economy because trade with Canada and Mexico only accounts for a small part of gross domestic product. The same report points to the benefits of the trade agreement. Exports to Canada have more than doubled since 1993, while exports to Mexico have more than quadrupled. The U.S. auto industry has seen a significant increase in exports to Mexico under the deal, for example. The China factor Trump is right when he says increased trade most likely caused manufacturing jobs to leave New York State. Peter Schott of Yale University and Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve wrote a report last year pinning a big part of the manufacturing decline on easier trade with China. As PolitiFact previously reported, lower tariffs set by the U.S. government for China have made trade with that country easier since the 1980s. Researchers say that’s led to the rapid decline in U.S. manufacturing. "The research evidence suggests that the impacts of NAFTA on manufacturing jobs was limited and were dwarfed by the impacts of imports from China," said Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. "In addition, manufacturing in the north has been harmed by the continued migration of manufacturing jobs to the south, where unionization rates are lower." Experts also point to the different economies of countries where we trade. Robert Lawrence of the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote earlier this year that lower wages in countries like Mexico provide an incentive for businesses to manufacture there. Wage decline In a separate analysis, John McLaren of the University of Virginia and Shushanik Hakobyan of Fordham University found wages declined in New York State during the implementation of NAFTA. They compared wages by locality from 1990 to 2000. By the end of the decade, wages had declined in New York State as a result of NAFTA, but only by a small amount. "For me the punchline is that these are all really small numbers," McLaren said. "So what we’re talking about is a change in wage growth over a decade at most around a percentage point for most workers." Some workers were more affected than others, but on average the change was small. Our ruling During a radio interview, Trump said "New York State has been horribly, horribly hurt by NAFTA." Manufacturing jobs have declined in New York State and the United States since before NAFTA was established in 1994. Experts blame the decline on several factors, like increased trade with China, automation and economic incentives for businesses to move manufacturing to other countries. Trade has played a significant role in the decline of manufacturing in New York State, but NAFTA isn’t the main cause, experts say.

pomt-01918	"I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/29/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-i-had-lowest-net-worth-any-american-p/	Former President Bill Clinton defended his wife and potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for saying they left the White House "not only dead broke, but in debt." He doubled down on it, in a way, while insisting just because they found success does not mean they are out of touch. "I think I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office," he told host David Gregory in an interview airing June 29, 2014, on NBC’s Meet the Press. "But I still could have been tone deaf. And, you know, now I don't, and we've got a good life, and I'm grateful for it." Intrigued by his comment, we wanted to know if it was accurate. Nowadays, the Clintons are not known for living on modest means. A Washington Post report says Bill Clinton earned more than $100 million from speeches given in the U.S. and abroad between January 2001, when he left office, and January 2013, when Hillary Clinton left her role as Secretary of State. She reportedly draws $200,000 for each public appearance, a new talking point among pundits who oppose her potential 2016 presidential candidacy. Clinton is considered the wealthiest living president and among the top-10 all-time wealthiest, with the Clintons’ combined net worth at about $55 million, according to the website 24/7 Wall Street, which started evaluating the net worth of presidents in 2010. But to Clinton’s point, it was not always this way. Clinton’s pre-presidential wealth The Clintons did not move into the White House with old money akin to the political dynasties of the Roosevelts, Kennedys and Bushes. And unlike nearly every other president, Clinton’s wife was the breadwinner ahead of his run for the Oval Office. Clinton sought a political career not long after graduating from Yale Law School in 1973 and marrying Hillary Rodham two years later, first winning a term as Arkansas’ attorney general in 1976 and following it up with five terms as governor. He earned $35,000 a year as governor, consistent with the lower pay of other Southern governors, as well as some speaking fees, honorariums and in-kind income, such as living in the governor’s residence. Hillary Clinton, then a lawyer and senior partner in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, earned $92,000 salary and listed her share of her law firm’s profit-sharing and retirement plan between $100,001 and $250,000, according to a New York Times examination of the couple’s finances in 1992. The Clintons listed their net worth as nearly $700,000 in a statement released a few months later, a substantial hike from the $418,692 net worth reported at the end of the 1989, according to the Washington Post. Assets included big gains in their investment portfolio (reaching $387,077) and retirement plans of $180,200, and liabilities included $65,000 mortgage for a half-interest in a condo co-owned with Hillary Clinton’s parents and a $100,000 bank loan from his last governor’s race. Was Clinton counting himself separately from his wife? We don’t know for sure, because our email wasn’t returned. But that would not be consistent with how married couples are usually treated under the tax code, an expert told us. "Most net worths of individuals, presidents or otherwise, are viewed as joint net worths," said Barbara Perry, senior fellow and associate professor in the University of Virginia Miller Center’s Presidential Oral History Program. "Most of these (presidents) did not have spouses with their own high income." Comparing against other presidents While we have a good picture of Clinton’s net worth, it is more difficult to gauge the net worths of many other presidents who served in the 20th century. The 24/7 Wall St. research is helpful but does not detail presidents’ net worth before taking office -- the crux of what we’re checking. We heard from several experts on presidents who said the data we need is just not available. Problems include a lack of uniform candidate financial disclosure requirements, inflation and changing national circumstances. "It’s one of those Clintonesque statements that can be true but who knows?" said Lewis Gould, a visiting distinguished professor at Monmouth College and scholar of William McKinley. We know some presidents are not really in the conversation. Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy all came from wealthy families, while Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush all either were successful in real estate or investments, or both. Others came from a career in public service and did not have significant family wealth, including Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Eisenhower and Woodrow Wilson. Often, people discussing the least monied presidents -- especially in the 20th century -- turn to Harry S. Truman. Truman’s money problems and bankruptcy-dodging as a result of his failed haberdashery business in the 1920s are no secret. With debts over his head, he continued to climb political ladders, first as a county judge and ultimately as U.S. senator, vice president and president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death in 1945. Truman continued to live modestly as a senator and vice president, residing in a two-bedroom apartment in Washington, D.C., shared with his wife Bess, daughter Margaret and ailing mother-in-law. Truman’s mother-in-law, not Truman, owned the well-known Truman Home in Independence, Mo., said Alonzo Hamby, a Truman biographer and distinguished professor of history emeritus at Ohio University. Even as a U.S. senator in 1935 earning $10,000, Truman was not in a solid enough financial position to save the family farm owned by his mother, Hamby said. So even though it’s not clear what his net worth was before he became president, Hamby said, "I find it very hard to believe that Bill Clinton was in a tighter financial situation." Another contender, though his term straddles the 19th and 20th centuries, is William McKinley, who was assassinated six months into his second term on September 1901. Based in Canton, Ohio, McKinley practiced law before becoming Ohio governor. The economic collapse of 1893 dealt him a personal financial setback during his time as governor, as he had co-signed loans from a friend who ended up going bankrupt (his friends helped him raise the money). He took office in 1897 and left an estate of $250,000 when he died, Gould said. We also found a document through the Gerald R. Ford presidential library suggesting that the 38th president took office with a relatively small net worth. The document, with a date of Oct. 29, 1973 (which would have been a year before Ford became president), showed a net worth of $256,378. That would have the same buying power as about $810,000 in 1992, when adjusted for inflation. Russell Riley, co-chair of the Miller Center’s Presidential Oral History Program and director of the Clinton Presidential History Project, said Clinton’s claim did not strike him as much of an exaggeration, "if an exaggeration at all." "He may have taken it one step too far by asserting he was No. 1 on the list, but if he’s not No. 1 he’s somewhere near the top," Riley said. Our ruling Clinton said, "I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office." Without a doubt, Clinton’s net worth was one of the lowest of 20th century presidents, experts told us. Whether it was the lowest is hard to say, and we could not find information to support it. There’s a good case to be made that Truman entered the White House with a (albeit unknown) smaller net worth. There’s not enough evidence to prove Clinton correct, but he is at least right in his larger point: He did not enter the White House with the wealth of many of his contemporaries. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2014-06-29T19:52:05	2014-06-29	['United_States']
pomt-09699	The House health care bill pays for "about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/06/wall-street-journal-editorial-page/house-health-care-bill-pays-itself-over-long-run/	Do you think the conservative editorial board of the Wall Street Journal likes the health care bill written by Democrats in the House of Representatives? Well, the headline on a recent editorial about it was "The Worst Bill Ever." The editorial disliked new regulations for the health care system and additional taxes to pay for health insurance expansions. The bill also "disguises hundreds of billions of dollars in additional costs with budget gimmicks," the editorial said. "It 'pays for' about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years. The House also pretends Medicare payments to doctors will be cut by 21.5% next year and deeper after that, 'saving' about $250 billion." We've looked into the problem of Medicare payments previously and whether that should be considered part of health care reform. We found evidence to support both sides. So we rated Sen. John Cornyn's statement about it -- "The first installment of health care reform ... will raise the deficit by $250 billion " -- as Half True. Here, we wanted to look at the claim that the bill pays for "about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years." To check on the bill's financial condition, we turned to the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, the nonpartisan budget agency that creates calculations for how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Political leaders and others regularly turn to the CBO as the definitive source for budget projections. The CBO looked at the bill's new spending, new savings and new taxes. CBO analysts added those numbers together to get the bill's impact on the deficit for a given year, and over 10 years. Generally speaking, the CBO does not provide numbers after the first 10 years, because it believes those numbers are subject to too much uncertainty. Looking at the House health care bill, it takes awhile for all the pieces of it to take effect, with different measures going into effect in different years. The requirement for individuals to buy insurance, for example, doesn't begin until 2013. People are subject to a tax penalty for not having insurance, and they'll see that penalty on the return they file in 2014. The new taxes on high-income individuals, however, go into effect earlier, in 2011. The CBO projects that these tax revenues will rise gradually over the first nine years. Meanwhile, cost savings don't start kicking in until 2012. The cost savings grow slowly but then get bigger in the last three years of the plan. (You can follow along with these numbers by looking at Page 3 of this CBO report .) The Journal editorial is right that the CBO shows the biggest costs come in the second five years of the program, from 2015 to 2019. But the cost savings are the biggest in the final years as well. Overall, the plan is in the black through 2014, dips briefly into the red in 2015 and 2016, and then pays for itself again in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Over 10 years, the bill reduces the deficit by $104 billion. The CBO did not create numerical projections for the years 2020 to 2029, but the report notes that for those years, the bill would probably result in "slight reductions in federal budget deficits. Those estimates are all subject to substantial uncertainty." To be clear, those who oppose the Democratic bill think the CBO's estimates will likely be undermined by future events. "The tax hikes will bring in less revenues than is estimated, and the spending provisions will likely be expanded over time," said Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Institution. "Even if the CBO assumes it's revenue neutral, the smart money would bet on lower tax revenues, fewer spending cuts and higher program costs." (Riedl added that he wasn't questioning the work of the CBO, he just thought it would be overtaken by political realities.) On the other hand, Edwin Park of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that it's significant that the CBO found the bill lowered the deficit over the first 10 years and also in the subsequent 10 years after that. That shows that the bill pays for itself over the long term and is fiscally sound. "The CBO has been crystal clear that it reduces the deficit in the out years," he said. The Journal editorial says the House bill "'pays for' about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years." It's true that the taxes kick in first, before many of the bill's biggest expenses get started. But the editorial doesn't mention that the CBO projects the largest cost savings for the bill's final four years, and that the bill appears to be self-sustaining starting around 2017.

pomt-03201	Says U.N. arms treaty will mandate a "new international gun registry."	false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/28/steve-stockman/un-treaty-about-weapons-systems-moving-between-cou/	CLARIFICATION, 4:06 p.m., Aug. 28, 2013: We amended this story to clarify that an explanation naming Sudan and Chad is hypothetical. "Ever since its founding 65 years ago, the U.N. has been hell-bent on bringing the U.S. to its knees," U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood, said in a recent fundraising letter. The letter, forwarded to PolitiFact by a reader Aug. 19, 2013, sought donations to the National Association for Gun Rights to battle "the U.N.’s ‘Small Arms Treaty’ " and said that the treaty’s provisions include "mandating a new international gun registry." Stockman also wrote that the treaty "sets the stage for confiscation on a global scale." A "gun registry" might facilitate that by telling the United Nations where everybody’s guns are. We wondered whether the treaty really creates a registry. We did not hear back from Stockman or the association about this claim, so we were unable to determine when the letter was sent out or to verify it had not been altered. But the same claim appears on a web page at the association’s site with a shorter version of the letter also attributed to Stockman. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims about the United Nations before, most recently finding that a letter supposedly outlining a U.N. plan to "disarm civilians" was fake. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated as Pants on Fire a chain email saying the Obama administration planned to use international treaties to ban all U.S. weapons. And in August 2012, PolitiFact Georgia tackled a claim very similar to Stockman’s. Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun said in a video from the same gun-rights group Stockman was supporting, "If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to … create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation." PolitiFact Georgia rated that claim, including its implication of confiscating guns, as False. Among its findings: A July 27, 2012, draft of an Arms Trade Treaty that failed to gain U.N. members’ approval would have required the U.S. to report information on international arms sales. Some background from that story: The U.N. has been working on a treaty to regulate the global arms trade -- not just small arms -- for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism and keep dictators from killing their own people. On April 2, 2013, according to the U.N.’s website, the organization’s General Assembly "adopted the landmark Arms Trade Treaty, regulating the international trade in conventional arms." The U.S. said "Yes" in that vote, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Jun. 3, 2013, that President Barack Obama planned to sign the treaty "before the end of August," saying it was "in the interest of the United States." For the treaty to take force in the U.S., it would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, which on March 23, 2013, voted 53-46 to insert its formal opposition to the treaty into Senate spending legislation. The text of the treaty says its purpose is to regulate the international arms trade and prevent illicit sales and transfers. It applies to arms, ammunition and parts moving across a national border, specifically conventional arms in categories such as "warships," "combat aircraft" and "small arms and light weapons." The treaty requires nations to deny authorization to exports of such armaments if they will be used for terrorism, to commit genocide, to attack civilians or in other war crimes, and to take "appropriate measures" if they detect that a shipment has been diverted. Nations are required to maintain a "national control system, including a national control list," report exports and imports to the U.N. each year and regulate brokering with measures that "may include requiring brokers to register," but the treaty doesn’t specify how countries must carry out these directions. Daniel Prins, chief of the Conventional Arms branch of the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us by phone that the national control list will be "an enumeration of the types of weapons you will report," starting with the categories in the treaty (warships, combat aircraft, etc.). Then, each year, nations will report imports and exports in the categories on their lists, Prins said: "35 tanks to Germany," for example. Countries can be more specific, but it’s up to them, he said. The treaty emphasizes that the U.N. is leaving regulation of the arms trade within a country entirely up to that country. The preamble says the parties to the treaty reaffirm "the sovereign right of any state" to regulate arms in its own territory "pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system." It also says the parties are "mindful of legitimate trade and lawful ownership." Article 12 of the treaty requires member nations to keep records of exports and says each country "is encouraged" to keep records on arms transferred into or authorized to ship through "territory under its jurisdiction." Countries are "encouraged to include in those records" the "quantity, value, model/type," the exporting and importing countries and "end users, as appropriate." Stockman’s letter includes some of the language in Article 12. Stockman wrote, "The registry must include the ‘quantity, value, model/type, authorized international transfers of conventional arms’ and the identity of the ‘end user.’ " But in the treaty, recording those details is "encouraged," not required. Though Article 12 deals primarily with exports, its language also encourages keeping records -- possibly including "end users" -- on arms transferred into a country. Prins said the importers, exporters and "end users" referred to in the treaty will most often be nations, not individuals. "This is a treaty on conventional arms, so it’s about battle tanks and attack helicopters and all that stuff," as well as small arms, Prins said. "For each individual weapons system that you export, you want to see where that ends up and where it’s being used." Giving a hypothetical example, he said, "If you send that to Sudan and the next moment you see it actually popping up in Chad, then we have an ‘end use’ issue. Because if all went well, (Sudan has) signed an end-user certificate on that transaction," meaning "they are supposed to be the last owner and user." If the weapons system were used by another country, that would be a breach of contract. He said there should be no effect on, for example, a U.S. citizen buying a gun from a foreign broker because "whatever broker you engage will need to be registered already with the U.S. government to be able to function as an arms broker." That’s because the U.S. has some of the strongest arms import and export legislation in the world, he said. With this treaty, Prins said, "we’re trying to get the world to adopt a transfer system that comes closer to what the U.S. already has." Our ruling Stockman said a U.N. treaty is "mandating a new international gun registry." His claim takes a treaty intended to curtail illicit weapons trade between countries and describes it as a step toward confiscating gun owners’ property. Nations that ratify the Arms Trade Treaty must track conventional arms that move across their borders, share some information about the transfers with the U.N. and other countries, then report the imports and exports in broad categories such as "battle tanks" to the U.N. each year. They must also regulate brokers, but requiring them to "register" is optional. Recording details such as the quantity and model of weapons in a shipment is also optional. We rate Stockman’s claim as False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-03346	"Since I was elected, crime rates have been at their lowest in over a decade."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jul/19/bill-foster/bill-foster-says-st-petersburg-crime-rates-have-be/	St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster is arming himself for re-election with a line about less crime in the city. "Since I was elected, crime rates have been at their lowest in over a decade," he said in a campaign brochure. PolitiFact Florida is keeping an ear out for claims by St. Petersburg mayoral candidates ahead of this year’s election. In this case, we already know the state’s crime rate is at a 42-year low from news reports and a previous fact-check of Gov. Rick Scott. We wanted to look at Foster’s claim about falling St. Petersburg crime and his actions to influence it. We turned to crime reports filed by the St. Petersburg Police Department to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. We searched offenses, which include both arrests and crimes in which no arrest was made, going back to 2002. Using that data, St. Petersburg’s crime rate yo-yoed from 2002-04 before decreasing steadily until 2008. The crime rate spiked in 2009, largely due to an increase in aggravated assault, larceny, burglary and stolen cars. What happened in 2010, Foster’s first full year in office? The crime rate plunged to at least a 10-year low. The rate fell again in 2011 and again in 2012. The biggest drop-offs occurred in the number of motor vehicle thefts, aggravated assaults, larcenies, burglaries and robberies, data show. Here’s a chart that shows the decline: Crime rate per 100,000 residents 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 8354 8121 8429 7980 7931 7506 7465 8255 6727 6226 5931 What’s happening in St. Petersburg is happening across the country, so it’s tough to figure out how much of an effect local law enforcement plays. The national crime rate has been declining over the past 20 years and is at its lowest points in some kinds of crime since the early 1960s, said William Ruefle, a University of South Florida St. Petersburg criminology professor who analyzes local crime. Ruefle credits modern, smarter policing. There’s also the all-time high rates of imprisonment around the country. A small number of people commit most crimes, so if they’re locked up, there will likely be fewer infractions, he said. When we asked Foster about his initiatives to reduce crime, he directed us to responses to two questions in his Tampa Bay Times editorial board questionnaire about the city’s homelessness issue. Foster pointed to several anti-crime initiatives that happened during his tenure, including a ban on panhandling; a joint police department-sheriff’s office task force focused on violent crime; new security cameras (thanks to Republican National Convention dollars); the creation of a gun bounty program targeting weapons owned illegally; adding a late-night downtown patrol unit to accommodate later bar hours; and establishing a squad that aims to address crime where it’s trending. Should Foster take the credit for declining crime? To a degree, experts said. Most of the ideas came from experts at the police department, said St. Petersburg police Chief Chuck Harmon, who has led the department since 2001. He credited Foster as being a good listener with a keen interest in crime around the city. (According to Harmon, Foster is the first mayor to get his own radio call sign. It’s X-0.) "He knew what the problem was, but it was my staff’s job to come up with the solution," Harmon said. "I will say he’s been involved with all of those things he talked about in one way or another. He could nix it if he didn’t like it." Police officials have "been scratching our heads" trying to figure out what’s driving the drop, Harmon said. Even though he can’t give a definitive reason for the big drop-off, he said the department has tried new tactics in recent years. For example, police are better monitoring offenders on probation and parole, which played a role in significantly reducing car thefts, he said. And a new unit created in the spring responded to an uptick in auto thefts during the first few months of 2013 -- most of which involved the driver leaving keys in the ignition while running into a convenience store -- by posting reminders at gas stations and on social media. "Crime prevention isn’t rocket science, but sometimes you just have to remind people: Don’t leave your keys in your car," said police spokesman Bill Proffitt. Foster wants to expand the department, which has applied for a four-year federal grant that would allow the city to add five more police officers. That would bring the force to 550 officers. Ruefle said honing in on crime spots are most likely to have an effect on addressing crime. Foster’s actions on the homeless population have also had some effect on crime, he said, as homeless residents were responsible for 15 percent of the city’s arrests and "it is much lower now." Still, it’s hard to say precisely what effect any of these policies have on the falling crime rate, he said. The big question: How long will the drop last? Both Harmon and Ruefle said it can’t keep going down at this pace. Harmon expects an increase in cybercrime will present the department with new challenges. In fact, police officials reported on July 10, 2013, that crime is up 6.2 percent for the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012. The city, however, is still on pace to have a lower crime rate in 2013 than it did in the years before Foster took office. Our ruling Foster said, "Since I was elected, crime rates have been at their lowest in over a decade." On the numbers, Foster is accurate. The crime rate is at its lowest since at least 2000. But in judging claims like these, we also must consider whether Foster is right to take credit for the drop. On that front, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. Yes, the mayor helped institute a number of new crime-fighting measures. But crime rates are down across the country, and it’s unclear how much the new crime-fighting tools helped St. Petersburg’s decline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11980	While Mayor Rick Kriseman said he would dip into reserves this year because of Hurricane Irma, he "went into the emergency reserves before Irma ever hit."	true	/florida/statements/2017/sep/29/rick-baker/rick-baker-says-kriseman-tapped-reserves-irma-hes-/	St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman and former Mayor Rick Baker offered conflicting stories about the city’s budget at their first mayoral forum since the August primary election. According to Baker, Kriseman tapped into emergency reserves this year in order to balance the city’s budget, despite record revenues. Kriseman defended himself by implying that the reach for reserves had not yet happened: "We’ve been investing in reserves every year. If we go and have to dip into reserves for this year it will be because of Hurricane Irma and the losses that have been sustained by the city in overtime." Baker didn’t let Kriseman have the last word. "Mr. Kriseman must be able to read the future, because he went into the emergency reserves before Irma ever hit," Baker said. "I don’t know how he did that." Many in the audience erupted into laughter and clapped for Baker. But was Baker’s retort right? Show us the money Basically, we found that the city has tapped into reserves. The city has plans to repay the loans. In May, the city council approved the transfer of $7.6 million to the Water Resources Capital Projects Fund to expedite infrastructure upgrades, which included projects to increase capacity at the water reclamation facilities. Half of the $7.6 million ($3.8 million) was taken out of the city’s economic stability fund — one of several types of reserve funds, and one specifically meant to cushion city coffers against economic downturns and natural disasters. The other half came from a different pot of money: the Water Resources department’s operating fund. The fund had an unappropriated balance, which, by definition, is not technically a reserve. (The Water Resources Department manages the city’s sewage and almost like an independent business.) Even though the city does not define this pool of money as reserves, some leaders consider it one and the same. In a Tampa Bay Times article, city council member Ed Montanari described the whole $7.6 million as reserves. There are many rules that govern whether reserves from the economic stability fund can be used, and one of the more relevant ones for this fact-check is the requirement for the city to repay the $3.8 million loan. That rules applies to reserves in the economic stability fund, but the city still hopes and has plans to replenish the whole $7.6 million loan after Water Resources department issues bonds. City officials said that would be in next couple months. So in this case, the city would issue bonds and sell them to investors. The city will pay back the the investors who bought one of those bonds in chunks. So the city is replenishing the money with more borrowed money. Kriseman’s team considers this "paying back" the loan, but that’s not how everyone in the city sees it. Montanari told the Tampa Bay Times he didn't agree with the city's decision to take $7.6 million to pay for sewer projects. "I don't like the fact that we're taking money from reserves and replacing it with borrowed money," Montanari told the Times. "I just want to state that on the record." So, if the city already tapped into reserves, why did Kriseman make it seem like it hadn’t? Kriseman’s campaign clarified that his comments about reserves were "strictly about the city response to Hurricane Irma." "While the city has not yet utilized the emergency reserves for Hurricane Irma, it is very likely that we will," said Kriseman spokesperson Ben Kirby. Kirby said the city will probably have to allocate reserves to pay city workers for the overtime they worked during the storm. He added that the majority of eligible expenses can be reimbursed by Federal Emergency Management Agency. Since Irma hit, the city requested FEMA assistance. Our ruling Baker claimed that Kriseman tapped into reserves before Hurricane Irma ever hit. That is accurate. Under Kriseman, the city tapped into reserves early this year to cover the costs of infrastructure upgrades, which included projects to increase capacity at the water reclamation facilities. The the city plans to issue bonds to repay the loan, but there’s no saying when that will happen. Furthermore, bonds are just borrowed money. We rate this claim True.

pomt-00444	"California is proposing to legislate what drinks restaurants can serve your kids, only giving two options: milk or water."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/aug/21/fox-news-channel/misleading-claim-fox-friends-california-kids-meal-/	Would a California bill really limit restaurant drink options for children to "only milk and water"? That’s the impression left by a recent segment on "Fox & Friends", an influential show that’s sometimes live-tweeted by President Trump. "This is a state that can run amok with the regulations and the nanny state. Now they want to legislate what drinks kids can get at restaurants," claimed host Ed Henry early in the segment. "There’s a bill that’s been proposed in the state of California (that would) only give children two options at restaurants: either milk or water," he continued. A second host then adds: "Of course, obviously, I’m the parent, I want to be able to make that decision. Where does it go? Some people in California think dairy is bad… . Or maybe it’s wheat. So how far will this go? That’s the question." We wanted to know: Does the bill really restrict kids drinks to only milk or water? Or is there more to the legislation? We set out on a fact check. Our research The legislation in question is Senate Bill 1192 introduced by Democratic State Sen. Bill Monning. He has championed it as a way to encourage healthy beverage options for children. The bill has gained attention from many news outlets in addition to Fox and many have offered misleading or incomplete ways to describe the legislation. The bill received final approval from the California Legislature on Aug. 21 and was sent to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown's desk for consideration. Here’s part of what the bill says: "This bill would require a restaurant, as defined, that sells a children’s meal that includes a beverage, to make the default beverage water, sparkling water, or flavored water, as specified, or unflavored milk or a nondairy milk alternative, as specified." The Fox hosts generally get that portion of the bill correct. But they leave out, until the end of the segment, any reference to a key provision of the bill: "The bill would not prohibit a restaurant’s ability to sell, or a customer’s ability to purchase, an alternative beverage if the purchaser requests one." The hosts also fail to mention that the bill applies only to restaurants with kids menus, though a chyron on the screen does reference kids’ meals. A third host near the end of the segment added: "The parents have to actively ask to have soda for their children." Based on the bill, and if their child is having a kids meal, that appears to be correct. Some restaurants have already removed soda from their kids meal menus. McDonald’s, for example, removed it in 2013, though the restaurant doesn’t turn down parents who ask for sodas with their child’s Happy Meal. A Fox News spokeswoman declined to speak on the record about the show’s presentation of the bill. Fox wasn't the only news outlet to leave the wrong impression. TheHill.com, a political news site, tweeted "California bill blocks restaurants from serving kids anything to drink but water, milk." Meanwhile, a patch.com news headline read "Kids Menus Can Only Have Water, Milk Under California Bill." In an interview, Monning described the Fox segment as "misleading." He added that "Fox & Friends" appeared to have shaped the story "to fit preconceived notions" about the proposal. Numerous health organizations support the bill and there’s no known opposition from other interest groups, according to reports by state Senate and Assembly committee staff. Our ruling During a recent "Fox & Friends" segment and on the show’s Twitter page, the claim was made: "California is proposing to legislate what drinks restaurants can serve your kids, only giving two options: milk or water." The claim ignores the critical fact that the bill allows restaurants, upon request, to serve children other drinks such as juice or soda. It also disregards the fact that the bill would only apply to restaurants with a kids menu. Two of the show’s hosts, along with a tweet following the segment, offered deceptive portrayals of the bill, leaving the average person with the impression it could be milk, water or nothing for kids at California restaurants. A third host then noted parents could still request soda for their children. That clarification, buried near the end of the segment, doesn’t balance out an otherwise misleading presentation. We rate the show's claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-12206	Preliminary murder rates in Philadelphia "will put the murder rate at the highest of this decade in the city."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jul/24/jeff-sessions/will-phillys-murder-rate-be-highest-decade-ag-jeff/	On Friday, another member of the Trump administration discussed crime in Philly. In town for a speech to law enforcement officials, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions started talking about violent crime, similar to the way his boss did in January at the GOP Retreat. Back then, Trump made a statement we at PolitiFact PA quickly decided was false, saying, "Here in Philadelphia the murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing." Sessions said, "Preliminary data show murders are up 20 percent from last year. It will put the murder rate at the highest this decade in the city." First off, the murder rate is up 20 percent so far this year. The morning he was speaking, it was actually up 21 percent over the same day as last year and has hovered near 20 every day for at least the last several weeks. But here we are fact-checking the latter part of the statement: whether the homicide rate this year will be the highest of this decade so far and whether it’s reasonable to make such a projection. When Sessions spoke Friday morning, the homicide count for Philadelphia was 174, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. Given 201 days had so far lapsed this year at that point, Philadelphia had experienced about .87 homicides per day. That rate would lead to 315 or 316 homicides by the end of the year. The total would not be enough to be considered the highest of the 2010s decade, or for the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017. In 2011, 326 homicides occurred here. In 2012, the number was 331. The projected total of 316 would be about 5 percent lower than either of those years, but higher than in any other year of this decade so far. But the other question is whether the number says anything meaningful at this point in the year. "There is so much variability in a low-volume crime such as homicide," said Jerry Ratcliffe, a criminal justice professor at Temple, "that predicting months ahead isn’t wise." Indeed, last year’s homicide total appeared to be rising compared to 2015 about midway through the year. As of September 2016, the rate was 9 percent higher than at the same time period the previous year. But by 2016’s end, Philly had 278 homicides, two fewer than in 2015. Ratcliffe has written extensively on this subject and found making early comparisons irrelevant because of fluctuations that are difficult to gauge. In January and February 2014, for instance, Philly saw about 37 percent more homicides than it did in January and February of 2013. But by the end of the year the city’s homicide rate ended up 0.4 percent higher than in 2013. Had Sessions even made his comment just two days later, the homicide total of 174 would have been the same, per Philly Police statistics. But because it was two days later in the year, the year-over-year increase had changed to 17 percent and the projected year-end count to 312 or 313 because of a drop to about .85 homicides per day. Our Ruling Sessions said of Philly, "Preliminary data show that murders are up at a rate of 20 percent from last year, which will put the murder rate at the highest of this decade in the city." Homicides are up about 20 percent — and consistently have been for some time — but the latter half of his statement is wrong. With 174 murders as of 11:59 p.m. Thursday, Philly was on pace to see about 316 by year’s end. The total would be lower than in 2011 (326) and 2012 (331). That’s not a sizable gap but still wouldn’t put the homicide count at the highest of this decade. On top of that, the merits of making such projections are questionable, given the high variability of homicide. We rule the claim Mostly False.

pomt-06540	"Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/05/mark-miller/mark-miller-says-wisconsin-republicans-enacted-mos/	When Wisconsin’s monthly unemployment numbers for August took another bad turn, both major political parties scrambled to affix blame. Republican Governor Scott Walker pointed at "problems in the national economy" in his weekly radio address on Sept. 22, 2011. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller, D-Monona, fingered the Republican agenda of budget cuts and tax breaks for businesses for failing to create family supporting jobs. Miller tucked another element -- the impact on education -- into the Democrats’ weekly radio address the same day: "While voting for over $2.3 billion in tax giveaways, Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation." We’ve already checked a variation of the tax-break claim -- the liberal group One Wisconsin Now said that Walker’s budget "includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade." The $2.3 billion figure is indeed the projected revenue loss, but the loss is from separate GOP-sponsored legislation as well as the budget. We rated that statement Half True. Miller, though, doesn't mention the 10-year period, so that takes the first part of his statement even more off the mark. But what about the education-related cuts? Were they the "most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation"? And by what measure? Miller pointed us to a September 2011 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that compared state-by-state budget cuts. He specifically noted media coverage of the study in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Madison’s Capital Times and the Wisconsin Radio Network -- all of which emphasized the #1 ranking in either a headline or first paragraph. Let’s take a deeper look. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, obtained budget data from 24 states -- not all 50 -- in conducting what experts told us was the only study that has attempted to quantify the recession-era cutbacks by state governments in aid to local schools. The group analyzed state general education funding that is sent to local schools using formulas and ranked states by two measures. It did not attempt to catalog how much individual school districts might have saved in costs due to limits on collective bargaining included in Walker’s budget-repair bill. But, that is potentially important. The state money to local schools was cut, but many districts were able to use the new freedom from union contracts to cut their own budgets to recover some or even all of the lost state aid. That limited the overall negative impact on the classroom. The study is ongoing, as the group is trying to gather information from the remaining 26 states. For those states, the information was not yet available or there were other obstacles to crunching the numbers, said Phil Oliff, a policy analyst who co-authored the study. The study found that Wisconsin had plenty of company in cutting aid for 2011-12 over the previous year -- 21 of the 24 states have cut per-student funding to some degree. The study noted: "Some of the deepest reductions to K-12 formula funding since the onset of the recession have occurred in the past year, as federal aid intended to sustain state education spending has expired, rainy day funds have been exhausted, and states have resisted raising additional taxes to offset the need for cuts." It ranked Wisconsin’s cuts as third deepest in percent change in spending per student (10.0%). The study highlighted this finding: "Of the states surveyed, the three states that reduced per student funding the most since last year are Illinois, Texas, and Wisconsin." So, it’s a poor ranking, to be sure. But that’s not Number 1. By another measure, Wisconsin was Number 1 -- the dollar change per student (-$635). This was covered in a chart in the study and that is what drew the headlines -- and Miller’s attention. Oliff told us that both measures were useful, just from different perspectives. A prominent Wisconsin education funding researcher who reviewed the group’s numbers, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Andrew Reschovsky, agreed both measures are important. "The bottom line is Wisconsin has made very deep cuts, either year over year or compared to pre-recession (levels)," Oliff told us. "Some of the deepest cuts in the nation." We asked Reschovsky how he would characterize Wisconsin’s rankings based on the study. "I'd be comfortable saying that among the 24 states they studied, and focusing only on aid, Wisconsin has cut state aid more dramatically than most of those other states," Reschovsky said. That's some of the deepest cuts, and deeper than most other states, but not the deepest. The Journal Sentinel’s story on Sept. 6, 2011 led with "Wisconsin leads the country so far this year in cuts to state aid for schools" -- but immediately noted the study was limited to 24 states. The story also noted the #3 ranking on the other measure. The headline was less specific: "Wisconsin ranks high in school aid cuts." The Capital Times piece the same day led with the dollar change (#1) under this headline: "Wisconsin’s cuts to school aid steepest of 24 states studied." The next day, the Wisconsin Radio Network’s website said: "Wisconsin K-12 funding cuts lead the nation." The WRN story led off: "Wisconsin’s cuts to school aid are the deepest among 24 states where budget information is available, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities." Like the others, it also prominently noted the limits of the study -- 26 states are not included. We asked Miller’s office how he could say the cuts were the most drastic "of any state" when the study looked at only 24 states. Miller spokesman Michael Browne told us that by saying "Republicans enacted" the deepest cuts, Miller had provided listeners with the appropriate context. "Enacted" signals that Miller was talking about the deepest cuts just among those states that had acted, Browne argued. But that doesn’t square with why the study was limited to 24 states. Some others have acted, but the data is just not available or has not been analyzed. And it’s reasonable to think some or many have cut education funding, said Oliff. Our conclusion Miller took to the airwaves to say that "Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation." He cited media reports concerning a study by a liberal think tank. Researchers we consulted poked no holes in the study, but it only covered about half the states. And while Wisconsin did indeed lead in cuts by one measure, it was third according to a second measure that is highlighted in the group’s report. There’s an element of truth in Miller’s claim, but he pushed past the limits of the study. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Mark Miller	None	None	None	2011-10-05T09:00:00	2011-09-22	['None']

pomt-08081	TSA "started off with 16,500 screeners and the agency has mushroomed to 67,000 employees with 3,590 administrative people ... making over $105,000 per year on average."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/17/john-mica/us-rep-john-mica-says-tsa-growing-and-growing-and-/	A northeast Florida congressman is taking aim at the Transportation Security Administration, saying the government agency has grown too big. U.S. Rep. John Mica, the incoming House Transportation Committee chairman, launched a series of criticisms about TSA surrounding its new screening procedures -- including potentially invasive pat-down searches. Classic government run amok, he says. TSA "started off with 16,500 screeners and the agency has mushroomed to 67,000 employees with 3,590 administrative people ... making over $105,000 per year on average," Mica said during a Nov. 25, 2010, appearance on Fox News. Mica has suggested the federal government might be better off training private airport security screeners and then slowly backing out of the process, saying a public-private partnership would be more efficient and less costly. "It would be far better for a streamlined TSA to focus on setting and checking security standards and auditing performance, rather than spending much of its time, resources and energy on managing a huge ballooning bureaucracy," Mica wrote in a Nov. 23, 2010, guest column in USA Today. We'll leave the policy debate for the policy debaters, but we wanted to see if Mica's TSA stats are correct. Has the aviation security screening force grown from about 16,500 to a bureaucracy of 67,000? And do TSA's administrative personnel in Washington, D.C., make $105,000 a year on average? First, some quick background on the TSA. Prior to Sept. 11, 2001, airport security was performed by air carriers with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA essentially provided the guidelines for passenger and luggage screening, and it was up to the air carriers to perform the screening itself. In most cases, carriers contracted that work out to third-party security companies. Results were mixed. In 1978, the FAA found that screeners missed identifying prohibited items during checks 13 percent of the time -- a rate considered "significant and alarming" by both the FAA and the airline industry. In two 1987 reports, the U.S. General Accounting Office pointed out that about 20 percent of test objects were still not being identified during the screening process. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government created the Transportation Security Administration to directly handle security screening. Which segues perfectly to Mica's statements. Justin Harclerode, Mica's spokesman on the Transportation Committee, said Mica got his figures from TSA itself -- with one caveat. "When Mr. Mica cites 67,000, he usually indicates that we are growing TSA to that level, because in its FY 2011 budget, the administration requested funding and justifications (more screening equipment operators, more canine unit staff, more behavior detection officers) for a TSA staff of over 67,000. The current staff is about 62,000 (a massive bureaucracy already) and the administration has requested funding to grow it to over 67,000," Harclerode said. We showed Mica's statement to the TSA and asked for clarification on his figures. TSA spokeswoman Sari Koshetz told PolitiFact Florida that the TSA total workforce is about 62,000. But Harclerode is right that TSA wants to grow. In its FY 2011 budget submittal, TSA asks for funding to grow the agency by about 4,500 employees (page 72 of this request). As for the headquarters staff, Mica is pretty much right on, TSA admits. The TSA headquarters workforce is approximately 3,650 (Mica said 3,590) and the average salary for employees there is $105,000 (exactly what Mica said). That's one part of Mica's statement. The other examines how the TSA has grown since 2001. How do things measure up there? Mica is right that in August 2002, nine months after TSA was created, the agency was operating with 16,500 screeners. But it's a misleading claim. The agency was known to be expanding. Let us explain. TSA was created in November 2001 as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. That legislation required that all airport security screeners be federal employees by Nov. 19, 2002. In the year between the congressional act and the deadline, the TSA slowly built its ranks, mixing federal employees with private security workers. At one point in August 2002, that mix included 16,500 federal workers. But it always was going to be more. By the end of 2002, TSA reported employing 56,000 security screeners. The agency shrunk some in 2003 as part of "rightsizing" but has slowly grown since then. In 2003, Congress placed a 45,000-employee cap on the agency, but TSA found ways around the cap, which was removed in 2007. What does that mean for Mica? Well, he said, TSA "started off with 16,500 screeners and the agency has mushroomed to 67,000 employees with 3,590 administrative people ... making over $105,000 per year on average." Little variances on the numbers aside, we take issue with the suggestion that TSA grew from 16,500 to a bulging 67,000-employee bureaucracy. TSA may have had 16,500 screeners in its infancy, but it was created with the idea that it would have many more. Mica is cherry-picking some numbers in his statement. So we rate it Half True.

pomt-01675	On offshore drilling for energy	no flip	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/18/mark-warner/warner-has-remained-steady-support-offshore-drilli/	Republican challenger Ed Gillespie says there’s a gap between U.S. Sen. Mark Warner’s professed support of offshore drilling for energy resources and his voting record. Here are Gillespie’s words from a July 26 debate with Warner, a Democrat: "When it comes to offshore drilling, Sen. Warner just said that he supports it, and I know that he has said that, but in fact in 2012, there was a vote for drilling for more oil and gas throughout the Outer Continental Shelf. Five Democrats voted for it, including Jim Webb (of Virginia). Sen. Warner voted against it." Warner replied that his stance has been steady. "On offshore oil, I’ve had legislation for that for years," he said. "But I do believe that Virginia should get a share of the royalties. The bill that Ed mentioned didn’t include that." So we wheeled out the Flip-O-Meter to measure Warner’s consistency on the issue. Gillespie, according to his campaign spokesman, was referring to a March 2012 vote on an amendment to a transportation funding bill. The amendment -- offered by Sen. David Vitter, R-La. -- would have re-opened the Outer Continental Shelf around the U.S. for drilling according to a five-year period originally designed to start in 2010. Virginia was included in that plan, but President Barack Obama put it on hold after the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Gillespie got Warner’s vote right -- he opposed the amendment, which did not pass. Three Democrats, including Webb, supported it. But the vote does not show waffling on Warner’s part. We read Vitter’s two-paragraph amendment; it did not seek revenue-sharing for coastal states. Warner, at the time of the vote, cited the omission as his reason for opposing the amendment. It’s been estimated that Virginia could receive as much as $250 million a year if the federal government gave it the same royalty rights it has granted to Gulf Coast states for oil and natural gas extracted off their coasts. Warner’s campaign sent us a list of the senator’s actions in supporting offshore drilling with the proviso that royalties are shared with affected coastal states: *Warner introduced legislation that would expand offshore drilling in 2013 and co-sponsored bills to that effect in 2012 and 2011. *He joined other senators in signing letters to the Secretary of Interior in signed 2012 and 2014 supporting drilling and urging that Virginia be included in the nation’s offshore plan. We spoke to Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club’s Virginia chapter, which strongly opposes offshore drilling. "I’ve been disappointed in Mark Warner’s support for offshore drilling," Besa said. "He’s been painfully consistent as far as we’re concerned, and on the wrong side of the issue." It should be noted that Gillespie, prior to becoming a Senate candidate, characterized Warner as an offshore drilling advocate. This occurred on Sept. 17, 2012, when Gillespie held a telephone conference with national reporters to outline positions being taken by Mitt Romney, the GOP’s presidential nominee. It was six months after Warner had voted against Vitter’s amendment. "We’ll allow for drilling off the coast off the coast of Virginia, which both Democratic senators and the Republican governor are asking for," Gillespie said, according to a transcript of the event. At the time, Virginia’s Democratic senators were Warner and Webb. The Republican governor was Bob McDonnell. Our ruling Warner’s record is consistent: He supports offshore drilling but insists that states, including Virginia, receive royalties for oil and natural gas extracted off their coasts.

"Australia becomes first country to begin microchipping its public," blares one such false headline appearing on the site Native American Stuff. We decided to take a closer look after Facebook users flagged it as suspicious. Microchips implanted in human bodies can transform how people tackle everyday tasks. They emit frequencies that do everything from unlocking doors to logging onto computers, removing the need to turn a key or flip a switch. While it’s true some people have voluntarily been implanted, there’s not a shred of evidence to support the absurd notion that the procedure is mandatory in Australia, as this story claims. The fake item appears to be a gross distortion of a puff piece from an actual Australian media outlet about an entrepreneur from Sydney who runs a business implanting microchips in customers’ skin. But there’s no evidence that the tech entrepreneur or her chip-implanting business are acting on behalf of the government of Australia, or that customers sought her service because a government policy requires them to do so. This bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking, clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to support an ultimately untenable central premise.

pomt-04172	Says Massachusetts has three state-mandated student tests and Finland just one.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/dec/17/thomas-ratliff/thomas-ratliff-says-massachusetts-imposes-three-ma/	Saying Texas students face too many state-mandated exams, an East Texas member of the State Board of Education suggested two faraway places enjoy stellar results with minimal government-imposed testing. In an opinion column published in the Dec. 10, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Thomas Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said: "Massachusetts, the envy of all public school systems in the United States, has three state-mandated tests. Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. That’s right, one." We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. But we have experience counting tests. In August 2012, we rated False a claim that Texas students spend 45 days a year on state-ordered exams after earlier rating Mostly False a claim about the number of testing days in the Austin schools. Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliff’s article does not say if he’s critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade. By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation. So, what of Massachusetts and Finland? Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard. Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay State’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain "proficient" scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the state’s "proficient" score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing. By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the state’s high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014. Now let’s flip to Finland. Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there "are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students’ senior year in high school." The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exam’s purpose is to "discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university." According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall. However, the exam is not a one-and-done. It’s composed of "at least four tests," one that each student must take in his or her "mother tongue"—Finnish, Swedish or Saami—and three others at their choice either on the "second national language" or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education. "As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests," the web page says. Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests? Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students "if they wish can take more exams." Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the country’s nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu Mäki-Lassila of Finland’s Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email. Our ruling Ratliff wrote that Massachusetts has three mandated student tests and Finland one. Both claims reflect the exams that students in Massachusetts and Finland have to take to qualify for high school graduation. But students on the academic track in Finland must take at least four separate tests. Also, given that Ratliff’s article does not say he’s speaking only to tests administered in high school, it’s worth noting that Massachusetts, like Texas, requires students starting in third grade to take state tests. This claim grades out as Half True. CLARIFICATION, 10:00 a.m., Dec. 19, 2012: We amended this article to point out that Finnish students who focus on vocational courses at the secondary level do not have to take a government-mandated exam to graduate. This wrinkle, brought to our attention by a reader, did not change our Truth-O-Meter rating.	None	Thomas Ratliff	None	None	None	2012-12-17T10:00:00	2012-12-10	['Finland']
pomt-07435	"Right now we are spending at an all-time high, close to 25 percent of our GDP [is] being spent on the federal government. But our revenues are at an almost all-time low of about 15 percent [of GDP]."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/22/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-federal-spending-near-all-time-hi/	In the coming weeks, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and a bipartisan group of five colleagues are expected to introduce a tough-love plan for lowering debt that they promise will make everyone angry. Warner says his "Gang of Six" will propose an array of tax increases and spending reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that would slice the national debt by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. He has been laying out the case for more taxes and less spending for months, calling the debt "a ticking time bomb." Warner appeared on "Face the Nation" on April 17 and told CBS newsman Bob Schieffer: "Right now we are spending at an all-time high; close to 25 percent of our GDP [is] being spent on the federal government. But our revenues are at an almost all-time low of about 15 percent [of GDP]." We wondered if he was right. GDP, or gross domestic product, is the measure of the total size of the U.S. economy during a given year. The Department of the Commerce has been tracking GDP since 1929. The Department of Treasury has been computing the size of government spending and revenues relative to GDP since 1940. It’s data backs up Warner’s contention. Rarely has government revenue been such a small portion of GDP, and rarely has spending been such a large chunk of the total economy. Let’s start with revenue. Ninety-three percent of federal receipts come from taxes on personal income, corporate income and payrolls. Uncle Sam took in $2.16 trillion during fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30. Revenues equaled 14.9 percent of GDP. In 2009 revenue was $2.11 trillion, again 14.9 percent of GDP. So both of those figures are close to the 15 percent mentioned by Warner. How do they compare to the past 70 years? The average since 1940 is 17.4 percent, and the average during the past 30 years is 18 percent. We found that revenue has not been below 15 percent of GDP since 1949 and 1950, when it checked in at 14.5 percent and 14.4 percent. During those post-World War II years, taxes were cut and the nation enjoyed rapid economic expansion. Medicare and Medicaid did not exist. There were 16 workers for each Social Security recipient, as compared to 2.9 workers per recipient today. The only other time where revenue was below the 15 percent level was 1940 through 1943, when the U.S. ran massive budget deficits to fund World War II. So Warner’s right when he says federal revenues "are at an almost all-time low." The revenue totals for 2009 and 2010 were the lowest percentage of GDP in 60 years. Now let’s look at spending. The federal government spent $3.46 trillion in fiscal 2010 fiscal year, down slightly from $3.52 trillion in the 2009 budget year. The 2010 figure was 23.8 percent of GDP, and the 2009 figure was 25 percent of GDP. Those numbers are above historical averages. Since 1940, federal spending has averaged 20.5 percent of GDP, and since 1981 the average is 21 percent. Spending under George W. Bush ranged from 18.2 percent in 2001 to a high of 20.7 percent in 2008. From 1980 through 2000, spending mostly ranged between 20 percent and 22 percent of GDP. Only during World War II did expenditures climb above Warner’s 25 percent threshold. It peaked at 43.6 percent in 1943 and 1944 as the U.S. financed much of its global war efforts with debt. By 1946 the figure was down to 24.8 percent, and in 1948, spending fell to 11.6 percent of GDP. Let’s wrap up. Mark Warner said government revenue is close to an all-time low at 15 percent of gross domestic product, while spending is at 25 percent of GDP, which Warner says is an all-time high. Revenue levels -- 93 percent of which come from taxes -- haven’t been this low in 60 years. So Warner is right. He also aces the spending side. The U.S. has only seen government outlays chew up this much of GDP once in history, at the height of World War II. We rate this statement True.

pomt-08541	"Social Security is a Ponzi scheme."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/03/john-loughlin/loughlin-compares-social-security-ponzi-scheme/	As Democrats fight to hold on to Congressional seats across the country, they have repeatedly accused Republicans of trying to privatize or even do away with Social Security. We checked one such claim by Rhode Island candidate David Cicilline on Saturday. GOP candidates have struck back with their own charge: Social Security, they say, is like a Ponzi scheme. Cicilline's District 1 opponent, Republican John Loughlin, has drawn the parallel at least three times during his campaign. Last week, in an interview with PolitiFact Rhode Island, he went so far as to compare the U.S. government's administration of Social Security with the scheme committed by convicted fraudster Bernard Madoff whom he said "went to jail for doing the exact same thing this country is doing with Social Security." In perhaps the most extensive example, Loughlin had this to say while speaking in February at a Rhode Island Voter Coalition forum: "For those of you who haven't retired yet, Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. The people who are working are paying for the people who are retired. There is no Social Security trust fund per se. Your money doesn't go into a big bank and come out when you retire. You're hoping there will be enough young people working to be able to pay your Social Security when you retire. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a classic Ponzi scheme. It's a textbook definition." If he's right and Social Security is indeed a Ponzi scheme it would make Madoff's $65 billion fraud look like child's play. So PolitiFact Rhode Island decided to take a look. We had a little help on this one from our partners at PolitiFact Wisconsin, who conducted a thorough examination of the Ponzi scheme issue after a Senate candidate there made a similar claim. We'll borrow from them. Let's start with some history. The scheme is named for Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions by promising them returns of up to 100 percent in just a few short weeks, then instead of investing their money, he used it to fund his personal habits. Ponzi kept the scam going by bringing in new investors, whose money he used to pay off existing ones. The current definition on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website identifies it this way: "A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors." Sound familiar? Loughlin thinks so. He insists that's the same process used to finance the federal Social Security program. And he believes that when benefits owed exceed the money coming in, the system will fall apart. There are similarities. As PolitiFact Wisconsin notes, Social Security uses taxes on current wage earners to finance the retirement checks of millions of Americans. But what about Loughlin's assertion that there is no Social Security trust fund with which to pay back wage earners? In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration said "The Social Security Trust Funds currently holds over $2.5 trillion in interest-bearing Treasury securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government." As Wisconsin notes, that essentially makes it an I.O.U. for current wage earners. But there is a second, critical component that defines a Ponzi scheme: fraud. To reach the level of this kind of scam, an investment setup must intentionally con investors, while making efforts to convince them that the finances are legitimate. Loughlin might say that's the case. And he's right to say the Social Security system is struggling financially as more Baby boomers reach retirement age. But that's very different than intentional deceit. In fact, Social Security was set up in the midst of the Depression to serve as an insurance plan of sorts for the elderly. Since then, participants and those who pay into the system have been well aware of how the program is run. For that reason, University of Rhode Island economics Prof. Rick McIntyre, called the comparison "unfair and inappropriate." A Ponzi scheme is guaranteed to run aground when the pool of investors is tapped out, whereas the Social Security administration's troubles could be remedied by raising taxes or other restructuring, should the federal government choose to do so, he said. "It is not a Ponzi scheme because there is no intent to deceive," McIntyre added. Mitchell Zuckoff, author of "Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend," and a URI graduate, addressed the persistent comparison in a recent interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. "The important difference and the fundamental difference is that there is no secret to how Social Security is run," he said. "No one is being misled; no one is taking the money and running..." Without that key element of deceit, we find it hard to find Loughlin's analogy -- or that of anyone who uses it -- credible. But there's one more thing. Loughlin doesn't just compare Social Security to the Ponzi scheme concept, he takes it a step further and draws a parallel with the specific case of Madoff, who is believed to have run the largest fraud of this kind in history. Publicly measuring a 75-year-old U.S. government program against such a massive crime is not only overstating the issue, it's bordering on irresponsible. False.

pomt-00702	Tyler Perry’s plan to turn a majority of the former Fort McPherson into a film and television studio is expected "to add over 8,000 new jobs to Atlanta."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/01/city-atlanta/Studio-plan-jobs-claim-misleading/	Atlanta officials say they are likely only weeks away from closing the deal on the largest business investment to take place on Atlanta’s southside in decades. By mid-May, they hope to make official the sale of 330 acres at the Army’s former Fort McPherson to actor and filmmaker Tyler Perry. Perry, a multimillionaire and long-term Atlanta resident, is ready to pay $30 million for the property, which he plans to redevelop into a television and film studio. According to the city, he has already invested about $200 million in various entertainment ventures in Georgia, most notably Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta. The new studio, which is forecast to take about two years to construct, is expected to attract additional investment in the area and expand Atlanta's footprint in television and film, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has said. The project could mean "over 8,000 new jobs, including the relocation of 350 jobs," according a city press on Aug. 8, 2014, announcing tentative agreement between Perry and a government agency overseeing the post’s redevelopment. That 8.000 jobs forecast has been repeated frequently and across all media platforms and has sometimes been attributed to Reed. The mayor, however, has parsed his words more carefully, saying the project will create "hundreds" of jobs and has the potential to enhance the area culturally and economically. PolitiFact decided the projections warranted a closer look. We contacted Brian Hooker, executive director of the McPherson Implementing Local Redevelopment Authority. He told us the often-touted employment figure was formulated based on data from Perry’s organization. The Army, he said, wanted to assess how the proposed studio would affect vehicle traffic around the post, which closed in 2011. The job numbers, developed in July 2014, assume that between 10 and 20 productions will be in the works at the studio all times. Each production involves 200 to 300 skilled union and nonunion workers, as well as the talent (the on-screen folks and those you and I would consider the stars). Jobs at the studio could range from a low of 3,900 to a high of 8,300, according to the calculations. The vast majority -- 2,000 to 6,000 -- involve contract work related to the productions. A production usually takes an average of four to five months, Hooker said. The second biggest pool of workers -- between 500 to 1,500 -- will be temporary jobs building the studio. The actual number of full-time jobs is estimated at between 400 and 800, with the bulk of those -- 300 to 500 -- being members of the professional and executive staff overseeing daily operations at the studio, Hooker said. It’s not clear exactly how many of those executive staff employees will be true new hires. That’s because the permanent employees of the current Tyler Perry Studios, about 350, are expected to move to McPherson. (Tyler Perry Studios executives have not shared their plans for the existing studio facilities, Hooker said.) Between 100 to 300 workers, categorized as "operations labor," also will be full time. They will be responsible for assisting set designers and others who come to the studio as part of the various productions, Hooker said. Our conclusion: Tyler Perry plans to develop a major television and film studio at the former site of Fort McPherson, providing a major boost to the community and to Georgia’s growing film industry. The project has been forecast to create about 8,000 jobs, including some in construction. That’s based on a report, which we examined that shows a potential range of jobs from 3,900 to 8,300. At best only about 800 of those are expected to be permanent jobs. Most of them are in contract work. That’s important and missing context that doesn’t diminish the project but shortchanges the reader. The overall statement from the city is partially accurate, but misleading. We rate the statement Half True.	None	City of Atlanta	None	None	None	2015-05-01T00:00:00	2014-08-08	['None']

pomt-15343	"More businesses are closing than are opening for the first time in our nation's history."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/10/todd-wilcox/senate-candidate-wilcox-says-more-businesses-closi/	An Orlando businessman vying for Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-vacated Senate seat announced his candidacy by saying fresh blood is needed to change the worst economic climate the country’s ever faced. "It's time to restore America's prominence both here at home and abroad," Todd Wilcox, a former Green Beret and CIA veteran, said in a statement announcing his candidacy on July 8, 2015. "The economy is growing at a dismal rate. More businesses are closing than are opening for the first time in our nation's history." The recent recession obviously has been an economic low point, but are the number of new businesses being eclipsed by the number of businesses closing for the first time ever? Well, it’s certainly true for as long as the government has been tracking that statistic. Beyond that is anyone’s guess. Wilcox, a Republican, told PolitiFact he was citing a May 2014 story from the Washington Post’s Wonkblog that said as much. The story was about a Brookings Institution study released that month called "Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros," which examined business creation and destruction in the U.S. since 1978. The report said that business failures had held steady over most of that period, while business entries had steadily declined. Starting in 2008, the two points intersected for the first time in their 35-year history of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics data. The trend continued through 2011, the last year of available data in the study.The study’s authors said they couldn’t speak to the causes for this trend, which they called "noteworthy and disturbing." But they noted that "it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones." Where Wilcox’s claim falters is that the data isn’t for the entire 239-year history of the United States, but just the 35 years examined in the study. The Business Dynamics Statistics database only has figures from 1976 to 2012. What truly happened prior to that is largely anyone’s guess, economists told PolitiFact. "I am not aware of any standard measures before then. I suspect that other measures do exist, but I doubt that they are systematically measured, year in and year out," UCLA economics professor Lee Ohanian said. While it’s possible there have been other periods of history where a similar trend has occurred, such as during the Great Depression, there is no dependable source of data measuring it, they said. "It’s somewhere between plausible and impossible to prove," said Robert Litman, one of the authors of the Brookings study. He suggested it would be "more accurate to say that for the first time since the government began tracking these things, fails have exceeded starts." Our ruling Wilcox said, "More businesses are closing than are opening for the first time in our nation's history." He’s right that more firms are now closing up shop than starting up, a trend that started in 2008. But the stat he’s citing is from a study of a 35-year period from 1978 to 2011, not all of American history. The Census Bureau database used for that study has only been measuring entries and exits since the 1970s. Economists, including the study’s author, told us Wilcox overreached a bit, because this trend may have happened before. There are no dependable sources of information to prove this is the first time this has occurred. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-01443	Under sequestration, the military was cut "down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/05/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-army-smallest-1940-navy-smallest-19/	The United States has upped its operations in Iraq and Syria, but Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says the military is shrinking. On CNN’s State of the Union Sunday morning, Graham criticized President Barack Obama for what he said are "half-measures" in thwarting terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. While Obama has focused on avoiding sending in combat troops to the Middle East, Graham said up to 4,000 troops may be necessary. The issue of military size resurfaced when host Candy Crowley asked Graham what his plans are if Republicans take control of the Senate in November. He said replacing sequestration-style budgets is priority No. 1. "You just heard a segment about the spread of Ebola throughout Africa," he said. "We're cutting the CDC's budget, the NIH budget. We're taking the military budget under sequestration cuts down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915. We're destroying the Intelligence Committee." There’s a lot in there, but the idea that the U.S. military -- by far the largest in the world in terms of spending -- is as small as it was nearly a century ago caught our attention. We found that Graham has accurate numbers regarding the Army and Navy. However, comparing today’s military to that of decades ago is comparing apples to oranges because of massive growth in technology and overall capabilities. The numbers Graham was referring to the number of ground forces and the number of ships, which is the traditional way of measuring the size of the Army and Navy, respectively, said Alex Roland, a professor of military history at Duke University. Graham’s staff pointed us to a letter written by former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2011. Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- both supporters of robust funding for the Defense Department -- requested the letter amid Congress’ budget talks in fall 2011 that led to sequestration legislation. In the letter, Panetta said, "Facing such large reductions, we would have to reduce the size of the military sharply. Rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history." As far as we can tell, Panetta’s assessment is accurate. The Army already is reducing the number of soldiers to 440,000-450,000 -- down from its recent war-time high of 570,000, according to the Defense Department’s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. (Those reductions are the result of the ending of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not mandated budget cuts as part of the sequestration.) Going forward, if sequestration-style cuts go into effect for fiscal year 2016, the number of soldiers will likely have to drop to 420,000. This is the lowest number of soldiers since 1940. Before the draft went into effect later that year, there were about 264,000 troops in the Army. Turning to the Navy, there are currently 289 deployable battle force ships. According to the quadrennial review, there will be an estimated fleet of 234 ships in Fiscal Year 2019. That is the lowest number of ships since 1915 -- two years before the United States got involved in World War I. That year, the Navy had 231 deployable ships. In 2016, it jumped up to 245 ships. To summarize: Army 1940 2019 (est.) Number of troops 264,000 440,000 Navy 1915 2019 (est.) Number of ships 231 234 Still, Graham was trying to make the point that the budget cuts have weakened the military to points not seen in decades. However, we learned from experts that comparing the number of troops and ships doesn’t say much about military might. The context We took Graham’s claim to several experts, who told us that comparing the American military of 2014 to that of the early 20th century is irrelevant. Because of technological advances, the ships and troops of today’s military have greater capabilities than they did in the world wars. "One of the reasons for the decrease in size -- both Army and Navy -- is that we now rely far more on technology than on sheer numbers," said Roland, the military history expert from Duke. "The question is not how we compare to our Army in 1940 or our Navy in 1915, but how we compare with our potential enemies in 2014. We are head and shoulders above them." For example, the Navy did not have any aircraft carriers in 1915, but now it has an active fleet of 10. David E. Johnson, a political scientist at the Rand Corporation, estimated that just four modern aircraft carriers would have capabilities equal to that of the entire Navy before World War I. At that time, the military also did not have radar, satellites, computers, virtually undetectable ballistic missile submarines, drones and other advanced technology that allow the military to do more with fewer soldiers. Also, in terms of military spending relative to other countries, the United States accounts for 37 percent of the world’s total military spending. China follows, at 11 percent of the world’s spending, as of 2013, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. (Put another way, the United States spends as much on its military as the next 8-12 biggest defense-spending countries combined.) Warfare also has changed, Johnson said. It’s been decades since the United States has been involved in a war, like the world wars, where the country lost numerous ships and hundreds of thousands of soldiers. While the military should continue have a robust number of ships and soldiers, it does not necessarily need as many as it did in previous conflicts. That being said, Johnson said sequestration has hindered military capabilities -- particularly in light of recent developments in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon has had to make cuts to its day-to-day operations, while carrying out missions in the Middle East that were not budgeted for. Our ruling Graham said that under sequestration, the military was cut "down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915." Graham was counting the number of ground troops in the Army and the number of ships in the Navy. He’s got the numbers right, but it’s not a fair comparison because technology and capabilities have grown so much in the past century. The Army and Navy of today are much more capable than they were decades ago, even with fewer soldiers and ships. A better comparison is to look at how the U.S. military stands up relative to other nations. Graham’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02300	"Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-private-sector-job-growth/	Ask Gov. Rick Scott about practically any topic and he is bound to steer the conversation back to jobs. The former CEO of a health care company loves to cite statistics that relate to job growth, such as this one in a March 31 online ad: "Florida’s economy is on a better path. Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs. Let’s keep working." Scott, who has governed during the national recovery, is expected to face former Gov. Charlie Crist, who governed during the recession, in November. The jobs picture under both governors is a key topic of debate in the race. Did Scott correctly cite the number of new jobs in Florida? Private vs. public-sector jobs Scott started the clock ticking in December 2010, one month before the Republican took office. His campaign used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to arrive at the figure. BLS data shows that the number of total nonfarm jobs grew by 517,500 between December 2010 and preliminary data for February 2014, the most recent month available. That’s a little short of the number Scott used. Scott gets to his number by ignoring reductions in government jobs. During the same time frame, Florida lost 23,200 government jobs. So if it hadn’t been for the lost government jobs, the number would be 540,000. At PolitiFact Florida we are very familiar with Scott’s statements about jobs and have been tracking his 2010 campaign promise to create over 700,000 jobs in seven years. That promise is currently rated In the Works. When Scott debuted his jobs promise in July 2010, state economists had released estimates showing that Florida would add 1.05 million jobs between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2018 -- no matter who served as governor. In response, Scott clarified his promise and said that his 700,000 jobs would come in addition to the ones state economists forecasted. Put simpler: his 7-7-7 plan became 7-7-1.7 million. Scott’s press office has consistently disagreed with our analysis, saying Scott’s campaign materials never qualified that 700,000 jobs would be on top of normal growth projections. To achieve the goal of 700,000 jobs on top of normal growth requires the state to produce more than 20,000 jobs on average per month, every month, for seven years. He has fallen short of that average the majority of the months, though the jobs picture improved in 2013. In this particular online ad, Scott doesn’t use words to take credit for the job growth, but he is touting job growth during his watch. We have interviewed economists in the past who caution that a governor can’t take much credit for job growth during a national recovery -- or too much blame for job losses during a national recession. Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moody’s who analyzes Florida, said that the creation of 540,000 private-sector jobs in the 38 months since December 2010 is not a particularly exceptional rate of job creation. "The most private-sector jobs created during any 38-month interval is 753,100 (during the 38-month interval that ended in August 2006)," Donaldson said in an email to PolitiFact Florida. "The current record is even less remarkable considering Florida’s larger current population." Our ruling Scott said in an online ad, "Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs." Looking only at the numbers -- and not whether Scott’s policies should get credit for the growth -- Florida added 517,500 total nonfarm jobs and lost 23,000 government-sector jobs between December 2010 and February 2014. It would have been more accurate for Scott to cite private-sector job growth. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-04-02T14:35:38	2014-03-31	['None']
pomt-10344	"McCain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform. . . . But when he was running for his party's nomination, he . . . said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/16/barack-obama/backtracking-on-the-path-to-citizenship/	Seeking to portray his Republican rival as a flip-flopper on a critical issue for Latino voters, Sen. Barack Obama used a July 8, 2008, appearance before the League of United Latin American Citizens to note remarks Sen. John McCain made that appeared to disavow an immigration plan McCain had championed in Congress. "Now, I know Sen. McCain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform — and I admired him for it," Obama said. "But when he was running for his party's nomination, he abandoned his courageous stance, and said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote." Obama is referring to comments McCain made during a Jan. 30, 2008, Republican candidates' debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. At issue was the immigration plan that McCain helped shepherd through the Senate in 2006 that combined border security and work-site enforcement to root out undocumented employees, with a guest worker program for most of the illegal immigrants in the country. House Republicans, who favored tough enforcement measures, branded the Senate measure as "amnesty" for illegal immigrants and the work of Democrats. They refused to participate in discussions to negotiate a compromise plan and instead passed a series of narrow bills aimed at thwarting illegal immigration. Most were never enacted into law, though Congress cleared a separate border fence bill. Asked during the debate whether he would vote for his original proposal if it came to the Senate floor again, McCain first demurred, saying it would not return in that form. But when pressed, he said he would not, because public opinion favored enforcement over citizenship measures. "I would not, because we know what the situation is today," McCain said. "The people want the border secured first. And so to say that that would come to the floor of the Senate — it won't. We went through various amendments which prevented that ever — that proposal." Asked again to confirm he would not vote for his bill as originally drafted, McCain replied, "My bill will not be voted on; it will not be voted on. I will sit and work with Democrats and Republicans and with all people. And we will have the principals securing the borders first." McCain's comments acknowledge many Republican primary voters' preference for tough enforcement measures. But in 2007, he supported another plan to rewrite immigration laws that resembled the previous year's effort and included a so-called "path to citizenship" for the estimated 12-million undocumented immigrants in the country. From these actions, one can infer McCain has toggled between endorsing enforcement measures and broader immigration plans that also address citizenship, depending on the circumstances. All of which backs up Obama's assertion. However, Obama is laying it on thick in stating McCain bucked his party in crafting the original plan. The immigration plans McCain championed were a priority of the Bush administration and Republican leaders in the Senate. To be sure, they infuriated grass-roots conservatives, who constitute a core GOP constituency and have long been critical of McCain's position on a host of issues. But in this case, Obama may be giving McCain too much credit for being a maverick in order to make the about-face more dramatic. Still, because McCain essentially disavowed his original comprehensive immigration proposal and said repeatedly he would focus on border security as president, we judge Obama's statement Mostly True.

pomt-08202	"Because of (U.S. Sen.-elect Ron) Johnson’s leadership, Senate Republicans adopted a caucus ban on earmarks."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/22/republican-party-wisconsin/state-gop-says-earmarks-ban-passed-due-leadership-/	In the week following his decisive victory over three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, political newcomer Ron Johnson laid low, declining interviews with state media. Turns out the Republican from Oshkosh was not inactive, though. National media reports on Nov. 9, 2010, placed Johnson among a group of incoming senators publicly backing a ban on earmarks -- those tasty pieces of pork sprinkled by the thousands into the federal budget by individual lawmakers. Reporters set up the issue as the first test of whether newly elected conservatives would take on a time-honored Washington tradition -- bringing home the bacon. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and others opposed the ban, which is non-binding but symbolically significant. On Nov. 16, McConnell dropped his opposition, the caucus endorsed the ban and it passed. In a news release the next day, the Republican Party of Wisconsin lauded Johnson. "Because of Johnson’s leadership, Senate Republicans adopted a caucus ban on earmarks, showing the American people they’re serious about cutting government waste and corruption. Senator-elect Johnson isn’t wasting any time in his push for reforms, and the Republican Party of Wisconsin applauds his efforts." Wow. Did Johnson, not even in office yet, really lead the way on the earmarks ban? Let’s peek behind the headlines. The Senate Republican caucus includes 46 members. Johnson is one of 13 newly elected Republicans. He was one of six incoming freshman to publicly agree to sign on to the earmark ban at the request of U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina). Other newly elected senators hung back, and just four current senators initially joined DeMint’s group. The DeMint crew of 10, dubbed an "insurgent group" by The Washington Post, sent a letter to their colleagues urging support for a ban. McConnell and another defender of earmarks, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), loudly pushed back against the ban in the days before the caucus vote. They said earmarks were a tiny slice of federal spending and important for district projects. Inhofe told the Post that banning earmarks "gives cover for big-spending members of Congress to look conservative. They start demagoguing the earmark thing and everybody goes, ‘Oh, they must be conservative.’" McConnell and Inhofe reportedly lobbied new members to vote against the earmark ban, although Johnson says he was not contacted. But the two backed off before the matter came to a vote, and on Nov. 16 in a closed-door meeting the caucus united behind a two-year moratorium. Again, media accounts portrayed sitting senators as bowing to pressure from voters and the Tea Party movement, to which Johnson is loosely tied. Johnson, by his own account, did not lobby other senators face-to-face on the issue. And he said he was not deeply involved with DeMint’s concerted effort, which dates back months. "That all occurred before we got here," said Johnson. "Quite honestly, we kind of stepped into this, having been asked to co-sponsor it (referring to the freshmen who signed on). And Sen. McConnell made his decision." DeMint, though, directly credits Johnson and the small group of early supporters for the victory. Wesley Denton, DeMint’s spokesman, told us: "Senator-elect Johnson was an early public supporter of the earmark ban. His leadership helped give us the momentum we needed to win." So, where does that leave us? In the wake of the earmarks vote, the state Republican Party credited Johnson’s leadership for its passage. The ban was opposed publicly by the Senate minority leader, putting the outcome of the vote in question. Johnson, new to Washington, joined a small group who took a public stand, while some other incoming freshmen stayed on the sidelines. Johnson didn’t take a role in arm-twisting on the issue. And he was not solely responsible, as the GOP’s claim suggests. But he and just a few others made a real difference in the outcome. We rate the claim Mostly True.

It’s doesn’t. Ford testified before Congress about her allegations that she was sexually assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when they were both in high school. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. Ford has been the subject of numerous viral social media posts that falsely suggest she is associated with prominent Democrats. This particular photo was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

pomt-03002	"Thirteen hundred" applicants in Rhode Island signed up for insurance through Obamacare.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/17/sheldon-whitehouse/sheldon-whitehouse-ted-cruz-spar-over-how-many-rho/	While Republicans and Democrats were still at loggerheads over the federal budget, the shutdown of the federal government and Obamacare, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, went on the Oct. 10 edition of CNN's "Crossfire" to debate all three. When the issue turned to Obamacare -- formally known as the Affordable Care Act -- , Whitehouse talked about how Rhode Islanders were receptive to the program, especially HealthSource RI, the state’s Obamacare health insurance exchange. He cited the case of one family that was so pleased, they returned to the HealthSource RI headquarters with coffee and doughnuts to thank the staff. At the time, many people were finding it impossible to sign up through exchanges run by other states and the federal government. That prompted this exchange: Cruz: "It's interesting that you apparently found a family in Rhode Island that went on the exchanges and got insurance." Whitehouse: "Thirteen hundred." Cruz: "It was publicly reported there were 580 in Rhode Island." We wondered who was correct, Cruz or Whitehouse. Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson said the senator's 1,300 number came via a phone conversation with HealthSource RI. We emailed HealthSource RI and asked Dara Chadwick, chief of strategic communications and media relations, how many people had signed up by the end of the day on Oct. 10, when the two senators were giving their numbers. She responded that 786 applications had been processed as of Oct 5. That's well above Cruz's number but well below Whitehouse's. And it was for the wrong date. So we asked again. When we declined to identify the politician we were fact-checking, Chadwick gave us another non-responsive answer. At that point, we sought help getting the number from the offices of both Whitehouse and Gov. Lincoln Chafee Meanwhile, we took out our calculator. On Oct. 11, the day after Whitehouse's appearance, the director of HealthSource RI, Christine Ferguson, told The Providence Journal's medical writer, Felice Freyer, that 1,698 applicants had completed their paperwork and selected a health insurance plan. The two numbers we did have suggested that about 163 applicants were completing the process each day. That means, at the time of the "Crossfire" appearance, roughly 1,467 applicants should have been processed. A few hours later we heard back from Chadwick. She said that at the end of the day on Oct. 10, 1,479 applications had been completed and processed. When we told her we were checking the Whitehouse appearance, she said the number supplied by HealthSource RI had been the total through Oct. 9, which was 1,313, essentially the number the senator cited. Our ruling In a televised debate on the evening of Oct. 10, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said 1,300 applicants in Rhode Island had signed up for insurance through Obamacare; his debate opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz, cited a lower number for Rhode Island: 580. Cruz's statement was clearly False. Five days earlier, the number of processed applications had already hit 786, according to HealthSource RI. The number at the time "Crossfire" aired was 1,479. If Whitehouse had said his 1,300 number was a day old, we would give him True. But he was off by a day, so he gets a Mostly True.

pomt-13419	"In Harrisburg, I passed more bills than all the Democrats combined, in terms of legislation affecting the city."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/sep/21/john-taylor/surprising-truth-about-philly-republicans-harrisbu/	State representative John Taylor is the rarest of Philadelphia’s elected officials: He’s a Republican. More than that, he’s a Republican liked by the unions, a Republican liked by Mayor Jim Kenney. Taylor told City & State PA last week he’s done something that makes him stand out even more among Philadelphia’s politicians: "In Harrisburg, I passed more bills than all the Democrats combined, in terms of legislation affecting the city." We’re talking about one representative versus 23 Democratic representatives. Could he really have passed more bills than all of them combined? First, we asked Taylor what time frame he was referring to. He said he meant this two-year term, from 2015 to present, given the article in which he was quoted focused on his bid for re-election against Democrat Joe Hohenstein. To test Taylor’s statement, we turned to the Legislature’s website, which tracks every bill sponsored by members of the state House and Senate. And it turns out Taylor is dead on. This term he’s been the primary sponsor of five bills that have passed into law, four of which have at least some relevance to Philadelphia. All 23 Philly Democrat representatives have been the primary sponsor of a combined two bills that have passed into law. The only two Democrats to sponsor bills that passed are Kevin Boyle and Bill Keller. Keller’s bill was about renaming portions of highways and streets in the area. Boyle’s had to do with emergency vehicles. Democrats Ed Neilson, Dwight Evans and Lynwood Savage haven’t even been a prime sponsor for a bill, period. "I don’t how far back that statistic would hold up," Taylor said of his passing more bills than the Democrats, "but it is certainly true for this term. And frankly it would be true for the next term." With that reference to the future, Taylor refers to the likelihood that Republicans will continue to hold power in the Senate and House. He said Republican leadership, which dominates the various committees, tends to emphasize their members ahead of the other party, meaning Republican-sponsored bills have a better chance of passing than Democrat-sponsored bills. "I was in the minority for 10 years," Taylor said. "You could come up with the cure for cancer and it would get put aside or it would come out with the Democratic name on it." Taylor said he attends most Philadelphia Delegation meetings and describes he and the Democrats from here as "kind of one big, happy family." And as one of three Republicans representing Philadelphia (Martina White is the other; Thomas Murt has a slice of Philly in addition to Montgomery County), he said he’s in the best position to act as a voice for the city. "For us to make things happen in a Republican-dominated body," Taylor said, "we need that." Our ruling In an article about Republican state Rep. John Taylor’s bid for re-election against Democrat Joe Hohenstein, Taylor emphasized the need for Philadelphia to have a prominent Republican by saying, "In Harrisburg, I passed more bills than all the Democrats combined, in terms of legislation affecting the city." According to the Legislature’s website, Taylor has been the prime sponsor of five bills that have passed this term. The 23 Philly Democrats have been prime sponsors of two bills that have passed.

pomt-13927	The ammunition used in the Orlando shooting "is banned by Geneva Convention. It enters the body, spins & explodes."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/23/michael-moore/liberal-filmmaker-michael-moore-says-ar-15-bullets/	Filmmaker and liberal commentator Michael Moore made a provocative claim about the ammunition used in the June 12 Orlando shooting — that it is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. "Ammo used in AR-15/M-16 is banned by Geneva Convention," Moore tweeted June 14. "It enters the body, spins & explodes. Show the crime scene photos and the NRA is over." The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported June 12 that Omar Mateen had been in possession of a 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol and a .223 caliber AR-type rifle. The latter was later identified as a Sig Sauer MCX rifle by the gun shop owner who sold Mateen the gun. Law enforcement has not released the exact type of .223-caliber ammunition used as of this fact-check’s publication. Still, many people responded on Twitter to Moore trying to debunk his tweet, so we took a closer look. We contacted Moore's office but didn't hear back. What is the Geneva Convention? The 1949 Geneva Conventions are a set of treaties and protocols dictating the humane treatment of people during war. For example, they prohibit torture, hostage-taking, deportation and execution without "judicial guarantees." In particular, the Conventions prescribe protections for various classes — the ill, medical workers, prisoners of war and civilians during wartime. The main text of the Geneva Convention treaties does not include any specific mention of prohibited ammunition, and neither do the supplementary protocols. The closest thing to Moore’s claim is Article 35 of the first protocol. It prohibits "weapons, projectiles and materials … causing superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering" but does not offer further clarification. In any case, the Geneva Convention does not apply to domestic weapon use, said Dan Joyner, a professor of law at the University of Alabama. Only wartime. "No source of international law prohibits the sale or use within a country of any particular kind of ammunition," Joyner said. Mateen’s declaration of allegiance to ISIS does give the incident an international character, but the Conventions primarily apply to issues between nation-factions. Different conventions We looked at other international conventions to see if they banned certain ammunition. Some do, but experts suggested Mateen’s ammunition might not qualify, again because these agreements are binding for traditional warfare, not domestic purchases. The first appearance of an ammunition ban in international treaties comes in the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg, which bans explosive or flammable projectiles weighing less than 400 grams. Declaration III of the 1899 Hague Convention bans bullets that "expand or flatten" upon entering the body — commonly known as "hollow-point bullets." The same language is included in the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The catch? Hague only applies "in the case of war" between two or more signatories. Rome only creates jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Case in point, the International Committee of the Red Cross notes that many parties to the Hague Convention use "expanding bullets" in their domestic police forces. Gary Mauser, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University, said Moore’s claim errs in relating the Orlando shooting to the Convention. "That ban does not apply to the attacker in Orlando since he was not part of a formal military force," Mauser said. In its newly set International Small Arms Control Standards, the United Nations has recently included a ban on a narrowly defined type of armor-piercing ammunition. However, these protocols are only guidance for how countries could choose to behave domestically, Mauser said. "ISACS recommendations are merely recommendations, and do not have the force of law, either internationally or within any nation," said Mauser, who is also an ISACS expert advisor. The bullets Experts are unsure whether Mateen’s ammunition matches what the treaties describe anyway, as law enforcement officials have not yet released the exact type of bullet Mateen used. George Mocsary, a professor of law at Southern Illinois University, said that the vast majority of AR-15 bullets (mentioned in Moore’s tweet) are .223 "full metal jackets." These, Mocsary said, would not violate any conventions because they are "not expanding," "not explosive," and "not armour-piercing by the ISACS definition." Mocsary did, however, note that many .223 rounds can penetrate some armour simply by nature of being shot from a rifle. However, investigators have not confirmed whether "full metal jackets" were in fact what Mateen used. Tim O’Rourke, an investigator for The Grafton Group forensic science firm, said it is impossible to definitively characterize Mateen’s rounds without further information. It is possible and legal to purchase hollow-point "controlled expansion" rounds in Florida, he said. Regarding what Moore tweeted about the bullets’ "spin," O’Rourke noted it is possible for bullets to "tumble" in the body depending on contingent factors such as barrel length and distance fired. O’Rourke noted, however, that the bullets would not be designed to explode or detonate in the body. Nonetheless, doctors treating the injuries noted the severe damage done to victim’s bodies, such as "big, giant cavities" in the victims. One mentioned that bullets struck with such force that ripple effects damaged even nearby tissue. "It actually puts kinetic energy into tissue that it didn't hit," said doctor John M. Porter in the Philadelphia Inquirer. "It can go next to the liver and still destroy the liver." Our ruling Moore tweeted that the Geneva Convention prohibits the type of ammunition used in the Orlando shooting. However, the Geneva Convention does not deal with ammunition. Other international conventions do prohibit certain ammunition, but only during wartime, not domestically. Even if they were binding domestically, experts are not sure whether Mateen’s bullets qualify, given the limited information released from law enforcement. That being said, Moore’s tweet does emphasize the amount of damage these bullets inflicted. Even if his specifics might be off, doctors’ reports support Moore on the general point about damages. We rate Moore’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c7d1cc63-b740-4c9e-ae93-d00188ad5e6a	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2016-06-23T11:00:00	2016-06-14	['Orlando,_Florida']

pomt-08600	"We've created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined."	true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/23/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-texas-has-created-more-850000-/	In a recent TV ad, Gov. Rick Perry boasts that Texas is "open for business." "We've created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined," Perry says in the Sept. 12 spot. An Aug. 24 Houston Chronicle headline appears on the screen: "By any measure, Texas tops nation in job creation." The Perry campaign pointed us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks jobs in each state. In January 2001, shortly after Perry became governor, Texas had 9,542,400 nonfarm jobs. As of June: 10,395,800. That's a net gain of 853,400 jobs, a surge of 8.9 percent. From July 2000 to July 2009, the state grew by about 3.8 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Texas, the second-largest state, has created more jobs than any other state in Perry's time as governor. Arizona created the second-most jobs, 132,700, followed by Utah with 113,200. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have enjoyed a net job gain during Perry's tenure, while California, the most populous state, has lost the most jobs: 827,800. Michigan lost the second most, 755,900, followed by Ohio, at 557,300. Excluding Texas and including the District of Columbia, which had a net gain of 59,100 jobs, all the states combined had a net job loss of 3,185,000 from January 2001 to June 2010. Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, confirmed that Perry is correct in saying that Texas added more jobs than all the other states combined. "Texas was one of the very few who even added jobs over that time," she said. That's not to say that Texas hasn't lost jobs. At its peak, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs in August 2008. About a year later, when the recession was in full swing, only 10.21 million jobs were on the payroll — about 430,000 less. Since, Texas has added about 180,000 jobs. That's about 250,000 fewer than its best. Worth noting: the Houston Chronicle article that the ad highlights looks at Texas job gains during that recent upswing, from July 2009 to July 2010 — just the past year of Perry's tenure as governor. We also wondered how many jobs were created in the state government — Perry's domain. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, Texas had 334,100 state government jobs in 2001, the year Perry took office, and 369,800 in 2009 — an increase of 35,700 jobs, or 10.7 percent, on Perry's watch. Significantly, Perry doesn't overtly take personal credit for the state leading the nation in jobs gained over his years as governor. We rate his statement as True. This story has been updated to correct the month that Perry became governor. He succeeded George W. Bush on December 21, 2000, not in January 2001.

pomt-09001	"Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon, Senate President-Designate Haridopolos and I stood up to Governor Crist and worked to remove Jim Greer as Chairman because of his mismanagement of the party."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/13/john-thrasher/john-thrasher-takes-credit-pushing-jim-greer-rpof/	October 18, 2010, is the day disgraced former Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer will stand trial on charges that he funneled funds from the RPOF into his own private ventures. As that trial nears, and the August statewide primary elections loom, there’s been plenty of political posturing around his case -- with party leaders trying to distance themselves from Greer or showcase themselves as the ones who pushed for his ouster. On July 1, 2010, after Greer’s trial date was set, Rick Scott, who is running against Attorney General Bill McCollum to be the Republican candidate for governor, called for an independent investigation into Greer’s mismanagement, arguing there was a conflict of interest with having the Attorney General’s office handle the investigation. "His back-room-deal mentality is out of step with voters who are demanding accountability and openness," Scott said about McCollum in a press statement. Scott’s statement prompted the current RPOF chairman John Thrasher, a state senator from St. Augustine, to fire back with this response: "Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon, Senate President-Designate Haridopolos and I stood up to Governor Crist and worked to remove Jim Greer as Chairman because of his mismanagement of the party." We decided to look further into Thrasher’s claim. Is it true that these four men "worked to remove Jim Greer?" When we turned to the Republican Party of Florida, which distributed Thrasher’s statement in a press release, they referred us to various news articles detailing Gov. Charlie Crist’s support and close ties to Greer, his hand-picked choice for chairman after Crist’s own election in 2006. Greer was an Oviedo city council member and regional leader of Crist's campaign. Tying Greer to Crist, though, doesn’t address which party leaders had pushed for Greer’s ouster. So we decided to look back and see where and when there were reports that the four high-profile Republicans pushed for his ouster. But first a little background on what led to Greer’s removal. Greer was forced out early in 2010, after complaints arose of lavish spending on party-issued credit cards and Republican donors and the media started to call for the release of the credit card statements. Nearly $7.3 million is reported to have been spent for the three years that Greer served as party chairman from 2006 to 2009. When Thrasher took over as party chairman in February, he ordered an audit of RPOF finances. A subsequent investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement showed Greer and Delmar Johnson, an RPOF staffer, had formed a consulting company, Victory Strategies, that was paid a 10-percent commission on money raised for the party. According to FDLE’s arrest affidavit, Victory Strategies funneled $125,000 from the party. Johnson kept $65,000 with the rest going to Greer. Now back to the question at hand: Did Thrasher, McCollum, Cannon and Haridopolos work to remove Jim Greer? Under growing pressure from party leaders, and with a state investigation by the FDLE pending, Greer voluntarily stepped down from his post on Jan. 5, 2010. We looked at media reports before and after Greer left, to see if and when the four Republicans mentioned by Thrasher started to publicly complain about Greer’s practices. Aug. 23, 2009 -- Haridopolos voluntarily gives back his party-issued credit card after initial reports of high spending by some cardholders, according to an Orlando Sentinel report. Dec. 18, 2009 -- Fifty party leaders call for Greer’s resignation. The same day, Greer tells the St. Petersburg Times that Crist "has told me I'm not to consider resigning." Dec. 26, 2009 -- Hillsborough County Republican Chairwoman Deborah Cox-Roush, in a long letter to the state executive committee, notes that Cannon and Haridopolos "refused to comment publicly" about Greer’s future, a signal he had lost their support. Dec. 29, 2009 -- The St. Petersburg Times called it "the biggest shoe to drop yet" when a dozen major GOP fundraisers called on Greer to resign. Jan. 5, 2010 -- Greer steps down in a hastily organized teleconference. That same day Cannon transfers $550,000 from the party’s account into his political action committee, the Florida Liberty Fund. A political strategist hired by Cannon tells the Orlando Sentinel that Cannon had requested the transfer earlier, citing lost faith in how Greer was spending the money. Jan. 7, 2010 -- Just before the party meets to select a new chairman, Senate President Jeff Atwater, R-North Palm Beach, adds Thrasher as a member of party executive committee. Feb. 11, 2010 -- As reports detailing party finances come out, McCollum issues a campaign press release stating his "outrage over recent revelations of extravagant contracts and lavish spending." He adds: "If audit findings suggest potential criminal activity, I will assist the state Executive Committee in directing these findings to the appropriate law enforcement investigatory agency." The Orlando Sentinel describes McCollum as "a driving force" in ousting Greer. Feb. 20, 2010 -- With Thrasher now elected as RPOF chairman, he tells members gathered for a general meeting that his "first order of business" is to call for a internal audit of the state party’s finances, according to a St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald story. State Sen. Paula Dockey, R-Lakeland, a McCollum rival for governor at the time, criticizes McCollum for being slow in responding to the Greer issue. A St. Petersburg Times blog also says McCollum, "like other Republican legislative leaders, long brushed off criticism of Greer's management and pleas that he help oust Greer." April 1, 2010 -- Greer files a lawsuit against the state party and Thrasher as party chairman, claiming they reneged on a secret severance package that would have paid Greer about one-year’s salary, nearly $124,000. The lawsuit also claims that Cannon and Haridopolos allegedly offered to pay Greer $200,000 in "hush money," to remain quiet about the severance agreement. Thrasher, Cannon and Haridopolos’ signatures appear on the secret deal, although not all on the same page, indicating their active involvement in the negotiations. The party, in response, says the severance agreement is not an enforceable contract, according to the St. Petersburg Times. June 2, 2010 -- The Florida Department of Law Enforcement announces they have opened an investigation into Greer’s spending practices. And that’s the tale of Greer’s fall. Thrasher has put much of the blame on Crist, for putting Greer in power and not curtailing his spending. Crist, who initially stood by Greer saying he was doing a "good job," has since said he was "surprised and disappointed" by Greer’s actions. Still Thrasher continues to pounce on Crist and the close relationship he shared with Greer. "The governor's the guy that pretty much placed Chairman Greer in the position he did," Thrasher said in an April 22, 2010, interview with the Tallahassee press corps. Much of the pressure and negotiation to remove Greer took place internally, and the "four horsemen," as Greer called them in his lawsuit, are not laying out their individual machinations. But it’s apparent these four party leaders were the ones who had to act after fundraisers and county chairmen rebelled against Greer. Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon and Senate President-Designate Haridopolos were top elected party leaders. Thrasher became a key player by virtue of his quick selection to replace Greer. Regardless of the behind-the-scenes nature of their attempts, the four politicians have been the most visible in their attempts to get Greer out of office. And they acted in the face of initial support for Greer from Gov. Crist, who at the time was still the nominal head of the party. We rate Thrasher’s statement True.

pomt-11013	Indiana expanded Medicaid when Mike Pence was governor	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jul/09/mandy-cohen/nc-democrat-right-about-mike-pence-expanding-medic/	Democrats in North Carolina argue the state should expand Medicaid to help residents pay for health care. Such a move would help hundreds of thousands of uninsured residents, they say, adding that most of the cost would be paid by the federal government. The Affordable Care Act enabled states to cover more people under Medicaid. But the legislation, signed into law by Democratic President Barack Obama, remains deeply unpopular among Republicans, and some state governments — including North Carolina’s — are refusing to expand Medicaid coverage. In North Carolina, a bill to expand Medicaid through a program called "Carolina Cares" was authored by Republicans but doesn’t have enough support to pass in the GOP-controlled legislature. So on June 26, a member of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s cabinet urged Republican legislators to follow in the footsteps of another prominent conservative: Vice President Mike Pence. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, told the crowd at a "Close the Gap Advocacy Day" event that Pence approved Medicaid expansion while governor of Indiana. "When (the Vice President) was Governor of Indiana, he expanded Medicaid," Cohen said, according to this tweet by the executive director of NC AIDS Action. Cohen’s comments came in the waning days of the N.C. General Assembly session, when legislators could have taken up the Medicaid expansion bill but didn’t. When PolitiFact contacted Cohen’s office, spokesman Cobey Culton referenced the websitefor Indiana’s health care program to support her claim. A deal with Obama The ACA, also known as Obamacare, allowed states to expand Medicaid programs to adults earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2015 was about $2,743 a month for a family of four. And it encouraged states to expand coverage by offering to pay for a large majority of the cost. Under standard Medicaid, the federal government offers states a cost-match ranging from 50 to 73 percent. Under the ACA, the federal government paid 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs between 2014 and 2016. It then dropped its support to 95 percent in 2017 and plans to cut its support to 90 percent by 2020. In 2015, then-Indiana Gov. Pence reached an agreement with the Obama administration to expand Medicaid under a custom program known as the "new Healthy Indiana Plan." The words "Medicaid" and "expansion" rarely appear together on Indiana’s health care website. The state describes the program as a "homegrown consumer-driven health care coverage program for low-income adults." And, upon announcing the news, Pence avoided praising Medicaid as an effective coverage option. "I believe Medicaid is not a program we should expand. It's a program that we should reform — and that's exactly what we're accomplishing," Pence said during a speech at an Indiana hospital. "HIP 2.0 is not intended to be a long-term entitlement program. It's intended to be a safety net that aligns incentives with human aspirations." But expand Medicaid, Indiana did. And, by the time Trump and Pence were elected to the White House, Pence was one of 10 Republican governors to expand Medicaid. "Indiana and Arkansas have different names for their programs, but they are accessing federal funds through the ACA Medicaid expansion legislation," said Robin Rudowitz, associate director for the program on Medicaid for the Kaiser Family Foundation. KFF is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that focuses on health care issues. As a result, about 381,000 people were enrolled in Indiana’s program by 2016, according to the State Health Reform Assistance Network. Indiana’s program Some conservatives oppose the idea of expanding Medicaid mainly because they fear the government might shift more of the financial burden to state governments over time. (Despite expanding Medicaid in Indiana, Pence wants to repeal the ACA and has falselyclaimed that expansion made it harder for disabled Ohioans to obtain coverage.) Indiana’s expansion plan gained support from Republicans in part because the Hoosier state implemented controversial qualification requirements. For example, all participants in Indiana’s program must contribute money — from $1 to $27 per month — to a health savings account. Enrollees who miss payments face a reduction in benefits. "In Indiana’s case their waiver contained elements like some increased cost sharing and health savings accounts — other states that have expanded Medicaid have used some of these ideas too," said Adam Searing, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s school of public policy. At the time, Indiana was the 28th state to expand Medicaid and one of the first to require premium payments. Since then, that list of states has grown to 33, and Utah is putting the issue to a vote via a statewide referendum this November. "While Indiana’s expansion doesn’t look exactly like say California’s or New York’s where they just expanded coverage under their existing Medicaid program to the new group of adults, it does look a lot like Arkansas or Kentucky or Arizona or Montana which all used such waivers when they expanded Medicaid," Searing wrote in an email. Effect of conditions The latest Medicaid expansion proposal in North Carolina (Carolina Cares) is modeled after Indiana's program. It would charge premiums and impose work requirements. Critics worried that Indiana’s rules would hinder its ability to cover more people. A recent study found that insurance coverage increased in states that expanded Medicaid — including Indiana. Aaron E. Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University’s School of Medicine and a critic of Indiana’s payment requirements, summarized the findings in a July 2 article for The New York Times. "The good news is that even with these extra requirements, Indiana saw significant gains in Medicaid coverage," Carroll wrote. "But we don’t know if gains would have been even larger without them," he continued. "It’s possible that the churn caused by cost-sharing requirements may be causing the state to underperform. Neighboring states did see larger gains than Indiana itself. But Indiana overperformed compared with other, more distant states, making this unclear." Our ruling Cohen said Indiana expanded Medicaid while Pence was governor. Though Indiana doesn’t refer to its program as Medicaid expansion, the state did expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act while implementing controversial conditions.

pomt-02177	Says Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald "Sterling is a Democrat."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/28/drudge-report/drudge-says-clippers-owner-democrat/	When Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was outed for allegedly making racist comments, conservatives leapt to dig deeper and came up with a surprising find. Sterling is a Democrat. Or so they claimed. Matt Drudge tweeted to more than 264,000 followers: "NYT informed the unwashed how Bundy is a Republican. Leaves out NBA Sterling is a Democrat." A recording of Sterling telling his girlfriend not to bring African-American friends to basketball games came on the heels of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy suggesting blacks would do better as slaves. Hence, Drudge’s tweet comparing the two men. PunditFact adds its research to the work of several other news organizations to correct the record on Sterling. (Hat tips below.) He is a registered Republican, according to the Los Angeles County voter registry. As far as we can tell, the conservative website Daily Caller was the first to tie Sterling to the Democratic Party. It had an click-baiting item on Saturday that declared, "Race hate spewing Clippers owner is Democratic donor." That article listed Sterling’s campaign contributions from more than 20 years ago. He spread a total of $4,000 among three Democrats, including former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, and California Gov. Gray Davis. According to public records, he has given no money to any candidate since. Shortly after midnight, the National Review Online posted that Sterling was a Democrat and then sometime later corrected itself. "An earlier version of this post identified Sterling as a Democrat," the editor wrote. "Although his political donations appear to have been exclusively to Democrats, his official party affiliation is not known." At about noon on Sunday, Drudge made his claim. In the wee hours, as Sunday became Monday, Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik rebutted those statements. Hiltzik tweeted, "What makes anyone think Donald Sterling is a Democrat? LA County records show him registered Republican since 1998." Mother Jones, Talking Points Memo and the Washington Post quickly made the same point during the day on Monday. Our ruling Drudge said Sterling is a Democrat. County records show that he is a registered Republican and has been for many years. His donations to Democrats took place two decades ago and were modest even by the standards of that time. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. Update: As we were publishing our fact-check, Drudge deleted his tweet without explanation.

pomt-05033	"For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/12/secure-america-now/ad-says-obama-apologized-showed-weakness-iran/	A new ad from an independent group claims President Barack Obama apologized and showed weakness on Iran. The ad comes from Secure America Now, which calls itself a "broad-based grassroots coalition of 2 million national security activists." A reader in Florida asked us to check it out. It uses clips from an interview Obama gave in the White House during his first days in office with the Arab network Al Arabiya. A female voiceover says, "For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology." (The words "an apology" flash across the screen.) Then it cuts to Obama telling the interviewer, "Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating." The voiceover says, "He reached out." Obama: "It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran." Voiceover: "Iran answered with terror, attacks on our troops and nuclear weapons development. …Tell President Obama: no apologies, no weakness. It’s time to stop Iran." The claim that Obama has apologized for America has been used and reused countless times -- always falsely -- and we found that this incarnation is only a hair closer to the truth. His first interview Obama sat down with Hisham Melhem, Al Arabiya’s Washington bureau chief, on Jan. 27, 2009. The network, based in Dubai, is regarded as a less-radical format than Al Jazeera and has been criticized for having a pro-Saudi Arabia bias. News coverage at the time billed the interview as Obama’s "first television interview in the White House," according to the New York Times, and "his first formal television interview as president," per the Washington Post. A spokesman for Secure America Now also pointed us to an MSNBC story characterizing the interview as the new president’s first. The Al Arabiya interview was part of a coordinated unveiling of Obama’s diplomatic initiatives. He had just named former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East, and before he sent Mitchell off on a tour of the region, he called Arab and Israeli leaders on his first full day in office. So it’s fair to say this was Obama’s first interview as president. No apology The interview begins with Melhem asking Obama about Mitchell's appointment and how the administration plans to pursue peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians. Obama responds: Well, I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away. And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals. And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues --and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved. And he will then report back to me. From there we will formulate a specific response. Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table. And it's going to be difficult, it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start the steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress. The ad uses only his comments, "Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating." But Obama was discussing how to begin brokering a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. He was not referring to Iran, as the ad implies. In addition, we don’t agree that those words equate to an apology. In that statement, and a few others, Obama seemed to be acknowledging that past efforts in the Middle East have been imperfect. Later, speaking about the wider Arab world, Obama said, "My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that." Nowhere in the interview did Obama use the word "apology," "apologize" or "sorry." PolitiFact has examined the apology claim numerous times. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, wrote in his book and repeated many times that Obama has apologized for America around the world. But again, there isn’t an "I’m sorry" anywhere to be found in Obama’s speeches or remarks. One expert we’ve talked to before says Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told PolitiFact in 2010. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology." Our ruling Secure America Now’s ad says, "For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology." The ad particularly emphasizes that Obama apologized. Obama’s first television interview after taking office was with the Al Arabiya network at the White House. But the ad gets nothing right beyond that. By saying "all too often the United States starts by dictating," Obama was not apologizing but being diplomatic about past strategies that failed to yield results. What’s more, the ad criticizes Obama’s approach to Iran, but his quote actually referred to the Israelis and the Palestinians. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and gives an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05935	"This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jan/27/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-castigated-israel-building-settl/	The Republican presidential candidates want to cast themselves as best buds with Israel and President Barack Obama as the pal of the Palestinians. At a Jan. 26, 2012, debate in Jacksonville, a listener who described himself as a Palestinian-American Republican asked this question: "How would a Republican administration help bring peace to Palestine and Israel when most candidates barely recognize the existence of Palestine or its people?" Romney’s reply included a comment about Hamas and its intent to eliminate Israel while he reiterated his own support for Israel. Then he turned the discussion toward a critique of Obama: "This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip." We emailed Romney’s campaign to ask which Obama speech or speeches he was referring to and did not get a reply, so we will look at a few of Obama’s speeches to the U.N. that included comments about Israel: Sept. 23 2009: It's true that Obama does not specifically mention Hamas. But it's certainly not a one-sided chastisement of Israel. Obama repeatedly calls on Palestinians to understand and respect Israel's security needs and mentions the fear Israelis face about rocket attacks. And Obama notes efforts on both sides. "Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security. Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians," Obama said. "As a result of these efforts on both sides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow. But more progress is needed. We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel, and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements" Obama describes how the U.S. and the U.N. should respond: "The United States does Israel no favors when we fail to couple an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians. And nations within this body do the Palestinians no favors when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over constructive willingness to recognize Israel's legitimacy and its right to exist in peace and security." Obama also talked about the pain both Israelis and Palestinians face: "We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us. It's not paid by politicians," Obama said. "It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night. It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own." Sept. 23 2010: Obama laid out goals for both sides, including that the Palestinians must have opportunities, and that the Palestinians will only win rights through peaceful means and reconciliation with Israel. As for the settlements, Obama said: "Israel's settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks. And our position on this issue is well known. We believe that the moratorium should be extended." It was another even-handed speech in which Obama made his support for Israel evident. Although Obama didn’t mention Hamas specifically, he did criticize those who murder Israelis or fire rockets at them: "It should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at Israel's legitimacy will only be met by the unshakeable opposition of the United States. And efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do nothing to help the Palestinian people. The slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance -- it's injustice. And make no mistake: The courage of a man like President (Mahmoud) Abbas, who stands up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstances, is far greater than those who fire rockets at innocent women and children. …. This time, we will think not of ourselves, but of the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams, or the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire." Sept. 11, 2011: On the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Obama said that the two sides were at a stalemate after he had called for a Palestinian state a year before. Obama spoke about the desires of Palestinians and Israelis, saying they both have legitimate aspirations. He devoted one paragraph here to the Palestinians talking about a future in which they can live in a state "with no limit to what they can achieve." And then Obama had three paragraphs focused on Israel’s side: "But understand this, as well: America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable. Our friendship with Israel is deep and enduring. And so we believe that any lasting peace must acknowledge the very real security concerns that Israel faces every single day. "Let us be honest with ourselves. Israel is surrounded by neighbors that have waged repeated wars against it. Israel's citizens have been killed by rockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their buses. Israel's children come of age knowing that, throughout the region, other children are taught to hate them. Israel, a small country of less than 8 million people, look out at a world where leaders of much larger nations threaten to wipe it off the map. "The Jewish people carry the burden of centuries of exile and persecution and fresh memories of knowing that 6 million people were killed simply because of who they are. Those are facts; they cannot be denied." He didn’t mention Israeli settlements or Hamas specifically, although he did talk about rockets being fired at Israelis. Out of the three speeches we examined, in this one Obama devoted more words to the Israeli side but still spoke of hopes for both sides. Our ruling In Florida, a state with a significant Jewish voting population, Romney said: "This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip." But that doesn’t square with our review of Obama’s speeches. In his 2009 speech to the U.N., Obama said that America does not accept "the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements." Though he did not specifically mention Hamas, he did mention Israeli’s fear of rockets. And in later speeches to the U.N., Obama was blunt in his criticism of violent attacks against Israelis, once saying "the slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance -- it's injustice." Our examination of three of Obama’s speeches to the U.N. showed that Obama is fairly even-handed as he has laid out goals for both sides -- while he spoke against the Israeli settlements, he also bluntly opposed violent attacks on Israelis.

pomt-09263	Says Texas has been waiting for two years for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to "create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today."	false	/texas/statements/2010/may/01/rick-perry/perry-says-state-waiting-feds-act-health-care-prop/	Gov. Rick Perry, a critic of the new federal health care law, said in an April 15 interview with the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine that states could act on their own to reduce the number of residents who lack health insurance. How so? Texas has “had for over two years, waiver requests in front of the Health and Human Services committee — before this administration (of Democratic President Barack Obama) got into place, I might add — that allowed us some flexibility ... to use dollars differently than what are mandated by the federal government to create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today,” Perry said. Perry's point: Texas has proposed some good ideas to help its uninsured residents with health care, but the feds have chosen to sit on them. Really? We sought to learn more. In response to our inquiry, the governor’s re-election campaign provided us with a copy of a 65-page proposal to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services dated April 18, 2008 -- nearly two years to the day before Perry’s Tribune interview. Clarification: According to the campaign, only one waiver request was sent, not "requests" as Perry put it. The Texas proposal states that it “outlines a comprehensive package of health care reforms that will provide more people with insurance, reduce reliance on expensive emergency room visits for basic care, and make it easier for the working poor to buy into employer-sponsored health coverage.” The state would do this, according to the proposal, by creating the Texas Health Opportunity Pool, a fund that would, among other things, provide subsidies to help low-income Texans pay for employer-sponsored insurance or buy into private plans the state would help set up. State officials estimated that by its fifth year, the program would have nearly 700,000 participants and would have cost $30 billion in federal, state and local funds. To generate money for the pool, the state sought permission from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to use federal Medicaid dollars that would normally go to hospitals that serve many uninsured and poor patients. (The federal agency can give states some flexibility in how they operate their Medicaid programs.) Medicaid, established in 1965, uses federal and state funding to provide health insurance to extremely low-income Americans. Perry had previously touted the plan in his 2007 State of the State address, saying that it "recognizes the long-term benefits of providing Texans preventative care through insurance instead of paying for costly emergency room visits." At the time, more than 5 million Texans lacked health insurance. However, Perry's vision for a revamped health care system in Texas -- the state that has had the highest proportion of uninsured residents for years -- hasn't gotten very far since it was sent to Washington in April 2008, George W. Bush's last year as president. In August 2008, Dianne Heffron, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the federal health agency, sent a letter to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission stating that CMS was "willing to work with Texas as part of a formal (waiver) process" but that "a number of areas under this proposal have been identified as problematic" -- making it impossible for the agency to approve the proposal as written. Some cited issues: + A delay -- two years -- before insurance subsidies to parents and adults without children would take effect. + A $25,000 cap on insurance benefits for parents, which the agency indicated was too low. + Extending health coverage to children of legal immigrants who have lived in the country for less than five years; a 1996 rewrite of federal welfare law bars immigrants who have been in the country less than five years from receiving public benefits. After receiving the letter, according to Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, the state went back and forth with federal officials as it unsuccessfully tried to get the waiver approved before Bush left office. On July 31, 2009, Perry wrote to the Obama administration's secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, asking her to approve the request as previously submitted by the state. His letter states that the "negotiation process was under way when the Obama administration took office in January, but is now stalled in Washington." Sebelius replied Oct. 27, writing that federal officials still had concerns about the proposal, including "the proposed funding sources and the extent to which access to health care coverage would be meaningfully expanded." She said she had directed appropriate officials to meet with the state to "help determine next steps and further assist Texas in developing an approvable health reform proposal." On Nov. 1, the state sent Sebelius a two-page document outlining the "principles, values and outcomes contained in the Texas waiver" to "re-familiarize" the feds with the proposal in hopes of extending discussions. When CMS asked for more information, Goodman told us, the state held back, waiting for the outcome of congressional debate over health care. By then, the prospect of national health reform appeared likely to complicate the Texas waiver request. In fact, the new law extended Medicaid coverage to some of the same people Texas had targeted to receive insurance subsidies. "We don’t believe the current (federal) reform plan invalidates our waiver request, but the implementation of the federal reforms would significantly change the landscape so we’d probably have to make some adjustments in our state proposal," Goodman said. Nevertheless, Goodman said, the state has continued to push for the "primary components" of the proposal, including redirecting billions in Medicaid hospital funds to the Health Opportunity Pool, but has received no recent response from CMS officials about that. When we contacted CMS, spokeswoman Mary Kahn said the agency was waiting for Texas to revise and resubmit its proposal. "They haven't sent us anything that meets the full requirements of being a formal waiver request," Kahn said. "In other words, the ball is in the state's court." So, where does all this leave Perry's statement? The governor is correct that the state sought federal permission about two years ago to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool intended to help some low-income Texans get private insurance. Since then, state and federal officials have gone back and forth on the request, with no resolution. Perry portrays the request as still awaiting action by the feds. But the federal agency has told state officials that their proposal needs revision before it can be formally considered. In that sense, federal officials have acted, and the state is responsible for the latest delay that Perry decries. We rate Perry's statement as False.

pomt-05252	"The legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/01/dennis-algiere/ri-sen-algiere-says-legislators-never-got-chance-d/	As fallout from the 38 Studios affair continues to rain down on Rhode Island, the finger pointing and questions of who knew what when are springing up like dandelions. In a May 23 letter to the editor in The Westerly Sun, Harriet Lloyd, executive director of the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition, said it was "disingenuous" for South County legislators Sen. Dennis Algiere and Rep. Donna Walsh to voice dismay over the $75-million loan guarantee that went to Curt Schilling’s company since they voted for the approving legislation in 2010. "The source of the 38 Studios disaster lies in 2010 legislation they ... supported that enabled the EDC to spend taxpayer monies of monumental proportions without approval of voters," she wrote. Her remark provoked a rebuttal letter the following day from Algiere, Walsh and three other Westerly and Charlestown lawmakers -- Representatives Samuel A. Azzinaro and Brian P. Kennedy, and Sen. Francis T. Maher. Together the Democrat and Republican lawmakers wrote: "The legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios." In light of some of the vitriolic reactions to the company’s now precarious existence, we thought it timely to look at the accuracy of the legislators’ statement. Here are the facts: As The Providence Journal chronicled in a Nov. 7, 2010, story, the 38 Studios deal was cloaked in secrecy from the start. In March of that year, then-Gov. Donald Carcieri attended a fundraiser for a World War II documentary at Schilling’s home in Medfield, Mass. Besides the documentary, the two talked business. Carcieri suggested the former Red Sox pitcher bring his new start-up video game company to Providence. During the next several weeks, Schilling and his team met privately with Carcieri’s top aides; Keith Stokes, the newly appointed executive director of the Economic Development Corporation; and House Speaker Gordon D. Fox. Schilling was interested in what funding the EDC could offer him. What emerged from those discussions was an arrangement that would bring the expanding company and the promise of 450 jobs to Rhode Island in return for the state guaranteeing $75 million in loans to the company. During the 2010 legislative session, with banks still not lending money in the aftermath of the housing collapse, Smith Hill lawmakers were already receptive to an EDC proposal for a $50-million revolving loan guarantee fund for small businesses. But what House leaders attached to the state supplemental budget that April for lawmaker consideration -- and what eventually came before them as a separate bill -- was a $125-million proposal. It had a name: the Job Creation Guaranty Program. The added $75 million in loan guarantees was precisely the amount Schilling had told state leaders in private he needed in capital, Stokes told The Journal in 2010. The name of the company was not included in the legislation and rank-and-file members in the House or Senate were not told that 38 Studios or any other specific company would be getting a big chunk of the pot, several lawmakers told the newspaper. In their letter to The Sun last week, Algiere and his colleagues said: "When we voted in favor of the Job Creation Guaranty program nothing in the budget article or in the act that passed specifically referenced 38 Studios. Our ‘yea’ votes were cast with the understanding that many small businesses around the state would have access to the $125 million loan program." In a telephone interview, Algiere raised a good question: would the loan program actually have passed unanimously in the Senate and with only one opponent in the House "if we knew $75 million could be going to one entity? I doubt it. That’s a high risk, start-up company." The legislation’s lone dissenter, Rep. Robert Watson, R-East Greenwich, said in a phone interview that he smelled a "scandal waiting to happen" behind all the secrecy. "38 Studios was never mentioned on the floor as a subject or even a concept," said Watson, "but I got up and railed against [the legislation] just as a generic principle because I feared there was something afoot. Programs that start out as $50 million and balloon to $125 million in a week’s notice, well, there is something up. Someone was going to get it." A videotape of the hearing on the bill supports Watson’s claim. Our ruling Algiere and his fellow legislators from Westerly and Charlestown say the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios. While the legislature did overwhelmingly approve the $125-million loan guarantee fund, it’s clear from news stories at the time and afterward, and from the tape of the debate, that rank-and-file legislators did not know when they voted that $75 million was meant for 38 Studios, even if some of their leaders did. Whether they should have been more skeptical of the loan guarantee fund is another question. We rule the legislators’ statement True (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13557	"The fact is" the Clinton Foundation has "got about 80 percent in overhead and 20 percent of the money is actually getting into the places it should."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/25/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-false-claim-80-clinton-foundation-c/	In a radio interview Aug. 23, 2016, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus wrongly interpreted tax forms submitted by the Clinton Foundation to claim that the foundation spends the vast majority of its donations on overhead and not charitable work. Speaking on The Mike Gallagher Show, Priebus described the foundation as a way to make the Clintons rich and said he couldn’t find examples of charitable work that they do. "And so, these people ask the question in interviews, especially in the liberal media, you know, well ‘don’t you think they do great work?’ Well, I don’t know what great work they do," Priebus said. "I mean the fact is, is if they’ve got about 80 percent overhead and 20 percent of the money's actually getting into the place that it should, then it seems like the only work that the Clinton Foundation is doing is lining the pockets of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And that, to me, should be investigated …" The claim that 80 percent of the money the foundation raises goes to overhead -- a term used to described expenses that go to management and fundraising costs -- is something that has been made by Carly Fiorina and Rush Limbaugh in varying forms. But, despite what Priebus says, it’s an incorrect reading of tax forms submitted by the foundation, experts who monitor and study charitable organizations say. We did not hear back from RNC spokesman Sean Spicer. A wrong reading Priebus’ case is built on the notion that the only charitable work the Clinton Foundation does is in grant-making and, by extension, everything else is overhead. We’ll use the Clinton Foundation’s most recent IRS tax form, for 2014, as an example. (It starts on Page 28 of this document.) The foundation reported total expenses in 2014 of a little over $91 million but grants of just $5.1 million. That’s close to 6 percent of the foundation’s money being spent on grants. Over a five-year period from 2009-12, the foundation raised over $500 million, the conservative website The Federalist reported, but only 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went toward grants. But that doesn’t mean everything else is overhead, people who monitor charities and their practices say. "Although it has ‘foundation’ in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity," Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, wrote in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. "In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment. "Failure to understand the difference led to the widespread claim (covered by the New York Post, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and others) that only a small portion of Clinton Foundation spending goes toward charity. While measuring charitable endeavors by the amount of grants awarded may be appropriate for many private foundations, it is not for an organization that acts as a direct service provider like the Clinton Foundation." What kind of activities? The Clinton Development Initiative is helping farmers in Malawi grow and sell more crops and has built a warehouse where farmers can store their crops for sale. The foundation is doing something similar for coffee farmers in Haiti. In 2013, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership launched the Acceso Centro de Formacion to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia. A lot of what the foundation does is have its employees help facilitate partnerships. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, for instance, has gotten credit for providing access to lower-cost drugs for millions of people with HIV/AIDS. The foundation program consolidated both the supply of raw materials to make the drugs and the bidding to supply the finished product. The result was lower production costs and lower drug prices. Today, the initiative tracks the going price for a menu of treatments and posts them to help health departments around the world as they negotiate with drug companies. Mittendorf and other people who study charities say the most general way to address how much a group spends on charities versus overhead is to look at the audited financial statements that consolidate the financial results of the entities that make up the Clinton Foundation. That include the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Clinton Global Initiative, Clinton Climate Initiative, Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, Clinton Development Initiative, and Clinton Health Matters Initiative. Financial statement rules require a nonprofit to split its expenses between program services, fundraising, and management/general costs (the latter two are collectively what are referred to as "overhead"), Mittendorf told us. He said that in 2014, 87.2 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses were on program services. "Of course, this only speaks to how the organization used its funds and not whether that 87.2 percent was allocated to the most effective program efforts, but it is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this question," Mittendorf said. The American Institute of Philanthropy’s Charity Watch, reached the same conclusion. It has given the Clinton Foundation an A rating and says it spends only 12 percent of the money it raises on "overhead." "The Clinton Foundation is an excellent charity," Charity Watch president Daniel Borochoff said Aug. 24, 2016, on CNN. "They are able to get 88 percent of their spending to bona fide program services and their fundraising efficiency is really low. It only costs them $2 to raise $100." Sandra Minuitti at the group Charity Navigator used the same general calculation when talking to our colleagues FactCheck.org, though she did not include the Clinton Foundation’s affiliates. By that measure, in 2013, 80.6 percent of spending was on program services. Our ruling Priebus said, "The fact is" the Clinton Foundation has "got about 80 percent in overhead and 20 percent of the money is actually getting into the places it should." Priebus is incorrectly reading IRS documents. Only a small amount of the donations collected by the Clinton Foundation are awarded as grants to other nonprofit groups. But that doesn’t mean that every other dollar is "overhead." The Clinton Foundation spends between 80-90 percent on program services, which experts say is the standard in the industry to define charitable works. It spends the majority of its money directly on projects rather than through third-party grants. Conversely, only between 10-20 percent is spent on management of the foundation and fundraising activities, which is tagged as "overhead." Priebus’ claim rates False.

pomt-04005	"We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/07/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-says-small-businesses-are-now-taxed-/	Emerging after a quiet post-election period, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan sat for questions from David Gregory, moderator of NBC’s Meet the Press, who posited that many business owners want Washington to cut a fiscal deal that includes tax increases. Ryan begged to differ. "They believe we should have tax reform," Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate, said during his Jan. 27, 2013 appearance. "We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations. We should have lower tax rates so we can be competitive." It’s well established that the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent is the highest in the world, at least on paper. But is America "taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations"? The starting point here is the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the law spawned by the New Year’s Day deal that prevented the nation from heading over the "fiscal cliff" of spending cuts that was set to trigger in 2013. Among many other things, the cliff deal left the federal corporate tax rate at 35 percent, but raised the top personal tax rate to 39.6 percent. Ryan voted for the bill, bucking a majority of his fellow Republicans. Democrats were overwhelmingly in favor. The final tally was 257-167. The change in individual income tax rates is relevant to business owners because some small businesses and large firms structure themselves as "pass-through" entities such as S corporations or partnerships, rather than traditional corporations. Profits for those entities are taxed under the individual income tax code rather than under the corporate tax structure. Tax experts we consulted agreed that the cliff legislation means that at least some small business owners will be paying more than corporations. So there is a basis for Ryan’s claim. But there are problems with his broad statement that, "We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations." Ryan’s claim, unqualified as it is, leaves the listener with the impression that the higher rates are just a fact of life for small businesses under the bill signed by President Barack Obama. That’s not the case. There is not yet a study that analyzes how small business would be affected by the taxation changes in the American Taxpayer Relief Act. But Ryan’s office pointed us to a pair of federal government reports that included projections of how earlier Obama tax proposals might affect businesses. They cited parts of the studies that found Obama’s plans meant that about half of all net business income would have been subject to rates over the 35 percent corporate rate. That suggests a broad effect. But both of the figures refer to business income, not just small business income. They are not one and the same. As PolitiFact Ohio noted in January 2013, "pass through" businesses that actually file under the individual income-tax code include some very large outfits, including "sole proprietorships and such partnerships as big law firms and financial funds. Goldman Sachs was classified as a partnership before it went public in 1999." One of the studies cited by Ryan, an August 2010 report by the Joint Committee on Taxation, did not attempt to define small business. The other Ryan-cited study did attempt to define small businesses from within that larger pool. It was a 2011 report by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis using 2007 tax data. It’s dated, but is the most comprehensive try at the subjective task of defining what is a small business, and it is widely cited by tax researchers. The study, as Ryan’s camp noted, found about 50 percent of business income was on returns filed by taxpayers who were in the top tax bracket. (It was that top tax rate that was raised for 2013.) But when that same study filtered out larger businesses, the percentage of affected business income dropped to 24 percent to 27 percent, depending on the definition of small business. We found another measure in the report that is relevant to this claim -- the total number of businesses. Looking just at what it defined as small businesses, the Treasury study found that "approximately half of our small businesses reported total income less than $50,000, and almost 90 percent reported net income less than $50,000." That is nowhere near the threshold for the highest tax rate. So, the tax rate for pass-through business income at that level would be nowhere near a point greater than the corporate rate of 35 percent. What’s more, only 2 percent or 3 percent of "pass through" entities defined in the Treasury study as small businesses were at the top tax rate. That study is dated, but the finding is relevant because the new top rate (39.6 percent) under the fiscal-cliff deal applies to nearly the same income levels as the old top rate. We heard that from tax experts at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities -- groups that span the ideological spectrum. There’s another issue with Ryan’s statement, pointed out by Joseph Rosenberg, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center, a joint Urban Institute-Brookings Institution project. Because the Treasury study is from 2011, it analyzed an earlier Obama proposal, not the fiscal cliff legislation (the American Taxpayer Relief Act). The earlier proposal would have raised more high-earning taxpayers into a new bracket above 35 percent than does the cliff deal. On the other hand, William McBride of the Tax Foundation told us the number of pass-through entities has grown relative to the number of corporations since 2007, the year the Treasury study analyzed. And the fiscal-cliff deal could affect business taxes in other ways, including through its new limits on tax deductions. Finally, it should be noted that small business owners are not forced to file under the individual tax code. If they are being bumped into a higher tax rate because of the 2013 vote, they could reorganize and file under the corporate tax rate, which was unchanged. Many won’t because there are advantages to passing through income to individual taxpayers, said Chuck Marr and Chye-Ching Huang of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. McBride addressed the same point. "Yes, pass-through businesses can choose to file as c-corporations, but it is a costly and lengthy process," he wrote in an email. "Plus, the c-corporation tax rate is the highest in the developed world. Out of the fry pan and into the fire." Our rating Ryan’s critique of the U.S. tax system included a remark that, "We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations." That will be true in some cases, applying to a not-insubstantial amount of business profits. But a credible study suggests that many, or even most, small-businesses have income that the new top tax rate won’t touch. And the system allows them to file under the corporate tax system if they so desire. Ryan’s statement has an element of truth but ignores facts that would leave a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2013-02-07T09:00:00	2013-01-27	['None']
pomt-12914	"House Bill 6627 also requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have (automatic voter registration)."	true	/illinois/statements/2017/jan/17/mike-fortner/fortners-claim-about-automatic-voter-registration-/	Sponsors of a new bill to make voter registration automatic with issuance of Illinois driver’s licenses say it fulfills federal standards for proving voter eligibility and protects against fraud. Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed the state's first attempt at automatic voter registration (AVR) over questions about fraud and federal compliance. But the chief co-sponsor of the new legislation, state Rep. Mike Fortner, R-West Chicago, wrote in an op-ed that his bill "requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have (automatic voter registration)." With automatic voter registration gaining momentum in recent years, we decided to look into Fortner’s claim to see whether states that have authorized AVR do in fact require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. Automatic voter registration in the U.S. Illinois’ attempt to institute automatic voter registration failed after Rauner vetoed Senate Bill 250 over concerns it could violate federal election law and open the door to voter fraud. Rauner said he supports modernizing the state’s election system and easing voter access, and noted in his veto message that with a few changes, he could get behind a future version of the bill. That new version was introduced Nov. 15 by House Republican leader Jim Durkin in the form of House Bill 6627. Later that month, Fortner penned an op-ed explaining how the GOP-backed legislation addresses the issues raised by the governor. Six states -- Alaska, California, Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and West Virginia -- and the District of Columbia have enacted AVR as of Dec. 8, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In March 2015, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a law that allows for the automatic registration of eligible residents applying for or renewing a driver’s license, except those who opt out. Most recently, voters in Alaska approved a November ballot measure to allow AVR through the state’s Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which pays a sum to eligible residents who have lived in Alaska for a full calendar year. Once the system is in place, eligible voters, unless they decline, either would be registered automatically or have their existing voter information updated when they complete their annual PFD applications. A total of 29 states considered measures in 2016 to automatically register residents who conduct business with state government agencies and transmit voter information electronically to election officials, according to the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. In addition to Illinois, New Jersey was the only other state whose legislature passed an automatic voter registration bill that ended up being vetoed by the governor. Requirements of automatic voter registration Fortner writes in his op-ed that unlike SB 250, the legislation he’s sponsoring requires an applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, which he says is required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also referred to as the "Motor Voter Act." The language in Fortner’s bill states that a driver’ license/voter registration application must, "unless the applicant declines to register to vote or change his or her registered residence address, require the applicant to attest, by signature under penalty of perjury, to meeting the qualifications to register to vote in Illinois at his or her residence address as indicated on his or her driver's license or identification card application." Federal law mandates states include a voter registration form as part of any application for obtaining or renewing a driver’s license. These applications only can require the minimum amount of information necessary to allow state officials to determine the eligibility of an applicant. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, a "voter registration application must state each voter eligibility requirement (including citizenship), contain an attestation that the applicant meets each requirement, state the penalties provided by law for submission of a false voter registration application and require the signature of the applicant under penalty of perjury." Under SB 250, the Secretary of State’s Driver Services Department would have been permitted to send all information pertaining to an applicant’s identity, address and citizenship to the Illinois State Board of Elections, "regardless of whether or not the individual attested to his or her eligibility to register to vote." That language was one of the sticking points for Republicans who opposed the bill, and was underscored in the governor’s veto message. "Senate Bill 250 does not require an applicant to attest to meeting the qualifications to vote or to sign the application, as required by federal law," Rauner wrote in his veto message. "The bill relies on the State Board of Elections to screen out individuals who are not eligible to vote, even though the State Board may not have access to that information." Do all states with AVR require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote? The second part of Fortner’s statement claims all states with automatic voter registration require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. In a phone interview, Fortner said his staff had verified that each state with automatic registration requires applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. Jonathan Brater, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice’s Democracy Program, referred to the attestation requirement as an "in-the-weeds legal issue." Brater said it’s difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison among states with automatic registration because eligibility requirements are collected differently in each state. He added that the attestation requirement outlined in the motor voter law is from a time when computers weren’t used for voter registration, and that the "specific wording of the law doesn’t really reflect how states do it" today. At least 33 states use electronic registration at DMVs and about 39 currently or soon will offer online voter registration. Both are available in Illinois. "The real problem with the National Voter Registration Act so far is that not enough people are getting to register to vote," Brater said. "Automatic voter registration fulfills the promise of the law that other attempts to implement have not." While states with automatic voter registration do collect eligibility information differently, an analysis of legislation passed by state legislatures shows applicants must attest that they meet the qualifications to vote and/or sign the application form. Here’s a look at AVR requirements in those states: Our ruling In a November op-ed about a Republican-backed automatic voter registration bill, Fortner wrote, "House Bill 6627 also requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have AVR." Fortner argued the House Republican’s automatic voter registration legislation addresses the concerns raised by Rauner when he vetoed SB 250 on Aug. 12. The bill would have permitted the Secretary of State to electronically send information pertaining to an applicant’s identity, address and citizenship to the State Board of Elections, "regardless of whether or not the individual attested to his or her eligibility to register to vote," according to the language of the bill. The West Chicago Republican’s claim that the National Voter Registration Act requires applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote, as do all the states that have automatic voter registration is accurate. An analysis of the legislation passed by the six states and Washington, D.C., that have enacted AVR shows all of them require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote with a signature, and none had language similar to that of Illinois’ bill. We rate Fortner’s claim True.

An April 29, 2016, article on the website RealNewsRightNow.com with the headline "Trump on revamping the military: We’re bringing back the draft" has enjoyed something of a resurgence on Facebook. Users recently reported the story as possibly being fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post includes bogus quotes of Trump at a campaign rally in Costa Mesa, Calif., telling a crowd that he wants to re-establish conscription, which ended in the United States in 1973. "We’re bringing back the draft, OK? We’re going to bring it back, and we’re going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties," he’s quoted. He also goes on to say "was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops." Except Trump never said those things (although he was in Costa Mesa for a rally that day). RealNewsRightNow.com is a parody site attempting to write for comedic effect. Their About Us page doesn’t carry any sort of disclaimer, but it’s apparent from the absurd biography written for alleged founder R. Hobbus J.D that the site is a joke. Besides multiple Pulitzer Prizes and Nobel Peace Prize nominations, Hobbus apparently won the fictional Stephen Glass Distinction in Journalistic Integrity, for example. Glass was a notorious fabricator of scads of people and quotes in stories he wrote for The New Republic. He was exposed back in 1998, before we used the trendy term "fake news." It’s also clear from the other stories on the site that the news is fake.

Trump has been criticized in the past for receiving five draft deferments from 1964 to 1968. Four were educational deferments for attending college and one was a medical deferment for heel spurs. Some opponents labeled Trump a "draft dodger." The goal of the story was obviously to play off this issue.

pomt-02230	"The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world" combined.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/16/anissa-naouai/rt-anchor-says-us-spends-big-military/	A correspondent for RT, the English-language cable news network funded by the government of Russia, and CNN anchor Chris Cuomo recently debated the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the media’s role. Cuomo suggested that CNN and other American media outlets are right to question to what extent Russia is meddling in the events in Ukraine. RT correspondent Anissa Naouai took the opposite tack, saying that the American media is believing everything the government in Kiev is saying while claiming news coming out of Russia is propaganda. You can watch the debate here if you like, but what struck us was a claim by Naouai about the American military. When Cuomo described the United States as "war weary," Naouai responded: "War weary?" she asked. "The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world. I wouldn’t call the U.S. military weary." From the context, it is clear that Naouai was talking about the next 16 biggest military budgets in the world combined. That’s what we decided to check. We found two credible groups that attempt to track military spending around the globe, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank, and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. There are flaws in each group’s numbers -- the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute uses budget figures (not expenditures), and some countries don’t release detailed information on military spending -- but they are generally considered the best approximations available. For the record, Naouai referred us to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, but we’ll look at both. Both groups recently released data for 2013. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute put the U.S. defense budget at just over $600 billion, while the International Institute for Strategic Studies uses a figure of $640 billion. Either number dwarfs the amount of spending by any other country, and plenty of countries combined, both groups conclude. But not the 16 next-biggest countries combined, as Naouai claimed on CNN. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the next 16 biggest militaries spent $801 billion in 2013, and the United States spends as much on the military as the next eight countries combined (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and India). Graphic: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute The International Institute for Strategic Studies only makes the top 15 spenders available for free. According to their analysis, the United States spent $600 billion on defense while the next 14 countries spent a combined $634.5 billion. By the International Institute for Strategic Studies analysis, the United States spends as much as the next 12 biggest countries combined. Graphic: International Institute for Strategic Studies Our ruling Naouai said, "The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world." The United States is definitely No. 1 on the world’s defense spending list. But its expenditures don’t eclipse the next 16 biggest counties combined as Naouai said, according to two independent groups. While we don't think viewers would get a markedly different impression if Naouai had said 8 or 12 instead of 16, her figures are off by a significant-enough margin. As such, we rate her statement Half True.	None	Anissa Naouai	None	None	None	2014-04-16T17:42:08	2014-04-16	['United_States']
pomt-12623	Says there is a "traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2017/mar/31/maggie-hassan/hassan-says-gorsuch-should-be-held-60-vote-thresho/	New Hampshire’s Sen. Maggie Hassan is the latest Senate Democrat to claim that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch should be held to a 60 vote-standard in order to be confirmed. In a letter she wrote on March 28 explaining why she would vote against Gorsuch, Hassan referred to "the traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees." So is 60 votes the "traditional" magic number that Supreme Court nominees need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate? In reality, Gorsuch, like all other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate. And superficially at least, the idea of a 60-vote threshold would seem to be contradicted by the experiences of Clarence Thomas, nominated in 1991 and confirmed on a 52-48 vote, and Samuel Alito, nominated in 2006 and confirmed on a 58-42 vote. However, Senate procedure is complicated, leading to misunderstandings. So let’s walk through the process. How confirmation works First, a nominee must testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Gorsuch did last week. Once the committee passes the nomination -- and the Republican-led committee is expected to easily clear Gorsuch -- it goes to the full Senate. The process requires the Senate majority leader to take the chamber into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. There, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee, or in the case of an objection, would need to invoke cloture, the process to end debate and force a vote. Under a cloture vote, the Senate agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. If Senate Democrats filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination, McConnell would need to invoke cloture. Today, there are 52 Republican senators, so under current rules, the Republicans would need eight Democrats to join them to reach the cloture threshold. That’s a difficult challenge in today’s polarized Congress. If there aren’t enough votes for cloture, McConnell could choose to "go nuclear" - that is, suspend the rules about how many votes Gorsuch would need to end the filibuster, changing it to a simple majority. (Here’s a more detailed discussion of the "nuclear option.") The 60-vote talking point Given the partisan combat over Gorsuch’s nomination, the "60-vote threshold" has become a widely repeated Democratic talking point. When we asked Hassan’s staff to clarify her statement about the "traditional 60-vote threshold," they referred PolitiFact New Hampshire to a list of prior Supreme Court nominees, saying that every one confirmed to the Supreme Court since the Eisenhower administration except for two (Alito and Thomas) either received "unanimous support or has met the sixty vote threshold." "This is the traditional 60 vote threshold that Senator Hassan believes should be maintained," said Hassan’s spokeswoman Meira Bernstein. The problem for Democrats who make this argument is that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee and taking a cloture vote is far from "traditional" in Supreme Court nominations. In fact, it’s only happened four times in modern history, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker. The chamber voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006, and it did the same in 1968, 1971 and 1986. PolitiFact and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked skeptically on claims about the 60-vote standard, including comments by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Bernie Sanders I-Vt., referring to a requirement or a standard of 60 votes. Both of President Barack Obama’s nominees won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-31, and confirmed Elena Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010. However, while the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Hassan’s argument that confirmations require 60 votes, it’s not that simple. Those nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. Even though the margins were greater, the final confirmations required only 51 votes. Our ruling Hassan said that there is a "traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees." Most Supreme Court nominees have indeed reached 60 votes. But not all have, and the official standard remains 50 percent plus one, not 60. And while a 60-vote supermajority for cloture is often required these days for much of the Senate’s business, filing for cloture is actually the exception, not the rule, where recent Supreme Court nominations are concerned. Cloture votes have been required in only four of the 23 confirmations since the Eisenhower Administration. This calls into question Hassan’s use of the term "traditional."

pomt-04859	Says U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson is "a big corporate lobbyist" and has been "lobbying during the middle of the campaign."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/10/eric-hovde/eric-hovde-says-tommy-thompson-big-corporate-lobby/	On the U.S. Senate campaign trail, one of the four Republican candidates answers to "Governor" but most often just plain "Tommy." Just don’t call Tommy Thompson a lobbyist. Republican rival candidate Eric Hovde and Democrats have rankled Thompson with the label "corporate lobbyist." It’s a pointed reference to Thompson’s lucrative private-sector affiliation with dozens of health and other companies that have benefitted from the connections and experience Thompson gained in Washington, D.C. Some of the companies deal with industry regulators that Thompson oversaw as Secretary of Health and Human Services during the George W. Bush administration. In January 2012, the Journal Sentinel reported Thompson’s net worth has reached roughly $13 million, much of in the seven years since he left government and began a career as corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker. Thompson says the "corporate lobbyist" label is flat out false. But Hovde, in a July 26, 2012 interview with Jerry Bader on WTAQ-AM in Green Bay, pressed the claim, even saying Thompson was "lobbying during the middle of the campaign." Is Hovde right? Even during the campaign? Hovde makes three points in support of his statement: Thompson’s employment at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Washington, D.C.; a media report on Thompson contacting a North Carolina lawmaker; and a campaign-donation report that listed Thompson’s occupation as "lobbyist." Washington firm Hovde correctly calls Akin Gump a "lobbying firm" -- it’s considered a Washington lobbying powerhouse. But it’s also an international law firm, and Thompson, an attorney, was listed as a partner before he left in January 2012 to campaign for U.S. Senate. Some Akin Gump partners are registered lobbyists while others, such as Thompson, are not registered to lobby, according to public databases of federal lobbyists. Thompson points to his unregistered status as proof he’s not a lobbyist. But does that mean Thompson doesn’t lobby federal officials? Not by itself. Federal law requires individuals to register as lobbyists if they have more than one lobbying contact in a three-month period while representing a client. The work must make up at least 20 percent of the lobbyist’s work for a client. Thompson, then, could limit such contacts, put his influence to work, and still fly beneath the rules. "We have at least 3,000 unregistered lobbyists, and the number is probably far higher than that," said Howard Marlowe, a lobbying firm president and head of the American League of Lobbyists, who spoke in general and not specifically about Thompson. So, Hovde proves nothing by pointing to Thompson’s employer and didn’t point to a single lobbying incident. Thompson’s defense, meanwhile, is a point in his favor but does not close the case. Telephone call Hovde referred us to a May 2012 Bloomberg news account -- confirmed by Thompson -- in which the former governor called the speaker of the North Carolina state House of Representatives about a state bill toughening regulations on controversial dental management companies. Private-equity firms have invested heavily in such firms, and Thompson has consulted with several private-equity firms, leading to speculation he was lobbying against the bill -- and right in the midst of the Senate race. But the North Carolina lawmaker, Thom Tillis, says he and Thompson never connected. Thompson told us he called not on behalf of a paying client, but a "friend of a friend" -- whose name he could not recall -- who wanted to know when the bill would be considered. So, at best that part of the claim is murky. Campaign report Finally, there’s the matter of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (R-North Dakota) listing Thompson as a "lobbyist" on a 2010 campaign report showing a $1,000 donation from Thompson. There is a document showing that in Federal Election Commission records. Thompson’s campaign says Thompson didn’t list himself that way, suggesting that Hoeven’s campaign erroneously wrote in that occupation. Hoeven’s campaign did not get back to us. The big picture We could not find any media references that labeled Thompson a lobbyist. One Thompson affiliation that drew our attention was his role as chairman of an advisory board at Constella Group, a North Carolina medical research firm. Constella’s CEO has said Thompson was brought on to "connect" the company with U.S. and foreign governments and advise it on growth strategies. Constella then agreed to hire Akin Gump -- but not Thompson specifically -- as its lobbyist, the Journal Sentinel reported in 2007. That’s getting closer to what a lobbyist does, but Thompson told us nothing he did for Constella constituted lobbying, and we found no evidence otherwise. In Washington, the kind of work Thompson does is often described as either a "strategic advice" consultant or a "rainmaker" whose influence and connections bring work to his firm. Bill Broydrick, a veteran lobbyist in Wisconsin and Washington, put it this way: "A consultant’s responsibility is to give his or her client their best professional advice, and that is not lobbying. That’s telling people how they should lobby." Indeed, Thompson has told reporters that he does work with a lobbyist at Akin Gump who lobbies for health care clients. An Akin Gump spokesman told us: "Gov. Thompson was a strategic adviser in Akin Gump’s health care practice, and did not engage in any activity that required him to register as a lobbyist." Thompson’s situation reminds us somewhat of the debate during the GOP presidential primary over Newt Gingrich’s statement that he "never lobbied under any circumstance" for Freddie Mac, a mortgage company giant connected to the federal government. Gingrich acknowledged that Freddie Mac hired his consulting group but he said it was only for strategic advice and broadening contacts among conservatives, not lobbying. In rating Gingrich’s claim Half True, PolitiFact National said he was technically correct but took pains to avoid being subject to the lobbying rules and use his influence as an adviser. Thompson appears to have taken similar pains. He told us Akin Gump wanted him to register as a lobbyist, but he refused. He is far less definitive when asked directly if he has ever contacted a legislator on behalf of any corporate client to urge action on a bill. He first told us he didn’t think he had, but then said couched it to say he couldn’t say for sure. Not exactly a denial. Our conclusion Hovde claims Thompson was a corporate lobbyist and has even lobbied during the current campaign. By the official definition, Hovde is off. Thompson is not a registered lobbyist and the the only significant evidence of direct contact with an elected official is the North Carolina example. On the other hand, it’s clear that Thompson has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register. As with the Gingrich claim, we rate this one Half True.	None	Eric Hovde	None	None	None	2012-08-10T13:26:42	2012-08-12	['Tommy_Thompson', 'United_States']

pomt-07900	"The two worst counties for (Medicaid) fraud in the country -- not state -- are Dade and Broward county."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/03/ron-saunders/saunders-says-dade-broward-rule-country-medicaid-f/	South Florida has a reputation as a place ripe for fraud and crime -- including bilking the government. State Rep. Ron Saunders, the Democratic minority leader from Key West, has slapped a more specific label on a costly problem in South Florida: Medicaid fraud. "The two worst counties for fraud in the country -- not state -- are Dade and Broward county," he told a roomful of reporters on Jan. 19, 2011, during an Associated Press preview of Florida's upcoming legislative session. It's easy to find news articles describing South Florida as a mecca for such fraud -- with labels such as "ground zero" or mind-boggling tales of abuse. But the word "worst" caught our eye -- are the South Florida counties of Miami-Dade and Broward truly the "worst" in the country for Medicaid fraud? Medicaid, a health care program for low-income individuals, is administered by the states and receives some federal funding. The Truth-O-Meter has weighed in multiple times on fact-checks related to the high cost and growth of Medicaid, including a claim by Pam Bondi, now Florida's attorney general, and Bill McCollum, Florida's previous attorney general. For more background, check out this website of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We spoke to Saunders directly on Jan. 20, who told us that his statement was in response to a question about how to resolve the state's budget crisis. Saunders said it's a "no-brainer" to cut back on fraud such as in Medicare and Medicaid rather than make more cuts in areas such as education. But after a lot of calls and research, we can say one thing for certain: Nobody tracks county-by-county Medicaid fraud nationally. Even within Florida, a county breakdown is not available. So we're going to rely on expert opinions and documented trends in this ruling. Mark Hollis, spokesperson for the House Democratic caucus, sent us links to newspaper articles and government reports about Medicaid fraud in South Florida. Among the sources Hollis cited was a March 2009 article in Health News Florida, quoting state Sen. Don Gaetz saying: "Since we have the worst problem in the nation, we need the most effective solution." Hollis also sent us a December 2005 article in HomeCare, an industry publication, quoting FBI agent Michael Clemens, who was in charge of the Miami field office at the time, saying: "South Florida is ground zero for health care fraud." But neither article provides any documentation to support that "worst" label. Hollis also sent us links to a House bill and recent government reports about Medicaid fraud. House Bill 1487 in 2009, which labeled Miami-Dade an area of "special concern," was intended to rein in Medicaid fraud. The Senate version, Senate Bill 2658, was signed into law in June 2009. The staff analysis outlined the rampant growth in home health care agencies in Florida: Of the 431 licensure applications in 2007, 58.5 percent were in Miami-Dade. In that county, the number of licensed agencies grew 414 percent between August 1999 and March 6, 2009. The analysis also stated that "While Miami-Dade has about 20 percent of Florida’s Medicaid population and about 33 percent of Florida’s residents over the age of 60, 91 percent of the state reimbursement for certain home health services were going to Miami-Dade." While the bill analysis doesn't provide data ranking all of Florida's counties, it certainly suggests that Miami-Dade has an overwhelmingly disproportionate share of Medicaid dollars -- and fraud. Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, which administers the Medicaid program, has a report from 2009-10 that also provides some insight. Although the 94-page report does not describe Broward and Miami-Dade as the worst in the nation, it noted: • "Home health agencies have been an acknowledged area of health care fraud in recent years. For the four fiscal years ending June 30, 2009, approximately 90 percent of Medicaid expenditures for home health aide visits were made to providers in Miami‐Dade County, while only about 20 percent of Medicaid recipients reside in that area. At the end of the fiscal year, there were 339 home health agencies in Miami‐Dade County actively enrolled in the Medicaid program and only 293 in the other 66 counties combined." (Page 53) • Statutes were changed in 2008 and 2009 to address home-health fraud. Forty-seven licensure denials for home health agencies were upheld in FY 2009-10 for fraud-related reasons. Thirty-one of the denials (66 percent) were in Miami-Dade County. (Page 65) We reached out to several agencies that have a role in Medicaid. Both the Florida Attorney General, which has a Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, and AHCA said they had no nationwide county-by-county information to support or refute Saunders' claim. Don White, spokesman for the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also told us that the federal government has "no statistics on Medicaid fraud." As for Saunders' claim that Dade and Broward are the "worst" in the country, White said: "Do we have the numbers? No. Is he probably correct? Yes." We ran Saunders' claim by Alan Levine, a former secretary at AHCA under Gov. Jeb Bush and an expert on Medicaid. "I have absolutely no doubt South Florida is among the highest," Levine wrote in an e-mail. "Others that likely run in the same circle are New York and New Jersey. But South Florida, from all the experience I have, clearly leads the way." Levine sent us a 2009 report, "Stop Paying the Crooks," by the Center for Health Transformation, an organization founded by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. It stated that the U.S. Department of Justice labeled "South Florida -- and more specifically, Miami-Dade County --Ground Zero for health care fraud in America." But no numbers ranking counties nationwide. We sent Saunders' claim to Craig Smith, the attorney who wrote the South Florida chapter, who works at Hogan Lovells law firm in Miami. "Whatever the exact figure is, there can be no question that the bulk of the fraud, waste and abuse is occurring in Miami-Dade and Broward counties," Smith wrote to us in an e-mail Feb. 1. "Based on the size of Florida's Medicaid program, you can fairly eliminate about 45 states from the comparative discussion." So let's review: Saunders said that "The two worst counties for (Medicaid) fraud in the country -- not state -- are Dade and Broward county." We could not find any government office that could point to numbers ranking counties across the nation in terms of Medicaid fraud. But we found four experts -- one from the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, one a former secretary of the state's AHCA, a spokesperson from a national organization that provides information on health care fraud and an attorney who specializes in health care law -- who all agree that Saunders is likely right. At PolitiFact Florida, we dig for data to support claims by politicians -- and Saunders and our experts haven't provided hard numbers to prove him right. But the fact that four experts -- including one appointed by a Republican governor -- generally back up the Democratic minority leader or say that the two counties are at least among the worst in the nation carries weight with us. We rate Saunders’ claim Mostly True.	None	Ron Saunders	None	None	None	2011-02-03T11:51:44	2011-01-19	['None']

pomt-10734	''The leading Democratic candidate once said that the unfettered free market is the most destructive force in modern America.''	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/13/rudy-giuliani/distorting-the-view/	One of Rudy Giuliani's frequent targets on the campaign trail is Hillary Clinton. And one of his frequent lines is: ''The free market is . . . one of our greatest assets. And the leading Democratic candidate once said that the unfettered free market is the most destructive force in modern America. I mean, just get an idea of where the philosophy comes from.'' Except Clinton never called the free market ''destructive.'' Giuliani is blatantly — and repeatedly — misquoting a line from her 1996 book, It Takes a Village. In the text, Clinton quotes author Alan Ehrenhalt, who wrote in his book The Lost City: ''The unfettered free market has been the most radically disruptive force in American life in the last generation.'' During a March 1996 interview on the C-SPAN program Book Notes, Clinton said she agreed with the statement. But the word ''disruptive'' is not the same as ''destructive'' in the context of the free market, said Ehrenhalt, executive editor of Governing magazine. The magazine is published by CQ and is an affiliate of the St. Petersburg Times . "There's no particular reason for a controversy," he said. "But Giuliani is looking for anything to say against Hillary Clinton ... and he keeps distorting it." Most economists would agree, Ehrenhalt said, with his assertion that the free market causes interruptions, whether positive or negative, in its normal course — which is the dictionary definition of disruptive. A Giuliani campaign spokesman didn't see a difference between the words. ''No one can deny that Mayor Giuliani was accurate in describing Hillary Clinton's economic philosophy,'' said spokesman Elliot Bundy. Clinton's campaign didn't want to comment on the issue, but her full answer to the C-SPAN question provides more context. ''The market is the driving force behind our prosperity, our freedom ... (but) it cannot be permitted just to run roughshod over people's lives as well,'' she said. Because of Giuliani's misquote, we give this a ruling of False.

pomt-07813	The United states is "borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/17/scott-rigell/rep-scott-rigell-says-united-states-borrows-more-4/	Federal budget season officially opened on Feb. 14 with the release of President Obama’s spending proposal for the coming fiscal year. Some of the first shots were fired by Virginia Republicans in the House of Representatives, charging Obama is not doing enough to cut spending and sink budget deficits. "We are a nation $14 trillion in debt and are borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend," said Scott Rigell, who represents Virginia’s Second District, in a press release. Rigell is not the only Republican using that line. We wanted to see if it is true. Crystal Cameron, Rigell’s director of communications, told us the congressman based his statement on the Treasury Department’s monthly report on the government’s income and expenditures. We turned to those summaries and did some math. In fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30, 2010, the federal government had revenues of $2.16 trillion. It spent $3.46 trillion. That means the deficit was 37.5 percent of total spending. The Treasury also has information through January of this fiscal year. The U.S. has spent $1.18 trillion while receiving $758.35 billion. That gives us a deficit worth 35.6 percent of spending. Uncle Sam projects the deficit will be of 36.9 percent spending for the entire 2011 fiscal year. So the true figures are a bit below Rigell’s claim that we are covering 40 cents of every dollar spent with debt. But he’s pretty close to the right number. There is, however, a catch. The Treasury Department divides its revenue and spending into two categories: on-budget and off-budget. Matt Anderson, a Treasury spokesman, said off-budget contains Social Security and the Postal Service. The services are not included in budget bills approved because they are expected to be self-supporting, although in recent years Congress has spent money to cover losses at the Postal Service. All other revenues and spending are considered on-budget. A chunk of our payroll taxes go directly into Social Security funds, which are then disbursed to recipients. The money never goes into the larger pool of U.S. revenue, nor do receipts from income taxes, corporate taxes or other forms of federal revenue go towards Social Security payments. The off-budget programs run a surplus. During the 2010 fiscal year they had revenue of $631.69 billion against spending of $554.69 billion. That means the deficit for on-budget programs was 47.3 percent. The full-year estimate for the 2011 fiscal year would put the deficit in on-budget programs at 45.9 percent. We asked Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow and budget expert at the center-to-left Brookings Institution, to check our figures. She and her research assistant, Alex Gold, confirmed our math. They said "the exact numbers depend on the time period examined, but 40 percent seems to be a reasonable ballpark figure." To get historic perspective, we looked at U.S. budgets from 1930 until 2010. The highest deficits, as a percentage of spending, came in 1943 during World War II, when 69.5 percent of spending was debt financed. In 1985, during when Ronald Reagan was president, the gap was 22.4 percent, and the deficit gap never fell below 11 percent under his watch. In 1995, during the Clinton Administration, the gap was 10.8 percent. The budget would actually enjoy four years of surplus at the end of his tenure, reaching a high point with revenues exceeding spending by 13.2 percent in 2000. In 2005 under George W. Bush, deficit spending accounted for 12.9 percent of outlays. The 2009 budget, passed during Bush’s final months in office and altered when Obama took over, saw spending exceed revenues by 40.2 percent. To review, Rigell said the United States is "borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend." Under the total budget figures the deficit is actually a bit smaller than that mark, coming in at 37.5 percent in the last fiscal year and a slightly lower number so far this year. But when Social Security and Postal Service funds are excluded, as they are from the annual federal budget, the size of the deficit climbs above 40 percent.

pomt-09194	"There are 321,092 public school teachers in Texas. And there are 313,850 non-teachers in our public schools."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/may/27/empower-texans/pac-says-texas-public-schools-employ-one-non-teach/	Urging Texans to find out how public schools are spending their money, Michael Quinn Sullivan, president of the conservative-leaning Empower Texans, which advocates for limited government, suggests that maybe too many non-teachers are soaking up taxpayer dollars that could be spent on classroom instruction. "Everyone says public schools in Texas are underfunded, but are they?" Sullivan says in the May 14 Web video, pointing out that more than half of the public school system's funding is spent on expenses outside the classroom. "You might say there's a little overhead." "There are 321,092 public school teachers in Texas. There are 313,850 non-teachers in our public schools," he continues. "Do we really need one non-teacher for every teacher on the public school payroll?" We're not weighing in on the value of non-teachers in the schools, but we wondered if Sullivan got his ratio right. He pointed us to the Texas Education Agency website, which has annual "snapshots" of public education in Texas both statewide and by district. The reports cover 90 statistics including student demographics, average college admission test scores and how many people each district employs broken down by job type. According to the most recent snapshot, 634,942 full-time employees worked in the public education system (not including charter schools) in 2008-09. Of those, 321,092 were full-time teachers and 313,850 staff members held other jobs. Who are all these non-teachers? According to the snapshot, teachers accounted for 51 percent of the schools' workforce in 2008-09. Auxiliary staff — such as security, public information officers and grant writers, according to TEA — were the next biggest grouping, 28 percent, followed by educational, at 10 percent, professional support staff, 8 percent, and administrative staff, 4 percent. This adds to more than 100 percent, the agency said, because some full-time employees divide time between positions. Sullivan said Empower Texans isn't suggesting that "all 'non-teachers' are bad — clearly many are needed," but that the one-to-one teacher to non-teacher ratio "seems a bit high." In the Web ad, Sullivan sounds a critical note, saying: "Hey, we've got bureaucrats to pay. If you think our classrooms are underfunded — and they probably are — the money should be pretty easy to find. Just walk down to your nearest administrative complex." There's a counterpoint. Debbie Ratcliffe, the TEA's communications director, said: "It takes a village to run a school district." "There naturally are going to be a lot of people on school payrolls that aren't teachers," Ratcliffe said. "Just think of the number of bus drivers and custodians and all those kinds of folks. Could you make a school run without them? Yeah, but it sure is a lot harder." Ratcliffe shared a more recent "standard report" that breaks down the full-time school employees for 2009-10 in detail. As of March 2010, the report says, statewide school district personnel totaled 661,285. Teachers made up about half of that, accounting for 333,090 full-time staff. Almost all the employees that fall under teaching staff are pre-kindergarten through 12th grade teachers. About 400 are labeled "not applicable," which Ratcliffe said includes tutors and study hall monitors. The 2010 count puts the number of administrative staff at 25,525, or 3.9 percent of all workers. So who are the other 302,670 employees — the bulk of the "non-teachers" in Sullivan's claim? About 5,136 are librarians, 11,082 are counselors, 5,916 are nurses and 3,924 are speech therapists, among others. Some 178,140 are classified as auxiliary staff, a category that includes security personnel, public information officers and grant writers. How does Texas stack up nationally? On par, according to the the National Center for Education Statistics' most recent data. In 2007, teachers accounted for 51 percent of all elementary and secondary public school employees. In 20 states, teachers accounted for less than 50 percent of total staff, including Virgina (35 percent). In 30 states, teachers made up 50 percent or more of all staff, including South Carolina (72 percent). According to another report, released in November, instructional aides accounted for about 12 percent of all full-time public school staff nationwide, instructional coordinators and supervisors made up 1 percent, guidance counselors (2 percent), librarians (1 percent), student and support staff (23 percent), school administrators (3 percent), school district administrators (1 percent) and administrative support staff (7 percent). Where does all this leave Sullivan's statement? He correctly cites the number of teachers and non-teachers, per the education agency's latest snapshot report. More recent data available from the agency shows both have increased; still, the ratio of teachers to non-teachers is about the same. But Sullivan's online call to action doesn't do justice to the state's actual mix of school workers. The majority of non-teachers aren't administrators or paper shufflers; they're people who work directly with students including counselors, librarians, therapists and bus drivers. We rate Sullivan's statement as Mostly True. This story was updated to correct the total number of public school employees to 634,942.

pomt-08020	"In my 12 years in the House, I have watched my district go from a solidly Democratic district to a heavily solid Republican district."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/10/allan-ritter/party-switching-legislator-allan-ritter-says-his-d/	Democrat-turned-Republican state Rep. Allan Ritter told reporters last month that the district he represents once was true blue, but it’s now dead red. Ritter was less, uh, poetical at a Dec. 14 Austin press conference confirming his switch, which helped Republicans edge toward the 101-vote Texas House super-majority they’ll have when the 2011 legislative session starts Tuesday. "In my 12 years in the House, I have watched my district go from a solidly Democratic district to a heavily Republican district," the Nederland resident said of House District 21, which takes in a portion of Beaumont and extends through southwestern Jefferson County. His comment appeared in a Dec. 15 Dallas Morning News article. Did most voters in Ritter’s district shift right in that time? To gauge election returns, we contacted the Texas Legislative Council, which provided results of various general-election races for Ritter’s district from 1994, four years before he first won his seat, through 2008; analyst Clare Dyer told us the council has yet to analyze 2010 results within the district. We also asked Jefferson County for breakdowns of district results. What we found is that Republicans running statewide were strong vote-getters prior to Ritter’s election, a sign the Dems’ grip on the district was already loosening. Still, Democrats continued to win a share of down-ballot races, though that pattern has faded. Also notable: Jefferson County, historically pro-union, pro-Democratic territory, saw numerous down-ballot races in which the GOP offered no nominees. Also, the district’s configuration changed slightly in redistricting after the 2000 census. We scrutinized district results based on boundaries in place at the time of each election. Some particulars: +In November 1994, seven Republicans running statewide carried the district, topped by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison with 61 percent. But seven Democratic statewide hopefuls also prevailed, led by Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock at 65 percent. +In 1998, Ritter drew 53 percent of the district’s vote, while Democratic state Sen. David Bernsen of Beaumont won 61 percent; U.S. Rep. Nick Lampson fared the best of Democrats in races analyzed by the council, gathering 68 percent. No Democrats won statewide office that year, but five nominees carried HD 21 including two judicial choices and Jim Mattox (for attorney general), 54 percent; John Sharp (lieutenant governor), 53 percent; and Paul Hobby (state comptroller), 52 percent. Eight Republican hopefuls including four judicial nominees won the district, topped by Gov. George W. Bush, at 68 percent. According to Jefferson County, a Democrat carried part of HD 21 in 1998 for a county commissioner’s seat, while a Republican seeking another commissioner seat carried a different part. Among HD 21 voters, Republican Jimmy D. "Skip" Hulett bested his Democratic opponent for a district court judgeship, though Hulett lost his race over all. +In 2000, Ritter won 57 percent of the district vote, compared to Lampson’s 63 percent. Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison got 66 percent with Bush, the GOP presidential nominee, drawing 62 percent. +In 2002, Ritter romped with 70 percent as Lampson garnered 66 percent in the district. However, every Republican running statewide--with the leading vote-getter being State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander, 64 percent--carried the district. From 2004 through 2010, Ritter ran unopposed in November elections as Republicans running for state and federal office enjoyed continued gains: +In 2004, Bush won 63 percent in the district as Democrat Lampson got 59 percent though he lost his seat to a Republican challenger in a district that had been redrawn by the GOP-majority 2003 Legislature. +In 2006, every Republican running statewide carried the district, led by Hutchison, who drew 65 percent. At the bottom of the statewide slate was Perry, who got 45 percent of the district vote versus three major foes. Down-ballot, the Democratic nominees for Jefferson County judge, Ronald Walker, and the 279th state district judgeship, Randy Shelton, drew 52 and 51 percent, respectively. +In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain drew 66 percent of the vote, while Cornyn carried 64 percent, compared to 55 percent statewide for both. In contested statewide races, no Republican carried less than 56 percent of the district vote. +In November 2010, Republicans beat Democrats in the district for three Texas Supreme Court seats, a seat on the state’s highest criminal court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and a spot on the Ninth Court of Appeals. Down ballot, Republican hopefuls for county treasurer and tax assessor-collector trounced their Democratic foes--also prevailing countywide in the historically Democratic bastion. To our queries, partisan consultants Mike Baselice and Ed Martin said the district leans Republican, but Martin, a Democratic strategist, said it hasn't changed as much as Ritter claims. Baselice, a GOP pollster, stressed numbers that he said demonstrate the district shifting 10 percentage points over 10 years. In 1998, the base Republican vote in the district was 47 percent, he said, a figure based on entwining the results of races for lieutenant governor and state comptroller (and ignoring third-party votes). In 2008, the base GOP vote was 57 percent, based on the results in one race for the Texas Supreme Court. In an interview, Ritter told us voter perceptions have swung. "I can’t say that a Democrat, the right candidate, cannot win in the district... My point is that the overall view and philosophical view and the comfortability of the voters, they are leaning heavy conservative and Republican. I can tell you, just from the reaction we’ve been getting locally that’s overwhelmingly supportive of (my switch), I know this is the right move." Finally, Bruce Drury, a retired Lamar University professor of political scientist, cautioned against basing conclusions about the district’s tilt on the latest elections, which were widely viewed as a referendum on national affairs and the Democratic leadership in Washington. Drury said: "If the Republicans screw up Congress and (the) 2012 (election) becomes a plebiscite on that and (President Barack) Obama appears to be successful, then Allan Ritter could well be in trouble." Our sense? Republicans running statewide had an edge in Ritter’s district before his first election and that advantage expanded in subsequent elections as Democrats became less successful. During the 12 years, though, Democrats still pulled off some wins, while a few candidates (like Ritter) managed not to stir up GOP challengers. Whether such free rides will continue is uncertain. Rittter exaggerates how "solidly Democratic" his district was; he’s closer to the mark on how Republican it became. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-05244	"We came out against Deepwater and everybody is now paying for [the project] in their electric bills."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/03/lisa-blais/tea-party-leader-lisa-blais-says-rhode-island-cons/	The controversy over Rhode Island's decision to guarantee $75 million in loans to 38 Studios to develop video games has raised questions about the government's role in promoting various businesses. When Lisa Blais, a member of the board of directors of Ocean State Tea Party In Action, was asked about the deal on the May 21 edition of WHJJ's "Helen Glover Show," she brought up the state's support of the Deepwater Wind project, which is planning to build wind turbines in the waters off Block Island. "As you know, we came out against Deepwater," Blais said. "And everybody is now paying for it in their electric bills." With the Rhode Island economy in such bad shape and many residents facing financial problems, "who can afford these extra surcharges on our electric bill," she asked, calling the Deepwater project another example of "crony capitalism." Her claim caught our attention because Deepwater is still in the planning stages, years away from completion. We wondered: Are Rhode Islanders really paying for a project that hasn’t been built? Before we answer that question, here’s some background. In 2004, the General Assembly passed a law requiring National Grid -- the company that provides electricity and gas to Rhode Island -- to start buying electricity generated from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, even though such sources cost more. In 2007, when the law took effect, the amount was 3 percent of the power the company purchased, rising incrementally each year. It is now at 6.5 percent, according to David Graves, spokesman for National Grid. In 2009, the legislature and Gov. Donald Carcieri modified that law, requiring National Grid to actively encourage renewable energy projects; one of them was to be an undersea power line from Block Island to the mainland. The line would be used to feed cheaper power to the island (currently the island relies on diesel generators for its power). Ultimately, the line would feed excess electricity from the Deepwater turbines to the mainland when the wind is blowing. In the first phase, there would be five turbines. In the second phase, up to 200 more would be built in federal waters. National Grid has racked up some legal costs dealing with that power line and those costs are being passed on to consumers as part of a 0.007 cents per kilowatt hour surcharge on their bills. For the typical residential customer -- who uses about 500 kilowatts per month -- that surcharge translates to no more than 3.5 cents per month. The real cost is going to come when National Grid has to buy the power Deepwater generates. Initially, National Grid and Deepwater agreed that National Grid would pay no more than 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for that energy -- but that was still more than two and a half times the cost of buying energy from conventional sources at the time. However, that price would automatically increase by 3.5 percent per year over the next 20 years. The state Public Utilities Commission overruled the deal on March 30, 2010, saying the price was not "commercially reasonable" for Grid's customers. Carcieri and legislative leaders reacted by passing a law requiring the PUC to rehear the case using different rules and a shortened timetable. It also redefined what was "commercially reasonable" and declared that Deepwater's initial Block Island project was "in the public interest." Critics said the changes gave the PUC no choice but to approve the agreement, even though the project was expected to result in consumers paying $409 million to $415 million extra for their power while getting economic benefits worth $129 million (as calculated by the state Economic Development Commission) and the creation of just six permanent jobs. The PUC approved the agreement by a 2-1 vote on Aug. 11, 2010. How much extra will the power from Deepwater Wind ultimately cost consumers? On an individual basis, Graves said, the best estimate in 2009 was that the typical residential bill would rise by $1.37 per month. The actual amount will depend on prices at the time. To put that number in context, the bill for the average customer is currently $78 a month. But the costs will show up in other ways as well, as businesses struggle with more-expensive electricity, an effect that will ripple through the Rhode Island economy. Benefits, such as cleaner energy, are even harder to quantify. Our ruling Lisa Blais of the Ocean State Tea Party In Action said that, in the wake of the state's approval of the Deepwater Wind project, "everybody is now paying for it in their electric bills." When we asked for the source of her information, she said she remembered it from the debate over Deepwater, but said she should have referred to the extra cost as something consumers will be facing. "I would have been more precise if I said now 'we face' paying for it, which was the tenor of my comments on Glover's show," she said. If the Deepwater Wind project becomes operational and if prices for purchasing electricity don't change significantly, Blais' statement could become true. But most radio listeners would have heard what we did: that we're paying for the project now. In the strictest sense, we're paying less than 3.5 cents a month for some incidental National Grid expenses connected with the project. That's enough to avoid a False on the Truth-O-Meter, but not enough juice to move the needle very far. We rate her statement Mostly False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-11944	"President Trump signs executive order stripping NFL of ‘non-profit’ status."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/10/blog-posting/donald-trump-did-not-kill-nfls-tax-exempt-status-e/	A news story that asserts President Donald Trump’s feud with the National Football League led him to revoke the organization’s nonprofit tax status is a trick play created by a fake news website. The headline on an Oct. 9, 2017, post on ConservativePaper.com read, "President Trump signs executive order stripping NFL of ‘non-profit’ status." Facebook users flagged the content as possibly being bogus, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news stories. The same story appeared on several other websites reported by Facebook users. The story, which is fake, said Trump on Oct. 8 had revoked the NFL’s "401(c)(3) status ‘until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.’ " (There is no such thing as tax-exempt 401(c)(3) classification in the tax code.) This was a response to players protesting racial inequity by kneeling during the Star-Spangled Banner, which has raised Trump’s hackles in recent weeks. Now, it may surprise some to know that the NFL’s league office did have tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit — a tax classification for business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate and trade boards and yes, professional football leagues. The change in the tax code was granted in 1966, to allow the NFL and AFL to merge without the threat of violating anti-trust laws. The league office essentially acts as a trade organization for the individual teams, which are what make most of the league’s profits, which are taxed. This is different than 501(c)(3) status, which is for charitable organizations. But the league voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status in 2015 after being criticized by politicians who thought the entire league was avoiding taxes. "As you know, the effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in the letter to team owners that year. "The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax-exempt." U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., revived the subject on Sept. 26 when he became lead sponsor of the Pro Sports Act, looking to make the voluntary status change permanent by changing the tax code. Trump also brought up the issue on Oct. 10, when he tweeted, "Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But he didn’t sign any executive order rescinding the league’s tax status, which it had voluntarily changed already. The fake story appeared to originate two days before Trump’s tweet, in an Oct. 8 post on FreedomJunkshun.com, which looks to be member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. FreedomJunkshun.com uses the same website architecture as other Blair-affiliated sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, "All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations."

pomt-02758	"In every poll," John Cornyn "always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about."	false	/texas/statements/2013/dec/13/steve-stockman/polls-showed-rick-perry-or-ron-paul-ahead-john-cor/	The congressman challenging two-term U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in the 2014 Republican primary says Cornyn is vulnerable from the right. In a Dec. 10, 2013, blog post on his campaign website, Steve Stockman of Friendswood specified: "In every poll liberal John Cornyn always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about." Calling Cornyn liberal is questionable, though we see that as Stockman’s opinion and not something that we could put to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Suffice to say that Cornyn came out as the Senate’s second-least liberal and second-most conservative member in a February 2013 vote analysis by National Journal magazine. We turned instead to whether every poll shows Cornyn losing re-election to "any conservative the voters have heard about." Voter polls Unfortunately, we failed to hear back from Stockman as we weighed the results of three fall 2013 voter polls testing Cornyn for re-election against particular possible Republican foes. An October 2013 poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune showed Cornyn leading at 39 percent against two little-known opponents, Dwayne Stovall and Erick Wyatt. Forty-eight percent of respondents had no opinion. On Nov. 14, 2013, UT government lecturer Jim Henson, one of the pollsters, wrote for the Tribune that this was "by no means a forceful showing for an incumbent senator in a state as red as Texas, and has further fueled whispers of a primary challenge." Elaborating by email, Henson told us Cornyn saw his voter favorability ratings among Texas conservatives drop through the summer, "which helped fuel further talk of a challenge from the right." Neither Stovall or Wyatt was widely known when the poll was taken, Henson said. Per Stockmn’s focus on Republicans Texans had "heard about," Henson offered: "I think it would roughly be fair to say that anyone who has previously run statewide or nationally, or has in some other way been the subject of media exposure, could be referred to as someone people have ‘heard about.’" Two polls to go. In early November 2013, a survey taken by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling indicated Cornyn was not the favorite of 388 past Republican primary voters, who by 49 percent to 33 percent indicated they would prefer a more conservative nominee. That poll also showed Cornyn ahead in hypothetical one-on-one faceoffs with two party figures and trailing another hypothetical challenger. According to a Nov. 6, 2013, press release on the results, Cornyn ran ahead of Biblical historian David Barton, former vice chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, by 51 percent to 18 percent, and led U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, by 40 percent to 31 percent. The poll also asked about a hypothetical matchup between Cornyn and Gov. Rick Perry. The result: Perry drew 46 percent to Cornyn’s 35 percent. (Perry, of course, is not challenging Cornyn and has, in fact, endorsed him.) By email, PPP spokesman Tom Jensen noted that 38 percent of the polled voters had an opinion of Gohmert. Jensen said the firm did not poll on Barton’s name recognition, "but it doubtless would have been lower." Jensen wrote: "My bar of whether voters have heard about a candidate would be whether they have 50% name recognition," meaning half or more of the voters recognize the candidate’s name. "Perry was the only one we tested who fit that bill. So Stockman’s statement might be true at some level but it’s not particularly compelling since there really just wasn’t much polling out there testing Cornyn against anyone who voters are very familiar with." Next, Jensen pointed us to an Oct. 26, 2013, poll by Human Events and Florida-based Gravis Marketing indicating that a generic "Tea Party" candidate, unnamed, would lead Cornyn among Republicans by 46 percent to 33 percent, according to a Gravis Marketing summary. The poll involved 563 Republicans, the firm said, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. According to the summary, Cornyn led several hypothetical one-on-one races--including versus Stockman. The summary says Cornyn led Gohmert in its polls by 45 percent to 20 percent and ran ahead of Stockman, 41 percent to 15 percent. But Cornyn trailed in a one-on-one matchup with U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, who has run for president several times, 44 percent to 34 percent, the summary states. We wondered about a seeming conflict in the Gravis results: Cornyn outpacing Rafael Cruz, whose son, Ted, is the junior senator from Texas, by 39 percent to 33 percent, in their hypothetical one-on-one matchup yet in a later poll result, the elder Cruz leading Cornyn, Paul and Stockman in a hypothetical four-way primary. The latter question was: "If the Republican primary were held today, would you vote for Cornyn, Cruz, Paul or Stockman?" The results: Cruz, 41 percent, Cornyn at 25 percent, Paul at 18 percent and Stockman at 3 percent. By telephone, the president of Gravis Marketing, Doug Kaplan, told us he suspects some poll respondents answering the four-way question thought they were considering a Ted Cruz candidacy against Cornyn rather than a race involving his father, with the erroneous effect being a boost to the elder Cruz’s poll standing. "I’m not confident with the way we worded that question," Kaplan said. Cornyn’s objection To our inquiry, Cornyn’s Senate campaign disputed Stockman’s website statement. By email, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out that no one leading Cornyn in the three polls was shown as attracting more than half the vote--in other words, winning the nomination outright. On another front, Brandewie maintained that Texas Republicans have "heard about" the two candidates bested by Cornyn in the UT/Tribune poll as well as Barton, Gohmert and the elder Cruz, each of whom did not lead Cornyn in the polled one-on-one matchups. Our ruling Stockman said: "In every poll," John Cornyn "always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about." In Stockman's favor, recent polling suggests Cornyn trailing Perry and Paul, two well-known Republicans, in hypothetical one-on-one matches. But polls also have shown Cornyn running ahead of Barton, Gohmert and Stockman. These Texans are almost certainly less known than Paul and Perry, both of whom ran for president. Yet Gohmert and Stockman are members of Congress and Barton has long been a grass-roots leader.

pomt-14767	Barack Obama’s Columbia University ID says he was a foreign student and went by "Barry Soetoro."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/09/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-still-claim-obama-wasnt-born-us/	President Barack Obama is about to enter his eighth and final year in the Oval Office, but some people are still trying to say he was never eligible for that job in the first place. Other conspiracy theories focus on Obama’s birth certificate (which isn’t a fake). This one uses his, ahem, totally real college ID to make the case that Obama was foreign-born. A reader recently asked us via snail mail to look into a post he saw on Facebook showing the purported Columbia University student ID of Barry Soetoro — aka Barack Obama. The ID lists Soetoro as a foreign student. This image has been around for a few years now. Here’s a 2013 post from "Tea Party United." Other Internet debunkers have looked at this before (Snopes, for one), but we wanted to take our own look. It may not surprise you that it’s a sham. Sorting out Soetoro There was a time when Obama used the last name "Soetoro." Obama used Soetoro, the last name of his stepfather, while he was growing up in Indonesia. At age 10, Obama moved back to Hawaii, his birthplace, and stopped using that last name. After two years at Occidental College in California, 20-year-old Barack Obama transferred to Columbia University in New York in 1981. There are no records that suggest Obama ever went by his childhood alias while attending Columbia. In 1983, the university’s weekly magazine published an essay written by Obama. The byline reads "Barack Obama." ID issues Whoever took the time to make this image apparently didn’t take the extra time to change the number on the card. After the card made the initial rounds, Snopes revealed the card number belonged to another student, who appears to be caught up in this simply because he posted his card to the web in 1998. The picture of Obama on the fake ID is definitely not of the president as a young college student. It looks like the photo was taken in 1999, when Obama was in his late 30s and a state senator in Illinois. What’s more convincing is Columbia University didn’t even start using digital ID cards until 1996 — 13 years after Obama graduated. "This is a fake," said Robert Hornsby, a spokesman for the university, to PolitiFact. "We didn't even have such IDs then." Finally, Obama’s ID would not have said "foreign student," and not just because Obama was born in Hawaii. Hornsby said Columbia doesn’t even label student IDs like that. Our ruling A Facebook post makes ridiculous claims about a Columbia University ID that shows Obama was a foreign student who went by the alias "Barry Soetoro." The post wants you to believe Obama isn’t really an American citizen. But the ID, and the birther narrative behind it, is not valid. Obama stopped using his stepfather’s last name when he was 10. Columbia University didn’t even start using these types of IDs until the mid 1990s, long after Obama graduated. The ID is a pretty bad Photoshop job. We rate the claim Pants on Fire! Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the name of Columbia University spokesman Robert Hornsby.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2015-12-09T15:46:04	2013-11-13	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-01833	David Perdue "has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot."	false	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/18/jack-kingston/record-doesnt-support-kingston-claim-against-perdu/	In a new campaign flier, U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue is shown holding up a sign that says: "I don’t vote but I want yours." "Perdue has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot," the flier states. "It’s clear he only votes for one thing: himself." Perdue, a wealthy businessman from Sea Island, and Jack Kingston, a veteran U.S. House member from Savannah, are battling to be the Republican nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Turnout is expected to be light for their runoff Tuesday. And Kingston and Perdue know the outcome could hinge on their ability to persuade their supporters and the party faithful to return to the polls. Kingston’s campaign is suggesting Perdue’s not a true Republican, a charge Perdue’s campaign vehemently denies. The flier is eye-catching. But is this statement accurate? "Perdue has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot." PolitiFact is on the case. We began by asking Chris Crawford, Kingston’s campaign spokesman, for proof. Crawford sent us Perdue’s voting records from Massachusetts, Texas, Tennessee and Georgia, places the former CEO of Dollar General has lived since 1994. The records, which we independently verified, show Perdue voted at least nine times in 20 years, including in the Republican presidential preference primaries of 2008 (in Tennessee) and 2012 (in Georgia). He voted by absentee ballot in this year’s May 20 general election primary, when he, Kingston and five others were on the GOP ballot for the U.S. Senate. Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s campaign spokesman, said "it’s a ridiculous assertion" to suggest Perdue isn’t "really a Republican." "Not only has David voted in Republican primaries for president, but David has also given over $65,000 to Republican candidates and causes in the past decade and raised thousands more to help elect fellow Republicans," Dickey said in an email. The Kingston campaign flier shows Perdue in a party hat and says: "David Perdue celebrating a lifetime of doing nothing for Republicans." It states that while the GOP was "busy fighting against the Democrats, Perdue was funding them." It also calls Perdue out for making a "big campaign contribution to an extreme Liberal Democrat from Massachusetts" who is not identified in the flier. Kingston isn’t the first Georgia candidate to use an opponent’s personal voting record to suggest that he or she is a party Johnny-come-lately. In 2010, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp accused GOP rival Doug MacGinnitie of failing to vote in Republican primaries for two decades. MacGinnitie countered with a commercial saying Kemp’s record showed he voted for Democrats. Kemp won the election, and Republican Gov. Nathan Deal went on to appoint MacGinnitie as state revenue commissioner. The argument can be made that, in some areas, where one party dominates, the primary can effectively decide an election. Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said polls show Kingston and Perdue in a relatively close runoff. "So potentially anything that can move even a few thousand votes could be decisive," Sabato said. "To most people, the topics of these Kingston ads might seem to be small potatoes, and in some sense, they are," he said. "But you have to look at the specialized, concentrated electorate for a runoff." Voters who go to the polls for party primaries and runoffs are generally "the most loyal, active party members," Sabato said. "They are precisely the ones who might be most concerned about the candidates’ past party loyalty, nonvoting record and political contributions." Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said he doesn’t believe any direct-mail piece or online ad would be a game-changer at this point in the race, "unless it was something new and jaw-dropping, and coordinated with TV and radio spots." "The charge that Perdue has not voted in GOP primaries is not new. Voters have heard it before," Swint said. "It's also not terribly surprising for business people who are relatively new to politics to have a thin voting record." He said voters might be more concerned about the donation to the "liberal Democrat" who the Kingston camp told PolitiFact was the late U.S. Rep. Joe Moakley. Kingston’s camp furnished records showing that Perdue, while vice president of Reebok, donated $500 to Moakley’s re-election campaign in 2000. Other records show that Perdue also donated to some well-known Republicans, including Lamar Alexander and Mitt Romney. To sum up, the Kingston camp, trying to convince voters that Perdue isn’t a real Republican, has sent out a flier that states: David Perdue "has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot." Public records show Perdue didn’t vote in a general election primary until this year, when he’s a candidate for U.S. Senate. But those same records show Perdue voted Republican in the presidential primaries in 2008 and 2012. That makes the "never voted in a Republican primary" claim flat out wrong. We rate the Kingston statement as False.	None	Jack Kingston	None	None	None	2014-07-18T00:00:00	2014-07-08	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-01852	Says 70 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid cost is for seniors in nursing homes.	false	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/14/mark-sickles/sickles-says-70-percent-virginias-medicaid-cost-se/	Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, says increased demand for nursing home care is a major reason why the Virginia’s Medicaid costs have soared. "We’re living longer than ever and you have to spend down until you get to $2,000 of assets before you qualify for (Medicaid funded) nursing home care in our state," Sickles said in a recent floor speech. "$2,000. That’s where the money goes. That’s where 70 percent of the money goes in our Medicaid program – to help our seniors live with skilled nursing who need it." Let’s start by noting that Sickles is correct is saying that Virginia’s Medicaid will only pay for nursing home care to elderly and disabled people whose total financial resources don’t exceed $2,000. What we want to explore in this Truth-O-Meter is Sickle’s claim that 70 percent of the state’s Medicaid money goes to provide elderly care in nursing homes. The statement comes amid a partisan battle over whether expand Medicaid to up to 400,000 additional low-income Virginians. Under Obamacare, the federal government would always pay at least 90 percent of the tab. The GOP-led General Assembly blocked the expansion last month, saying Washington can’t be trusted to pay its promised shares. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, is exploring whether he can broaden the program without legislators’ consent. Sickles told us he can’t recall the exact source of his nursing home claim but, as a long time member of the Health, Welfare and Institutions Committee, he’s often heard that 70 percent of the Medicaid money goes to 30 percent of the recipients. He said he understood that trend was "largely caused" by seniors in nursing homes. But Craig Markva, a spokesman for the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs the state’s Medicaid program, gave us a different explanation. He said 70 percent of the money is spent on the medical expenses of all elderly and disabled patients, who comprise 32 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid recipients. Markva sent us Medicaid statistics for the budget year that ended June 30, 2013 -- the latest numbers available. They show that of the slightly more than 1 million Medicaid enrollees in Virginia, only 22,513 -- or 2.2 percent -- were seniors in nursing facilities. Out of a $6.7 billion Medicaid budget that fiscal year, the state spent $648 million to care for seniors in nursing homes. That boils down to 9.7 percent of the money. All told, seniors accounted for about 7 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid recipients during the 2012-13 budget year and received about 17 percent of the funds, or slightly more than $1.1 billion. Our ruling Sickles said that 70 percent of the state’s Medicaid spending goes to seniors in nursing homes. He’s way off; only 9.7 percent of the money goes to that cause. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13274	"Cancer and matters to do with kidney failure kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined."	false	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/13/william-ruto/lack-basic-death-data-leads-false-claims-kenya/	At the launch of a new political party at a sports stadium in Nairobi, Kenya, the country’s deputy president William Ruto talked about a disease that Vice President Joe Biden has made his life’s mission. At the start of the year, following the death of Biden’s son to brain cancer, the vice president took the lead in the administration’s Cancer Moonshot project, an effort to rapidly accelerate cancer research. Ruto cast cancer as a top public health priority for his country. "Cancer and matters to do with kidney failure kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined," Ruto said Sept. 9, 2016. Given that AIDS is the No. 1 killer in sub-Saharan Africa, and malaria ranks fourth, our Africa Check partners decided to check Ruto’s numbers. He is wrong. For the record, Ruto’s office did not provide any supporting data. A dearth of numbers Solid data is sorely lacking in Kenya as it is in most sub-Saharan African nations. But the numbers that are available disprove Ruto’s claim. Kenya just launched a national cancer registry, but it won’t be fully in place until 2019. For the time being, the highest estimate puts the number of cancer deaths at 28,000 in 2015. On kidney disease, Kenya has no national data at all. The World Health Organization estimates 3,100 deaths for 2014. Combined that’s a rough count of 31,100 deaths. WHO is the most reliable source for tuberculosis death estimates in Kenya as well, with about 9,400 deaths in 2014. The United Nations AIDS program relies on statistical models to derive the number of AIDS deaths in Kenya. UNAIDS says it is "logistically impossible and ethically problematic" to investigate all deaths. According to its statistical model, there were between 28,000 and 50,000 deaths due to AIDS in Kenya in 2014, with 38,000 being the most likely figure. For malaria, the WHO said in its World Malaria Report for 2015 that it was unable to collect data for six East African countries, including Kenya, between 2000 and 2014 because of "inconsistent reporting, or changes in health service accessibility or diagnostic testing". The best we could find for malaria deaths was Kenya’s civil registration data, which provisionally shows 23,789 deaths in 2013 and 20,691in 2015. As you can see, while the numbers are far from perfect, they do not support Ruto’s point. This table pulls the numbers together. Even using the lowest estimates for AIDS and malaria deaths, the combined toll is greater than for cancer and kidney disease. Cancer/Kidney deaths AIDS/Malaria/TB deaths Cancer 28,000 Kidney disease 3,100 AIDS 28,000 Malaria 20,691 TB 9,400 Totals 31,100 58,091 There are efforts such as the Health Data Collaborative and the African Health Initiative that aim to beef up the health data collected in sub-Saharan Africa. But it will be a tough slog. Robert Black at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health helps oversee the data coordination program at the African Health Initiative and he told us it will take many years before these countries have robust systems. "The funding that is available for this from both national and donor funds is grossly inadequate to reach that objective in the near term," Black said. In May 2016, Kenya became the first African country to launch a national effort to ramp up its systems for collecting health data. One of the top priorities? Making sure that every death and cause of death is recorded. Our ruling Ruto said that cancer and kidney disease "kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined." The precision of the numbers leaves a lot to be desired, but based on the best estimates, Ruto isn’t even close. Using conservative estimates, deaths from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are double those from cancer and kidney disease.

pomt-09625	Says he "brought 1,200 jobs to Texas by moving his factories here from China."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/farouk-shami/shami-claims-hes-created-1200-jobs-texas-moving-hi/	Hair-care mogul Farouk Shami of Houston thinks "Made in the U.S.A. is the strongest brand in the world," and by promising to create new jobs, he's hoping to win the governorship. As a head-start, "he just brought 1,200 jobs to Texas by moving his factories here from China," according to his Nov. 23 TV ad. We decided to follow-up on one of his biggest talking points. The Palestinian-born businessman, seeking the Democratic nomination in the March 2 primary, has created a $1 billion manufacturing company that makes CHI hair irons and BioSilk shampoo, among hair products. Shami cut the ribbon on his new Houston facility CHI USA in late July 2009. Earlier that month, he announced he was moving to Houston overseas production of his hand-held products, like hair irons, and in the process bringing more than 1,000 jobs to that city. But contrary to his ad, those jobs were created as a result of moving production from South Korea, not China, campaign director and senior strategist Vince Leibowitz said. "That was a miscommunication within our campaign over where those jobs were cut, and unfortunately we got the incorrect information to the talented people who put together our television ad," Leibowitz said. Democratic media firm Devine Mulvey produced the spot. As of Jan. 11, the campaign had changed its commercial to mention only the shift of jobs from Korea. The change happened after our inquiry. Still, on the same day we found the incorrect China reference in a video of the ad (shown to the right) on Shami's Web site, and on the site's homepage. Elizabeth Yong, public relations manager for Houston-based Farouk Systems Group, said CHI USA produces "five to 10" of a total 61 hair care tools, including the original flat iron.Yong said bringing all production stateside will take two years, though "more than 1,000" jobs have already been shifted. Last July, the company said it hopes to shift 4,000 jobs to Texas by 2012, starting with the move of 1,000 jobs from South Korea and China. Leibowitz said that some jobs have been created as a result of relocating production from China, but not the ones advertised as part of Shami's campaign. Perhaps Shami deserves a back slap for admitting his mistake and reworking his ad. Still, incorrect information was left online. We rule his claim Half True.

pomt-13545	"Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘Trump Effect.’ They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims and immigrants."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-citing-trump-effect-says-teachers-/	Americans should be concerned about the effect of Donald Trump’s campaign on kids, said Hillary Clinton in an Aug. 25 speech decrying what she sees as her opponent’s campaign of "prejudice and paranoia." She told the story about a high school basketball game in Indiana, where home team fans taunted players from their heavily Hispanic rival school by holding up a large cutout of Trump’s head and chanting "build a wall." "Next time you see Trump rant on television, think about all the children listening across America," Clinton said. "Kids hear a lot more than we think. Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘Trump Effect.’ They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants." We wondered if Clinton is right teachers are reporting an increase in bullying and harassment and if so, what does it have to do with Trump? Clinton’s source is an April report out of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights and antidiscrimination advocacy group. The report is titled "The Trump Effect: The impact of the presidential campaign on our nation’s schools." The center conducted an online survey of approximately 2,000 K-12 teachers and found: "Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail." While their findings correspond directly with Clinton’s claim, it’s important to note that this was not a scientific survey, as the report notes. The respondents don’t represent a random sample of teachers, and it’s likely that those who chose to respond to the survey are those who are most concerned about the campaign’s impact on students. This means it would be inaccurate to extrapolate from the survey that bullying and harassment are generally on the rise across the country. Rather, it is more a collection of teachers’ anecdotal experiences. We looked for a scientific study that speaks to this same question but couldn’t find one, mostly because there tends to be a lag in this kind of data, meaning data on bullying trends in 2016 won’t get published until 2017 or later. The process of setting up and getting approval to conduct a scientific study is lengthy and cumbersome, and would not be approved before the election, said Sheri Bauman, a professor at the University of Arizona who researches bullying. Even so, Bauman said the Southern Poverty Law Center’s report should not be dismissed, as its data show important recurring themes. Here are some interesting details from the survey. Keep in mind that the survey did not mention any candidate names whatsoever: Respondents gave a total of 5,000 comments. Of those, one in five mentioned Trump. All other candidates were mentioned fewer than 200 times combined. "More than one-third have observed an increase in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment." "Teachers report that students have been ‘emboldened’ to use slurs, engage in name-calling and make inflammatory statements toward each other," and "Kids use the names of candidates as pejoratives to taunt each other." "More than two-thirds of the teachers reported that students — mainly immigrants, children of immigrants and Muslims — have expressed concerns or fears about what might happen to them or their families after the election." On the otherhand, the bullying can be contrary to the depiction that Clinton offered. The survey also noted examples of students getting bullied by others because they or their parents support Trump. The findings support Clinton’s claim, said Maureen Costello, the report’s author and director of the center’s Teaching Tolerance project. "It’s fair to say the reports say teachers who respond to us are in fact seeing an increase in the quantity of harassment and change in quality of bullying," Costello said, adding that she has received upwards of 300 unsolicited additional comments from educators since the report came out, all expressing similar sentiments. "I suspect (Clinton) might be right, but the data are not there to support the statement from a scientific-evidence-based perspective," said Dorothy Espelage, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and a leading expert in bullying. A Trump spokesman dismissed the survey, noting that it was unscientific. Our ruling Clinton said, "Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘Trump Effect.’ They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants." Teachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center study reported an increase in bullying and harassment, particularly involving anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments. Many of these teachers, unsolicited, cited Trump’s campaign rhetoric and the accompanying discourse as the likely reason for this behavior. The term Trump Effect is a product of the survey’s authors. And the survey is unscientific because it's based on anecdotal reports. But experts in bullying told us the Southern Poverty Law Center’s survey and their sense of current trends in schools supports Clinton’s point.

pomt-10018	In Japan, executives of failing companies "say 'I'm sorry' and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/17/chuck-grassley/executives-japan-do-not-regularly-commit-suicide/	Lots of elected officials expressed outrage at the news that failing insurance company AIG was giving large bonuses to employees while accepting taxpayer money to stay afloat. But few expressed their outrage with AIG officials as starkly as Sen. Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa. "I suggest, you know, obviously, maybe they ought to be removed," Grassley said. "But I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they'd follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, I'm sorry, and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide." "And in the case of the Japanese, they usually commit suicide before they make any apology." The next day, Grassley specified that he was not suggesting AIG executives should kill themselves, though he did say he wanted an apology. We wondered if Grassley was right that Japanese executives who make significant mistakes often apologize and then resign or commit suicide. We found many news stories of Japanese executives apologizing, a process in which the person stands and bows deeply. One story we found about a Sony battery problem detailed the exact posture of the executives. It noted they were seated while they bowed "and did not bow deeply," which signaled how Sony had been reluctant to admit fault. The story noted that none of the Sony executives resigned. We also spoke with Gary Knight, a professor of international business at Florida State University who teaches annual business courses in Japan. Knight confirmed that apologies and resignations are more common among Japanese executives than their U.S. counterparts. "Culturally, it's pretty different than the U.S.," Knight said. "It's certainly the norm that if a top executive commits a blunder that affects employees or customers, they would apologize for it." Resignations are common, too, though that doesn't always solve problems, Knight said. "The person resigning may be the most knowledgeable person at the firm. Meanwhile, you're faced with finding a manager who can solve the problem," he said. But executive suicides — not so common. Knight said they happen occasionally, but overall they are "pretty rare." Suicide in Japan is actually a serious social problem, according to several news reports. More than 30,000 people a year commit suicide in Japan, giving it one of the highest suicide rates among industrialized countries. None of the reports we reviewed singled out shamed executives, however. In fact, the most commonly cited groups of special concern were laid-off workers, the elderly and the young. In conclusion, we find that Grassley gets the apologies and resignations right, but overstates the regularity of suicides. Apologies appear to be much more common than suicides. So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Chuck Grassley	None	None	None	2009-03-17T18:48:00	2009-03-16	['Japan']
pomt-00370	"Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS – which was the firm hired by the Clinton campaign to write the dossier. Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI. The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/11/mark-meadows/meadows-says-ohr-got-dossier-through-his-wife/	The special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has brought a lot of names to the center of attention. The most recent is Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official whose relationship with former British spy Christopher Steele has sounded alarms among congressional Republicans. In a matter of weeks, Ohr has transformed from a virtual unknown in politics to a favorite target of President Donald Trump and his allies. Rep. Mark Meadows, a western North Carolina Republican who is one of the president’s staunchest defenders and a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, has criticized Ohr for his connection to Steele, the author of the dossier that made claims about the president’s financial and personal ties to Russia. On Sept. 5, a week after a closed-door interview between Ohr and the House Oversight Committee, Meadows sent a letter asking the Justice Department to review Ohr’s contacts with Steele. But even before that request, Meadows was floating a theory for his supporters to consider. "Here are some key facts you need to know about Bruce Ohr to understand why he is important to our investigation," Meadows wrote in an email newsletter. "Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS — which was the firm hired by the Clinton campaign to write the dossier. Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI. The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign." Other Trump allies have also sought to link Ohr, his wife and the dossier to the FBI’s wiretapping of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. During a July 12 congressional hearing with FBI agent Peter Strzok, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, leveled the same charge. "So Nellie Ohr works for Fusion, works for (Fusion GPS founder and former journalist) Glenn Simpson, and she's giving documents to Bruce Ohr, who’s giving them to the FBI," Jordan said. Details surrounding the dossier, the Page wiretap and the Russia investigation are still emerging. But much has been reported already, and we wondered how Meadows’ statement would stack up against publicly available information. The FBI’s National Press Office declined to comment. Ben Williamson, Meadows’ communications director, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Nellie Ohr "worked for Fusion GPS ... the firm hired by the Clinton campaign" Bruce Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, is a 55-year-old former government official and Russia expert. Meadows is correct that during the 2016 election, Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was hired to work for then-candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign, according to Fox News. But the firm’s research into Trump was already underway when the Clinton campaign got involved — a fact Meadows omitted in his email. Fusion GPS was originally hired by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. It was only after Trump secured the Republican nomination that Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to continue compiling research about Trump, according to the New York Times. At that point, the firm hired Steele, who had sources in Russia. Steele produced 35 pages of research memos, which became collectively known as the Steele dossier and detailed some salacious — but not fully verified — claims about Trump. "Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI." While Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS, Bruce Ohr worked in the Justice Department. Although Meadows’ statement does not specifically allege that Bruce Ohr received the dossier from his wife, other Republicans have insisted that she acted as a go-between for Fusion GPS and law enforcement agencies. But as we noted in a fact-check of conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt about Jordan’s theory, there is no evidence that Nellie Ohr personally routed the dossier to the Justice Department. It is true, however, that Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI, according to former FBI agent Peter Strzok’s testimony. "Mr. Ohr provided information to the FBI that included material that is what everybody is calling the dossier, reporting from Mr. Steele," Strzok told lawmakers during a congressional hearing. But Bruce Ohr was not the FBI’s only source for the dossier. The FBI received multiple versions of the Steele dossier from several different people, according to an email Strzok sent colleagues in January 2017, which was obtained by The Hill. The late Sen. John McCain said he delivered a version of the dossier to then-FBI director James Comey in late 2016. David Corn, a reporter at Mother Jones, also admitted on Twitter that he provided the Steele memos to the FBI shortly after the election. Even Steele himself met with FBI officials on July 5, 2016, according to the New Yorker. Meadows’ omission of these details could be misleading for readers of his email. "The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign." In October 2016, the FBI applied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant to wiretap Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. The agency believed Page was "collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government" after being "the subject of targeted recruitment." In February 2018, Republicans and Democrats released competing memos about the application for surveillance, with Democrats pushing back on Republicans’ claims that the FBI did not properly secure a warrant and misused its surveillance capabilities, according to the New York Times. But on July 21, 2018, the Trump administration released a heavily redacted version of the documents related to the wiretapping. The documents revealed that the FBI did partly rely on claims first reported in the dossier. For example, the application cited claims from the dossier that Page, while visiting Moscow in the summer of 2016, met with two senior Russian representatives to talk about removing Ukraine-related sanctions the U.S. had imposed on Russia and other matters. The FBI said in the application that it suspected the person who hired Steele was looking to discredit the Trump campaign, but clarified that Steele’s previous reporting of "reliable information" as a British intelligence officer made the agency believe segments from the dossier were "credible." (The FBI eventually terminated its partnership with Steele in October 2016 after he made what the agency considered to be improper disclosures to the news media.) But the redacted documents also contained evidence against Page that did not come from the dossier. In fact, Page was on the FBI’s radar as early as 2013 for contacts with Russian intelligence, according to the New York Times. Meadows’ suggestion that the FBI’s wiretapping amounted to "spy(ing) on the Trump campaign" is also misleading, since the FBI secured a warrant from the FISA court to do so. Page also left the Trump campaign in September 2016, before the FBI applied for its warrant. Even some Republicans have objected to claims suggesting the wiretap could be considered spying. "I don't believe that them looking into Carter Page means they were spying on the campaign," said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during an interview on CNN. It is worth noting that the Steele dossier did not trigger the special counsel’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russian connections. That probe began in July 2016 due to information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, as PolitiFact has shown before. Our ruling In an email newsletter, Meadows said Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign funded the Steele dossier, Bruce Ohr handed the dossier to the FBI, and the FBI used the dossier to spy on the Trump campaign. Meadows is correct that Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS and that the Clinton campaign hired the firm to continue researching Trump. He is also right that Bruce Ohr provided the FBI a copy of the dossier. But the FBI received the dossier from multiple sources. And it is not entirely accurate to say the FBI used the dossier to spy on the Trump campaign since Page left the campaign in September 2016. The FBI relied in part on the dossier to secure a warrant to monitor Page, but the dossier was not the sole basis for the wiretap — and the wiretap was authorized in court. New details could emerge if further documents related to the wiretap are disclosed. But based on what we know now, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-11844	"Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/07/markwayne-mullin/oklahoma-rep-mullin-says-average-family-would-save/	Republicans promised that their tax overhaul would save money for the middle class, and Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., was quick to make the case that it did. "I’m working alongside the White House and other members in the House to lessen the tax burden that currently weighs on so many Oklahomans," Mullin posted on his congressional blog. "Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut. Imagine what you could do with $1,182 more in your pocket!" Mullin's talking point has been popular among House Republicans trying to sell the tax plan. In the past week, we've heard House Speaker Paul Ryan and a Georgia congressman tout the same figure. In each case, they overstated the impact of the tax cut. Mullin did, too, but less so. Here's what you need to know. The figure comes from the House Ways and Means Committee, which wrote the tax bill. That committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements in the committee's calculation involve tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction would be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit will be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example Mullin highlighted refers to a "family of four making $59,000 per year." Here’s the scenario outlined in the House’s fact sheet, using the fictional example of "Steve and Melinda" with two middle school-aged children: "As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. "That’s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it’s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future." The Ways and Means Committee said they chose a household income of $59,000 because it’s the median household income nationally. (Mullin talked about families and families are not identical to households, but in Oklahoma, the median family income is about $58,000, so the distinction makes little difference in his state.) For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So the number adds up, but there are some caveats that show it might not work out this way for all families like Steve and Melinda’s. Watch out for deductions The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure House estimate. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. For example, nearly 9 million people with high medical bills deduct them on the taxes. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. But some taxpayers who depend on these itemized deductions today may end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. The tax cut would fade over time David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told us that the bill has some wrinkles that can turn a tax cut into a tax hike. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes about a $450 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together: Mullin didn’t promise that the initial tax cut would last, as other Republicans have. After Mullin made his statement, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed the tax plan using a different approach. The committee found that while tax collections from people making under $40,000 would fall at first, they would go up in 2023. The groups that would do the best under the plan would be people making between $100,000 and $200,000, and those making over $1 million a year. Our ruling Mullin said that the average American family of four would get a tax cut of $1,182. The number is a reasonable estimate, based on certain assumptions. What might not be obvious is that families who take advantage of deductions today might see their taxes rise. And even those who benefit immediately might see those gains turn into losses after 2023. So if you think this tax cut would be ongoing, or every year, you'd be wrong. Unlike his colleagues, however, Mullin didn’t outright promise that the initial tax cut would last for more than one year. Mullin's statement therefore is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-01542	Greg Abbott did "nothing" to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a West Texas state-run school.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/sep/16/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-claims-greg-abbott-didnt-act-allegatio/	In a TV ad suggesting Greg Abbott failed to act when allegations of misconduct came to his office, Wendy Davis reminds Texans of the sexual abuse scandal that touched off a 2007 legislative overhaul of the Texas Youth Commission. In the ad, a narrator says in a dark tone: "Young boys at a state-run school are sexually abused. When a local investigation lags, a Texas Ranger notifies Attorney General Greg Abbott, asking him to investigate. Abbott does nothing," the narrator says, adding that 11 months then went by with more incidents of abuse and neglect. "But Abbott didn’t pursue the case," the narrator says. By way of backup, the Davis campaign offered news stories describing attempts by a Texas Ranger to get authorities outside of West Texas, including the attorney general, to look into the alleged incidents at the West Texas State School in Pyote. We reviewed those news reports and others, which together chronicled initial inaction by a state lawyer before Abbott’s office presented the related allegations to a grand jury. Abbott does nothing? Public knowledge of alleged sexual wrongdoing by officials at the remote school traces to February 2007 news reports by the Texas Observer and Dallas Morning News. But a Texas Ranger, Brian Burzynski, had been on the case for years and had already reached out to the state for help. Burzynski emailed an assistant state attorney general, Will Tatum, on Feb. 21, 2006, graphically detailing sexual abuse of male youths at the school, according to information released by Abbott’s office in March 2007. The Ranger’s email said the local prosecutor had the case but "hasn't done anything with it and I am losing hope that he will. ... I would like you to view this report and tell me what you think." Burzynski had begun his investigation in February 2005. According to Abbott’s office, Tatum declined to pursue the case because of jurisdictional concerns; under state law, the attorney general’s office needed a local prosecutor to ask for assistance before it could get involved. As Burzynski’s emailed request became public, Abbott’s state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said Tatum still should have forwarded the report to his supervisors before responding to the email, but he didn't follow agency procedures, according to news reports at the time. Knowing "the seriousness of the allegations contained in that email, action would have been taken by the attorney general's office, and this agency would have actively engaged in the matter in any way possible," Strickland said. But Strickland also said that two days after Burzynski sent the email, Tatum correctly told the Ranger that the Ward County district attorney, Randall Reynolds, would have to ask Abbott's office for help on the case. An April 2007 Austin American-Statesman news story said Tatum sent Burzynski the name and address of his supervisor, Adrien McFarland, for the Ranger to give to Reynolds. Abbott acted in 2007 Strickland said the attorney general's office began an aggressive investigation after Reynolds asked for help; that request came in Jan. 17, 2007. In April 2007, a Ward County grand jury returned 13 indictments against two former school administrators for improper sexual conduct with six students, ages 16-19, the attorney general’s office announced at the time. Abbott and other state prosecutors appeared before the grand jury to present the charges against former Texas Youth Commission officials Ray Edward Brookins and John Paul Hernandez, Abbott’s office said. Abbott said at the time: "With today's indictments, the victims of sexual abuse at West Texas State School are a step closer to the justice they deserve." According to the state announcement, on April 4, 2007, District Judge Bob Parks had granted the attorney general’s office sole authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse at the Ward County facility. Parks appointed the attorney general as "District Attorney Pro Tem" after the local district attorney recused himself from the case, the announcement said. Footnote: In April 2010, a jury sentenced Brookins to 10 years in prison on his conviction for sexual relations with a teenage inmate. In 2011, a jury acquitted Hernandez on 14 counts of molesting boys in 2004 and 2005. Texas law on the attorney general and criminal prosecutions Generally, the April 2007 Statesman news story pointed out, the Texas attorney general is an executive who primarily defends the state in civil disputes, "though in local criminal cases involving fraud in insurance, Medicaid or elections, the attorney general can usually find a way to involve himself, one way or another. His staff, using a provision in the penal code dealing with computer crimes, can even initiate investigations into the solicitation of sex from minors on the Internet." Charges like the ones from West Texas, the story said, "are off-limits until a local prosecutor requests assistance in writing." Eric Nichols, deputy attorney general for criminal justice, told the newspaper the state agency followed the letter of the law. At the time, the Texas Government Code said: "A prosecuting attorney may request the assistance of the attorney general in the prosecution of all manner of criminal cases or in performing any duty imposed by law on the prosecuting attorney. In requesting such assistance, a prosecuting attorney may appoint any assistant attorney general as an assistant prosecuting attorney." The 2007 Legislature amended the law to say the attorney general may offer assistance in any criminal prosecution. Another adopted revision: The attorney general may offer assistance "in the prosecution of criminal offenses concerning the Texas Youth Commission." The Statesman story said two lawmakers, Democratic Reps. Jim McReynolds of Lufkin and Jim Dunnam of Waco, questioned Nichols about whether Abbott’s office should initially have done more: Even if he couldn't initiate prosecution, couldn't he have picked up the phone and called Reynolds, or even the governor, the state's chief executive officer? Nichols said in an interview at the time that Abbott’s aides assumed the local prosecutor was doing his job. "Do you automatically draw the conclusion that nothing is going to happen?" Nichols asked. On the other hand, the Statesman story said, it might not have mattered whether someone in the attorney general's office called Reynolds to offer help. Burzynski told lawmakers in 2007 that Reynolds continually assured him he would prosecute the case. The story said Reynolds had said little in his defense except to blame politics or a "breakdown in communications." A timeline accompanying the story said Abbott learned of the West Texas investigation at a meeting of senior agency staff Jan. 22, 2007. On March 9, 2007, Abbott announced the grand jury would soon begin hearing the case. Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a state-run school. In 2006, Abbott’s office reacted to a Ranger’s report detailing such allegations by saying a local prosecutor needed to seek state assistance--and a state lawyer reportedly did nothing more. But this charge ignores a pivotal development. In 2007, after the local prosecutor requested help, state attorneys overseen by Abbott steered a grand-jury presentation leading to indictments.

pomt-10188	John McCain would "reduce oversight of health insurance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/22/barack-obama/forecasting-another-market-collapse/	The recent meltdown in the financial markets, and the massive government-led bailout it inspired, has made deregulation almost a dirty word. Seizing on the spirit of the times, Barack Obama is accusing John McCain of preparing to eliminate regulations governing the sale of health insurance, in a continuation of what Obama contends are the too-hands-off regulatory policies of the Bush administration. "We’ve seen what Bush/McCain policies have done to our economy. Now, John McCain wants to do the same to our health care," an announcer intones in a new Obama campaign ad, called "Article," that was unveiled Sept. 22, 2008. "McCain just published an article praising Wall Street deregulation, said he’d reduce oversight of the health insurance industry, too. Just as we have done over the last decade in banking. Increasing costs and threatening coverage." The magazine article mentioned in the ad is an opinion piece McCain wrote in the September/October edition of Contingencies , a magazine published by the American Academy of Actuaries devoted to insurance and financial service issues. Obama wrote an accompanying piece in the same issue. We’ve already dealt with the McCain camp’s views on financial regulation in this item about former McCain adviser Phil Gramm , and this story that examined McCain's position on the bailout of insurance giant AIG. On the issue of health insurance, the Obama ad focuses on a section of the McCain article dealing with expanding consumer choice in health care. McCain advocates allowing individuals to purchase health insurance from companies across state lines. Currently, states oversee the health care insurance market within their borders, a system of regulation that McCain and others say limits consumer choices and inflates prices. "Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation," McCain wrote. "You should be able to buy your insurance from any willing provider – the state bureaucracies are no better than national ones." McCain is adapting a health care proposal long championed by conservatives in Congress and by the Bush administration that would allow insurers to bypass state-imposed coverage mandates for certain types of treatments and procedures, such as diabetes care and cancer screenings. The theory behind these proposals is that by eliminating the need to comply with a tangle of state regulations, small businesses and consumers would be more likely to band together and better able to negotiate lower prices, and thus reduce the number of uninsured Americans. Several bills that would have permitted this passed the U.S. House when the GOP controlled the chamber, but they died in the more closely divided Senate. Critics of such regulatory streamlining worry that it would destroy state-mandated consumer protections that include limiting how much and how often an employer can raise premiums when an employee gets sick, and eliminate state requirements on mental health and screenings such as those for cervical and breast cancers, leaving consumers at the mercy of insurers. (Health insurance generally is regulated by states, not the federal government, but the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, does outline some requirements for employee benefit plans.) So, there are two elements here. First is the question of whether or not McCain wants to "reduce oversight of the health care industry." The answer largely hinges on how McCain would license insurance carriers to operate across state lines, and whether he would retain some of the existing rules while streamlining state regulations – complex but important details his campaign hasn’t provided. One scenario that Republicans considered in the Senate in 2006 would have allowed insurers to bypass state coverage mandates if they met certain minimum standards. Insurers who chose to offer such plans would have been required to offer at least one plan that matches the benefits offered to state employees of one of the five most populous states — California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. Democrats blocked the proposal from being considered, so it’s unclear how McCain would have voted. Experts say without more details, it’s difficult to predict an answer to the second element, which is whether or not such changes would "increase costs and threaten coverage." Cori Uccello, the American Academy of Actuaries’ senior health fellow, says if new cross-country insurance rules were made more favorable to people in poor health, for example, sicker individuals would migrate to those interstate plans and gradually force premiums to rise. The opposite could occur if the new market’s rules had less generous coverage requirements and primarily attracted healthier individuals. Uccello says applying the same rules to all interstate plans could avoid such disparities. So it’s impossible to tell whether McCain’s plan would really drive up costs and threaten coverage, never mind unleash a calamity on the scale of what is currently sweeping through the financial sector. McCain certainly is on record supporting less state regulation of health insurance, which would reduce coverage mandates and put more of an onus on consumers to shop for the best deals. Whether this would result in more choice and lower prices, as McCain contends, depends on what kind of rules his administration would draft, and how insurers would respond. But lacking such details and the knowledge of how the market would react, it’s a stretch for Obama to suggest McCain is intent on taking a hands-off approach to health insurance. We rule his claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-09-22T00:00:00	2008-09-22	['None']

pomt-13210	Says Rob Portman "said the auto rescue was a lousy deal for Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/20/ted-strickland/did-rob-portman-call-auto-bailout-lousy-deal/	Former Democratic Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland didn’t waste any time attacking Republican Sen. Rob Portman for opposing the 2009 automotive bailout and calling it a "lousy deal." "He said the auto rescue was a lousy deal for Ohio," Strickland told an audience during his opening statement at the third Senate debate in Cleveland. This isn’t the first time Strickland made this claim. Strickland made the charge in front of some Ohio delegates during a meeting held the week of the Democratic National Convention, according to the Columbus Dispatch. We wondered if Strickland was right. Did Portman call the automotive bailout a "lousy deal?" Strickland’s campaign said the remark in question comes from a 2009 statement from Portman, who was a candidate for Senate that year but was not yet in office. The campaign accessed the news release using the Wayback Machine, an Internet Archive website. "The General Motors bankruptcy plan Washington announced today is a lousy deal for Ohio," reads the statement. "Taxpayers, including hard working Ohioans, are investing $50 billion in a GM plan that we now find includes shutting down plants in Mansfield, Parma, and Columbus, Ohio. The reason for this unprecedented taxpayer bailout and government intervention was to preserve jobs. Instead, for our $50 Billion taxpayer investment, thousands more workers will see their jobs disappear. Ohio deserves better than this." That’s the only direct reference to "lousy" Strickland’s campaign sent PolitiFact Ohio, but they also sent an article from the Columbus Dispatch that quotes Portman’s former spokesperson in 2011 saying Portman still thinks "the auto bailout was not a good deal for Ohio." Portman’s campaign told PolitiFact Ohio that although Portman was not in office when the bailout launched, he would have supported the auto rescue. As evidence of this, Portman’s campaign pointed to a 2010 U.S. Senate debate against Democrat Lee Fisher. Portman was asked if he would have supported the 2009 bailout, which Portman responded to with a "yes," while also mentioning he would have liked to see "more conditions" in the bailout. "$50 billion of our taxpayer money went to a private entity that the government essentially took over, and then they closed four plants here in Ohio." Portman said at the debate. "So, if I had been in office at the time I would have supported it, but I would have been sure that Ohio didn’t fall behind." Our ruling Strickland said Portman "said the auto rescue was a lousy deal for Ohio." As a candidate for Senate, Portman did call the 2009 automotive bailouts of GM and Chrysler a "lousy deal" in a press release from 2009. Strickland cited this remark without including the fact Portman said he still would have supported the bailout. Strickland’s claim is accurate, but needs a slight clarification.

pomt-03965	Says Texas is last in workers' compensation coverage.	true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/14/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-last-workers-c/	Taking umbrage at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign to lure California businesses, the Sacramento Bee swiped at Texas in an editorial stating that among its shortcomings, Texas is last in workers’ compensation coverage. Workers’ compensation coverage ensures employees get paid if they’re injured on the job, or that in work-related deaths, their families receive benefits. Before states started passing such laws in 1911, workers’ main recourse was to sue their employers, who usually won in court. Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, offered as a basis for this claim a February 2011 report, "Texas on the Brink," issued by a Texas House caucus called the Legislative Study Group. The basis for the report’s ranking on "workers’ compensation coverage" was 2006 data on the percentage of workers covered in each state that came from the National Academy of Social Insurance, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group that researches such issues. And herein lies an important anomaly: Texas is the only state that does not require all employers to obtain workers’ compensation coverage. Experts we consulted agreed this is the reason why Texas consistently ranks last and well behind other states in the proportion of workers covered. There are exceptions; the National Federation of Independent Business says in an online comparison of such state laws that those include government construction contracts. In those cases, workers can file compensation claims, a right that employees usually give up in workers’ compensation agreements, "if they think they have a genuine case and the employer is still refusing to pay monetary benefits," the summary says. And other states exempt certain employers. The academy’s most recent data on the percentage of workers covered in each state comes from 2010. As charted in an August 2012 report, it shows that while Texas had 78.6 percent of workers covered, no other state had less than 94.9 percent covered. Thirteen states -- including California -- had 100 percent covered. Amy Lee, a Texas Department of Insurance expert on workers’ compensation at the Texas Department of Insurance, told us by email, "The 2012 estimate is that 19 percent of private Texas employees do not have (workers’ compensation) coverage," citing her agency’s 2012 analysis of employer participation in the Texas workers’ compensation system. Next, we wondered if there were other ways to rate states on their workers’ compensation coverage. Distinctions can include types of injury covered and differences in benefits paid. And going by some of them, Texas is not last in the nation. For example, division executive for state relations Lori Lovgren of the National Council on Compensation Insurance, which gathers and analyzes data on workers’ compensation, emailed us a 2012 report showing Texas ranked 38th in the business-friendly ranking of lowest cost to employers. Jennifer Wolf, executive director of an association representing state and provincial workers’ compensation systems in the U.S. and Canada, told us by email she would say there can be "quite a bit of difference" between states, especially "when you are comparing different types of benefits (temporary, permanent partial, permanent total)." Wolf’s group, the International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions, is based in Madison, Wis. Wolf and Lee said that most states’ systems have gradually come into line with a set of federal recommendations issued in 1972. Wolf said the most recent check on compliance with those guidelines was a Jan. 1, 2004, report from a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor. States averaged compliance with 12.83 of the 19 recommendations, the report said; Texas’ compliance was slightly below average, at 12.5. So the most significant difference between the states that we found is Texas’ voluntary system, under which 81 percent of private-sector workers get coverage not dissimilar to that across the country. Of the 19 percent in Texas that do not have government-mandated coverage, Lee said, "most have access to some sort of occupational benefits plan by their employer. The rest have no coverage." Rick Levy, legal director of the Texas AFL-CIO labor federation, said the alternative coverage offered by employers not subscribing to Texas’ system can offer "far inferior" benefits. "The fact that so many workers lack coverage at all really sets us apart from everybody." Our ruling The Bee said Texas is last in workers’ compensation coverage. Under state law, Texas remains the only U.S. state in which such coverage isn’t mandatory for all employers. And in 2010, 81 percent of Texas workers had such coverage, while nearly all workers were covered in the other states. The editorial’s statement is True.

pomt-07015	Says car insurance rates have decreased since about a decade ago because of market-based solutions that attracted more auto insurers to New Jersey.	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/07/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-credits-former-gov-jim-mcgreeve/	Gov. Chris Christie recently credited one of his Democratic predecessors for saving New Jersey drivers some money. Christie, a Republican, said former Gov. Jim McGreevey helped reduce auto insurance rates in a state where drivers struggled for decades with high costs and few insurance options. "I’ve got to give a shoutout to Governor McGreevey," Christie said in an "On the Line" interview with Steve Adubato. "He did a very good job on that while he was governor and our auto insurance, while still high, is not anywhere near as high as it used to be about a decade ago. And that's because we went to market-based solutions that brought more folks in here, created more competition, and now you have lower rates." Any New Jerseyan with four wheels and a driver’s license knows insuring those four wheels can get expensive. But are drivers in the state better off because of changes enacted by McGreevey? First, let’s tackle how auto insurance rates have fared over time. According to data compiled by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators, the average combined premium in New Jersey dropped from $1,316.49 in 1998 to $1,197.91 in 2008, the most recent year analyzed by the association. The state’s average combined premium, which is the average price for a policy that includes liability, collision and comprehensive coverage, peaked in 2004 at $1,386.46. PolitiFact New Jersey also looked at the average expenditure, a statistic that aims to measure what motorists spent on average for car insurance, including those who buy only liability coverage. The average expenditure in New Jersey dropped to $1,081.28 in 2008 from $1,138.28 in 1998. It peaked at $1,221.08 in 2004, according to NAIC numbers. The NAIC notes that these measurements are calculated with no distinction for deductibles, vehicle types and other factors that can affect auto insurance rates, and does not rank states because of these issues. However, the rankings can be compiled from data in the reports. According to our analysis, New Jersey had the most expensive combined average premiums in the nation, including Washington, D.C., from 1998 to 2004. In 2005 and 2006, D.C. pulled ahead and New Jersey dropped to second. But for the two most recent years of data, 2007 and 2008, New Jersey has ranked third, behind D.C. and Louisiana. The state’s rankings for average expenditure have a similar trend. Is McGreevey the reason for the drop? In 2003, McGreevey enacted changes to the state’s auto insurance regulations in a bid to attract more insurance companies to the state, increase competition and lower rates. The same year, California-based Mercury General, opened in New Jersey and other major insurance companies followed. Although New Jersey’s average combined premium and average expenditure on auto insurance peaked in 2004, they have fallen annually since then, according to NAIC data. But rates have also decreased nationally since 2004. A national expert on auto insurance told us that while the movement in rates in New Jersey mirrors national trends "to some extent," costs are being pushed down by state reform efforts from McGreevey in 2003, and from reforms enacted in the late 1990s. "It’s become a much more attractive place for companies," said David Snyder, American Insurance Association vice president and associate general counsel. Three other industry experts said the reforms enacted during McGreevey’s tenure deserve significant -- if not complete -- credit for cheaper auto insurance in New Jersey. John Dyke, a trustee of the trade group New Jersey Auto Agents Alliance, said "the reforms actually do help a lot because they drive competition within the market place." The economy also is a factor, Dyke said, because more people are opting for less coverage. Chuck Leitgeb, vice president of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, an organization that represents insurance companies in New Jersey, largely attributed the drop in prices to the reforms. The drop in the average expenditure is "unquestionably the results of the reforms," said Brian Sullivan, editor of Risk Information, which covers the insurance industry. "They’ve unleashed a competitive frenzy in New Jersey." Let’s recap. Christie said market-based reforms enacted during McGreevey’s tenure helped drive down auto insurance costs in New Jersey, and experts we spoke with said reforms enacted in 2003 played a significant -- if not complete -- role in reducing rates.

pomt-14135	"Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/05/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-minimum-wage-hike-15-would-red/	Though he’s significantly trailing Hillary Clinton in the Democratic delegate count, Bernie Sanders is keeping up the pressure on his primary rival, particularly on policy grounds. In a tweet sent on May 4, 2016 -- the day after Sanders won the Indiana primary -- Sanders reminded followers about his stance on the minimum wage, which is more aggressive than Clinton’s. Sanders supports raising the wage to $15 an hour, while Clinton has backed a raise to $12 an hour. (Currently, it’s $7.25 an hour.) "Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year," Sanders tweeted. Is that correct? Not really. Sanders’ tweet rests on an analysis of increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, not to $15. In reality, economists have never modeled potential job losses caused by increasing the minimum wage to $15, which would be more than double the current level. In fact, some suggest that raising the minimum wage that high could produce enough job losses to increase -- not decrease -- public assistance costs. The source of Sanders’ statistic The number comes from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank, based on a minimum wage hike to $10.10. "Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would reduce government expenditures on current income-support programs by $7.6 billion per year -- and possibly more, given the conservative nature of this estimate," EPI wrote. The author of the EPI paper, David Cooper, told PolitiFact that he and his colleagues did subsequently re-run the numbers -- not for a $15 minimum wage but for a $12 minimum wage. Their conclusion was that a bump to $12 would save an even higher amount than a bump to $10.10 -- specifically, $17 billion annually. So Sanders’ tweet, Cooper said, could actually be "an understatement." But even if you agree with that argument -- and many economists would not -- changing the calculation to a $15 minimum wage could make a big difference. Even Cooper acknowledged that there’s a degree of uncertainty about the impacts of a minimum wage hike as large as the one Sanders was referring to, if only because it hasn’t been studied. "I don't think we know definitively whether $15 would be different, because it is larger than the increases that have been rigorously studied," Cooper said. However, he added, "If you think $15 would have some sizable negative effect on employment or hours, it's going to moderate those savings (on government assistance programs). We have no way to know by how much." Economists are skeptical Other economists we checked with expressed even deeper skepticism. They said that even if you accept research that says modest minimum-wage increases don’t depress employment -- which, again, is a claim not all economists agree with -- it’s unwise to blithely assume that an increase to $15 will have no negative impact on hiring and hours worked. For instance, in 2014, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that an increase of the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9.00 would result in the loss of 100,000 jobs. But a rise to $10.10, CBO estimated, would swell that number fivefold, to 500,000. Scaling that calculation up to a $15 minimum wage would almost certainly increase net job losses further, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "It’s very hard to believe that a minimum wage hike to $15 would produce the same adverse impact on employment as a hike to just $10.10," Burtless said. Indeed, the potential adverse impacts are "likely to be considerably bigger" at $15, he said. Others agreed. "A larger hike is more likely to cause a decrease in employment opportunities, and that could result in an increase in the demands for government support rather than a decrease," said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist agreed. "These estimates are predicated on the notion that the minimum wage is a simple transfer from employers to employees, with no negative effects on employment," he said. "The higher the minimum wage goes, the worse of an assumption that is." What the Sanders camp says When we reached out to the Sanders campaign, they forwarded two supporting documents. One was a letter from 210 economists backing a minimum wage hike to $15 an hour. However, even this letter acknowledges that "raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as of 2020 would entail an increase that is significantly above the typical pattern with federal minimum wage increases." The second was a study from the University of Washington that found little or no evidence of price increases at grocery, retail, or gasoline stores in Seattle relative to the surrounding areas after that city raised its minimum wage. However, while Seattle’s wage is eventually heading to $15, it has not reached that level yet, and the study only looked at the period after the wage increased from $9.47 to $11. That’s a jump of $1.53, not $7.75 -- the size of the federal increase if Sanders had his way. The authors of the University of Washington paper acknowledge this. "We have little reason to think that our initial impact assessment will adequately capture the full impact of the minimum wage ordinance," they wrote. "As some employers will have until 2021 to fully adapt to higher wages, the complete impact of the $15 minimum wage in Seattle may not be known for nearly a decade." One of the authors, University of Washington public policy professor Jacob L. Vigdor, told PolitiFact that "it's fair to say that we don't have evidence to support the public spending claim" made by Sanders. Our ruling Sanders tweeted, "Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year." Sanders based this on a study that looked at what would happen if the minimum wage were raised to $10.10, not to $15. In reality, no such study of a $15 wage hike exists -- and economists say there’s good reason to believe that jobs lost from a wage hike that large could be significant. It might even be big enough to increase the cost of government assistance, not lower it. At the very least, a minimum wage increase this big is historically unprecedented, meaning that the degree of certainty in Sanders’ tweet is unsupported by academic evidence.

pomt-13694	Says Hillary Clinton's Iran nuclear deal "lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/29/reince-priebus/iran-nuclear-deal-was-hillary-clintons-and-it-line/	In recent weeks, one of our most-clicked factchecks has been about an attack Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus made on Hillary Clinton back in April 2015. Priebus, a Wisconsinite, claimed that Clinton took "money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen." Our rating was Half True. His phrasing could have left the impression that Clinton herself, rather than the Clinton family foundation, received the money. (And Yemen doesn’t have a monarchy and didn’t make contributions to the foundation.) On July 21, 2016, Priebus attacked Clinton again, this time during his address to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. "In foreign policy, a Clinton presidency means forgetting our friends and enabling our enemies," Priebus charged. "Just look, just look at her disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which lined the pockets of the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money, while abandoning our greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel." Several days earlier in Cleveland, Priebus made one statement about the Bush family appearing at GOP conventions and another about "the facts" and "the best scenario for kids." Both were rated False by PolitiFact National. This claim is not looking so good, either. Terror sponsor The Republican Party didn’t respond to our requests for information to back Priebus’ statement. But labeling Iran the "number one state sponsor of terrorism" isn’t just rhetoric. Iran has been on the State Department’s official list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. And in its latest annual country report on terrorism, released in June 2016, the State Department said Iran "remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism" in 2015. But Priebus’ characterization of the nuclear deal with Iran, struck in July 2015 with the United States and several other nations, is deeply flawed. Nuclear deal The deal was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. At the time, it was believed Iran might be two to three months away from getting a nuclear bomb. But if Iran abides by restrictions imposed by the deal, scientists say, it would take at least 12 months to build a weapon. In exchange for curbing its nuclear program, Iran gets access to tens of billions of dollars in assets (estimates are as high as $150 billion, but the exact amount is not known). But the vast majority of those assets are Iran’s own money, not American cash. Those assets had been frozen as a result of sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and other countries. CNN noted the deal includes the State Department agreeing to pay Iran $1.7 billion to settle a 35-year-old legal dispute over a trust fund that had been frozen since Iran's revolution. So, the nuclear deal arguably "lined the pockets" of Iran -- but almost all of it is Iran’s own money. One more thing -- and it’s a big one -- about the timing of the deal. Clinton has said that her work as secretary of state in putting together sanctions against Iran helped usher Iran to the negotiating table, a claim PolitiFact National rated Mostly True. But Clinton was referring to work she did in 2009 and 2010. And she left the secretary position in February 2013. That means Clinton was gone for 2.5 years before the nuclear deal was struck. In other words, the heavy lifting was done under the current secretary, John Kerry, although Clinton endorsed it. And President Barack Obama had to sign off on the deal, so it belongs to him more than any secretary of state. Our rating Priebus said Clinton's Iran nuclear deal "lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money." The United States labels Iran as the top state sponsor of terrorism. But the deal was struck 2.5 years after Clinton left the Obama administration. And the vast majority of the tens of billions of dollars that Iran gets is not American money, but its own assets, which were frozen by the U.S. and other countries that imposed sanctions on Iran. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d04632ed-a487-42ae-8342-dab37119b6af	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2016-07-29T09:30:00	2016-07-21	['Iran']
pomt-14676	"California Senator, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, 'Give me your guns, I'm rounding 'em up,' she would."	false	/california/statements/2016/jan/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misfires-feinstein-gun-claim/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: Texas Senator Ted Cruz repeated a false claim about California Senator Dianne Feinstein and guns during Thursday night’s GOP presidential candidates debate in South Carolina. Cruz said at the debate: "California Senator, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, 'Give me your guns, I'm rounding 'em up,' she would." Cruz's claim is at the 9:30 minute mark in the video above. The Texas Republican made a nearly identical claim Jan. 7 in a CNN interview. We ruled it false. In that interview, Cruz told CNN: "I’ll tell you who I do take at her word is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said: ‘If I could go to Mr. America, Mrs. America, and say, hand over your guns, I want all of your guns, I would do it.’" We focused on Cruz's provocative comments that Feinstein said she wanted Americans to "hand over your guns, I want all your guns." We learned Cruz took a statement Feinstein made in 1995 about the assault weapons ban she authored far, far out of context. No love lost Cruz and Feinstein are about as far apart on gun rights as any politicians in Washington D.C. The senators famously sparred in 2013, during Feinstein’s unsuccessful attempt to pass a revamped assault weapons ban. At a Senate hearing, the longtime California senator accused Cruz of giving her a "lecture" on constitutional rights. "I’m not a sixth grader," Feinstein told Cruz, during a terse exchange. "I come from a different place than you. I respect your views. I ask you to respect my views." Cruz had suggested Feinstein was trying to pick apart the Second Amendment, in a way she would never try with the First or Fourth Amendments. Cruz is among the biggest gun rights backers in the GOP presidential candidate field. As Texas solicitor general, he led a successful fight before the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a Washington D.C. gun ban in 2008. His defense of the Second Amendment has continued this winter in stump speeches from New Hampshire to Nevada. Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) meets with attendees Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016, during a campaign stop at Granite State Indoor Range in Hudson, N.H. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Feinstein on guns Feinstein, by contrast, is considered a leader on gun control. In 1994, she authored the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which was signed by President Bill Clinton. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. It also banned the manufacture and sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. The bill expired in 2004 after efforts to extend it failed in Congress. Its restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons or magazines made before the ban’s effective date: Sept. 13, 1994. Video of Feinstein’s comment In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired in February 1995, correspondent Lesley Stahl asked Feinstein about this loophole, which made it legal to buy and sell hundreds of thousands of the assault weapons the senator had sought to restrict. Feinstein responded: "If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t here.’" Cruz’s campaign spokesman pointed to this statement when we asked him to back up the presidential hopeful’s claim. It’s available on YouTube as a short excerpt of the longer 60 Minutes piece. The YouTube video makes it clear that the interview is about the assault weapons ban. The term "assault weapon" is uttered in the first sentence, just as the video clip shows Feinstein hoisting up a semiautomatic weapon at a press conference. Nowhere in the short piece or the full interview does Feinstein discuss banning "all guns" as Cruz claimed. Feinstein does say in the TV interview that she wanted to ban all assault weapons, regardless of when they were made. She again made that point in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor several months after the 60 Minutes interview, in December 1995: "If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that," she said, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record. Feinstein has outlined her support for legal gun ownership in many ways, including during the effort to renew the assault weapons ban. "Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right," Feinstein wrote in an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle in July 2012. Our ruling Cruz has claimed multiple times that Feinstein stated her desire to tell Americans "I want all of your guns," or "I'm rounding 'em up." When asked to show evidence of the claim, Cruz’s spokesman pointed to a short segment of a 60 Minutes piece that centered on Feinstein’s assault weapons ban from two decades ago. While Feinstein calls for an "outright ban" in the excerpt, a reasonable look at that sound bite, and a transcript of the full 60 Minutes interview, shows Feinstein is not referring to banning "all guns." Instead, she’s relaying that she failed to achieve her desired full ban on assault weapons. The full TV segment details a large loophole in the law that allows the sale and purchase of assault weapons made before the ban went into effect. Feinstein’s statement is clearly in response to concerns over that loophole. We rate Cruz’s claim False.

pomt-08956	"Should Democrats get their way, every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011. Every single one."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/22/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-democrats-want-all-bush-tax-cuts-e/	In a July 20, 2010, press conference, Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., the third-ranking House Republican, attacked the Democratic majority over tax policy. He said, "The American people deserve to know that, should Democrats get their way, every income tax bracket will increase on January 1, 2011. Every single one. You know, you don’t raise taxes on every American taxpayer during the worst recession in 25 years. As we’ve done on their failed stimulus policy, as we did on their national energy tax, as we did on their government takeover of health care, House Republicans will stand in the gap to protect taxpayers from the largest tax increase in American history." We thought it would be worth checking two aspects of Pence's statement. One is whether all tax brackets are indeed poised to rise when tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush expire at the end of this year. The other is whether the Democrats actually want that to happen. We'll take these in order. • Will every tax bracket increase? The answer is yes, unless Congress takes action. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2010, lowered income tax rates across the board, though studies have shown that the benefits of this law, when combined with other Bush-era tax cuts, tilted toward wealthier Americans. The law created a new, 10 percent tax rate for the lowest-income taxpayers (many of whom actually qualify for tax rebates under the Earned Income Tax Credit). It also chopped a few percentage points off most existing tax brackets, with the top rate for married households falling from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. If the tax cuts were to expire with no Congressional intervention, the pre-2001 tax brackets would spring back to life. Here's how the tax brackets would look on a before-and-after basis for married couples filing jointly based on their incomes. For simplicity, we're ignoring modest adjustments for inflation. Tax brackets for other categories such as individual filers broadly follow the same pattern. • Up to $16,750: Rises from 10 percent to 15 percent • From $16,751 to $58,200: Stays same at 15 percent, but entire bracket pays 5 percent additional on the first $16,750 • From $58,201 to $68,000: Rises from 15 percent to 28 percent • From $68,001 to $137,300: Rises from 25 percent to 28 percent • From $137,301 to $209,250: Rises from 28 percent to 31 percent • From $209,251 to $373,650: Rises from 33 percent to 36 percent • $373,651 and up: Rises from 35 percent to 39.6 percent So on this point, Pence is correct, assuming Congress does nothing. • Do Democrats want every tax bracket to rise, as Pence suggests? In a word, no. For many months, Democratic officials have consistently said that they intend to let only the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals lapse. The cutoff they usually suggest is $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly. President Obama campaigned on just such a plan, and we've logged those promises into our Obameter campaign promises database. Take this Reuters article published July 13, 2010, just days before Pence made his comments. "The U.S. Congress will likely act to extend tax cuts for the middle class to avoid choking off the fragile economic recovery, key congressional Democrats said on Tuesday. House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer said he expected the House to push to extend middle-class tax cuts before they expire at year end but suggested cutting taxes for the wealthy is less urgent. 'What you want to do is stimulate at this point in time, so you certainly do not want to increase taxes on the middle class, middle-income working Americans,' Hoyer told reporters. President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress have vowed not to raise taxes on individuals earning less than $200,000 or couples making less than $250,000." A bill to do this is not yet finished, but spokesmen for both Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the House Ways and Means Committee confirmed to PolitiFact that the legislative proposal they're working on would extend the tax cuts for all taxpayers below an income threshold. A Pence spokesman countered with another Hoyer remark, made June 22, 2010, during a forum on deficit reduction. Hoyer told the audience that "as the House and Senate debate what to do with the expiring Bush tax cuts in the coming weeks, we need to have a serious discussion about their implications for our fiscal outlook, including whether we can afford to permanently extend them before we have a real plan for long-term deficit reduction," according to an Associated Press report. This suggests that at least one leading Democrat is undecided about how to proceed with the Bush tax cuts in the long term. However, we don’t see this as strong evidence for Pence’s claim. First, Hoyer, in comments to reporters after the June 22 event, said, "I don't think this is the time to increase taxes." He said that any tax increases, if they happen at all, would need to take place after the economy recovers. He didn't express any opposition to temporary extensions of the tax cuts (at least for middle- and lower-income Americans) -- and that’s the only factor that’s relevant in judging Pence’s quote. While Pence would be on safe ground questioning Hoyer’s commitment to a permanent extension, he’s wrong to say that Hoyer would somehow "get (his) way" by seeing all tax brackets increase on Jan. 1, 2011. Just to be safe, we checked with Hoyer’s office to nail down his stance on a temporary extension. Communications director Katie Grant confirmed that Hoyer favors at least a temporary extension to prevent a tax increase on Jan. 1, 2011. If anything, the momentum within the Democratic Party may be in the direction of keeping the Bush tax cuts for everyone, even for the wealthy. On July 22, 2010, news reports indicated that Democratic Sens. Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Kent Conrad of North Dakota had joined a growing chorus of Democrats who think it might be a good idea to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone, at least until the economy has recovered. Pence is right that every tax bracket will go up if the law is not extended. Still, we think the claim that Democrats don't want to extend the law is inaccurate. While the legislative drafting is still in process, the Democratic majority in Congress has made clear that it plans to extend tax cuts for all but the top couple percentage points of the income distribution. So it's highly misleading for him to say that Democrats actually want to see all the bill's cuts expire. Indeed, Pence's comment verges on a scare tactic. While Pence would have been entirely accurate to say, "If the Democrats fail to extend the expiring tax cuts, all tax brackets will increase," he didn't. What he did say merits a ruling of False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c0d67665-83ed-4917-9c62-18f8b2669155	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2010-07-22T10:02:21	2010-07-20	['None']
pomt-12856	Says that in Texas, it’s "already illegal to enter a bathroom to harm someone."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/feb/01/sylvia-garcia/half-true-senators-claim-its-already-illegal-enter/	A Democratic opponent of a legislative proposal dictating who enters which bathrooms says existing law already bars Texans from slipping into facilities intending to do wrong. Houston state Sen. Sylvia Garcia declared in a Jan. 5, 2017 press release: "All Texans want to go to the bathroom in peace, including transgender people. That’s why it’s already illegal to enter a bathroom to harm someone." We wondered about that as the Texas proposal, dubbed the Texas Privacy Act by authoring Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, was assigned to a Senate committee in early 2017. Senate Bill 6 primarily would require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings, public schools and universities corresponding with the sex they were assigned at birth. The proposal also would prohibit city and county officials from adopting ordinances that prevent private businesses from making policies for their bathrooms and dressing rooms. Nationally through the first few weeks of 2017, GOP lawmakers in eight states, including Texas, had proposed bathroom-related legislation, according to tracking by the National Conference of State Legislatures. And over the previous few years, at least 24 states considered "bathroom bills," though North Carolina was the only state to have passed and implemented a measure, according to the group. In Texas, Democrats have denounced Kolkhorst’s measure as discriminatory against transgender people and warned that it could harm Texas businesses and tourism. Proponents led by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick say the measure will keep men from entering women’s restrooms to commit crimes. So, is entering a bathroom with plans to hurt someone already against Texas law? Asked to appraise Garcia’s claim, a Kolkhorst spokesman, Matthew Russell, said by email it’s incorrect that Texas law already forbids a person from entering a restroom for the purpose of committing a crime. Russell also provided a statement from Kolkhorst conceding that laws "exist to protect people everywhere from harm," but her legislation, Kolkhorst said, "specifically recognizes that predators often seek to target victims in vulnerable locations such as showers, locker rooms and restrooms." Garcia's backup In contrast, a Garcia aide guided us to a Houston ordinance and a state criminal law pertaining to public bathrooms. John Chapa Gorczynski, Garcia’s chief of staff, noted a Houston city ordinance that makes it a crime to enter an opposite-sex restroom without permission. The 1968 ordinance states: "It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and intentionally enter any public restroom designated for the exclusive use of the sex opposite to such person's sex without the permission of the owner, tenant, manager, lessee or other person in charge of the premises, in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance." Those, of course, are one big city’s restrictions. YetChapa Gorczynski also pointed out sections of state criminal laws forbidding certain behaviors, though in them we saw no general proscription against entering the bathroom designated for an opposite sex. Chapter 42 of the Texas Penal Code, prohibits anyone from looking into "an area such as a restroom or shower stall or changing or dressing room that is designed to provide privacy to a person using the area." Other parts of the code pointed out by Garcia’s aide: Chapter 20.01 and 20.02 – Illegal to restrain a person against their will anywhere Chapter 21.07 and 21.08 – Outlaws public lewdness and indecent exposure in public places, including acts of "deviate sexual intercourse" or "act of sexual contact" Chapter 21.15 – Against the law to make invasive visual recordings where someone "has a reasonable expectation that the intimate area is not subject to public view" including, the law specifies, bathrooms and changing rooms Chapter 21.16 – Voyeurism with the intent "to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of the actor" also is against the law At the Texas Municipal League, which says it serves more than 16,000 mayors, councilmembers, city managers, city attorneys, and city department heads, an official said by email that Houston’s bathroom entry ordinance might be unique. Bennett Sandlin said: "I’m not aware of any other ordinances that get into the specifics of bathroom access. Most of the cities that have them are more generic in terms of supporting civil rights," meaning access to public services and accommodations regardless of a person’s race, sexual orientation or gender identity, he said. Our ruling Garcia said it’s already illegal in Texas to enter a bathroom to harm someone. In many ways, significantly, Texas laws forbid a person from harming another person. Also, a longstanding Houston ordinance bars a person from entering the incorrect bathroom. But Garcia didn’t show nor did we find similar no-entry restrictions in place statewide or in other cities.

pomt-01714	"So far, the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/07/joy-reid/joy-reid-compares-deaths-gaza-911-deaths/	Whenever tragedy strikes abroad, pundits often make a point to translate death tolls into dead Americans. The Israeli-Palestinian war is no exception. On her Aug. 4 Reid Report, Joy Reid called out the United Nations for their inability to stop or temper Israel’s campaign in Gaza. The UN’s "condemnations and expressions of outrage," Reid said, "have done exactly nothing to protect civilians in Gaza." "So far the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s." Americans don’t take the name of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in vain. So we wanted to dig into Reid’s claim: Does her math check out, and is she right to compare the impact of the Palestinian deaths to what Reid defined as the American "population equivalent"? Reid’s math, and why 9/11s are not a unit To consider Reid's claim, you need to first know that Reid is essentially looking at the percentage of deaths per population. For one part of the comparison, she's using the population of Gaza, which is pretty straightforward. For the other part of the comparison, she's choosing to use the entire population of the United States. And as we'll show you, that makes all the difference. Reid's napkin math is relatively straightforward. Roughly 1,800 Palestinians have died out of 1.8 million in Gaza, which equals 0.1 percent of its population. Roughly 3,000 out of 300 million Americans died directly in the Sept. 11 attacks, which works out to 0.001 percent of America’s population. Compare the two and you get that .1 percent is 100 times 0.001 percent. That’s where "100 9/11s" comes from. If you use slightly more precise numbers, it doesn’t move the needle that much. The United Nations report issued on Aug. 4, when Reid made her claim, put the number of Palestinian deaths at 1,777 (not more than 1,800, as Reid said), and the CIA estimates Gaza’s population at 1,816,379. A 10-year memorandum on the Sept. 11 attacks from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism puts the number of deaths in the Sept. 11 attacks at 2,997, and the United States Census Bureau population clock puts the U.S. population on Sept. 11, 2011, at 285,558,980. Using those numbers, we get that Palestine’s death count is the "population equivalent" of 93.22 9/11s when using the entire population of the United States. That's not quite Reid’s 100, but it's not substantially different. But our fractional result does help demonstrate that 9/11s are not a particularly good unit of measurement. It’s unclear what 0.22 of a 9/11 -- or for that matter, 100 9/11s -- would look like. Impact on society Comparing death tolls as proportions of population is misleading, experts told us. In his book How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking, University of Wisconsin mathematician Jordan Ellenberg explains how, while occasionally useful, taking population equivalents quickly becomes ridiculous if you apply it to extreme cases. For example, Ellenberg writes, the 1,074 Israelis killed by Palestinians from 2000-05 works out to 50,000 Americans, but if you scale down instead of up, it loses its punch. The same Israeli death toll, he says, is proportional to only one or two deaths in Tuvalu, a Polynesian island with roughly 1,000 inhabitants. "When commentators in Israel and Palestine were observing 9/11 when it happened, people weren’t saying, ‘Imagine if 20 Palestinians had been killed,’ " Ellenberg told us. Similarly, the Palestinian death count from the last couple of weeks is the "population equivalent" of about 1.3 million Chinese, but only one Tuvaluan -- not quite as rhetorically overwhelming as "100 9/11s." The problem, Ellenburg wrote in a 2006 Slate article, is that our "innate number sense simply doesn’t extend" to extremely small numbers. He uses the example of a Hezbollah bombing of the Israeli city of Haifa, which killed one in every 787,500 Israelis. "Imagine that it was actually one in 78,750. You just multiplied the scale of the crime tenfold, but can you say sincerely that the two numbers inspire a different reaction? The proportions are just too small to comprehend." Beyond that, Ellenberg told us, "there’s a huge amount of wiggle room in how you count what population you divide by." If you use just the population of New York City instead of the entire United States, the Palestinian death count works out to about three 9/11s. And if you limit yourself only to the population of Manhattan, you get less than one 9/11. It’s not clear which figure is the best choice to put the Palestinian death count in context -- or if any of them are even useful. Population equivalent, but not morally equivalent Reid's comment also can be seen as trying to create a moral equivalence. But that doesn’t hold water, said Oxford ethicist Anders Herlitz. "Most moral theories would say that the moral worth of individual lives are not comparable at all," Herlitz said. "According to this line of thinking, we cannot measure the life of one against the life of many." The only "sound ethical theory" that does let you make what philosophers call "inter-personal comparisons" is utilitarianism, Herlitz said, which posits that "all lives are of equal worth. One Palestinian equals one Israeli equals one American, and so on." So there’s no ethical sense in which 1,800 Palestinian deaths are comparable to "100 9/11s." Our ruling Reid, decrying the UN’s failure to temper the rising death counts in Gaza, said, "So far, the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s." She used a couple of rough estimates, but Reid’s math basically works out for the parameters she set. The parameters, however, are the problem. Using 9/11s as a unit ignores qualitative differences between the Sept. 11 attack and the Israeli-Palestinian war. It’s also not clear what populations she’s referring to, and while looking at deaths as a proportion of population can be useful, the numbers here are too small for them to mean much. There are also at least equally valid and different ways to compare deaths as a proportion of population that would produce vastly different results. (Going from 100 9/11s to less than 1 9/11.) Reid’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-01859	"I created the school choice program."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/13/gary-george/gary-george-says-he-created-school-choice-program/	In the history of Wisconsin’s groundbreaking private school choice program, as told by journalists and scholars, Democrat Annette "Polly" Williams is the godmother of the movement and Republican Tommy Thompson the godfather. But Gary George is bluntly rewriting those accounts as he attempts to resurrect his political career through a challenge to US Rep. Gwen Moore, another Democrat from Milwaukee. "I created the school choice program, which ushered in not only an era of educational reform in Wisconsin, but really throughout the nation and around the world," George, a former state senator, told newsman Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s "Upfront" show July 6, 2014. Who deserves the title of creator? The word has several meanings, including "to cause to come into being," or "evolved from one’s own thought or imagination." How it passed George pointed us to the final amended bill that became law in 1990, when it was signed by Thompson, who was governor at the time. That bill allowed poor Milwaukee parents to use publicly funded vouchers to send their children to private, non-religious schools of their choosing. It was a scaled-down version of a Republican plan that sought to include religious schools. To become law, the bill had to clear Joint Finance, the powerful committee that George co-chaired with Milwaukee Democrat Walter Kunicki. It was part of a multi-issue budget bill. As heads of the committee, George and Kunicki were listed as authors of the bill. George brokered several changes, getting the support of Williams and others. George’s role was "crucial" in winning passage, wrote James Carl, a scholar of urban education reform, in his book, "Freedom of Choice: Vouchers in American Education." Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the same: "I give him his props. We couldn’t have gotten that bill passed without his help." Other participants agreed. Howard Fuller, a Milwaukee Public Schools critic who went on to become superintendent, told us that "if Polly had not come to an agreement with Gary, it would not have passed." So George can lay claim to a significant role in the legislation that created the choice program. But there’s little doubt that the final product was largely drawn from an earlier bill drafted by Williams, then a state representative, and educational activist Larry Harwell. Indeed, George appears to have had little if any role in the decades-long legislative battles that came before the measure finally passed. And in his book, Carl flatly calls Williams "the state representative who authored the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program." Further back in history Williams and Harwell were among the varied and sometimes competing forces -- some liberal Democrats, religious leaders, conservatives, business leaders -- who began pushing in the late 1960s for choice and independent community schools in Milwaukee’s central city. Some legislation was considered and voted on in the 1970s and into the 1980s but the partisan political obstacles were many. The decisive action, put in motion by Thompson, came during the Republican governor’s first term in the late 1980s. The reform-minded Thompson was rebuffed in 1988 when he sought a voucher program in Milwaukee that included religious schools. George did not favor the plan and Joint Finance deleted it from the state budget, amid teachers union opposition to the governor’s move. Thompson tried again in early 1989 with a similar result, but momentum built when Milwaukee Public Schools leaders put forward their own choice plan. George’s policy adviser, Walter Farrell, started warming to the bill, Carl recounted in his book. At that point, Williams, who opposed the MPS plan, authored her own, but it fell in the state Assembly. She redrafted new legislation in mid-1989 and worked to get bipartisan support. The governor, as well as Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist, got behind it. Teachers union opposition faded. Williams "helped persuade (George) to support their legislation," Carl wrote in his book. "After meeting with community residents and Thompson, George eventually came down on Williams’ side." The Williams-authored bill easily passed the Assembly, but was bottled up in a Senate committee until George attached it to a budget bill and made changes that Williams agreed to. It worked. Senate and Assembly passage followed, and Thompson signed it in April 1990, winning praise from President George H. W. Bush. In news accounts at the time, Thompson credited Williams for the plan, and George offered a cautious comment: "We’ll see if this is an experiment that works." Today, Fuller sees Williams as deserving of the most credit, despite George’s crucial late work. George told us: "Polly Williams, she had the concept, but you have to legislate it. It’s legislation, so there’s no parentage." Williams says now she is bitter at what she sees as a misguided Republican expansion of choice beyond Milwaukee and to wealthier families in recent years. But she’s proud of what she did and politely disagreed with George’s comments. "He didn’t create it," she said. Thompson told PolitiFact Wisconsin he sees it this way: "It was my idea, and both Williams and George had a lot to do with it. Our rating George told an interviewer: "I created the school choice program." Clearly the former senator helped give birth to choice, steering it through the Senate with crucial changes and granting his crucial support. But George didn’t conceive of the idea. And his account crowds out the long leadership -- and more prominent role -- of both Williams and Thompson, not to mention Williams’ authorship of the bill George modified. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.

John McCain said, 'No.' "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/02/fred-thompson/mccain-bargained-with-his-vietnamese-captors/	In his speech Sept. 2, 2008, to the Republican National Convention, former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., recounted John McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam after his Navy plane was shot down in October 1967. "They took him to the Hanoi Hilton, where he lapsed in and out of consciousness for days," Thompson said in St. Paul, Minn. "He was offered medical care for his injuries if he would give up military information in return. John McCain said, 'No.' " Thompson compresses details of McCain's biography to offer the most positive picture of the Republicans' 2008 standard-bearer. But in doing so he contradicts statements McCain made in his bestselling autobiography, Faith of My Fathers. In the book, co-written with Mark Salter, McCain recounts the grievous wounds he suffered when shot down and afterward at the hands of angry Vietnamese. He was taken to the Maison Centrale, known to POWs as the Hanoi Hilton, where he did lapse in and out of consciousness for four days and refuse his interrogators' demands for information. But then, McCain recounts, he tried a different approach with a prison officer nicknamed "Bug.'' "Desperate, I tried to bargain with him. 'Take me to the hospital and I'll give you the information you want.' I didn't intend to keep my word, reasoning that after my injuries had been treated, I would be strong enough to deal with the consequences of not holding up my end of the bargain,'' McCain wrote. As for never cooperating with Vietnamese, McCain also admits he eventually gave up information about his ship and Navy squadron. "I regret very much having done so,'' he wrote.

pomt-10335	"For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/22/barack-obama/obama-proposed-more-troops-in-07/	During an overseas trip to Afghanistan, Sen. Barack Obama said the United States needed to focus on the war there, calling the situation "precarious and urgent," adding "I believe this has to be our central focus, the central front, on our battle against terrorism." "For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three," he said. We consulted the record to see if Obama had urged more troops for Afghanistan that long. Back on Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. The speech got a lot of attention because Obama said that the United States should aggressively pursue terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan. "If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will," Obama said. (See our previous Truth-O-Meter rulings about Obama's stance on Pakistan here , here and here. ) But Obama also talked about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan. "Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need — and deserve," Obama said. "As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs, and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country. As president, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban." That speech was the first time we could find of Obama specifically advocating for more brigades to Afghanistan. Technically speaking, the time from his speech on Aug. 1, 2007, to his more recent statement is 10 days short of a year. But it's pretty darn close, and it's likely that speech reflected policy crafted over a longer period than 10 days. So we find his statement True.

pomt-10495	"I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before (Obama) did."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/07/hillary-clinton/nope-obama-was-first-in-the-senate-too/	From the beginning of her presidential campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been answering for her vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, a vote that begat a war that has grown ever more unpopular. It hasn't helped that Sen. Barack Obama has been able criticize her vote with impunity because at the time of the vote he was in the Illinois state senate and rather famously gave a speech at a rally opposing an invasion. At a campaign stop in Eugene, Ore., on April 5, 2008, Clinton was asked again by an audience member to explain her 2002 vote. Clinton responded by saying that Obama may have opposed the war prior to the invasion, but she was the first to criticize the war once he became a U.S. Senator in January 2005. "When Sen. Obama came to the Senate, he and I have voted exactly the same except for one vote. And that happens to be the facts. We both voted against early deadlines. I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before he did. So I'm well aware that his entire campaign is premised on a speech he made in 2002, and I give him credit for that speech," she said. Iraq has been a hot-button issue in the race for the Democratic nomination since the start. A whopping 91 percent percent of Democrats disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling Iraq, according to a March 2008 CBS News poll. Indeed, we spent a lot of time earlier in the campaign documenting which Democrats were against the war first or wanted the fastest withdrawal . Clinton cannot claim to have opposed the war before Obama, so by focusing on who spoke more critically of Iraq beginning with his arrival in the Senate, Clinton wants to reset the clock on this debate. It's a novel strategy, and we wondered if it might work, given that she has spoken out strongly against the Bush administration's war efforts in the years since her Iraq vote. But a little research shows her new timeline doesn't work any better than the old one. Obama still is first. And we're not the first to have done this. Clinton's remarks didn't sound right to Jake Tapper of ABC News, who reported the remarks and debunked them earlier on his "Political Punch" blog . Obama took office on Jan. 3, 2005. One of his early assignments on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was to participate in a hearing to confirm Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State. On Jan. 18, Obama questioned Rice during the hearing about how quickly Iraqi troops were being trained and whether they truly were ready to defend their own country. Obama said then that if success in Iraq is "measured by whether Iraqis can secure their own circumstances, and if our best troops in the world are having trouble controlling the situation with 150,000 or so, it sounds like we've got a long way to go. "And I think part of what the American people are going to need is some certainty, not an absolute timetable, but a little more certainty than is being provided, because right now, it appears to be an entirely open-ended commitment." Sounds like criticism to us. Clinton, meanwhile, weighed in a week later with a statement on Rice's nomination, saying, "In her role as National Security Advisor, Dr. Rice was a member of the team responsible for our flawed Iraq policy. She made several misleading statements about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in the lead up to the war." Clinton also said in the statement the she profoundly disagreed and deeply regretted how the war has been conducted. Clinton might be showing moxie by trying to reframe the Iraq issue in a way that puts her on top, but the facts don't support it.

pomt-06953	Georgia’s illegal-immigration legislation "simply follows existing federal law."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/18/jack-murphy/does-georgias-immigration-bill-simply-follow-exiti/	Just hours after a federal judge ordered a preliminary injunction of Georgia’s legislation to crack down on illegal immigration, a state senator who pushed to get the bill passed laid out what he considered the positives about the ruling. Sen. Jack Murphy, a Republican from Cumming, noted the judge struck down several arguments by the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit against the legislation. But it was the final words of Murphy’s press release that made us reach for the law books. "This law simply follows existing federal law," the release said. We wondered about the senator’s claim since supporters of the Georgia legislation, House Bill 87, pushed for the bill largely because they felt the federal government has done a poor job enforcing its immigration laws and keeping illegal immigrants out of the country. Before Gov. Nathan Deal signed House Bill 87, its supporters also argued the legislation would survive legal challenges. The bill requires all Georgia companies with more than 10 employees to verify the immigration status of all new employees, using the federal government’s E-Verify program. It says businesses that do contract work for the state, their subcontractors and their sub-subcontractors must participate in E-Verify. It gives law enforcement authority to check the immigration status of someone detained on probable cause of committing a crime. Judge Thomas Thrash was concerned about Section 8 of the legislation, which he wrote "will convert many routine encounters with law enforcement into lengthy and intrusive immigration status investigations. Thus, the individual plaintiffs have shown a realistic threat of injury as a result of HB 87." Murphy and others expect the legislation to be appealed to the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and possibly heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. Murphy sent us a statement to back up the claim in his press release. Much of it focused on a section of federal code on immigration about hiring and harboring illegal immigrants and the penalties for document fraud. The general themes of the federal law and Georgia’s legislation, HB 87, are similar. They both say it’s bad to hire or harbor illegal immigrants, and impose fines and possible prison time for anyone who aids in either process. They both have fines and prison sentences for anyone who commits document fraud. Georgia’s legislation makes several references to following the guidelines of federal law. Thrash, however, said there are big differences between the state legislation and federal law. "Despite superficial similarities, however, Section 7 [of HB 87] is not identical to 1324 [in the federal code]," Thrash wrote in his ruling. "For example," he wrote, "O.C.G.A. 16-11-202 prohibits knowingly inducing, enticing or assisting illegal aliens to enter Georgia. Section 1324’s corresponding ‘inducement’ provision prohibits inducing an alien to ‘come to, enter, or reside in the United States.’ Once in the United States, it is not a federal crime to induce an illegal alien to enter Georgia from another state." Thrash also wrote that the "defendants wildly exaggerate the scope of the federal crime of harboring under 1324 when they claim that the plaintiffs are violating federal immigration law by giving rides to their friends and neighbors who are illegal aliens." Muzaffar Chishti, an official with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said "the [Georgia bill] prohibits knowingly inducing, enticing or assisting undocumented immigrants to enter Georgia, whereas it is not a federal crime to induce an undocumented immigrant to enter Georgia from another state." He added that the language in the Georgia bill that creates fines and sentences for violators "allows the state to use prosecutorial discretion and judicial interpretation differently than the federal system." Chishti noted that Thrash had those same concerns, pointing to a portion of a federal court ruling concerning Arizona’s illegal-immigration legislation. "[A]lthough Section 7 appears superficially similar to 1324, state prosecutorial discretion and judicial interpretation will undermine federal authority ‘to establish immigration enforcement priorities and strategies,’ " Thrash wrote, quoting the Arizona ruling. Murphy told us he respectfully disagrees with some portions of Thrash’s ruling and that the judge’s interpretation of the federal law is incorrect. Murphy questioned our pursuit of this fact-check, saying, in part, that we could find 100 experts who would agree with Thrash while he could find 100 experts who would agree with him. Still, we pressed on in search of more nonpartisan experts. One was Victor Cerda, former general counsel for the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. He argues Georgia’s E-Verify guidelines go beyond federal guidelines. For example, he noted that Georgia requires affidavits from contractors, subcontractors and sub-subcontractors of the immigration status of their workers. The federal government does not require an affidavit from contractors, an official said. Instead, contractors must sign a memorandum of understanding that they will use E-Verify within its guidelines. "Georgia has a lot more definition," said Cerda, now a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm Jackson Lewis, which specializes in workplace law. So let’s go back to Murphy’s argument that HB 87 "simply follows existing federal law." In the area of penalties, which are easier to measure, Georgia’s bill is less in some areas and potentially greater in other areas. The legislation addresses the same issues as federal law, but there are some differences where Georgia does more than simply follow federal law, such as Cerda’s point on affidavits and the language in Georgia’s bill concerning "inducing" illegal immigration here from another state. Since Murphy’s statement does not consider those distinctions, we rate his claim as Half True.	None	Jack Murphy	None	None	None	2011-07-18T06:00:00	2011-06-27	['None']

pomt-05971	Says Texas does not regulate the appearance of some kinds of imitation firearms sold in Texas.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/24/eddie-lucio-jr/eddie-lucio-says-texas-does-not-regulate-appearanc/	A Democratic state senator called for regulations after police fatally shot a 15-year-old boy who was brandishing what turned out to be a non-lethal air pistol. In an interview posted online Jan. 6, 2012, by KRGV-TV, Channel 5, Eddie Lucio of Brownsville said: "First of all I think that there should be a prohibition of some kind on the appearance of these pellet guns and airsoft guns that are sold in the state of Texas." At least, Lucio said, such guns should visibly stand out so "we understand exactly what they are." In the same segment, reporter Eddie Flores said Lucio told him that "right now, there are no known regulations or prohibitions in the appearance of pellet guns or airsoft guns in the state of Texas." No regulations in Texas? When we inquired, Lucio’s legislative director, Sara González,said the senator intended to stress the lack of state, not federal, regulations of the facsimile firearms’ appearances. Airsoft guns, she said, are required by federal law to display a 6-millimeter orange tip, a mandate that doesn’t apply to pellet or BB guns. "What (Lucio) meant is there is nothing in the state that we know of," she said. "There’s federal regulation on airsoft guns, but that doesn’t apply necessarily to metal pellet-type guns or BB guns." In the Jan. 4, 2012, incident at a Brownsville middle school, the student was wielding a Umarex SA177, according to news accounts. The device solely fires steel BBs, Justin Biddle, a marketing manager at Umarex USA, told us in an interview. González helped us isolate the federal law that regulates the appearance of imitation firearms, stipulating the 6-millimeter orange marking requirement for airsoft guns. Those guns shoot projectiles at a lower speed than pellet or BB guns, according to Jeffrey Welty, an assistant professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina School of Government, who specializes in criminal law and procedure. But the marking requirement does not apply to "traditional BB, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of air pressure," the law says. So, the gun used in Brownsville was exempt from federal marking requirements. In the wake of the shooting, the office of Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, also examined legal issues related to facsimile firearms, said J.J. Garza, Oliveira’s chief of staff. Garza pointed us to another part of the U.S. Code, Section G, which states that federal provisions on imitation gun identification supersede such local or state laws and ordinances. But are there state and local restrictions anyway? Meagan Dorsch, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of State Legislatures, emailed us the organization’s July 2011 list showing states with imitation firearm statutes: Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin. We wondered how any state statutes survive without conflicting with the superseding federal law. By addressing aspects not included in the federal provisions, advised David Kopel, an expert on firearms policy and research director at the Independence Institute, a free-market think tank in Colorado. For instance, he said by email, "Louisiana’s statutes only applies to guns that fire blanks, and those aren't covered by the federal law." Separately, experts at the Texas Legislative Library said that some Texas cities, including Plano, Horseshoe Bay, Farmers Branch and Carrollton have local ordinances that regulate how people display facsimile firearms--no reckless displays of imitation guns in public places, for example--but these statutes don’t regulate the appearance of the guns. Our ruling There are no state-level regulations of the appearance of pellet/BB or airsoft guns sold in Texas, but federal law requires airsoft guns to have special markings -- a wrinkle Lucio did not clarify.

pomt-11377	Says U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis "voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/29/uncle-sams-misguided-children/misleading-attack-ron-desantis-about-farm-bill-foo/	Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, who has received support from President Donald Trump in his bid for Florida governor, favors giving a benefit to immigrants in the country illegally, says an article on Facebook. "DeSantis voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants," stated a March 23 headline on Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, a website that says it is a "community founded by United States Marine Veterans to bring awareness of the lame stream media." The article drew from the Central Florida Post, a right-leaning website. The Uncle Sam story said that DeSantis’ vote on the 2014 farm bill "ultimately puts illegal aliens and criminals ahead of law-abiding American citizens in line for food stamps — a judgment President Trump would surely question." (While Trump has said the "time has come" to restrict federal assistance to immigrants, that already exists.) We found that the Uncle Sam article omitted key context that immigrants in the country illegally were already banned from getting food stamps long before the 2014 farm bill, a sweeping package that only briefly mentions verifying immigration status. The article also ignored an explanation by DeSantis about why he voted against the farm bill. DeSantis is running in the August primary against a field that includes Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. DeSantis vote on farm bill in 2014 A farm bill is passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food stamps, known as SNAP for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Uncle Sam story points to an article about DeSantis’ 2014 vote as one of 63 Republicans to join 103 Democrats voting against HR 2642, the farm bill. The legislation, which passed the House 251-166 and was signed into law by President Barack Obama, had drawn opposition from both sides: Some liberals said the cuts were too steep while some conservatives said it didn’t do enough to cut spending. While the legislation was hundreds of pages, only a few sentences related to illegal immigrants. Section 4015 stated "a state agency shall be required to use an immigration status verification system." That provision drew scant media attention. Some news stories mentioned in a single sentence that the farm bill banned illegal immigrants, college students, lottery winners and dead people from getting food stamps. Another reason the immigration section may not have been a key part of the debate? Federal law already generally banned immigrants in the country illegally from getting food stamps. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 restricted access for immigrants to get food stamps. But subsequent legislation restored access for certain immigrants, including refugees and lawful permanent residents with a proven work history. While the 2014 farm bill required states to use an immigration status verification system, most states already had procedures in place to meet that requirement. Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, which advocates on behalf of low-income people, said the farm bill didn’t change immigrant eligibility rules for food and nutrition assistance. "Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens," he said. Why DeSantis voted against the farm bill The section on immigration wasn’t the motivation behind DeSantis’ vote against the farm bill. He voted against the bill because of the high costs. He believed that the bill failed to overhaul a food stamp program that was growing too large, said campaign spokesman Brad Herold. In a 2014 Facebook post, DeSantis said the farm bill was a "bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms," such as work requirements. Herold said DeSantis does not believe in granting any form of benefits to immigrants in the country illegally. He has voted in favor of amendments related to work requirements for food stamps. But the 2014 farm bill didn’t alter the pre-existing policy that illegal benefits are not eligible for SNAP benefits. "Voting against a bill that expanded farm subsidies and failed to enact welfare reforms is not a vote to confer benefits on illegal immigrants," Herold said. Jacob Engels, publisher of the Central Florida Post and author of the article inked from the Uncle Sam website, directed PolitiFact to an article by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that advocates for low levels of immigration. The story was more nuanced, saying that a family that has some citizens and some immigrants in the country illegally could still get some benefits. Our ruling Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children said that DeSantis "voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants." The article fails to point out that even before the farm bill passed, undocumented immigrants were already generally blocked from getting food stamps. The farm bill that DeSantis voted against was a sweeping piece of legislation that mentions immigrants only briefly in the context of requiring states to verify their status. DeSantis stated at the time of his vote against the bill that he thought it was a bad deal for taxpayers and failed to rein in the food stamp program. By voting "no" he took a stand against the overall piece of legislation — that’s not evidence that he "voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants." We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05205	"When I started in Ohio it was terrible. Now, we’re getting bipartisan support for our bills. And that’s called leadership."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/11/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-his-leadership-has-led-more-b/	Editor's note: This item was updated to correct a vote total for the 2011 budget vote in the Ohio House. John Kasich doesn’t like playing second fiddle, but when he was on "Meet the Press" on June 3, that’s pretty much what he was doing. The Republican governor was on the show facing off against Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to argue as proxies on the relative merits of the candidates for president. Hoping to give a boost to GOP nominee Mitt Romney, Kasich laid into President Barack Obama’s argument that Republicans in Congress are blocking his moves at every turn and undercutting his agenda. Citing his own experience in Ohio, Kasich said the key is to take the "terrible" politics in Washington D.C. and forge a bipartisan road. "When I started in Ohio, it was terrible," he told host David Gregory. "We’re now getting bipartisan support for our bills. And that's called leadership." Was Kasich right? PolitiFact Ohio looked at a previous claim by Kasich in 2011 that there had been some "significant" bipartisan accomplishments during his first year in office and rated that True. But this statement was more sweeping. PolitiFact Ohio decided to pull the voting records and see what they showed. We started out by determining what bills could be fairly described as Kasich administration initiatives as opposed to something lawmakers may have wanted to do. After consulting with an informal trio of PolitiFact Ohio Statehouse reporters, we came up with eight key bills in Kasich’s first year that are fairly described as his babies: the state operating budget, the state transportation budget, the JobsOhio economic development board bill, a business regulation reform bill, a sentencing reform bill, a collective bargaining reform bill (known as Senate Bill 5), a bill cracking down on pill mills and a measure allowing oil and gas drilling in state parks. Before revealing the results, we should note that Kasich’s fellow Republicans hold the advantage over Democrats in both the House (59-40) and the Senate (23-10). So for those eight bills from 2011, we found that on the average, they received 17 House Democratic votes out of a possible 40 and four Senate Democratic votes of a possible 10. On half of the votes in the House, the Kasich bills received three or fewer votes -- which is less than 10 percent of the Democratic votes that could have been obtained. And half of the time in the Senate, the Kasich bills received no Senate votes. Among the bills receiving scant support from either Democratic caucus were the controversial collective bargaining reform legislation, which no Democrats voted for, and Kasich’s state budget, which received only three House Democratic votes. Next, we looked at bills that Kasich has pushed in his second year as governor. After again consulting our informal panel, we came up with seven key bills Kasich has been the driving force behind in 2012. They are the collateral sanctions bill, a Lake Erie water usage bill, a second JobsOhio economic development package as well as four bills that were part of what Kasich called his mid-budget review, or MBR. The MBR bills were wide-ranging rewrites of Ohio law or leftover initiatives which the Kasich administration wasn’t ready to roll out in his main state budget in 2011 covering education, energy, tax policy and a catch-all bill covering various areas of administration policy. For those seven bills, we found on the average that Kasich received 26 House Democratic votes out of a possible 40 and five Senate Democratic votes out of a possible 10. (Please note that those averages are based on six votes per chamber as each chamber hasn’t voted on one of the seven bills listed.) With the exception of the Lake Erie water use bill, which received a single Democratic vote in the House, we found that Kasich received at least 16 House Democratic votes for all of his other initiatives. In the Senate, Kasich’s bills in 2012 didn’t get much more support than his bills in 2011, although he was blanked only once instead of four times. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the clearest example of Kasich’s point is to compare the state budget vote in 2011 (no Democratic votes in either the House or the Senate) to the mid-budget review package of 2012 (an average of 23 House Democratic votes and five Senate Democratic votes). "Things are much better than they were back then," he said in terms of getting bipartisan support. So where does this leave us as the dust settled? When Kasich appeared on "Meet the Press" to bash Obama, he wanted to draw a sharp contrast between the gridlock in Washington and what he sees as his record in Ohio. He said that when he started in Ohio, the political atmosphere was "terrible" but "now we’re getting bipartisan support for our bills." Our math does show that Kasich is getting more support for his key bills in 2012 than when he began his term -- 26 House Democratic votes compared to 16 and five Senate Democratic votes instead of four. Furthermore, the Democratic shutouts for Kasich have dropped off sharply in his second year. However, Kasich appears to have overstated the Democratic opposition to his initiatives when he came into office in 2011. It is true that almost all Democrats opposed his state budget, and no Democrats voted for the controversial rewrite of Ohio’s collective bargaining laws, but at least some Democrats supported most of the other initiatives sought by Kasich in 2011. We find that to be additional information that puts Kasich’s statement into a clearer context. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s statement rates Mostly True.

pomt-01401	"We know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/12/tony-perkins/tony-perkins-we-know-social-science-children-do-be/	The Supreme Court’s refusal this week to review any of the same-sex marriage cases that had been sent for appeal undercut such bans in several states. Supporters of gay marriage celebrated the move. Opponents criticized it as further proof that "unelected judges" have the power to overrule the will of the majority. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a leading group in the fight against gay marriage, said children’s welfare is central to the council’s position. "We know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad," Perkins said Oct. 12 on Fox News Sunday. We have examined this sort of claim before. The independent research fails to back up Perkins’ view. The Family Research Council has a Web page with 10 arguments from social science against same-sex marriage. We went through the list to see which spoke to the welfare of children, and of those points, which were based on studies that compared children in same-sex and opposite-sex households. Not addressing the welfare of children Five of the 10 had more to do with marriage and society than children. They advanced claims that opposite-sex marriage promotes the domestication of men, paternal commitment, sexual fidelity, "gender-typical" roles and the association of marriage with procreation. A sixth one spoke of how children conceived through artificial insemination "hunger" to know about their biological fathers. While those questions no doubt occur, the book cited by the Family Research Council focused largely on what fathers can bring to child-rearing. It was more a guide to fathering, and less a comparison study of different kinds of households. In fact, it wasn’t a peer-reviewed comparison study at all. The remaining four pieces of evidence That leaves four items on the Family Research Council list. One asserted that children need fathers and cited a study on households where the father is absent. However, that research looked at single-parent households, not children with same-sex parents, and so it addresses a different issue entirely. The Web page offers the corollary point that children need mothers. It cites books, not academic studies, and again, the books are not focused on comparing same-sex and opposite-sex households. They look at gender differences and how children develop over time. The final two points from the Family Research Council address the data on children of same-sex households. You can find many research papers that claim that growing up in same-sex households does no harm. But the council cited the court affidavit of a University of Virginia professor who said that not one of those studies "was conducted according to generally accepted standards of scientific research." That testimony has been critiqued on two scores: It came in 2001 and research has passed it by, and it overlooked a range of studies. But even if the methodological critique were correct, it wouldn’t prove that growing up in an opposite-sex household is better. The council then cited the work of New York University sociologist Judith Stacey to make the point that children raised in same-sex households "are more likely to experience gender and sexual disorders." When we looked at this topic before, Stacey said this represents a "complete misuse of the research." Stacey wrote that the differences she described, such as children being more open to same-sex relationships, need not be seen as deficits. Stacey accused same-sex marriage opponents of cherry-picking her findings. What other research shows We did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it was denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher’s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, the researcher loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents. In contrast, we found several research projects that compared much larger numbers of children in same and opposite-sex households. One published in 2012 looked at 78 children -- about half boys and half girls -- raised by lesbian parents. The mothers joined the research project as far back as 1986, long before their children were born. The children were assessed over time and those results were matched to children from heterosexual couples. When asked about how they felt about themselves, their relations with their parents and with their peers, the children of lesbians responded much as did the children of straight parents. However, they were more likely to report being teased at school because of their parents. The American Psychological Association produced a comprehensive review of studies going back three decades. The most relevant section focuses on research that compares the children of lesbian or gay parents. The studies looked at children in terms of their school performance, their relations with their peers, intelligence, self-esteem and a number of other variables. According to this review, "the belief that children of lesbian and gay parents suffer deficits in personal development has no empirical foundation." Our ruling Perkins said that based on social science, we know "that children do best with a mom and a dad." The research cited on the website of Perkins’ group, the Family Research Council, does not provide any support. It relies on books rather than peer-reviewed research, it quotes selectively or mischaracterizes from the work it cites, or at best, challenges the quality of the methodology behind findings that go against its position. In contrast, we found recent peer-reviewed social science research that finds that at the very least, children of lesbian parents do as well as other children. We rate Perkins’ claim False.

pomt-14119	"Jason Kander supports [Obama’s] plan to bring the remaining suspected terrorists to U.S. soil."	false	/missouri/statements/2016/may/09/roy-blunt/sen-blunt-misstates-opponent-jason-kanders-positio/	The race for Missouri’s U.S. senate seat is heating up between incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt and Secretary of State Jason Kander. Blunt said Kander supports President Obama’s plan to close Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. military prison in Cuba housing suspected terrorists, and transfer prisoners to mainland prisons. Blunt tweeted out a petition against the plan 11 times on his campaign account between April 18 and April 20. The petition says, "Jason Kander supports his plan to bring the remaining suspected terrorists to U.S. soil. Tell national Democrats and Jason Kander that bringing suspected terrorists to U.S. soil puts Missouri families at risk." This statement piqued our interest, because Kander made headlines in February for coming out against this plan. So we decided to look into the claim. Obama has tried to close Gitmo ever since he took office in 2009. The Missouri House passed a resolution later that year that opposed the closure. It urged Congress to "reject any act of asylum, containment, transport, imprisonment, or medical care in regard to suspected terrorists from any United States operated foreign prison present within the State of Missouri." Kander, who was serving as a state representative at the time, voted against this resolution. At the end of February of this year, the White House again released a plan for closing the detention center. Part of the plan includes transferring detainees who cannot be released in foreign countries to a U.S. prison facility. One of the proposed facilities is a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which sits a few miles from the Kansas-Missouri border. Kander released a statement opposing this plan after it was announced by the president. "Our focus right now needs to be defeating ISIS, and we can’t risk the possibility that the terrorists housed at Guantanamo could rejoin the battlefield," said Kander. "These dangerous prisoners should not be transferred to the United States, and I strongly urge President Obama to reconsider this plan." His spokesman Chris Hayden said Kander has never supported legislation on the federal level to close Gitmo and has opposed executive action. "He did not think that a non-binding resolution in the Missouri legislature was the best way to keep us safe from terrorists," Hayden said. Blunt has accused Kander of flip-flopping on the issue. Tate O’Connor, spokesperson for Blunt’s campaign said, "Jason Kander may wish to un-ring the bell, but he cannot." He said Kander is only trying to appeal to Missouri’s popular vote by opposing Obama’s plan. But Kander never officially stated his position on closing Gitmo until February. Even the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which seeks to get Republicans elected to the Senate, released a video last November saying the committee couldn’t find his stance on bringing the prisoners to the U.S. Blunt is going against the message from his fellow Republicans when he says Kander supported Obama’s plan in the past. Our Ruling Blunt says Kander supports Obama’s plan to bring the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. Kander voted against a 2009 resolution in the Missouri legislature that called on Congress to keep the facility open. But that doesn’t mean he supported Obama’s plan to close the prison. He took no official position until February, and even the National Republican Senatorial Committee said they weren’t sure where he stood before then. We rate this statement as False.

pomt-02845	Says Mark Pryor "cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/19/tom-cotton/sen-mark-pryor-cut-medicare-pay-obamacare-says-rep/	So far, PolitiFact has heard some familiar attacks in the 2014 midterm election campaign rhetoric. The latest comes from the Arkansas Senate race, where incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, faces U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican. Recently, they traded jabs over Medicare funding. "Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70," Pryor’s ad said. "Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare," Cotton’s ad shot back. We’ve addressed Pryor’s claim in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on Cotton’s assertion that the Affordable Care Act strips Medicare funding. Cotton’s office didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but we did hear from Pryor’s folks. We’re certainly no stranger to different versions of this claim. There is a connection between the Affordable Care Act and cuts to Medicare funding. Both parties have recognized a need to rein in Medicare costs, which were growing at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "Without reform, the nation’s already excessive health care spending would have reached unsustainable levels within the next few decades," the 2010 CMS report read. With the enactment of the health care law, Medicare’s growth was projected to slow to 5.3 percent, according to the same CMS report. Over time, CMS predicts this will result in a 10-year savings of more than $700 billion. The savings will come from reductions to Medicare Advantage, which represents a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. In additions, hospitals will be paid less if they don’t meet certain benchmarks for patient care. The law’s intent was to save money by making the system more efficient and without making reductions in benefits. So Obamacare doesn’t "cut" Medicare funding that already exists. Rather, it controls future spending, which politicians on both sides of the aisle called for. The cost control "is part of what Congress does to try to manage the insanely complex and expensive Medicare system," said Jay Wolfson, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. "It is not new, nor is it partisan." When Mark Pryor voted with the Senate to pass Obamacare in 2009, he wasn’t voting to cut Medicare. He was voting to slow its growth. The goal is to reallocate some of the money saved toward Obamacare’s goal of covering the currently uninsured, said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University health policy law professor. So the savings are designed to offset costs in Obamacare so that the law doesn’t increase the national deficit. Our ruling Cotton’s ad claimed that "Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare." In reality, the Affordable Care Act calls for a slowed growth of Medicare funding, not a slash to current funds. The savings from this approach will be used to offset Obamacare costs. Because the ad doesn’t make this clear, we rate Cotton’s claim Half True.

pomt-14878	"Welders make more money than philosophers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-welders-more-money-philosophers/	Florida Senator Marco Rubio is a fan of vocational training. At the Fox Business Network GOP debate in Milwaukee, Rubio made a pitch for young Americans to put down the textbooks and pick up a blowtorch. "For the life of me, I don’t know why we have stigmatized vocational training," Rubio said. "Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers." It was a big moment for Rubio, but was he correct? Philosophically and statistically speaking, no. It’s hard to know exactly how many philosophers there are in America, as many don’t have the title "philosopher" in their job descriptions. For this fact-check, we will look at those who majored in philosophy in college. According to Payscale, a company that collects salary information, philosophy majors make an average first-year salary of $42,200. The average mid-career pay for philosophy majors is even better: $85,000 per year. Additionally, the median pay for philosophy professors is nearly $90,000 per year, according to salary.com. The top 10 percent of philosophy professors make more than $190,000 a year. Rubio will be hard-pressed to find a welder who makes a comparable salary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for welders, cutters, solderers and brazers is $37,420 -- about $18 an hour. The top 10 percent of welders earn $58,590 or more. That’s significantly less than the top 10 percent of philosophy professors, who earn $190,000 or more. We haven’t heard back from the Rubio campaign yet, but it’s possible that Rubio read something along the lines of this 2014 Wall Street Journal column, which cites a few cases in which welders bring home annual salaries exceeding $150,000. While this might be the case for some extremely high-level welders -- just as some philosophy professors make significantly more money than others -- the labor and salary data suggests these cases are the exception, not the norm. Our ruling Rubio said, "Welders make more money than philosophers." It made for a great sound bite, but neither salary nor labor statistics back up Rubio’s claim. Statistically, philosophy majors make more money than welders -- with much more room to significantly increase pay throughout their careers. It’s clear that Rubio was making a pitch for more vocational training in the United States, but his claim on welders doesn't hold together. As Aristotle said, "The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold." We rate Rubio’s claim False.

pomt-01014	"Did you know under President Obama family health care premiums have increased $4,154 on the average?"	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/02/barbara-comstock/comstock-says-family-health-policies-have-increase/	"Did you know under President Obama family health care premiums have increased $4,154 on the average?" U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-10th, recently tweeted. We didn’t know that. So we gave it a look. Other claims using the same number have popped up on a number GOP websites across the country. Comstock and others say the $4,154 figure comes from an annual report on employer health benefits that was published by the Kaiser Family Foundation on Sept. 10, 2014. Kaiser’s findings were based on a survey of more than 2,000 businesses of all sizes across the nation about their health insurance costs. On Page 31 is a chart that details the average annual premiums for single and family coverage for work-based health care plans since 1999. The chart shows that in 2008, the average cost for family coverage -- shared by the company and the employee -- was $12,680. In 2014, it was $16,834. According to Comstock, that means there’s been a $4,154 increase under Obama. But there’s a problem with that computation. Obama didn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2009. Kaiser’s 2008 survey was based on responses companies gave from January to May 2008 about their health plans, some of which were contracted before the survey began. In other words, Comstock is holding Obama responsible for some premium increases that occurred during the presidency of George W. Bush. If we use the 2009 Kaiser report to start to start counting premium increases under Obama -- and even here, some of the hikes still would have occurred when Bush was president -- the bottom line drops. The average family premium was $13,375 in 2009 .The increase between then and 2014 would be $3,459. While Kaiser charts annual average premiums, it makes no attempt to attach the numbers to individual presidents. Craig Palosky, a spokesman for the non-partisan research foundation, declined to comment on Comstock’s claim or offer guidance on the political relevance of data in the report. "I’d like the survey to speak for itself," he said. Some perspective The $4,154 increase since 2008 that Comstock hangs on Obama is a big number. So is the $3,459 average increase in family premiums since 2009, when Obama took office. But these figures need context. Kaiser, in a news release last September summarizing its 2014 report, said the trend on employer-based family premiums over the last five years is good news. "Premiums increased more slowly over the past five years than the preceding five years (25 percent to 34 percent) and well below the annual double-digit increases recorded in the late 1990s and early 2000s," Kaiser wrote. Comstock, in blaming Obama for rising insurance costs, omits a key qualification: Family premiums offered by employers increased at a faster inflation-adjusted pace during the Bush years than they have under Obama. If we use 2009 as the baseline for Obama, then, as we’ve said, family average premiums rose from $13,375 to $16,834 in 2014. That’s an increase of $3,459. Adjusted for inflation, the price went up 10.3 percent. Looking back over the last six full years of the Bush administration, average family premiums rose from $9,068 in 2003 to $12,680 in 2008. That was an increase of $3,612. Adjusted for inflation, the price went up 19.5 percent. The Kaiser survey, while offering a universe of statistics on employer-based insurance, contains little explanation of trends. Kaiser doesn’t offer an opinion whether the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, is playing a major role in the slowing of family premiums. The report notes that a major feature of the ACA -- a mandate requiring companies with 50 or more full time employees to offer health insurance or pay a federal fine -- is starting to kick in this year. We spoke to two health care experts and they both largely attributed the slowed rise in premiums to the nation’s slow recovery from the Great Recession. "To some degree, inflation has abated and so has medical inflation," said Paul Fronstin, a senior analyst with the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. Another reason for the slowed premium growth, they said, is that employees are paying a greater share of their health care costs through out-of-pocket deductibles for doctor appointments and hospital stays. Our ruling "Did you know under President Obama family health care premiums have increased $4,154 on the average?" Comstock tweeted. She attributed her figure to the Kaiser Foundation’s 2014 survey on employer-based health insurance policies. First, the number is dubious. Kaiser doesn’t t assign statistics in its report to any president. To get to $4,154, Comstock uses Kaiser’s 2008 survey as the base year for Obama. That means she’s blaming Obama for some premiums that went into effect a year or more before he was inaugurated. If we use 2009 as the base year -- when Obama took office -- the increase is $3,459 and even this average would include some policies that were contracted before his presidency began. Second, Comstock’s charge lacks context. By just throwing out a number, the congresswoman suggests the premiums are spiraling. In fact, Kaiser says the rate of increase in the cost of employer-based family policies has slowed during the last five years. We rate Comstock’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-11582	"Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants.' "	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/01/breitbart/following-joe-kennedys-speech-breitbart-says-fall-/	In his Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III talked about the immigrant roots of a city in his Boston-area district. "We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts, a proud American city," Kennedy said, speaking from a vocational technical high school. "An American city built by immigrants." Breitbart, a conservative website formerly run by Steve Bannon who served as Trump’s strategist, fired back at Kennedy’s description of the city. "No, Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants,' " stated the headline. "Fact-Check: Mostly False." We decided to do a fact-check of our own of Breitbart’s claim. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found the Breitbart story glosses over the role of immigrants in the city’s history. As evidence, Breitbart wrote that Fall River was established in the 1600s by English settlers "who were not ‘immigrants’ but colonists." Breitbart wrote that a native-born family, the Bordens, ran a mill in what became the town before and after the American Revolutionary War. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Breitbart said that immigrants arrived at the end of the 19th century. Breitbart has a point that English settlers arrived before other immigrant groups, but when the town truly took off due to the textile mills, it was waves of immigrant labor that fueled the growth. We interviewed Bridgewater State University professor Philip Silvia who wrote his dissertation on local history, The Spindle City: Labor, Politics and Religion in Fall River (1870-1905). Silvia has taught courses on Fall River’s immigrant and labor history. Fall River was settled by English immigrants in the 1600s when few people lived in the area, Silvia said. But ultimately, "it attracted immigrants like no other place," Silvia said. Fall River became prominent in the 19th century when textile factories were constructed. The mills drew various waves of immigrants from different nationalities, including the English and the Irish. Fall River incorporated as a town in 1803 and as a city in 1854. The real surge occurred after the Civil War when Fall River became the pre-eminent textile city in the United States, fueling a massive influx of immigrant workers. A gigantic wave came from French Canada, the largest immigrant group for decades. "Technically one could argue it wasn’t immigrants supplying the capital who built the mills, but without workers, the mills would not have succeeded as they did," Silvia said. Breitbart pointed to immigrant statistics in 1910 and wrote that immigrants "never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak." But Silvia, who wrote his dissertation on the topic, said that by 1875, more than half of the population was foreign born. By the 1870s, three-quarters of the mill population were immigrants and that population climbed even higher. Eventually immigrants included those who were Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Jewish and Scottish. Later waves came from Vietnam and Cambodia. Around 1900, there were 18 ethnic groups in the city. "It is an immigrant city," he said. Kennedy’s spokesman pointed to an article by the local newspaper that covers Fall River, The Herald News, documenting visible signs around the city that show its immigrant history. "From the Fabergé egg-shaped bell towers of St. Anne’s Church to the Portuguese bakeries that line Columbia Street, Fall River would not be Fall River without its immigrants...," stated the newspaper following Breitbart’s article about Kennedy’s speech. "Fall River’s notable churches and many of its landmarks were built by the people who began arriving on its streets in the mid-19th century from Ireland, Canada, Italy, Lebanon, Poland and Portugal, and in recent years from Brazil, Syria, Haiti, Cambodia and elsewhere." As of 2016, about 18 percent of the city’s population of 90,000 is foreign born, according to the U.S. Census. We attempted to reach Breitbart and did not get a reply. Breitbart wrote that, "Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants.' " English settlers first established Fall River in the 1600s when it was sparsely populated. But Breitbart gives short shrift to the role waves of immigrants played in growing the community as it turned into a prominent textile city in the 1800s. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02656	"If you have a job in this country, (there's a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/14/steve-southerland/rep-steve-southerland-r-fla-says-97-percent-those-/	Five decades after President Lyndon B. Johnson launched the War on Poverty, Fox News Sunday invited Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., among others, to discuss the anniversary. Host John Roberts asked Southerland about ending current programs and moving to a system of block grants: "You said, looking back on Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, it has failed and failed miserably. Do you keep putting more money into existing programs or do you -- as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested earlier this week -- fundamentally reform everything, (taking) a big pot of money that the federal government has and (giving) that to the states to administer in innovative ways?" Southerland responded, "I think you have to look at the indicators -- the fundamentals of these programs. Look what causes poverty. We know that two-parent families (are) a child's greatest opportunity to avoid poverty. We know that a good quality education with daily parent involvement … reduces poverty. … If you have a job in this country, (there’s a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty. And so, therefore, I think there's a better way." Several readers asked us to check Southerland’s claim that if you have a job, there’s a "97 percent chance" that you're not going to be in poverty. We found Census Bureau data from 2012 that supports his claim. The Census Bureau found that 2.9 percent of Americans between 18 and 64 who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 were in poverty. However, we’ll note a caveat. Southerland said "if you have a job" -- and there are people in the United States who have jobs, but not full-time, full-year jobs. Among Americans age 18 to 64 who have part-time jobs, the poverty rate is 16.6 percent. And among all workers -- Americans who have either a full- or a part-time job -- the rate is 7.3 percent. So a more accurate number for the likelihood of poverty "if you have a job" is 92.7 percent, or, rounding up, 93 percent. That’s very close to 97 percent, but slightly off. "While the percentages may vary slightly from one year to the next, independent sources make clear that your chances of living in poverty increase more than ten-fold if you don’t have a steady, full-time job," said Matt McCullough, a spokesman for Southerland. A final point: The census figures show that nearly 2.9 million people worked full time for the whole year yet still ended up below the poverty line. That may only be 2.9 percent of all full-time workers, but it’s still a whole lot of people working, yet still ending up below the poverty line. Our ruling Southerland said, "If you have a job in this country, (there's a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty." That’s true only for full-time jobs. If you include both full-time jobs and part-time jobs, then the percentage drops slightly, to 93 percent. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02211	"Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013. Thanks Chief Fernandez!"	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/22/broward-county-police-benevolent-association/hollywood-had-more-homicides-any-other-city-browar/	The police union in Hollywood has launched a high-profile battle in an effort to oust Chief Frank Fernandez, and they have literally taken their message to the sky. In March, the Police Benevolent Association floated a banner from an airplane that flew over the beach and downtown that declared, "Hollywood a high crime area. Thanks Chief Fernandez!" Then on April 15, the PBA posted a billboard on Pembroke Road that stated: "Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013. Thanks Chief Fernandez!" We decided to investigate whether the homicide statistic is accurate and if Fernandez can be blamed for it. Hollywood police department battles To understand the backdrop of the billboard requires a bit of history about the years of feuds between city officials and police union leaders in this city of 145,000. In 2011, the city declared financial urgency and cut officers’ pay, which led to protests from the union and officer turnover. Fernandez became the city’s assistant city manager overseeing public safety in 2012 and chief in 2013, and he’s been tasked with trying to turn around the long-troubled department. Though Hollywood has a popular beach front that draws tourists and snowbirds, it’s also had some famous scandals in recent years. In 2007, a handful of officers convicted in a scheme that included selling heroin to undercover agents posing as mobsters. (The chief at the time was accused of leaking information about the probe before the arrests, forcing the FBI to bring it to a close prematurely.) A separate group of officers drew national attention in 2009 after one of them crashed into a vehicle, and video captured employees saying they would "do a little Walt Disney" to protect the officer and doctor a police report. News reports in the Sun-Sentinel indicate Fernandez has had some success: He has increased recruiting, made physical improvements to the police station and brought a close to contract negotiations. Fernandez also brought in outside consultants to audit the agency, and they found problems with its use-of-force policy, missing internal affairs files and forgotten rape kits, the Sun-Sentinel reported. The union disputes the audit and says it was written by a hired consultant tasked with finding fault. The billboard is the latest round in the battle between the police union and city leaders who say it’s just another ploy. Hollywood crime statistics Jeff Marano, president of the police union, sent us Hollywood crime statistics from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The data showed homicides in the city rose from five in 2012 to 16 in 2013. A spokeswoman for the city didn’t dispute the numbers but said they come with some caveats. First, the homicides were either drug- or gang-related or domestics, Raelin Storey said. "There were not random acts of murder taking place in the city of Hollywood," she said. The reasons behind the homicides aren’t the point, Marano said. "A homicide is a homicide," he said. "It’s a dead person." Assessing whether the number of homicides placed Hollywood in the No. 1 slot in Broward was more complicated because statewide data for 2013 hasn’t been published yet. (Marano said he determined Hollywood was the highest by speaking with a Hollywood homicide detective who speaks with his counterparts at other departments.) So we decided to do our own research and contact law enforcement agencies in Broward County to ask them to supply the number of homicides in their city in 2013. We mostly focused our search on the larger cities or the ones that had more than five homicides in 2012. The results: Hollywood: 16 Fort Lauderdale: 13 Pompano Beach: 8 Lauderhill: 6 Lauderdale Lakes: 5 Oakland Park: 5 Miramar: 4 Pembroke Pines: 0 We did not find any city that had a higher number of homicides than Hollywood in Broward. Not surprisingly, the city pointed to statistics that give residents a more favorable impression of safety in their city. The data from FDLE showed other serious offenses, which include sexual assaults, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and larceny and motor vehicle thefts. In total, those offenses dropped 13 percent in Hollywood in 2013. FDLE data showed that the crime rate dropped from 5,869 in 2012 to 5,050.9 in 2013. Experts pick apart union’s billboard We sent the union’s statement and the city’s recent murder statistics to a few criminologists. Several experts told us that when examining small numbers from one year to the next, a jump can appear significant even when it’s not. To draw meaningful conclusions requires looking at several years of data and examining the nature of the homicides. "Homicides are rare events in Hollywood, and as such the rates can bounce around quite a bit," said James Lynch, chair of the criminology department at the University of Maryland and former director of the federal government’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. We asked Marano to explain why the union pinned the number of homicides on the chief. Marano cited the chief’s "poor leadership" and deployment of officers, specifically "not enough officers assigned to street level crimes." But the experts we interviewed rejected the idea that the chief was to blame for the number of murders in one year. "Let’s assume the facts are correct," said Robert Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at Georgia State University. "So does that mean blame chief for it? Unless the chief is the one who shoots the people, I would say absolutely not." While there are steps police departments can take in an effort to reduce crime, there are several factors -- including neighborhood and economic conditions and drug and gang activity -- that influence the number of murders in a city in a given year. Those conditions are entirely or largely out of the control of the police, said Ronald L. Akers, a criminology professor at the University of Florida. "We like to attribute declines in crime rates in a community to good police work, but there is not strong evidence to support that," Akers said. "Similarly, one may want to attribute increases in crime to bad police work or an ineffective police department, but again, where is the evidence to support that? What have the police done any differently in 2013? What if the number of murders come down again in 2014?" Our ruling The police union’s billboard states, "Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013. Thanks Chief Fernandez!" Hollywood had 16 homicides in 2013, and we could not find any city that had any more homicides than Hollywood. While the number is correct, the union cherry-picked crime statistics to find one that puts the city in the worst light. At this point, we have no idea if the number is part of a trend or an aberration. We also know that overall, crime decreased. The billboard places the blame on Chief Fernandez, but criminologists say the chief can’t be blamed for the number of murders, especially when it is such a small number. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06456	"Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular, that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-hits-obama-administration-ending-/	Michele Bachmann continued to make the case against the health care law supported by President Barack Obama and most Democrats during the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2011. "Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function," Bachmann said. "Secretary (Kathleen) Sebelius, who is the head of Health and Human Services, reported that the government can't even afford that part and has to throw it out. And now the administration is arguing with itself," she added. "When even the Obama administration wants to repeal this bill, I think we're going to win this thing. We're going to repeal it! And I will!" Here, we’re fact-checking Bachmann’s statement, "Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular, that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function." Bachmann gets a few things right here, but she also gives a misleading impression that the overall law’s popularity prompted the administration’s decision. But first let’s start with what the CLASS Act does. The problem the CLASS Act tries to address is how to pay for either nursing home care or in-home care for people who are functionally limited but do not require hospitalization. Right now, Medicare -- the health insurance program for Americans over age 65 -- usually does not pay for long-term nursing home care, and families can struggle to find appropriate help. The acronym stands for Community Living Assistance Services and Supports, and it was created as part of the health care law. It was intended as a stand-alone government-run program to help defray the cost of long-term care. In some ways, the program was intended to act like a traditional insurance program -- the insured people pay premiums and then draw the benefits only if they need them. (If you have the appetite for it, read this detailed analysis on the differences between CLASS and traditional long-term care insurance.) The late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., championed the program for years, and it was through his efforts that the program was attached to the health care law. But the CLASS program looks to have fizzled. As Bachmann stated, on Oct. 14, 2011, U.S.Secretary of Health Human Services Kathleen Sebelius announced the program was not going forward, because it could not meet a legal requirement that the program be self-sustaining. (The insurance industry's term for this is "actuarially sound.") "For 19 months, experts inside and outside of government have examined how HHS might implement a financially sustainable, voluntary, and self-financed long-term care insurance program under the law that meets the needs of those seeking protection for the near term and those planning for the future," Sebelius wrote in a letter to Congress. "The work has been groundbreaking in many ways and has taught us a great deal ... But despite our best analytical efforts, I do not see a viable path forward for CLASS implementation at this time." The problem that the program ran into was that people wouldn't join the program unless they were likely to need benefits, which meant costs would have exceeded contributions, said Richard Kaplan, an expert on elder law at the University of Illinois who has studied the CLASS program. "This was only going to appeal to people who were extraordinarily risk averse or who were already ill," he said. The requirement that the program pay for itself was actually an amendment put into the law by then-Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. Gregg is now an adviser to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, but he gave an interview on the end of the CLASS Act to the Washington Post's Sarah Kliff on Oct. 18. "I didn’t like the idea of setting up the program. But with this, it was either going to have to work or come down as a result of the amendment," Gregg said. As for the Obama administration ending the program, "I don’t think they really had a choice in the matter," Gregg said. And indeed, all the other sources we consulted indicated the administration had to stop the CLASS program because it could not meet its legal requirements. Bachmann is wrong when she suggests the Obama administration voluntarily ended the program in the face of negative public opinion about the overall health law. Which brings us to another point -- the CLASS program is not an integral part of the health care law, as some might think upon hearing Bachmann's comments. Most of the health care law has to do with expanding the coverage of traditional health care insurance. The CLASS program was intended to stand as a totally separate program only designed to help with long-term care. Even if the CLASS program ends, the rest of the health care law still stands. Even Gregg agreed this was the case, telling the Post, "This was not a core element of the overall bill. It was put in as a courtesy to Sen. Kennedy. I do happen to think the overall bill is going to massively fail on the fiscal side and probably fail on the substantive side too. But you can separate off the CLASS Act as not having an effect on the underlying bill, even though the underlying bill will also fail." Finally, Bachmann said the Obama administration is "arguing with itself" about whether the CLASS Act should be formally repealed. Actually, the Obama administration has said that the law should be left on the books, calling a formal repeal unnecessary and unproductive. The law’s advocates say it should be left so it can be modified at some future time. That position has drawn scorn from Republican leadership. "It defies logic for the White House to admit this part of their health spending bill would put an unsustainable burden on taxpayers, yet demand it stay on the books," said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, in comments to the Associated Press. Our ruling Bachmann said, "Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular, that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function." She's right that the Obama administration announced the program was ending. But the Obama administration is being forced to scuttle the program because it can't meet the cost requirements the law sets out. It's not because the administration's support is folding in the face of unpopularity. Bachmann messes up so many of the details as to significantly misrepresent the situation.

pomt-13838	Says Ron Johnson "supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age" for Social Security.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/13/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/state-democrats-say-ron-johnson-supported-plan-cut/	Social Security is a perennial campaign issue. And so it is with the 2016 U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, a rematch between Republican incumbent Ron Johnson and the man he defeated in 2010, Democrat Russ Feingold. The Wisconsin Democratic Party targeted Johnson on the issue with a radio ad released May 4, 2016. A few moments into the spot, the narrator says: "As senator, Johnson’s been working hard to undermine Social Security. He supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age. Johnson even said it’s a shame that George Bush wasn’t able to privatize Social Security. And he didn’t stop there. Johnson went after Medicare, voting to turn it into a voucher program." We rated Mostly True the Medicare-voucher claim, as Johnson backed plans advanced by fellow Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, who is now the House speaker. Under those plans, Medicare would no longer pay fees to health care providers -- instead, Medicare beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy to use toward their health care. Now let’s see whether Johnson has supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age for Social Security. Democratic Party’s evidence To back its claim, the Democratic Party cited Johnson’s support for two proposals -- one by Ryan and one by U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Both were broad proposals, not specific strictly to Social Security. Ryan’s 2010 "Roadmap" proposal called for what the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described as "a wholesale rethinking" of Social Security, as well as Medicare and federal taxes. On Social Security, it would have reduced some benefits and raised the retirement age. But based on two statements cited by the Democratic Party, Johnson didn’t express support for the Social Security changes, or for the Roadmap overall, rather he merely praised Ryan. Johnson said he "applauds" Ryan "for putting forth a plan in good faith to begin the conversation on entitlement reform" and he said Ryan showed "courage" by advancing proposals such as the Roadmap. Lee made a proposal in 2012 that included provisions to reduce the size of cost-of-living increases and raise the retirement age for Social Security. Johnson was among 17 senators who voted for it. But it was a federal budget proposal, covering a vast number of programs and proposals, not just Social Security. So, voting for the budget wasn’t necessarily showing support for every element it contained. Johnson has said he is open to considering various options for shoring up Social Security, including cutting benefits and raising the retirement age. And he has pointed out, without necessarily endorsing the idea, that raising the retirement age would save money. But that isn’t the same as supporting a proposal to make those changes. What’s going on here, of course, is an age-old political exercise -- one side resists committing to a specific plan, while the other tries to pin as many unfavorable details on the other as possible. We are left to sort it out based on what is on the record and the facts known now, not on speculation about what a future vote might involve. Our rating The state Democratic Party says Johnson "supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age" for Social Security. The party could not cite and we couldn’t find any proposal to make those changes that was supported by Johnson. Indeed, such a standalone proposal would have made major news. Johnson has said he is open to considering such proposals and he voted for a federal budget proposal that contained them. But voting for a federal budget proposal and its myriad programs isn’t an explicit show of support for cutting benefits and raising the retirement age for Social Security. For a statement that contains an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1c82fcd0-22a2-4862-91b9-823b934a4ade	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2016-07-13T05:00:00	2016-05-04	['None']

pomt-11414	Says Rebecca Dallet "has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/21/michael-screnock/has-rebecca-dallet-candidate-backed-liberals-supre/	In a televised debate from Milwaukee between the two remaining Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates, Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, who is backed by conservatives, attacked Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is backed by liberals. In the March 2, 2018 debate, a month ahead of the April 3, 2018 election, Screnock charged that Dallet "has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives." We found in a previous fact check that Dallet had not been as partisan as Madison attorney Tim Burns, who was eliminated in the primary election. But while Dallet generally sticks to stating her "values" on key issues, there have been instances where she’s gone further. Values vs positions For this fact check, we’re reviewing eight statements made by Dallet. Regarding the first six, Dallet campaign manager Jessica Lovejoy told us Dallet "has not shied away from talking about her common Wisconsin values of equality, fairness, clean air and water, and good schools. She does not advocate for specific policies to advance these values." As we’ll see, in the first three statements, Dallet singled out mass incarceration, the environment and fighting "right-wing special interests" as issues that she said need to be addressed, though she didn’t advocate for specific policies. 1. I’m not going to apologize for standing up for safer communities and for victims. And I think that we can do that while also trying to address racial injustice and the problem of mass incarceration. 2. Just look at our president and you have to worry about equal protection under the law. Women are under attack. We have to protect our environment. 3. I believe we (Burns and her) share many of the same values, and I hope that we can unite Wisconsinites to fight against right-wing special interests and make our state Supreme Court work for the people again. But in the next three statements in which Dallet talked about her values, she went further. Dallet talked about not making it more difficult to vote, alluding to the debate over whether Wisconsin’s photo ID law makes it more difficult to vote; she attacked the National Rifle Association, which is known for its activism to protect gun-owner rights; and she flatly stated that sales of a particular gun should be outlawed. 4. I believe in clean air and water, I believe in our public education system and I believe in working people. I think we need to ensure we increase participation in our voting system, not decrease it. I think we need to address racial and gender inequality head on, not sweep the vestiges of a racist and patriarchal system under the rug. 5. That’s why I took the #NoNRAMoney pledge. I will not accept money from an organization that puts profits above the lives of Americans. Will you join me today in pledging that we won’t vote for any candidate who takes NRA money? nonramoney.org/voter-pledge #NRABoycott 6. Why do you need that rifle that was used in that (Parkland, Fla.) school shooting? What was it, an AR-15? Who ever needs to fire off that many rounds in a minute? There is no reason for that gun. There is no basis for it. It’s not a gun that should be sold in the United States. I mean, let’s talk about reasonable gun control …. I’m not going to write that law, that’s going to be our legislatures. But we should all -- I mean, I’m a citizen just like everyone else -- we should all write our legislatures, tell them how we think and let them write those laws. Recusal rule On the remaining two statements, Lovejoy told us that when Dallet speaks about changing policy, "she's referencing the need to update the Supreme Court recusal policy that currently allows sitting justices," such as retiring Justice Michael Gableman, "to remain on cases where a party spent significantly on their behalf in their election." Here are those Dallet statements: 7. It is the time for women. It’s a time for making sure we stand up and our rights are protected. And experience matters to get the policies we want to move forward and to protect our rights. That statement was made during the concluding remarks of a campaign appearance. Dallet had begun her remarks talking about her experience as a prosecutor and judge, then she talked at length about the importance of the recusal rule, and then she spoke about the experience Screnock and Burns have, before concluding. It could be argued that in making the "policies we want" statement, Dallet was echoing her remarks about recusals rather than making a general statement about the need "get the policies we want." But in the final statement, from a radio interview, it’s harder to see the argument that Dallet was referring to recusals. 8. All of the values that I talked about -- clean air and water, and equal protection, and women -- are under attack. And, this is something we all feel and we all relate to. And I'm the candidate that is going to be able to protect those values at this critical time, and there is just too much at stake right now to have someone without the experience needed to advocate for the policies that need to be changed and to make sure to protect those values. Dallet had been asked earlier in the interview about recusals. But she made the statement we cite when asked about about why she featured criticism of President Donald Trump in her first TV campaign ad. Our rating Screnock says Dallet "has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives." Dallet frequently says she is merely stating her values, such as equal rights or clean air and water, and often she singles out those issues without advocating for a particular policy position. But on some occasions she has gone beyond that. For example, after citing clean air and water, and equal protection as her values, she pledged to "advocate for the policies that need to be changed." And she has advocated for addressing "mass" incarceration; increasing voter participation and not allowing the sale of AR-15 guns. We rate Screnock statement’s Mostly True.

pomt-12413	"It was a 100 percent lie that (Donald Trump’s) election unleashed anti-Semitism. … Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/22/dennis-prager/were-two-people-responsible-virtually-all-anti-sem/	A segment hosted by CNN’s Don Lemon on May 18, 2017, got a little heated. Lemon and one of his guests, conservative radio host Dennis Prager, sparred over an apparent increase in anti-Semitic incidents after the 2016 presidential election, and who was to blame. Prager said there was no rise in anti-Semitic incidents, and the incidents that did occur didn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump. "It was a 100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism," Prager said. "Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend." Is he correct? We found that Prager has a point about the bomb threats to Jewish community centers largely being the work of two suspects who have since been arrested. However, there is evidence that the number of anti-Semitic incidents other than bomb threats did increase after the election. (Prager did not respond to email inquiries.) The suspects To date, the FBI announced two arrests related to the bomb threats. (We should note that the two individuals cited below have not been tried yet.) The first came on March 3, when the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York announced a charge of cyberstalking against a St. Louis man, Juan Thompson. Thompson was charged with "allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the Anti-Defamation League." The Justice Department said that Thompson appeared to have made "at least eight of the JCC threats as part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate" his victim. Prager was wrong that Thompson tried to impress a girlfriend; he is charged with trying to implicate an ex-girlfriend in crimes she didn’t commit. As for calling him a "black radical," that’s a somewhat subjective. The Riverfront Times, a St. Louis newspaper, said that as a black journalist, Thompson had filed "searing dispatches about injustices in Baltimore, Mississippi and Chicago. He relished the opportunity to strike back at what he calls an ‘oppressive, anti-black, racial supremacist, capitalist system’ that kneecaps all but the country's rich and white in the pursuit of basic civil rights and opportunities." Then, on April 21, the Justice Department announced that charges had been filed against Michael Ron David Kadar, an 18-year-old resident of Israel with dual citizenship in the United States and Israel. The charges in question were for making telephone bomb threats against Jewish facilities in central Florida and for providing false information to police in Georgia. Then-FBI director James Comey said in a statement that "this kind of behavior is not a prank, and it isn't harmless. It’s a federal crime. It scares innocent people, disrupts entire communities, and expends limited law enforcement resources." So Prager’s on target when he cites Thompson and Kadar as the two individuals charged so far with making Jewish community center bomb threats. The bomb threats Somewhat less certain is the total number of threats called in to Jewish community centers. As we noted, officials have tied Thompson to eight calls. Meanwhile, the criminal complaint against Kadar alleged that between Jan. 4 and March 7, Kadar made "at least 245 telephone calls involving bomb threats and active shooter threats. A significant portion of the threats targeted Jewish community centers and other historically Jewish institutions such as Jewish schools and Anti-Defamation League offices." The FBI declined to comment further to PolitiFact, citing the ongoing investigation. So the exact number of threats the two individuals made -- once duplicate calls and calls made to non-Jewish targets are set aside -- is hard to nail down. However, the number of calls they made appears to be in the ballpark of the number of reported bomb threats. It’s not certain that threats numbered in the "hundreds," as Prager said, but if not, they weren’t far off. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that tracks hate crimes, has tracked upwards of 170 such threats made internationally and domestically. And the Anti-Defamation League -- another group that tracks hate crimes, and which was a target of a number of the calls in question -- has identified 167 such threats in the United States in Canada. (The ADL’s tally did not count other countries, as the SPLC did.) Given this data, Prager has a point that most of the bomb threats are traceable to the two individuals who have been charged so far, and he’s also correct that Kadar has been charged with making many more than Thompson. Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said that there are probably a modest number of bomb threats not traceable to either of these two suspects. "The two individuals that Prager mentioned accounted for the vast majority of the bomb threats, but not all of them," Tuchman said. That said, Tuchman added one further piece of evidence that Thompson and Kadar account for the vast bulk of threats: "Thankfully, there have been no further bomb threats recently," he said. Anti-Semitic incidents more broadly But if Prager has described the situation with the Jewish community center bomb threats with reasonable accuracy, he has engaged in a bit of cherry-picking by ignoring other signs of increased anti-Semitism after the election. "Even if the bomb threats are discounted, we still saw an increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the first quarter of 2017," Tuchman said. "Not including the bomb threats, there were 380 total incidents in the first quarter of 2017, up from 291 incidents in the first quarter of 2016. That’s an increase of 31 percent." Incidents in 2016 cited by ADL include instances of harassment (such as voice mails or social media attacks), vandalism (such as graffiti) and assault (including one incident in which two shots were fired at a victim’s vehicle). Tuchman added that the number of incidents in December 2016 were almost 70 percent higher than the number of incidents in December 2015. Tuchman cautioned that ADL "believes that the presidential campaign was a factor in the increase in anti-Semitic incidents, but only one factor." But even if the election was only one factor among many, the rise in anti-Semitic incidents overall call into question Prager’s assertion that it’s a "100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism." Our ruling Prager said, "It was a 100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism. … Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend." He’s close to the mark in describing the overwhelming role of two suspects in making bomb threats against Jewish targets earlier this year. However, Prager ignores a documented rise in anti-Semitic incidents beyond bomb threats. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-14073	"Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/may/19/vote-no-2/medical-marijuana-dispensaries-will-outnumber-walm/	Opponents of Florida’s medical marijuana amendment have fired up a new round of attacks, claiming there will be a dispensary on practically every corner if voters approve the initiative. In a three-minute ad released May 16, 2016, the group Vote No On 2 calls Amendment 2 "a scam to legalize pot." Should the measure pass, they say, it’s likely that places to buy medical marijuana will outnumber two well-known retail outlets. "Looks like Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined," the video says. It goes on to deride California medical marijuana regulations and users, and implies Florida would become like the Golden State if the measure passes. While polls say medical marijuana is enjoying about 80 percent support among voters, Vote No On 2’s figures spark an interesting point. Would the number of medical marijuana dispensaries outnumber Walmarts and Walgreens locations in Florida? That's possible, according to one state estimate, but the figures are a little hazy. Dispensary data Amendment 2 was first on the ballot in 2014 but narrowly lost the 60 percent required to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, altered the language to address some concerns that hounded the 2014 amendment. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis "or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated," with a doctor’s recommendation. It works like this: If a patient with one of these conditions gets the okay from a doctor, they (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card and be able to go to a state-regulated dispensary to buy their marijuana. Doctors technically can’t prescribe marijuana because it is still a Schedule I drug under federal law, meaning it’s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits, and is therefore illegal. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine. Pharmacies also can’t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. So how many dispensaries would there be? The proposed amendment leaves the details of medical marijuana regulations up to the Legislature and the Florida Health Department. Legislators would need to pass a bill for medical marijuana and the health department would develop and enforce regulations. In essence, there could be as few or as many dispensaries as the state wants. There’s only one estimate for how many patients and dispensaries there would be — a 2015 health department analysis. That report used Florida Department of Economic and Demographic Research data to estimate 440,552 patients in Florida would qualify for medical cannabis. The amendment would lead to 1,993 registered treatment centers, the health department said. That’s the figure Vote No On 2 is using in its ad. United for Care doesn’t dispute the figures, because the health department’s analysis is the only study that’s been done. "It’s the best educated guess that we have," United for Care director Ben Pollara said. "It’s up to the Department of Health and the Legislature. … It could be 2,000, it could be 20. It could be 5,000." In any event, 1,993 dispensaries would outnumber all the Walmarts and Walgreens in Florida. Vote No On 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson said the group chose those businesses to illustrate how ubiquitous dispensaries would be should the amendment pass. The video correctly shows 840 Walgreens drug stores in the state, but includes 191 Walmarts, a figure apparently derived from a January 2007 list from Reclaim Democracy, a group seeking limits on corporate influence in government. A more recent list from Walmart shows 223 supercenters and 10 discount stores. (Neighborhood Markets and Sam’s Club stores are not included in either count.) While Walmart and Walgreens do have pharmacies, we’re not convinced pitting small medical cannabis dispensaries against big chain retailers is a fair comparison. It may be better to compare so-called "pot shops" to the overall number of pharmacies. The state health department told us there are 9,725 licensed pharmacies in Florida. To provide more context for the dispensary estimate, we will note that the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation says Florida has 2,082 active licensed veterinary clinics — and 1,893 package liquor stores. Mile-high estimate With so little spelled out in the proposed amendment, we wondered how the health department arrived at its estimate of 1,993 dispensaries. The health department told us they used Colorado, with about 5.3 million people, for the analysis because the state has allowed medical cannabis for years and has a broad baseline of data. The report says there are 515 licensed medical marijuana centers as of October 2015 (there are 528 now, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue) serving almost 114,000 patients. Analysts then scaled that up to Florida’s population of 20 million. Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies and the pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project, said of the 24 states and the District of Columbia allowing medical marijuana, it’s misleading to use either Colorado or California as examples for Florida. Not only did Colorado decriminalize recreational marijuana use in 2012 — its 421 retail shops are counted separately from medical dispensaries — but both states lacked the kind of initial regulatory oversight Amendment 2 would require. "California dispensaries still have no state licensing or regulation to speak of, though a regulatory and licensing law should be phased in by 2018," O’Keefe said in an email. "In Colorado, regulations went into effect in 2010-11, but hundreds of dispensaries pre-dated them." A better state to look to would be New Mexico, O’Keefe said, because it required a licensing program in its law when it passed. New Mexico had 23 dispensaries for its 2 million residents, and expanded that to 35 in 2015. Extrapolating Florida’s total based on New Mexico’s regulations would net far fewer dispensaries, O’Keefe said. If it were based on total land area, Florida could limit the number to about 16. If there were the same number of dispensaries per capita as New Mexico, there could be about 340. "I really can’t say how many are likely, since it will depend on many factors, with the primary one being regulations. But I would bet it’s far less than 2,000," O’Keefe said. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, "Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined." The state health department did project 1,993 medical marijuana dispensaries would be needed to serve potential patients, based on data from Colorado compared with Florida. That is more than the 840 Walgreens and 233 Walmart supercenters and discount stores in the state, although the comparison seems like a bit of a red herring. It’s important to remember that while the health department report is the only real estimate available, this figure isn’t definite. The agency and the Legislature would decide the actual number of stores and how they are regulated after the amendment passes. That total is anyone’s guess. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy in November 2013, but Senate Republicans blocked his confirmation the following spring because of alleged anti-gun leanings. The National Rifle Association, which scores policymakers’ records on gun rights, announced that it would ding senators who voted for Murthy. CNN’s Candy Crowley pushed back on Cruz’s assertion, noting that Murthy is a doctor. Cruz acknowledged that, but repeated his original point: "He is a doctor, but where he’s made his name is as a crusader against Second Amendment rights." It’s up for debate how much of an impact the surgeon general would have in the current Ebola situation. But it’s bogus for Cruz to imply that Murthy -- a graduate of Yale School of Medicine -- is not primarily a health professional. It’s also a bit of a stretch to call Murthy an "anti-gun activist." A career in public health Here are some of Murthy’s credentials as a health professional: Received his doctor of medicine degree in 2003 from the Yale School of Medicine; Is a physician and Harvard Medical School instructor at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, one of the best hospitals in the country; Has contributed to vaccine development and cancer research published in several medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, Science, and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute; Co-founded TrialNetworks, which provides medical researchers with information technology systems for managing clinical trials; Member of the U.S. Presidential Advisory Council on Prevention, Health Promotion and Integrative and Public Health. Also of note: As a student, Murthy co-founded two India-based public health projects, one while as an undergraduate at Harvard University and the other while at Yale. The first focused on AIDS prevention, and the latter trained women in rural areas to address community health issues. Political leanings Where Murthy starts to get in hot water with Republicans is with Doctors for America, which he founded and currently heads. Doctors for America is a pro-Affordable Care Act health care reform advocacy group. They started out in 2008 as Doctors for Obama, an arm of the Obama presidential campaign. Doctors for America’s primary cause is health care reform and expanding access to medical services. However, the group also considers gun violence a public health problem, and they have pushed gun control legislation. At a 2013 conference, they held a reducing gun violence workshop. Of particular concern for the NRA is a letter Doctors for America sent to Congress Jan. 14, 2013, following the Sandy Hook school shooting. Murthy’s signature is on the letter. The letter lays out several policy suggestions, including a ban on assault weapon sales, instituting universal background checks and removing laws that prohibit doctors from asking patients if they own a gun -- similar to other Doctors for America proposals. These policy proposals are relatively mainstream and expected from someone who is a political ally to the president. They are also similar to policies supported by other medical associations, such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But the NRA has painted the Doctors for America policy proposals as radical. The NRA and Senate Republicans also made hay with Murthy’s Twitter. In 2012 and 2013, he tweeted occasionally about gun violence -- expressing plainly that he believes in more gun control and that he considers it a health care issue. But does this mean he’d be an advocate for gun control as surgeon general? When we asked Cruz's office for comment, spokesperson Catherine Frazier told us this: "It is wrong to cherry-pick one line out of context from the argument that Sen. Cruz was making, which is that the president’s nominee is no mere health professional, he is a liberal activist that has indicated he would use his position to further a gun control agenda. Both Republicans and Democrats have voiced concern over the nomination." In Murthy’s opening statement at his surgeon general confirmation hearing, though, he listed other public health issues as priorities -- including obesity (his stated primary cause), vaccine-preventable diseases and tobacco use. He did not mention gun control. Later in the hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., read aloud one of Murthy’s tweets. In response, Murthy said he would not use the surgeon general role as a "bully pulpit for gun control." He added: "The role is not to be a legislator or a judge. The role is to be a public health educator and to bring the country together around our most pressing health care challenges, and I believe at this point that obesity is the defining public health challenge of our time. That is where I intend to put my primary focus." Our ruling Cruz said, "President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist." Murthy has a long list of credentials showing he is a health professional, including his position as an attending physician at a leading hospital. Murthy runs a health care reform organization that has pushed for gun control measures, and he has expressed personal support for gun control. But enacting gun control is not Murthy’s main cause and not part of his public surgeon general platform. It’s no secret that Murthy is a political ally for Obama and backs his positions on gun control. But it's inaccurate to say he's an anti-gun activist but not a health care professional. We rate Cruz’s claim False. Update, Oct. 24, 2014: After we published this item, Frazier, Cruz’s spokeswoman, wrote us to say that we didn’t note in our original report that Cruz acknowledged Murthy was a medical doctor. We have added to the story additional context from the interview with Crowley to make that clear. Still, we continue to believe that Cruz was inaccurate to minimize Murthy’s substantial record as a medical professional -- in ways unrelated to gun policy -- and caricature him as primarily an advocate. Our rating remains the same.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2014-10-23T18:28:59	2014-10-19	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-01642	Says of Mitch McConnell, "What can happen in 30 years? A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/25/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-ad-says-mitch-mcconnell-ma/	Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, thinks her opponent has been in office way too long. Grimes released a new ad last week that blasted McConnell for his 30-year tenure in Washington. McConnell -- the expected Senate majority leader if he defeats Grimes and the GOP wins enough seats in November -- is running for his sixth term. The ad says that one of the side effects of staying in office too long is that a senator can become a multi-millionaire and lose sight of the needs of average constituents. "What can happen in 30 years?" the ad’s narration says. "A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office, while voting 17 times against the minimum wage, three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas, and 12 times against extending unemployment benefits for laid off workers." That’s a lot to chew on, but we’ll limit our assessment here to the question of whether senators can really make millions in office. Our friends over at the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into a similar claim by Grimes in May and found that it fell flat. Because the charge is being aired anew, we decided to take a look. Senate salaries It’s true that McConnell was not a millionaire when he became a senator in 1985 but has become a multimillionaire since then. As of 2012, his estimated worth was $22.8 million, making him the 10th-richest senator, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which collects data on money in politics. That’s almost twice as much net worth than the typical senator in 2012; the average was $12.1 million. The problem with the ad is its strong suggestion that McConnell made his millions from being a senator. That’s not the case. When we asked the Grimes campaign for evidence, they pointed to Senate salaries going back to 1985. Senators’ salaries have grown from $75,100 in 1985 to $174,000 in 2009, and they haven’t changed since. McConnell has been the Senate minority leader since 2007, meaning his salary is higher -- about $193,400, according to the Congressional Research Service. (For comparison, Grimes’ current annual salary as Kentucky’s secretary of state is $117,329, according to the Kentucky state government’s salary database.) So adding up annual salaries between 1985 and 2014 and adjusting for McConnell’s leadership positions, McConnell would have earned more than $4 million before taxes and deductions. But as of 2012, McConnell is worth nearly $23 million. If his wealth didn’t come from his office, how did McConnell get so rich? McConnell’s wealth The truth is, much of McConnell’s money comes from his second wife, Elaine Chao, whom he married in 1993. (McConnell was married to his first wife, feminist scholar Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 until 1980.) Congressional financial disclosure forms cover both spouses if the lawmaker is married. Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush, is the daughter of James S. C. Chao, the founder of a major international trade company. After immigrating to the United States from China in the 1960s, Mr. Chao founded Foremost Maritime Corporation -- now the Foremost Group, of which he is the chairman. We couldn’t figure out exactly how much James Chao is worth. But the Chao Family Foundations recently donated $40 million to build a new executive education center at Harvard Business School. So how did McConnell’s finances change when he married Elaine Chao? The good news is that elected officials are required to fill out public financial disclosure forms annually. The bad news is that the Senate Public Disclosure Office at the Capitol tosses out any forms that are more than six years old. However, we were able to access McConnell’s disclosure forms back to 1995 through the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. And McConnell’s campaign gave us the forms for 1994, 1993 and 1992. All congressional financial disclosure forms show assets, income and liabilities in broad value ranges. For example, if someone owns a piece of property worth $800,000, it will be categorized on the form as being valued between $500,000 and $1 million. For consistency, let’s assume the maximum amount possible based on those broad ranges. In 1992 -- in the middle of his second term and the year before he married Chao -- McConnell had up to $825,000 in assets and about $46,000 in income (such as speaking fees and investment returns) on top of his Senate salary. He also had up to $300,000 in liabilities, such as property mortgages, bringing down his net worth. After marrying Chao in 1993, McConnell reported a maximum of $2.6 million in assets -- including a piece of real estate worth up to $1 million that belonged to Chao -- and $93,500 on top of his Senate income. He also had $815,000 in liabilities. And that same year, McConnell inherited his mother’s estate. Fast-forwarding to 2012, his net worth -- $22.8 million -- was nearly three times higher than it was five years earlier (in 2007, it was $7.8 million). In 2008, as we found in McConnell's discloure forms from that year, he and his wife received a gift of between $5 million and $25 million after Chao’s mother died. This apparently accounts for the bulk of the increase during that five-year period. Our ruling Grimes’ ad said, "What can happen in 30 years? A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office." What's problematic here is the ad’s strong suggestion that McConnell somehow managed to leverage his public office into personal riches. In truth, most of the growth in his wealth stems from his marriage and money his wife received after her mother died. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate this claim Mostly False. Correction, Aug. 25, 2014: An earlier version of this article included the figure for Grimes’ salary that was reported on her Senate candidate financial disclosure form. However, this figure -- $188,000 -- included earnings from 2013, as well as from part of 2014. To make the comparison equivalent to McConnell’s salary, we’ve adjusted her annual pay to $117,329.)

pomt-14069	Before 2005, "the percentage of" Texas high school "students meeting the college readiness standards of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013."	true	/texas/statements/2016/may/20/don-willett/justice-don-willett-accurately-recaps-surge-texas-/	Deep in the May 2016 Texas Supreme Court ruling that upheld and critiqued the current school funding system is encouraging news about the performance of Texas students. On Page 58 of the majority opinion, Justice Don Willett (who subsequently showed up among individuals that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he’d consider to succeed Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court) refers to a November 2005 decision by the court that required lawmakers to change the system. At the time of the West Orange-Cove II ruling, Willett writes, "the percentage of students meeting the college-readiness standards of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013," Willett continues. Did Texas high school graduates get so much more college-primed that fast? Best we could tell, the cited figures track with state test results tracked by the Texas Education Agency. Then again, as few as 26 percent of Texas high-school graduates lately show a readiness for college according to a couple of other respected metrics. Texas Success Initiative With help from Texas Education Agency officials, we found figures very close to what Willett presents in the 2016 majority opinion. According to the agency, in 2004, 29 percent of students fulfilled college readiness standards for English language arts and 43 percent did so for math while in 2013, 65 percent of students met readiness standards for English, 66 percent for math. With rare exception, according to the agency, the percentage of students fulfilling each readiness standard escalated steadily through the intervening years. And most recently, in 2014, 68 percent of students met the English readiness standards with 67 percent doing so in math, the agency says. We wondered what the percentages meant. They reflect student test results, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised, in keeping with a state law that requires college and universities to assess incoming high school graduates for their readiness to take college courses and offer remedial instruction as needed. Under the program, called the Texas Success Initiative, the TEA has reported on the readiness of high-school students by calculating the share of students who meet related expectations on the state-mandated English language arts and math 11th grade/exit-level Texas Assessment of Knowledge & Skills. Asked if perhaps standards loosened between 2004 and 2013, Culbertson pointed out by email that in each of the years, a student classified as ready for college needed "scale scores of 2200" on each relevant TAKS including a 3 (out of a possible 4) on the writing portion of the English test. To our inquiry, Shannon Housson, TEA director of performance reporting, said by phone the 124 percent and 54 percent respective improvements in students meeting the readiness standards over nine years reflected schools and students adjusting to and, in some cases, mastering the English and math TAKS, which were given from 2003 through 2011 before yielding to the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness. At its inception, Housson said, the TAKS added up to a "significant increase in rigor" for students accustomed to the previous state-mandated exams. "I remember the angst in the schools," Housson said, as teachers and others came to terms with the new focus on "higher-order thinking skills" linked to the state-set curriculum rather than simply academic skills. Finally, Willett’s citation of the 2005 court decision on school finance led us to look back at how that opinion by Justice Nathan Hecht presented the percentages of students meeting the readiness standards. In the ruling, Hecht showed results for all students plus break-outs suggesting considerable performance lags among African American, Hispanic and Limited English Proficient students. Results for 2013 suggest such gaps have closed quite a bit except among students the state deems English Language Learners. Texas Students With Test Scores Suggesting College Readiness, 2004 and 2013 Subject All Students African-American Hispanic White LEP/ELL* English (2004) 29% 19% 20% 36% 3% Math (2004) 43% 21% 29% 56% 13% English (2013) 65% 55% 60% 74% 14% Math (2013) 61% 51% 55% 71% 12% SOURCES: Web pages, entries for Texas Success Initiative - Higher Education Readiness Component, statewide reports for 2004, 2013 Academic Excellence Indicator System, Texas Education Agency, both undated (accessed May 16, 2016) *Limited English Proficient/English Language Learners SAT, ACT scores There are other ways to gauge college readiness. In 2014, nearly 34 percent of the state’s students who took the pre-college SAT (or 32 percent of public school students taking the test) did well enough to demonstrate a readiness for college work without remediation, according to the College Board, which associates an SAT score of 1550 out of 2400 with a 65 percent probability of obtaining a first-year college GPA of B- or higher. The same year, among 60 percent of 116,147 Texas high school graduates to take the ACT scored well enough to show a readiness for college English, the Iowa-based group says, with 47 percent doing so in math and 36 percent demonstrating readiness in science--and only 26 percent clearing all the tests’ college-readiness benchmarks. ACT says its readiness benchmarks are "scores on the ACT subject-area tests that represent the level of achievement required for students to have a 50% chance of obtaining a B or higher or about a 75% chance of obtaining a C or higher in corresponding credit-bearing first-year college courses." Our ruling Willett, writing for the court majority, said that before 2005, "the percentage of" Texas high-school students meeting the coordinating board’s college readiness standards "stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013." This statement doesn’t acknowledge readiness metrics such as ACT or SAT scores. But it almost perfectly reflects the state’s tallies of high school graduates in 2004 and 2013 who scored high enough on state English and math tests to be considered college-ready. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-01832	"At some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/18/susan-happ/susan-happ-says-some-point-their-lives-99-percent-/	The U.S. Supreme Court’s controversial "Hobby Lobby" decision in June 2014 involved contraception and the insurance coverage that companies are required to provide to employees under the Affordable Care Act. In a 5-4 decision, the court agreed with arguments made by Hobby Lobby, a chain of arts and crafts stores. Attorneys for the owners had argued they should not be forced to provide certain kinds of contraception that they feel violate their religious freedom. The decision was criticized by Democrats, who argued it allows some companies to make a health care decision for their female employees -- including which forms of birth control are covered. For instance, under the decision, the pill is okay, but intrauterine devices and the morning-after pill can be turned down. Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, a Democrat running in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary for attorney general, laid out her concerns about the ruling in broad terms. "Giving corporations, executives and bosses the ability to make decisions about women’s health care is deeply regrettable," she said in a June 30, 2014 news release. "At some point in their lives, 99 percent of women use birth control. This decision seems to ignore that fact and side with corporations over women." Others have cited a similar figure, including President Barack Obama on Feb. 10, 2012 when he unveiled a compromise on birth control coverage in his health care bill that aimed to address concerns raised by the Catholic Church. "Nearly 99 percent of all women have relied on contraception at some point in their lives –- 99 percent," Obama said at a White House briefing. Is Happ right that virtually all women rely on birth control at some point in their lives? When asked for backup, Happ’s campaign directed us to a Feb. 14, 2013 report, "Contraceptive methods women have ever used: United States, 1982-2010," published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That report was based on interviews with 12,279 women between 2006 and 2010. Each woman was asked a series of questions about whether she or a partner had ever used each of more than 20 methods of contraception. The goal of the report was to prepare national estimates on the use of contraception in the United States. Its conclusions were pretty straightforward: "Virtually all women of reproductive age in 2006–2010 who had ever had sexual intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime (99 percent, or 53 million women aged 15–44)." The report said 88 percent of the women in that group have used "a highly effective, reversible method such as birth control pills, an injectable method, a contraceptive patch, or an intrauterine device." It added that the most common methods used were the male condom (93 percent), the pill (82 percent), withdrawal (60 percent), and the injectable Depo-Provera (23 percent). The report also said that the use of contraception had increased from 94.8 percent of sexually experienced women in 1982, to 98.2 percent in 1995 and 99.1 percent in 2006-2010. So the report is pretty clear when it comes to widespread use of contraception among sexually active women considered to be of reproductive age. But Happ’s claim was broader than that. She did not limit it to an age group, or qualify it as sexually active women, which the report did. That means there are some problems with her claim. For instance, the report says that only 86.6 percent of the women surveyed ever had sex with a male, meaning 13.4 percent never did. Similar trends were found in previous CDC surveys. A 2005 report said that about 8.4 percent of the women included in a 2002 survey said they had never had sex with a man. That survey was of 7,643 women between the ages of 15 and 44. When Obama made his 2012 statement, Cybercast News Service noted that the 2010 CDC report found 13.9 percent of women surveyed never had sexual intercourse, a figure that’s in line with the more recent study cited by Happ. So how many women are we talking about? According to the 2012 Census , the United States had about 92 million women between the ages of 15 and 44, so the number of women who never had sex is just over 12 million women. It is also worth noting that the CDC report says says 93 percent of women reported using condoms, and 60 percent reported using withdrawal as a birth control method. Those figures help drive the conclusion that virtually all women use birth control at some point in their lives. Neither, of course, is provided by prescription -- the context in which Happ made her claim. So, that also serves to skew the numbers behind the point she is making. Our rating Happ said "at some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control." It’s clear she was arguing that contraception use is widespread, and important for women who run the risk of getting pregnant. But in making the statement, Happ used an overly broad brush, applying what is true for a subset (sexually active women between 15 and 44) and applying it to a larger group (all women). We rate her claim Half True.	None	Susan Happ	None	None	None	2014-07-18T05:00:00	2014-06-30	['None']

pomt-09695	"Mitt Romney ... gave you government health care that is now bankrupting the state" of Massachusetts.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/10/glenn-beck/beck-claims-universal-health-care-driving-massachu/	On his Nov. 2, 2009, Webcast, Glenn Beck rattled off a list of Republicans he thinks are just too liberal for his party, including Sen. Lindsay "Grahamnesty," Minnesota Gov. Tim "Cap-and-Trade" Pawlenty, Sen. John "My Hero is a Flaming Progressive" McCain, and Sen. Olympia "Health Care" Snowe. And then there's former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who Beck said "opened the tent and gave you government health care that is now bankrupting the state." "That was my problem with the Massachusetts Romneycare," Beck said, referring to a three-year-old mandate that requires everyone in the state to have health care. "I remember saying to him, 'Mitt, you're not king. You're not going to be there forever. You opened the door, the progressives came in.'" In many ways, the Massachusetts health care model mirrors a plan lawmakers are considering on Capitol Hill, so we wondered whether the mandate could be the budget-buster Beck claims it to be. First, a few words about the Massachusetts plan. When Romney became governor in 2003, he was looking for a way for Massachusetts to make health care cheaper and more accessible. "People who don't have insurance nonetheless receive health care. And it's expensive," he told National Public Radio in 2006. "We're spending a billion dollars giving health care to people who don't have insurance. ... And my question was: Could we take that billion dollars and help the poor purchase insurance? Let them pay what they can afford. We'll subsidize what they can't." Thus began Romney's plan for an individual mandate, a requirement that nearly everyone have health insurance, even those who are unemployed. Though Romney vetoed eight parts of the bill, including a provision that would have fined small businesses that failed to comply with the mandate (the legislature overrode that veto), the basics of his original vision remained intact throughout the legislative process. Commonwealth Care is a program that helps low-income consumers pay for plans while Commonwealth Choice acts as an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses. The program is subsidized by taxpayer dollars and federal funding. Today, about 96 percent of the state's population has health insurance, either through the state program, their employers or by other means, which ranks Massachusetts first in the nation in terms of percentage of people with some form of coverage. Nevertheless, Commonwealth Care has had its share of criticism. Some critics say it's been a boon to the insurance industry, while others complain that some consumers are paying even more for coverage, not less, as state lawmakers initially hoped. (In fact, Massachusetts has some of the most expensive health care per family in the country, according to some studies.) Another complaint: Commonwealth Care has taken a significant bite out of Massachusetts's bottom line. Indeed, the program has been quite popular. Initially, the state projected that 215,000 people would eventually be enrolled in the program at the cost of $725 million. By 2007, enrollment had reached 80,000 and six months later, the number had doubled to 158,000 people. In 2008, enrollment peaked at more than 177,000 people. Currently, the state is expecting to spend about $880 million on Commonwealth Care in the coming budget year; that's about 3.3 percent of the state's $27 billion budget. So, while the program has become more expensive, it has not been the budget-buster that Beck suggests. We asked experts whether the state would still be facing a $5 billion deficit if the program hadn't been put into place, and the resounding answer was "yes." "Beck joins a long and growing list of uninformed commentators who allege that Massachusetts’ health reform is bankrupting the state," said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a tax policy think tank. "He and they are absolutely wrong." The state's budget deficit has been caused by an unprecedented collapse in state tax revenues, Widmer said. According to the administration, tax revenues have fallen $2 billion below the amounts the fiscal 2009 budget was built upon. And the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, a left-leaning budget think tank, says the problem has been compounded by permanent tax cuts put in place during the late 1990s. Adding to these financial woes is an increase in the number of people relying on unemployment benefits as the result of losing their jobs, said Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University. "The state would be facing a deficit no matter what," Sager said. So, while the state may be broke, it has little to do with the health care program Mitt Romney put in place over three years ago. Instead, tax revenue shortfalls and a growing reliance on unemployment benefits due to layoffs have put a massive budget burden on the state. As a result, we give Beck a False.

pomt-14201	"Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/21/ben-carson/andrew-jackson-debt-balanced-budget-president/	Former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said it doesn’t make sense that President Andrew Jackson will no longer be the centerpiece of the $20 bill because he was the last master of the federal budget. Carson, who now backs Donald Trump, lamented the 19th century president’s displacement in an April 20 interview on Fox Business. "Well I think Andrew Jackson was a tremendous secretary — I mean a tremendous president," Carson said. "I mean, Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt." Black abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who rescued slave families using the underground railroad, will replace Jackson on the front of the $20 bill, while a smaller image of Jackson’s face will appear on the back. Jackson’s appearance on the bill has stirred up controversy as of late, especially because Jackson, a populist and a war hero, presided over the removal of approximately 46,000 Native Americans from their land. We wondered if Carson had his historical facts straight. We took Carson’s statement to mean that Jackson was the last president to do both things: balance the budget and eliminate debt. A lot of presidents have presided over balanced budgets, which is when the government takes in more revenue than it spends, leading to no net borrowing in that year. But a balanced budget doesn’t necessarily mean no debt, because old debt can carry over from previous years. Jackson was, in fact, the only president to preside over a total elimination of all remaining debt while having a balanced budget. However, this wasn’t nearly as dramatic of an accomplishment as it would be today. Experts told us to take this factoid with a grain of salt because the debt was already on its way down, and by the time Jackson took office, the amount of debt was trivial. The history Jackson, who served from 1829-37, was an ardent supporter of keeping banks and government separated. He believed that banks would have undue influence on government, and he was hell-bent on eliminating the debt. (Jackson was also deeply skeptical of paper currency, which adds some irony to the current debate over his position on the $20 bill.) In January 1829, the debt was about $58 million. (Jackson took office that March.) In today’s dollars, that amounts to about $1.4 billion. The total public debt outstanding today is higher by many orders of magnitude: $19.2 trillion. Jackson watched that debt scale down to zero in 1835. According to the Treasury Department, the debt remained close to zero when Jackson left office. But Jackson didn’t have to take much action to make this happen. Since the end of the War of 1812, which racked up a lot of debt, Congress required debt reductions of at least $10 million per year under under Jackson’s two predecessors, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. So all Jackson really had to do was maintain the status quo, said Daniel Feller, a Jackson expert at the University of Tennessee. "The policy of paying off the debt happened before Jackson, and he happened to be president" when the debt hit zero, Feller said. In addition to continuing the already-established debt-reduction policy, Jackson vetoed some infrastructure bills that would have spent money on things like building roads. He also liquidated the Second Bank of the United States, a precursor to the Federal Reserve, resulting in a massive surplus of government money that was used to pay off the last of the debt, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in federal spending patterns at George Washington University Law School. Immediately following Jackson’s departure, the country experienced a financial crisis, the Panic of 1837. The panic resulted from several factors, including the collapse of a speculative land bubble and international capital flows, but some economists believe Jackson’s fiscal policies should carry some of the blame. "The country did eventually have the good sense to borrow again, to finance the country's enormous economic expansion throughout the 19th and 20th centuries," Buchanan said, noting that it is not always desirable to bring debt down to zero. While the only president to see a national debt of zero, Jackson certainly wasn’t the only president who presided over a balanced budget. In today’s world, it’s rare for the federal government to balance its budget, meaning revenue is higher than expenditures. Since the 1960s, only five years have had balanced federal budgets: 1969 under President Richard Nixon; 1998, 1999 and 2000 under Bill Clinton; and 2001 under George W. Bush. But in earlier years, balanced budgets were much more regular. From 1900 to 1960, about 25 years had balanced budgets, according to government historical tables. Before that, we don’t have year-to-year budget breakdowns. But we do know that there was an overall budget surplus from 1800 through 1850, so balanced budgets were a fairly regular occurrence around the time Jackson was in office. Fuller backed up that point. "Carson is merely applauding Jackson for having paid off the debt through a one-time gimmick," as opposed to adjusting policy to keep the debt low for the long run, Buchanan said. Our ruling Carson said, "Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt." Experts say this feat doesn’t really deserve the plaudits Carson is giving it, but Carson has his facts basically right. Jackson was the last — and only — president to bring the national debt to zero on top of having a balanced budget. The statement is accurate but needs added context, which is our definition of Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/72b86490-26c7-4af9-81a5-736827d02e19	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2016-04-21T17:06:40	2016-04-20	['None']
pomt-12598	Says Tammy Baldwin "supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/05/restoration-pac/early-attack-ad-says-tammy-baldwin-backed-letting-/	More than a year and a half before she faces re-election for a second term, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin was hit with a super PAC ad that attacks her on military funding and dealing with the threat of terrorism from Iran. The video from Restoration PAC, posted March 21, 2017, makes a series of attacks. We’ll check its first one, which comes after a photograph of the Wisconsin Democrat appears on the screen. "Tammy Baldwin has some interesting ideas on how to keep us safe," the female narrator intones. "She supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops." Congress, of course, provides funding for the military -- not citizens directly. And couldn’t Congress easily move money collected through taxes from one fund to another? Let’s explore why this attack mostly misses its target. The PAC We rated as Pants on Fire a Restoration PAC ad that supported Wisconsin’s other U.S. senator, Republican Ron Johnson, in his 2016 win for a second term. The ad used a fake image to make it appear that President Barack Obama had met with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. As a super PAC, the suburban Chicago-based Restoration PAC can raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals. And it can spend unlimited money to advocate for or against political candidates. According to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, the group took in $4 million during the 2016 election cycle, with $3.8 million of it contributed by Richard Uihlein, president and CEO of Uline Inc., a packaging supply company based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., near Chicago. Nine days after the Restoration PAC video posted, it was announced that Uihlein had given $2 million to another super PAC that is encouraging Republican businessman Kevin Nicholson to run against Baldwin in 2018. The attack When the attack on Baldwin is made in the Restoration PAC ad, a footnote appears referring to the 2009 version of the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act, which has been introduced perennially but has never become law. The measures would allow citizens to redirect their tax dollars away from the military -- but not actually withhold funds from troops. According to a summary of the 2009 bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: The bill would have applied to conscientious objectors -- people opposed to any participation in war, usually based upon moral, religious or other beliefs, who made their status known to the U.S. Treasury Department. The department would have had to put income, gift and estate taxes paid by those people in a fund "to be allocated to any appropriation not for a military purpose." Baldwin, then a member of the House of Representatives, was a co-sponsor of the 2009 version, as she had been in 2003, 2005 and 2007. (She was not a cosponsor in 2011, nor in 2013 or 2015, after being elected to the Senate.) To back the attack on Baldwin, a Restoration PAC spokesman referred us to a 2012 article by Media Trackers, a conservative website. The article claimed that Baldwin’s support of the 2009 bill meant she wanted to "block funding for body armor and medical supplies for U.S. troops." But as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watchdog columnist Daniel Bice reported at the time, when Baldwin faced attacks over the bill in her first Senate campaign, experts say the measure was a feel-good bill that wouldn't lead to federal defense cuts. What the bill could do As the experts told Bice, if the taxes from conscientious observers could not be used on military items, lawmakers could simply dip into another pot of tax dollars to underwrite war-related expenses. Even the group pushing the legislation said at the time the bill would not "directly decrease the amount of money spent on war." And its website now says the bill would "not immediately impact the level of military spending." Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center, told us the bill’s effect would be "symbolic at best." Added Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense: "It’s a pretty empty piece of legislation; more like an accounting trick. Clearly this is intended for a conscientious objector to feel better about their taxes, but it doesn’t reduce their tax bill or really withhold funding for our troops.’" Our rating Restoration PAC says Baldwin "supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops." Baldwin on four occasions, most recently in 2009, cosponsored a bill that would have allowed conscientious objectors to direct the federal government not to use their income taxes and other tax payments for any military purpose. But the bill would not have restricted Congress’ ability to allocate money to the military; even the organization pushing the legislation acknowledges it would not reduce military funding; and experts agree it is a symbolic measure that would not result in funding being withheld from troops. For a statement that contains an element of truth but leaves out important details, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-06608	President Obama "went around the world and apologized for America."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-repeats-claim-obama-went-around-world-/	In a debate in Orlando on Sept. 22, 2011, Mitt Romney charged that President Obama has gone around the world apologizing for America. President Obama "went around the world and apologized for America," Romney said, in response to a question about Israel and the Middle East. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has made this charge several times. The first time we checked it was when he made the charge is his own book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness. Here’s the claim from Romney’s book that we checked back then: "Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined," Romney wrote. "It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." In the book, Romney specifically named the speeches he was referring to: "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." At the time, we rated the claim False. Romney made a similar claim in June 2011 during a campaign appearance when he said, "A few months into office, (President Barack Obama) traveled around the globe to apologize for America." We rated that one Pants on Fire, because he implied the trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries. That was hardly the case. Let’s recap our specific findings. What Obama said For starters, as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: "sorry." Merriam-Webster defines an apology as "an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret." We read the seven Obama speeches cited in Romney’s book and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks, and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together. At a town hall meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. "On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated," Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team. "Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable," Obama said. "I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the United States and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply "move forward." Here are his exact remarks: "In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward." Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in his book. Typically, Obama would say that the United States must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; we’ve rated it a Promise Broken.) Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism. Obama said that after 9/11, "our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions." He also said that the Guantanamo prison "likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies." Did Obama apologize? Back in 2010, we sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing. • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the United States has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. "There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation," he said. • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret." Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. "There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will," Murphy said. "The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that. • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society, and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." Other presidential apologies Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. "The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well," Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. "We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope." Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. "The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong," Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. "To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry." Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. "My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy, and it is not over," he said. "The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all." Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. "We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America," Bush said. "I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America." Obama's praise and motivations While Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledged as much when he wrote that Obama, "always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there." In Cairo, Obama called the United States "one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world." At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, "What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history." And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama said: "Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity." What’s new from the debate What Romney said at the debate in Orlando -- "He went around the world and apologized for America" -- is very similar to what he said at his campaign stop in June -- "A few months into office, he traveled around the globe to apologize for America." At the debate, Romney added this comment: "He addressed the United Nations in his inaugural address and chastised our friend, Israel, for building settlements and said nothing about Hamas launching thousands of rockets into Israel." We looked again at Obama's first speech at the United Nations. It's true that he does not specifically mention Hamas. But it's certainly not a one-sided chastisement of Israel. Obama repeatedly calls on Palestinians to understand and respect Israel's security needs. And he specifically mentions the fear Israeli civilians have of rocket attacks. "We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us. It's not paid by politicians," Obama said. "It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night. It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own." Our ruling Some of the Obama speeches that Romney cited in his book certainly laid out Obama’s foreign policy ideas, and it seems fair to say that a less confrontational approach was among Obama’s goals. Obama had made no secret during the campaign that he intended to set a different course on foreign policy than Bush -- a committed unilateralist -- had pursued. Still, we think it’s incorrect for Romney to portray these early speeches as part of a global apology tour. Using Romney’s standard, you could argue that any change in foreign policy that’s undertaken after a presidential transition and announced to the world would constitute an "apology" for the previous policy. On the substance of Romney’s charge, we believe that what we wrote in March 2010 still stands. While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, those passages were typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries have erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch. And on the new angle Romney has added -- that the trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries -- we think it’s a ridiculous charge. There’s a clear difference between changing policies and apologizing, and Obama didn’t do the latter.

pomt-02307	Says Rick Scott presided over cuts to the Bright Futures college scholarship program.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/01/american-bridge-21st-century/rick-scott-presided-over-bright-futures-cut-democr/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott paid for college by working at a doughnut shop and getting help from the GI bill. Now he says he wants low-income students to have that same shot at the American dream that he did. Scott has called for lowering the cost of college, including challenging colleges to offer $10,000 degrees. On March 17, 2014, he repeated that message at a college affordability roundtable at Barbara Goleman High School in Miami Lakes. Democrats were watching. American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC, used a video clip of a reporter interviewing Scott at the event to produce an online attack video. While a smiling Scott appears to be standing in a library, a reporter asks: "In your first year in office you proposed millions of dollars in cuts to public education. Then in 2011-12 over those two years (you) signed off on tuition increases of 13 percent. You presided over cuts to the Bright Futures college scholarship program. To what extent is your recent efforts to boost education and hold the line on costs of education re-election politics?" "All of that is incorrect," Scott responded, and then the video cuts him off. Text on the screen says, "Scott approved cuts to Bright Future scholarships," followed by, "Rick Scott is bad for Florida." We heard the rest of Scott’s defense thanks to a recording by Miami Herald education reporter David Smiley. Scott talked up funding increases for K-12 education, "record funding for universities" and his fight to cut higher education tuition -- but he didn’t mention Bright Futures. Education funding has been a hot topic in the race between Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, the Democratic frontrunner. Here we will examine American Bridge’s charge that Scott presided over cuts to Bright Futures. Bright Futures Launched in 1997, Bright Futures is the college scholarship program funded by the Lottery and designed to keep high-achieving students at Florida schools. The Web ad cites a May 2011 article in The Ledger about Bright Futures cuts approved by the Legislature and Scott during the annual legislative session. American Bridge sent us many other articles that described cuts that year. Why would state legislators want to make the program less generous? They say it’s grown too expensive and that too many students qualify. In an effort to make the scholarships more competitive, they have increased test score requirements, a move that drew the attention of the U.S. Justice Department for making it harder for poorer students of minority backgrounds to get the grant. There are a few ways we can examine cuts to the program, by looking at the total number of students served, the total amount of money disbursed, and the average scholarship amount per student. (There are different levels of Bright Futures awards depending on grades and other factors, but we will cite the overall average.) Here are recent years’ numbers on Bright Futures. The spending picture is not settled for the current and future fiscal years, so we have included an estimate for 2013-14 and the proposed figures for 2014-15. Year Number of students served Amount of money disbursed Average award per student 2007-08 159,170 $379.8 million $2,387 2008-09 169,366 $429 million $2,533 2009-10 177,612 $423.5 million $2,385 2010-11 179,076 $423.3 million $2,364 2011-12 174,047 $333.8 million $1,918 2012-13 162,980 $312.1 million $1,915 2013-14 estimated 154,160 $309.4 million $2,007 2014-15 proposed 127,573 $266.2 million $2,086 Source: Florida Department of Education At a glance, it appears the total amount of Bright Futures funding nose-dived after Scott took office. Crist vows on his campaign website to reverse the cuts under Scott. Reality is slightly more muddled. The decline in the total number of Bright Futures recipients and the program's total budget is a result of decisions by the Legislature under both Crist and Scott to rein in costs. (We asked the Crist campaign for a response; they didn’t provide one.) The program’s costs spiraled up from an initial price tag of $70 million in 1997 to $437 million in 2011. Some critics said the standards for getting the awards were too easy. In 2010, Crist’s last year as governor, the Legislature reduced Bright Futures scholarships by $1 dollar for every credit hour. The bill also raised SAT/ACT requirements incrementally, which was expected to lead to a drop in the number of students who would qualify. For example, the Legislature raised the minimum SAT requirement for Florida Medallion Scholars -- one subset of Bright Futures -- from 970 in 2010-11 to 1050 in 2013-14. In 2011, Scott’s first year as governor, the Legislature decided to further raise test scores for 2013-14 graduates. For example, those Medallion Scholars would now have to score 1170 on their SAT by 2013-14. Scott’s summary of his proposed 2014-15 budget states his proposal "fully funds" the scholarships for eligible students and that the decline in total funds is due to a projected decrease of students because they changed the standards. So both Crist and Scott signed legislation that had the effect of reducing funding for Bright Futures. Our ruling American Bridge’s video said that Scott presided over cuts to the Bright Futures college scholarship program. During his tenure, the program’s total budget and number of students served has dropped. The average award amount under Scott is smaller than during the Crist years. However, it's worth noting that the Legislature under both Crist and Scott tightened eligibility requirements, which reduced the number of students who received the money. Both Crist and Scott signed off on those changes. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	American Bridge 21st Century	None	None	None	2014-04-01T15:44:02	2014-03-18	['None']
pomt-13794	Says Hillary Clinton "said all work-related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/chris-christie/stamp-one-correct-chris-christie-says-clinton-wron/	Several speakers touched on Hillary Clinton's email scandal at the second night of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was one. He used it to argue that "Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she cared about protecting America’s secrets. And then, she lied about it over and over and over again." "She said there was no marked classified information on her server. The FBI director said, that's untrue," Christie said. "She said that she did not email any classified information. The FBI director, says that's untrue. She said all-work related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true." For this fact-check, we'll look at Christie's claim about what happened with Clinton’s work-related emails. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, decided to use a private, unsecured email server at her New York home for government business. When news of the system came to light — indirectly, as part of the investigation into the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya — Clinton's lawyers went through the 60,000 or so emails she had collected to cull out personal communication. She claimed the remaining government-related emails were turned over to the State Department. The Clinton campaign fact sheet on the controversy says she provided copies of 30,490 emails covering over 55,000 pages. "In providing these emails to the department," the fact sheet says, "Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related — including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting — erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the department and National Archives’ determination that over 1,250 emails were 'personal' records (which they have indicated will be returned to her)." That's in line with her statement on the April 3, 2016, edition of Meet the Press where she said, "I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails." (At the time, before the FBI released the results of its investigation, we gave her a Half True because more than 31,000 had been deleted by her lawyers without any government review.) And in a Sept. 4, 2015, interview on MSNBC with Andrea Mitchell, Clinton claimed that her lawyers "went through every single email." Then the FBI released the results of its probe. Director James Comey reported finding "several thousand work-related emails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014." Some were uncovered because they had been archived in government email accounts belonging to workers who had sent or received them. Some were discovered among the millions of fragments of emails stored in the unused space of the servers used by the Clinton system. Two emails were classified as "confidential;" one was classified as "secret." None were top secret. But Comey also said it wasn't surprising that those work-related emails weren't turned over. "We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them," he said during his news conference. "Our assessment is that, like many email users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed." The FBI director also said some of the work-related emails not turned over to the State Department may have been deleted because her lawyers had not, in fact, gone through every one. Instead, they "relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all work-related emails," he said. "It is highly likely their search terms missed some work-related emails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the (unused) slack space of a server." If Clinton had been using a government account like she should have, the work-related correspondence would have been archived, the FBI director said. But her system didn't do that. When we asked the Clinton campaign about Christie's work-related email claim, spokesman Josh Schwerin noted Comey testified before Congress that three of the classified emails were not properly marked as classified, and there was no evidence that any work-related emails were intentionally deleted. Our ruling Christie told the convention that Clinton "said all work-related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true." The FBI did indeed discover that work-related emails had been deleted by Clinton's lawyers despite her insistence, still posted on her website, that she included all emails "that were even potentially work-related."

pomt-00238	Says Socrates said, "When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/08/viral-image/no-socrates-didnt-call-slander-tool-losers/	A viral image on Facebook quotes Socrates as saying, "When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers."​ There’s no evidence Socrates said that. The Facebook page Allen West Republic shared the photo on the morning of Sept. 25, the day Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Kavanaugh narrowly passed the Senate’s confirmation vote and was sworn in Oct. 6.) The post has been shared more than 12,200 times since then, but the misattribution has been around a lot longer. A user posted the quote on Goodreads in 2008, and the quote has been circulating ever since. Socrates didn’t write anything himself, so the picture of who he was and what he said is reliant on others’ writings. Plato and Xenophon wrote about Socrates and slander but not in the context of lost debates, said Christopher Moore, a philosophy and classics assistant professor at Penn State. Socrates believed those who slandered him hated philosophy and truth, but he didn’t call them losers. In Plato’s "Apology," Socrates points to his effort to find men smarter than himself as the root of slander against him, according to Debra Nails, a Michigan State University philosophy professor emeritus. When Socrates decided other men weren’t as smart as him, those men didn’t like him very much. However, there's no evidence of him saying any version of the viral image quote. Plato’s and Aristotle’s versions of Socrates were not interested in debates as something that could be won or lost, at least not by an individual, according to Christopher Rowe, Durham University classics and ancient history professor emeritus. In Socrates’ view, only truth could defeat anyone. Middle school essayists love to start with a good philosophical quote or a dictionary definition, but this supposed Socratic saying originates from the internet, not from a textbook.

pomt-02979	The goal of Common Core is "to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/oct/21/florida-stop-common-core-coalition/common-core-instills-religious-political-views/	If reading about how Common Core aims to establish the same standards across states in reading and math makes you yawn, consider some of the more controversial subjects in which the feds want to tell your children what to think, say Common Core opponents. "The Common Core standards, along with the aligned curriculum and the mining of nearly 400 data points reveal that the goal of the standards is not simply to improve academic achievement but also to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs," states a report on the website of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition. Here, we will fact-check whether Common Core includes the federal government dictating what students should think about politics and religion. Report that makes claims about Common Core Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts. President Barack Obama's administration has used its education funding grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Florida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks -- though local school districts can still choose to do so. Common Core is about standards: the knowledge and skills students are required to have in each grade, from kindergarten through high school, not the curriculum schools use to teach those standards. Florida’s Next Generation Sunshine State Standards include general information about the U.S. political system. It also includes the world's major religions in the World History section. All curriculum decisions are made locally by schools boards, schools and teachers, according to the state Department of Education. We read nothing in the standards that suggested that any level of government was telling students what political or religious beliefs they should personally hold. So what evidence do the critics have for saying the Common Core will instill political and religious beliefs? The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition cited a report written by Education Liberty Watch. The co-authors were Dr. Karen Effrem, President of Education Liberty Watch in Minnesota and a co-founder of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, and Randy Osborne, a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of several conservative candidates and causes, including the Florida marriage amendment. The report zeroes in on something called the National Education Data Model, which lists hundreds of data elements. The report linked to a screen grab it created of those data elements. The list shown includes "voting status" and "religious consideration" and "religious affiliation." (It also includes far more mundane elements such as a student’s birthdate, address and race.) These are elements that districts could choose to collect on any individual in the district: students, parents or teachers. We could not find the same list of attributes on the NEDM website, but we shared it with officials involved with NEDM and they didn’t dispute it. But there are some major caveats about this list of data elements. First, this is not a required list of data for all states or school districts to collect. Instead, it is a voluntary model that states can use to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. That means states or districts could choose to use some of the data elements and not others, or ignore the data model entirely. Helping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said. Buckley said that federal officials did not come up with these potential elements out of thin air -- they were chosen because certain school districts or states had sought that particular data element in the past. "Remember this is all voluntary," Buckley said. "If your state already collects this, or has a reason why it collects it, (then we tell them) ‘here is how we recommend you code it’ so everyone doesn’t invent their own code for religions.’" We interviewed Alexander Jackl, chief architect Choice Solutions, Inc., an education data software company and one of the original authors of the National Education Data Model. Jackl is also a member of a working group about the newer version -- the Common Education Data Standards, or CEDS. The data fields for religion in particular are useful for private, religious schools, he said. Those fields "are in the NEDM conceptual model as possible attributes," Jackl told PolitiFact in an email. "This makes sense as parochial schools and religious universities might make use of NEDM as well and those elements would be useful for them. It looks, though, like they were not carried forward into CEDS." We contacted a few school districts in Florida to ask if they collect data on voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliations, or if they plan to start doing that with Common Core. Here’s the response we received from a spokesman for Miami-Dade schools: "No. No. No. And no." Broward, Hillsborough and Pasco schools also don’t collect that data. "I can’t think of any useful or legitimate educational reason to know that information," said Linda Cobbe, Pasco schools spokeswoman. The Florida Department of Education does not require school districts to ask about voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliation and has no plan to do so under Common Core, department spokeswoman Cheryl Etters said. Fears have become widespread Claims that Common Core will lead to collecting data about students religious or political beliefs have been repeated by conservative pundits. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal signed an executive order in May to prohibit the state from collecting certain information about students and their families, including religious and political affiliation and voting history. A similar bill was recently introduced in the Michigan house. In response to questions from parents, the Arizona state superintendent of public instruction distributed a fact-sheet that states: "Will the system track a family's political affiliations or firearms ownership? Absolutely not." Also, there is a clear difference between a state or a school district choosing to ask students about their voting status or religious affiliation and, as the report suggests, and using Common Core as a way to "instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs." Effrem sent us an email arguing that the Common Core standards are intended "to teach and instill non-cognitive/psychological/socioemotional attitudes." She cited an example of a lesson in Utah in which "students use their voices to advocate solutions to social problems that they care deeply about" and a middle school in Florida that apparently took a Junior Scholastic quiz called "what kind of party animal are you?" But nothing we saw in Effrem’s email proved that as a result of Common Core the federal government is trying to instill particular religious or political beliefs in students. Additionally, we found nothing in either of the data models to suggest that the federal government is telling students what political or religious beliefs they should hold. For public schools, it wouldn’t be constitutional, anyway. Our ruling The goal of Common Core "is not simply to improve academic achievement but also to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs," said an anti-Common Core group. Their evidence, though, is flimsy at best: A computer model that has a data field for voting status or religion, which would typically be used by a private school. We could find no public schools that kept such data, and Florida Department of Education has no plans to require that they do. That’s a far cry from attempting to instill particular religious or political beliefs. We rate this Pants on Fire!

pomt-01220	Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler opposed an injunction to stop a "company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/nov/21/brad-rockwell/steve-adler-represented-store-trying-build-over-aq/	UPDATE, 5:30 p.m., Nov. 25, 2014: After hearing from Rockwell, we removed parts of our original story: testimony about whether mechanical systems could cause the project to meet anti-pollution standards – an element that didn’t speak to Rockwell’s claim – and a comment by a lawyer that workers took care of spilled gasoline, an action we didn’t confirm. We also took out our reference to a wave of litigation. While several judges considered the Lowe’s conflict in 2004, environmentalist groups filed only one lawsuit, Rockwell told us. We also made it clear Rockwell does not believe his statement was an exaggeration. These changes did not affect our rating of the claim. Vivid image: Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler going to court to keep a judge from stopping petrochemicals from being dumped beneath Barton Springs. Austin attorney Brad Rockwell recently charged Adler, an eminent-domain lawyer, with doing just that. (Disclosure: Rockwell's daughter, Lilly Rockwell, covers city government for our parent newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman. She wasn't involved in this fact check.) "I met Steve Adler in litigation while he was representing a company who was dismantling the SOS ordinance," Rockwell said at a Nov. 12, 2014, press conference held with mayoral candidate Mike Martinez next to the lengthy spring-fed swimming pool. Adler and Martinez vie in a Dec. 16 runoff. At the press conference, Brad Rockwell was referring to the Save Our Springs law approved in 1992 to limit development potentially polluting the pool. Rockwell, former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance, continued: "Adler opposed our efforts to get an injunction to stop this company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer." Did Adler battle for a company to dump oil ‘neath the pool? Adler represented Lowe’s It’s public record that Adler represented Lowe’s before an Austin state district judge in 2004 and opposed a temporary injunction, shortly granted, that kept Lowe’s from continuing to build a store in Southwest Travis County. In March 2005, though, the Austin City Council moved to settle the dispute, clearing the way for the Brodie Lane store. Adler and others went before a judge in July 2004 in response to a lawsuit brought by the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups that year intended to stop the Lowe’s project from being built on land in the heart of the Barton Springs recharge zone, described in Statesman news stories at the time as covering a 20-mile stretch of Travis and Hays counties. Rainfall in the zone percolates through soil and creek beds, a November 2003 Statesman news story said, replenishing the segment of the Edwards Aquifer that supplies not only Barton Springs but wells serving 50,000 residents. In question: Whether the plaintiffs were right that the construction was subject to the Save Our Springs ordinance limiting impervious cover to 15 percent or, as Lowe’s maintained, the company was free to put in up to 40 percent impervious cover in keeping with what Travis County permitted. In the July 1, 2004, hearing before Judge Scott Jenkins, Adler advanced reasons the project wasn’t subject to the SOS ordinance. Among his contentions: The land wasn’t in Austin’s purview, or extraterritorial jurisdiction, or if it was, the project still could proceed under looser development rules in place when plans were initially submitted to Sunset Valley. Engineer’s testimony And according to a hearing transcript, Adler didn’t say a word about whether Lowe’s should be allowed to pour petrochemicals into the earth. But during the hearing, parties seeking the injunction, including the city of Sunset Valley and Save Our Springs, called to the stand Lauren Ross, an environmental engineer, who testified about her visits to the construction site the day before. Asked if she observed conditions that would drive up average annual pollutants on the site after completion, Ross testified: "There are clearly pollutants present on the site and discharging from the site that would not have been present prior to the beginning of the construction process." Specifically, Ross said, she saw "clear evidence of hydrocarbon sheens on the water in the construction rock" around a fuel tank in violation of state requirements. Also, Ross testified, there’s "no containment to prevent fuel spills from moving across the site." She said that when she visited in the morning, a mesh silt fence intended to keep sediment from flowing off the site was breached at a spot where it looked to her like the land was graded to make all runoff head that way; she said the fence was restored by the time she returned in the afternoon. Most disturbing, Ross said, she saw that water running off the site wasn’t going into a culvert along Brodie Lane. Instead, she said, the flow was going into a hole in the ground onto limestone rock beneath, meaning all the project’s runoff was "being discharged directly onto limestone that is presumably a recharge feature" for the aquifer, she said. Asked what the flowing water looked like, Ross said the water had been filtered through the silt fence, but still had sediment and "any of those escaping hydrocarbon sheens that we know are on the site at a more distant location." Ross, asked her opinion of the environmental effect of the construction and on surrounding water features of the Lowe’s project, said: "There is significant risk. And I think what I saw yesterday indicates it is much more than just a risk of contamination of downstream waters and the Edwards Aquifer from the proposed construction. It is clear that despite the engineering standards for erosion-type construction irrigation controls, these systems fail." She also said she couldn’t recall seeing before the level of hydrocarbon sheens on a construction site that she saw on the Lowe’s site. Earlier in the hearing, Adler told the judge that stopping the $19 million project, which he called "well underway," was "going to cause greater environmental damage and greater harm than allowing the project to continue." His legal contentions extended to mention of a 2003 state law intended to make the site subject only to Travis County’s development rules. Judge mentions ‘hydrocarbon spills’ Jenkins’ temporary injunction, issued July 2, 2004, said that if the construction continued, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury due to degradation of waters in nearby Williamson Creek, Barton Springs, the Edwards Aquifer and Sunset Valley water wells. The court further finds, Jenkins wrote, "an increased risk of water pollution, were construction allowed to continue in violation of the SOS Ordinance, because of the failure risks inherent in man-made pollution-control features." Also, Jenkins directed Lowe’s to "ensure storm water runoff from the property be diverted from flowing into aquifer recharge features at or adjoining the property, that Lowe’s remove fuel tanks from the property, that Lowe’s remove from the property water contaminated by hydrocarbons and perform reasonable remediation of any hydrocarbon spills at the property." In an interview, Rockwell stressed the judge’s order as an indication his statement was accurate as well as comments by Ross to the Austin Bulldog for a May 21, 2014, news story quoting her saying that what she saw the day before the hearing was "totally my worst nightmare about why we need to minimize construction over the aquifer. The fuel storage tank failed, secondary containment around the tank failed. ... The silt fence was down, and there was direct migration into the Edwards Aquifer," Ross said. Adler calls claim 'outrageous' Adler called the dumping characterization outrageous. "To dump petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer would be illegal in addition to being immoral," Adler said in an interview. "Neither I nor Lowe’s nor co-counsel ever argued that the company should be able to dump petrochemicals into the aquifer." The vital issue in court, Adler said, was whether a 4-3 vote by the Austin City Council in December 2003 was sufficient to let the development proceed. Save Our Springs and others successfully maintained in courts through 2004 that in keeping with the SOS ordinance, six council votes should have been required for the project to launch. Adler told us: "Lowe’s doesn’t want to be dumping hydrocarbons down. No one in the courtroom would countenance dumping hydrocarbons down the aquifer." Adler noted, too, that concerns about hydrocarbons going into the ground from the site weren’t part of pre-hearing briefs. Rockwell agreed, albeit pointing out no one knew of the oily sheen until the inspection visit by Ross. Rockwell, asked if his statement was an exaggeration, replied not. He also said that what he said at the press conference didn’t "purport to summarize the whole litigation or everything about what the injunction fight was about. It’s one aspect, one very important aspect." Other lawyers in the dispute To our inquiries, other lawyers in the dispute offered conflicting takes on this claim. Doug Young, the city attorney for Sunset Valley, which sided with the environmental groups in court, said by phone: "Was Steve trying to vindicate the right of his client, Lowe’s, to dump petrochemicals down a recharge hole into the aquifer? No, I don’t think he was. But did he hear the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Ross that there were petrochemicals in the surface water there?" Young added: "It would be unreasonable to assume Lowe’s intended to dump that gas on the ground and either not worry about where it went or intend for it to go down this recharge feature. There’s no reason to believe that. But it happened. And they opposed" the injunction to stop the construction. Daniel Byrne, who like Adler represented Lowe’s in the hearing, said by phone: "The notion that anyone was pumping petrochemicals into the aquifer is complete garbage." We emailed North Carolina-based Lowe’s about this topic and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Rockwell said Adler opposed an injunction to stop a "company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer." It’s not that simple. Adler, representing Lowe’s in court, opposed a successful push by the City of Sunset Valley and environmental groups to get a temporary injunction to stop Lowe’s from continuing to build a store over the aquifer. In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judge’s order in response said Lowe’s should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasn’t rooted in letting Lowe’s dump -- or stopping Lowe’s from dumping -- petrochemicals. The big issue was whether the site should be built out with up to 40 percent impervious cover or the 15 percent allowed under the SOS ordinance. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13373	Says Colorado Democratic congressional candidate Morgan Carroll "racked up $11 billion in new spending" in the state Legislature.	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/sep/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-morgan-carroll-racked-11-billion/	The National Republican Congressional Committee is running an ad branding Colorado state Sen. Morgan Carroll as a tax-and-spend Democrat. Carroll is challenging Rep. Mike Coffman, a four-term Republican incumbent in the 6th Congressional District, a crescent-shaped swath of Denver suburbs considered one of the country’s most competitive swing districts. The dark, grainy ad begins with an image of the U.S. Capitol building and the narrator saying, "Washington has a spending problem -- and Morgan Carroll would make it worse." "In the (Colorado) Legislature, Carroll racked up $11 billion in new spending, nearly doubling the state budget," the narrator continues. For this fact-check, we’re focusing on the claim that "Carroll racked up $11 billion dollars in new spending, nearly doubling the state budget," making it sound like she played a key role in the increase. In support of its claim, the NRCC provided documentation showing that when Morgan became a Colorado House member in 2004, the total state budget was $14 billion. The budget grew to $25 billion by 2015 -- and Carroll voted for that budget, NRCC noted. To evaluate the accuracy of the ad’s statement, let’s start with a brief primer on Colorado tax history. Colorado lawmakers are restricted by law in how much they can increase the state budget. In 1992, Colorado voters approved a Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, popularly known as TABOR, a constitutional amendment designed to restrain growth in government. As PolitiFact previously reported, the measure said the government can't spend tax money collected under existing tax rates if revenues grow faster than inflation and population. Instead, the government had to rebate that money to taxpayers. These rebates applied to many types of taxes and business fees, but it primarily affected income and sales taxes. TABOR also required any tax increases to be approved by voters. When the 2001-03 recession hit, TABOR compounded a state government fiscal crisis because of it’s so-called "ratchet effect." As the downturn caused state revenues to drop below the previous year’s spending, TABOR’s rules restricted the government’s spending growth to that lower baseline and state revenues plunged -- even as Colorado’s economic growth rebounded. By 2005, many people believed the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights was hurting basic services, particularly education. So voters were asked to approve Referendum C, allowing government to stop refunding excess revenues for the next five years and permanently eliminating the ratchet effect. The measure drew bipartisan support from Colorado's elected leaders, including then Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican. Anti-tax groups vehemently opposed the measure, saying it was a betrayal of TABOR. The NRCC ad hammers Carroll for raising taxes, citing her vote -- along with a majority of the state Legislature -- to place Referendum C on the ballot. But voters approved Referendum C with 52 percent of the vote, allowing the state to keep about $3.7 billion in revenue that otherwise would have been refunded to taxpayers under TABOR. We looked closer at the claim that Carroll "racked up $11 billion dollars in new spending" by voting for the $25 billion budget in 2015. It’s important to note that about one-third of that $25 billion is federal money, over which state lawmakers have little control. Another 30 percent comes from "cash funds," which is money from fines, fees and limited taxes that are allocated by statute to specific programs, including transportation and health care. Lawmakers exercise most of their control over the state’s general fund, which was $9.6 billion in the 2015-16 fiscal year -- or 38.4 percent of the overall budget. Yet Carroll did vote for the Senate conference committee’s budget bill, which passed on a bipartisan 31-2 vote. What the NRCC ad doesn’t mention is that Republicans control the Senate -- not Democrats like Carroll. Both Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and Republican Senate leaders praised the bipartisan collaboration on the $25 billion budget that was described as "reasonable, responsible and delivered on time," by Sen. Kent Lambert, the Republican chairman of the the Joint Budget Committee. Outside observers questioned the ad’s suggestion that one lawmaker is responsible for racking up an $11 billion increase in the budget over 11 years in a Legislature that totals 100 lawmakers and experienced changes in which party controlled the governorship, and both legislative chambers during that time. "This claim strikes me as a huge stretch," Seth Masket, chairman of the political science department at the University of Denver, told PolitiFact. "If Carroll is guilty of this, then so is everyone else who served in the Legislature during that time." "Lawmakers are restricted in their ability to increase the budget," he added. "TABOR restricts growth in government spending to where spending was the previous fiscal year, plus inflation and population growth. But basically, the Joint Budget Committee in the Legislature puts together a budget resolution, and Carroll, along with a majority of legislators, voted to approve it." Our ruling The NRCC said Morgan Carroll "racked up $11 billion in new spending," implying that she had a key role in "nearly doubling the state budget." Carroll did vote for a $25 billion budget in 2015, but the Democrat was joined by a vast majority of lawmakers in a Republican-controlled Senate. The budget’s passage was hailed as a bipartisan accomplishment by both parties. Colorado lawmakers are restricted by law in how much they can increase the state budget. While the NRCC ad focuses on the total budget, lawmakers’ control is largely limited to the general fund, which in 2015 was 38.4 percent of the overall budget. The NRCC’s misleading ad exaggerates Carroll’s responsibility for the budget increase. We rule the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dcb1cf37-14c7-47c5-8465-1a0b9950a77c	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2016-09-28T17:18:04	2016-09-22	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Colorado']

pomt-04687	Says that like Todd Akin, all Texas Republicans in U.S. House cosponsored a bill "that attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/06/lone-star-project/pac-says-todd-akin-and-paul-ryan-all-texas-republi/	Amid bipartisan outcry over a Missouri Republican’s reference to "legitimate rape," a pro-Democratic political action committee drew attention to legislation supposedly containing similar language. "Every single member of the Texas Republican congressional delegation cosponsored the same bill supported by (U.S. Rep. Todd) Akin and Paul Ryan that attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults," said a report circulated Aug. 23, 2012, by the Lone Star Project. PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed in an Aug. 22, 2012, item that Akin and Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee and Wisconsin House member, co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act in July 2010 and again in January 2011. Both versions were written by U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and referred to "forcible" rape; that word was removed from the 2011 bill during congressional deliberations. In all versions of Smith’s legislation, rape or "forcible" rape was mentioned in a section defining exceptions -- that is, cases in which using federal money to pay for abortions would not be prohibited. Lone Star Project researcher Erik Ruselowski emailed us (and we double-checked) that part of the version introduced in the House in 2011: SEC. 309. TREATMENT OF ABORTIONS RELATED TO RAPE, INCEST, OR PRESERVING THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER. The limitations established in sections 301, 302, 303, and 304 shall not apply to an abortion -- (1) if the pregnancy occurred because the pregnant female was the subject of an act of forcible rape or, if a minor, an act of incest; or (2) in the case where the pregnant female suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the pregnant female in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. According to the text (2010’s HR 5939 and 2011’s HR 3) and numerous news stories about the act we read in the Nexis news database, the main purpose of the legislation was not redefining rape but limiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion. Seeking background on the term "forcible," we learned that forcible rape was and is listed as a specific crime in some states and, according to a Jan. 6, 2012, Justice Department press release, was from 1927 through 2011 a part of the definition of rape for purposes of the Uniform Crime Report data that law enforcement agencies supply to the FBI. The "longstanding, narrow definition of forcible rape," according to the release, "is ‘the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will’ " -- penile penetration of the vagina despite physical resistance by the victim. The new, broader definition is: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." FBI Assistant Director David Cuthbertson said in the release, "This change will give law enforcement the ability to report more complete rape offense data, as the new definition reflects the vast majority of state rape statutes." An Aug. 23, 2012, New York Times news story about Akin’s comment said, "States have been adjusting their definitions of rape for the past 30 years, many moving away from the insistence on evidence of force because most rapes do not result in harm to the woman separate from the act itself." So, what did the failed legislation cited by the Lone Star Project propose to do? Since 1976, federal health appropriations acts have included a modification commonly called the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal dollars to pay for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life. Republicans said the Democratic-steered federal health care overhaul, signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010, did not provide enough protections against federal money being used to pay for abortions. One focus of the concerns was state-level insurance "exchanges" established by the act, in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people not insured through employers. A Jan. 1, 2011, Boston Globe news story quoted Smith as saying that without an additional change in law, "we are setting up a funding scheme to pay for abortions." According to the congressional database, Smith’s 2010 bill was short-lived and his amended 2011 bill won approval in the Republican-majority House by a 251-175 vote, with all Republicans and 16 Democrats in favor, but stalled in the Democratic-majority Senate. Notably, the description of rape in Smith’s proposal went farther than the Hyde Amendment, which did not use the word "forcible" but stated simply that abortions are exempted from the bill’s funding restrictions when the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life or is the result of incest or rape. Soon after Smith introduced the bill Jan. 20, 2011, critics called attention to its use of the phrase "forcible rape." A Feb. 1, 2011, Washington Post news story reported that women’s groups objected to the word "forcible" in HR 3: "Critics say the modifier could distinguish it from other kinds of sexual assault that are typically recognized as rape, including statutory rape and attacks that occur because of drugs or verbal threats." The Post quoted cosponsor Rep. Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill., as saying the bill "was not intended to change existing law regarding taxpayer funding for abortion in cases of rape, nor is it expected that it would do so." However, Smith quickly agreed to delete the word because, the Post reported in a Feb. 3, 2011, news story, it was being "misconstrued." A CBS news story the same day quoted Smith spokesman Jeff Sagnip: "The word ‘forcible’ will be replaced with the original language from the Hyde Amendment." House Judiciary Committee press secretary Charlotte Sellmyer told us by email, "The bill was officially amended when the amendment was voted on in committee, which was March 3, 2011." In a phone interview, Lone Star Project founder Matt Angle told us that when he wrote the PAC’s report, he was referring to the Texas members of the U.S. House (the only group that could co-sponsor a bill with House members Akin and Ryan) cosponsoring the act when it was reintroduced Jan. 20, 2011, and afterwards before "forcible" was deleted. "Everybody from District 1, Gohmert, to District 32, Pete Sessions, and all the Republicans in between," Angle said. For perspective, we checked the cosponsors of both the 2010 and 2011 introductions of the bill using THOMAS, the congressional database. The version introduced July 29, 2010, included among its eventual 186 cosponsors all 20 Texas Republicans plus two Democrats -- Solomon Ortiz of Corpus Christi and Henry Cuellar of Laredo -- from the 32-member Texas delegation. The 20 Texas Republicans were, listed by district number, Louie Gohmert of Tyler, Ted Poe of Humble, Sam Johnson of Plano, Ralph Hall of Rockwall, Jeb Hensarling of Dallas, Joe Barton of Ennis, John Culberson of Houston, Kevin Brady of The Woodlands, Michael McCaul of Austin, Michael Conaway of Midland, Kay Granger of Fort Worth, Mac Thornberry of Clarendon, Ron Paul of Lake Jackson, Randy Neugebauer of Lubbock, Lamar Smith of San Antonio, Pete Olson of Sugar Land, Kenny Marchant of Coppell, Michael Burgess of Lewisville, John Carter of Round Rock and Pete Sessions of Dallas. Voters in November 2010 elected three additional Republicans to the Texas delegation. And in 2011, all 23 Texas Republicans in the House but no Texas Democrats were among the 227 legislators who eventually signed on as cosponsors of Smith’s HR 3. The Texas cosponsors were the 20 Republicans from 2010 plus GOP freshmen Bill Flores of Bryan, Francisco "Quico" Canseco of San Antonio and Blake Farenthold of Corpus Christi. Seventeen of the Texans were original cosponsors. Five joined Feb. 8, 2011. The last one, however, got on board March 8 -- after the deletion of "forcible." The latecomer was Culberson, whose office offered no comment when we asked about his timing. We looped back to Angle with our findings on the cosponsors and the intent of the bill. Angle told us that he believes the Texas Republicans showed by cosponsoring the bill that they supported making a legal distinction between rape and forcible rape. Our ruling Except for Culberson in 2011, all Texas Republicans in the House cosponsored versions of the legislation using the word "forcible." But, absent from the PAC’s claim is the fact that two Texas Democrats cosponsored the 2010 proposal, which dampens the suggestion that Republicans alone were committing to placing "forcible" rape into the proposal. And though the PAC said the "bill ... attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults," redefining rape was not the proposal’s purpose. Also, its author agreed to delete the term when critics singled it out. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Lone Star Project	None	None	None	2012-09-06T10:51:41	2012-08-23	['Todd_Akin', 'Texas']

pomt-02422	"Florida high schools are four out of the top 10 in the entire United States."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/mar/04/rick-scott/four-nations-top-10-high-schools-are-florida-rick-/	Gov. Rick Scott has positioned himself as a public education cheerleader as he prepares to face the voters in November. After facing criticism for slashing school spending in 2011, Scott later called for education funding increases and teacher raises. Now in his fourth State of the State address on March 4, 2014, he boasted about the national rankings of our high schools. "Florida high schools are four out of the top 10 in the entire United States," Scott said. We wanted to determine if Scott was correct about the ranking of our high schools. Rankings of high schools Scott’s claim comes from Newsweek’s ranking of "America’s Best High Schools," which looked at public schools and was released in May 2013. Four Florida high schools ranked in the top 10: • No. 2: International Baccalaureate School at Bartow High, Bartow • No. 6: School for Advanced Studies, Miami • No. 9: Suncoast Community High School, Riviera Beach • No. 10: Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville Newsweek invited more than 5,000 high schools to participate and about half responded. The rankings are based on graduation and college acceptance rates, and average SAT/ACT scores based on data from 2011-12 school year. Other factors include scores and enrollment in certain classes such as advancement placement and international baccalaureate. Another often-cited ranking, though, comes from U.S. News and World Report, which uses a different methodology -- and not surprisingly that leads to different results for Florida schools. This ranking, based on data from the 2010-11 school year, shows only one in the top 10 from Florida: Pine View School in Osprey. U.S. News rankings, done together with the American Institutes for Research, cover more than 21,000 public high schools. This analysis takes into account several factors that relate to how a school’s students perform on reading and math tests, including taking into account economically disadvantaged students and minorities. It also examines Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test data. Education Week, a respected publication in the education field, gives an average grade to each state as a whole. Education Week gave Florida a "C" for K-12 achievement, ranking the state at seventh in the country. Education experts We sent Scott’s claim to several education experts to ask their opinion on the Newsweek and U.S. News rankings. None of them embraced these rankings, and they offered several criticisms and caveats. Matthew Di Carlo, an education policy at the Albert Shanker Institute, cautioned that Newsweek’s data from schools is self-reported and only takes into account a small portion of the nation’s high schools. The indicators measured such as graduation and college acceptance rates are predominantly a function of student background. Jeffrey Henig, a Columbia education professor, said that the Newsweek rankings don’t control for certain factors such as socioeconomic status and whether the schools have competitive entry requirements -- as does the school from Miami on the list. "All 'best school' lists have flaws and most have serious ones," Henig said. "Ranking systems that look at test scores or graduation rates or similar outcome measures, without considering the characteristics of the student populations they serve, tell us little about whether listed schools are good ones, and tell us absolutely nothing about the quality of the state systems in which they are located." Our ruling Scott said that "Florida high schools are four out of the top 10 in the entire United States." Newsweek’s rankings released in 2013 support Scott's claim. But education experts say there are several caveats about using that ranking, which is based on self-reported data for a fraction of the nation’s schools. There also are other rankings under which Florida doesn’t fare as well -- for example, the U.S. News rankings include only one Florida school in the top 10, while Education Week gave Florida a "C" for K-12 education statewide.

pomt-06461	"Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/19/hank-johnson/going-green-helps-bring-green-congressman-says/	A recent environmental flare-up in Congress drew the ire of one Georgia representative and an opportunity to dust off the Truth-O-Meter. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson recently used his website to voice his outrage about a bill called the TRAIN Act. The bill passed the House of Representatives in late September with strong support by Republicans who said the act is needed to examine Obama administration environmental policies they say have resulted in higher oil, gas and coal prices. The bill, as of late last week, was in the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Environment and Public Works. Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat, said the bill would block "two of the most important, life-saving Clean Air rules in decades -- the mercury and air toxics rule and cross-state air pollution rule." The congressman then argued it’s false to claim strong environmental regulations hurt big business and used some numbers to back up his case. "Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent," Johnson said. So are Johnson’s numbers correct? The congressman’s office said the information we wanted to check came from the American Lung Association. A spokesman for the association referred us to an Environmental Protection Agency report last year that found emissions for six common pollutants had declined by 63 percent since 1970. The EPA report also found the nation’s gross domestic product has increased by 204 percent in that same time frame. Several experts we spoke with said the EPA’s numbers were on target and had no quarrels with the federal agency’s research. "I think [Johnson] is on point," said Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Health Services. On the economic growth part of the claim, two local economics experts we interviewed thought that number was on target, too. They both looked at GDP data that was adjusted for inflation. Christine Ries, who teaches economics at Georgia Tech, said gross domestic product is the measure most commonly used to measure economic growth. Georgia State University economics department chairwoman Sally Wallace also found no problem with the math in Johnson’s statement. She did suggest we look at per capita income to examine the second part of the congressman’s claim. The growth in that category was also above 200 percent, from $19,167 in 1970 to the 2010 per capita income of $40,584. Johnson’s statement seems to imply that the Clean Air Act did not hurt the economy or even helped it. Wallace wasn’t sure a direct correlation can be made. She researched GDP 10 years before the Clean Air Act passed and the 40 years since and concluded that the average annual growth was greater before 1970. "It’s kind of difficult to say it’s directly related," Wallace told us. Two groups joined forces last year to research the economic impact of the Clean Air Act. The Small Business Majority, an advocacy group for the nation’s 28 million small businesses, and the Main Street Alliance, a national coalition of small business networks in 15 states, concluded in its 10-page report that about 1.3 million jobs were created between 1977 and 1991 as a result of environmental regulations from the Clean Air Act. Using some EPA data, they believe the Clean Air Act’s benefits far outweighed the costs. The report criticized congressional efforts to scale back the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act. For years, as a 2001 paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research noted, manufacturers have argued whether the act puts them at a competitive disadvantage globally. The report by the widely cited think tank looked at 15 years of data and concluded that the regulations "retard industrial activity." Johnson is correct in his statement about the Clean Air Act’s impact on pollution. The rest of his argument was aimed at countering claims that strong environmental policies hurt business. The numbers the congressman used seem to be on target, but there’s some room for debate about the Clean Air Act’s impact on the economy. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-02108	Says Hillary Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and appeared "wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/14/karl-rove/rove-clinton-hospital-stay-and-glasses-point-traum/	If Hillary Clinton decides to run for president, she knows every bit of her life will be put under a microscope. Republican strategist and Fox News commentator Karl Rove proved the point at an event near Los Angeles last Thursday. In remarks reported in the New York Post, Rove raised questions about Clinton’s health following a mild concussion in 2012. "Thirty days in the hospital," Rove said. "And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that." Many people took Rove’s comments to mean that he thinks Clinton has a brain injury, though Rove says he was just raising the question and that it should be part of any presidential vetting. There are two points for us to cover in this fact check -- the time Clinton spent in the hospital and the nature of the glasses she wore for weeks afterward. (She doesn’t wear them now.) First, the background. In December 2012, a stomach virus kept Clinton at home where she fainted and hit her head. During a follow-up visit, doctors spotted a blood clot, admitted her to the hospital and treated her with blood thinners. Clinton was in the hospital for about four days, not 30, a point Rove got wrong. (In a subsequent interview, Rove said it was a "30-day period where she’s fighting something.") Clinton testified near the end of January at a House hearing on the Benghazi, Libya, attack, and was seen wearing the glasses Rove referred to. A State Department spokesman said they were related to issues stemming from her concussion. The peculiar shape of one of the lenses led experts and doctors to conclude they were prismatic glasses. The glasses are designed to help with blurred or double vision, experts told us. We spoke with Steven Galetta, who is chair of the Neurology Department at New York University Medical Center. "About 30 to 50 percent of concussions lead to some kind of visual problem," Galetta said. "When there’s double vision, we can manage it by putting a prism over one eye. It bends the light to line up the image from the other eye." Galetta said the glasses are often optional. Whether someone wears them depends on how quickly the person wants to get back to work. "Most patients resolve (the issues) on their own," he said. "I’d say 85 to 90 percent of these patients do incredibly well and have no recognizable symptoms afterwards." Given Clinton’s job as Secretary of State, Galetta said he could see why her doctors might have jumped in to deal with her complaint. Rove exagerated the tie between the glasses and trauma. Galetta said such lenses are used in cases other than traumatic brain injury. Anything that affects the ocular motor nerves or the way the eyes work together can produce double vision that then might be treated with prismatic glasses. So while Rove said the glasses are used "only" for people with traumatic brain injury, doctors say that is incorrect. More broadly, Rove’s characterization of Clinton’s concussion as a traumatic brain injury generated a bit of concern among the physicians we reached. Doug Smith is a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania. Smith said the public might not understand how broadly the term applies. The Centers for Disease Control report that 2.2 million head injuries sent people to the emergency room in 2010. "Technically, a concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury," Smith said. "But Rove made a linkage that doesn’t fit. Having a concussion and wearing those glasses tell you nothing about a person’s cognitive status. The vast majority of people with concussions make a full recovery." Our ruling Rove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital and then emerged wearing glasses that only people with traumatic brain injury use. Rove since said he was wrong about the length of her hospital stay. The actual number is four days. By describing a long hospital stay and tying it to signs of traumatic brain injury, Rove associated Clinton with a more profound medical episode. Experts reject that association. Concussions are the mildest form of traumatic brain injury. The glasses Clinton wore are an optional treatment for temporary problems of double vision that are relatively common among people who suffer concussions along with other conditions. She has not worn the glasses for some time, and the neurologists we contacted said most people recover fully. While Rove never claimed Clinton suffered brain damage, he was wrong about the hospital stay and combined that with the glasses to exaggerate the nature of Clinton’s injury. His claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2014-05-14T10:48:47	2014-05-08	['None']
pomt-02161	"A lot of the problems with forest fires ... is because of bad policy (not to clear out the forests) that was put in place by environmentalists."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/01/dana-perino/perino-faults-enviros-mega-fires/	America gets a lot of wildfires. Some of them hit grassy rangelands, some hit forests, most are small but some are huge. The 2011 Wallow forest fire in Arizona destroyed over half a million acres. Since 2000, the country has averaged nearly 75,000 fires a year with over 80 million acres lost. There are many causes but Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, focused on just one. Last week on Fox News’ The Five, the conversation turned to climate change and in the middle of making the case that economic growth had to be part of any solution, Perino made a passing reference to fires. "A lot of the problems with forest fires, the major raging ones that happen in the West," Perino said, "Is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists and not clear out the forests." We tried to reach Perino to ask her what she meant by "a lot" and what policies she had in mind. We did not hear from her. In this fact-check, we dig into the rich debate over the role of environmentalists and wildfires. In particular, we aim to see if fire damage would have been substantially less if environmental policies were different. This question is as vast as the nearly 200 million acres managed by U.S. Forest Service, but we found that extensive drought and vast amounts of combustible material played a key role. And what about governments failing to proactively clear out forests? The consensus suggests a mix of factors that include fire policies dating back to the early 1900s and limited budgets to reduce fire hazards. What’s less clear is the role of environmental activists and environmental policies. It is true that environmental regulations and legal challenges by environmental activists frequently delay the work of the Forest Service. It is difficult to say if these delays played a major role in the large fires the country has experienced. Let’s take a look at the big picture, starting with the role of environmentalists. The environmental factor To John Barnwell, director of policy for the Society of American Foresters, a professional education group, the lack of money to prevent fires is primary. But environmentalists and their actions play a role. Barnwell chafes at the long environmental review process and frequent litigation over Environmental Impact Statements that beset the Forest Service. A 2010 analysis from Western Michigan University found that no other agency tops the Forest Service for the number of suits under the National Environmental Policy Act. It averaged about 100 legal challenges each year. In some well-known cases (think of the Spotted Owl in the Pacific Northwest), logging ground to a halt entirely due to environmental protection rules under the Endangered Species Act. Timber harvests on federal land are a fraction of what they were in late 1970s. Ann Camp, a forestry scientist at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says national environmental groups seem to be intractable to compromise. "I can tell you from experience that local environmentalists and local chapters of national environmental organizations have been on board for some activities," Camp said. "But the national chapters nixed their involvement and had already decided to contest the outcome -- whatever it was if it included any level of harvesting." We found the case of a New Mexico fire where a Forest Service thinning project that might have reduced the damage was delayed by appeals from two environmental groups. On the other hand, we also found examples where environmental groups worked hand in hand with loggers and state and national officials to move many projects forward. And Camp noted that some large fires took place in remote areas where no logging of any sort had ever been planned. Plus, fires have struck in forests where extensive harvests took place. There is no question that environmental rules and lawsuits delay and sometimes block activities on federal lands, but it is difficult to prove that absent those moves that the western states would have avoided their mega fires. And there are several other factors that play a more prominent role, experts say. The paradox of too little fire When Congress wants an impartial analysis, it turns to its in-house think tank, the Congressional Research Service. In 2012, the CRS looked at the causes of wildfire damage. That report said the roots of recent mega fires are "excess biomass in the forests, due to past logging and grazing and a century of fire suppression, combined with an expanding wildland-urban interface — more people and houses in and near the forests — and climate change, exacerbating drought and insect and disease problems." A huge part of the reason we see huge fires today, the CRS report and experts say, is that we were too quick to put out fires. Around 1910 a series of massive fires wiped out entire towns. In two days, Washington, Montana, and Idaho lost 3 million acres of woodland. The fires led to a cry for the federal government to beef up its efforts to put fires out as quickly as possible. "Our forestry tradition comes from central Europe, which has always had a paradigm that fire was bad for forests," Camp said. Historically, periodic fires cleared out the undergrowth while allowing mature, healthy trees to survive. But with the focus on keeping fires small (the mantra was to put out every fire by 10 a.m. the day after it was reported), the amount of combustible material grew. The growth of grazing livestock also reduced naturally occurring fires by creating gaps in the terrain that stopped a fire from spreading. The result: In the 1800s, a natural stand of Ponderosa Pine, a common species in the West, might have a few dozen trees per acre. Today, hundreds of smaller trees might be squeezed into the same area. When fire hits, it burns hotter and moves faster. Instead of running along the ground, it jumps into the crown of the trees where the winds drive it even more. Many millions of acres of forest face this risk. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Forest Service policy began to shift in earnest toward viewing fire as a potential ally in managing the forests. But today, the Forest Service describes this legacy as the equivalent of a toxic dump. A hazard that built up over decades remains in place and is potentially lethal. Too little water The new millennium opened with an extended drought that left much of the western United States primed for fire. Peter Brown, a researcher at Colorado State University, has studied the fingerprints of fires over the centuries in the growth rings of trees. "Fire is driven by climate," Brown said. "The first thing you need, besides something like a lightning strike for ignition, is dry conditions." The years from 2000 to 2004 were spectacularly dry. Colorado State researchers said the drought was the strongest in 800 years. It killed trees, made the ones that lived more vulnerable to insects and turned the ground cover into tinder. The 2011 Wallow fire in Arizona came after a winter with little precipitation. The combination of dry ground, dry wood and grasses and strong winds produced a fire that in five weeks burned as many acres as had burned in the previous 25 years. Too little money, too much land The federal government has tried to come to terms with the legacy of a management policy that left too much fuel in the forests. Just as the nation was entering one its worst periods of fire, the Forest Service laid out an ambitious plan to clear away that excess scrub, brush and small trees. Called the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, it aimed to use controlled burns and physical removal to treat 6.9 million acres per year. An assessment by Northern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute highlighted the gap between that goal and the reality. In 2011, the agency planned to reduce the risk of fire in an additional 960,000 acres. "Th­e number of acres treated in Fiscal Year 2011 is not even close to number of acres proposed per year in the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, or that are needed to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire at the landscape scale," the assessment said. At the heart of this problem is money. Barnwell said the Forest Service has been so busy fighting fires, it has needed to use the money that had been budgeted to prevent them. "Over the past 10 years, they borrowed $3.4 billion from other activities to pay for fire suppression," Barnwell said. "Congress will put some of that back, but they’ve missed a season to do really important work. They can never get ahead." We found wide agreement that these fire prevention projects need to take place on a very large scale if they are to tamp down on the mega fires. The Congressional Research Service advised that the odds make it unlikely that the land you clear will be the one where a fire will take hold -- there are just too many acres to cover. By the CRS’ count, the odds that any given acre will catch fire are no more than 1 out of 100. Thus, you have to treat a lot of acres and that has not happened. Lastly, Perino broadly faulted policies "put in place by environmentalists." But both the National Environmental Policy Act (1969) and the Endangered Species Act (1973) passed either unanimously or with overwhelming bipartisan support. President Ronald Reagan signed significant revisions into law. Perino’s characterization seems like an oversimplification. Our ruling Perino said, "A lot of the problems with forest fires is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists." The crux of this fact-check really comes down to how you define "a lot." While the record shows that the need for environmental impact statements and legal challenges have a significant impact on Forest Service projects on federal lands, the connection to the extreme fires of the past 15 years is less certain. Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame. Perino’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False. Update: The Forest Service drew funds from other programs over a 10-year period to pay for fire suppression. A previous version of this fact-check was unclear on this point..

Walker proposed an increase of $649 million in education spending in the 2017-18 school year. However, the Legislature approved a budget that brings the boost down to $639 million, by spending less than what Walker proposed on rural schools and high-performing Milwaukee schools. 	verified	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/04/21/did-gov-scott-walker-cut-1-6b-in-education-funding-in-his-first-budget/	None	None	None	Pawan Naidu	None	Did Gov.

pomt-11607	"They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013" for immigration legislation, and "each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/26/ronald-brownstein/did-senators-pass-immigration-reform-bills-2006-20/	In a discussion about the recent three-day government shutdown — due to lawmakers' disagreement over federal funding and policies for young immigrants in the country illegally, so-called Dreamers — pundit Ronald Brownstein said that while many Americans want Dreamers to stay, it’s unclear if that can be achieved. Twice before, senators have agreed on immigration reform, but each time, the prospect fell through without action from the U.S. House of Representatives, said Brownstein, a senior political analyst for CNN. "They probably can find 60 votes in the Senate to do that. They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013 for immigration reform. And each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up," said Brownstein, who’s also senior editor at The Atlantic. "Without the president's leverage, without him leaning on House Republicans, you could easily see the same thing again." The Dreamers are in limbo after the Trump administration rescinded a program that prevented their deportation. President Donald Trump has tweeted that "nobody knows for sure" if a deal will be reached and that it must include funding for his border wall with Mexico. Is Brownstein right about the 2006 and 2013 immigration push? He’s got his history right, and we thought it was worth reviewing in depth. May 2006: Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, 62-36 The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed in the Senate on May 25, 2006, along a 62-36 vote. The bill included provisions to strengthen border security with fencing, vehicle barriers, surveillance technology and more personnel; a new temporary worker visa category; and a path to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally if they met specific criteria. Then-President George W. Bush commended the Senate "for passing bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform" and said he looked forward to working with both chambers. But the bill was never taken up by the House. The House in December 2005 passed a separate bill with greater focus on border security and enforcement, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. That proposal narrowed in on employment eligibility verification; immigration fraud; and immigration enforcement authority at state and local levels. It did not include a guest worker program or the legalization of immigrants. Instead of voting on the Senate bill, House Republican leaders held a series of summer "field hearings" to get the public to weigh in on controversial provisions in the Senate bill, which Republicans labeled as amnesty. ''Our No. 1 priority is to secure the border,'' then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, of Illinois, said in June 2006. "And right now I haven't heard a lot of pressure to have a path to citizenship.'' In September 2006, after meeting with Republican leaders, Hastert said they agreed "that we cannot support totally" a lot of the provisions in the Senate bill, because it "would not secure the border. Matter of fact, it erased the border." Lawmakers from both chambers never formed a conference committee to iron out the details in both bills and the proposals expired at the end of the 109th Congress. June 2013: Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, 68-32 Backed by Democrats and 14 Republicans, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act passed the Senate on a 68-32 vote on June 27, 2013. The bill directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. It also included provisions to allow immigrants in the country illegally to adjust their immigration status, if they met certain criteria. "The bipartisan bill that passed today was a compromise … Today, the Senate did its job. It’s now up to the House to do the same," said then-President Barack Obama. But House Republicans again opposed the Senate immigration proposal, arguing that border security needed to be addressed first before legalizing the status of millions of immigrants. "I’ve made it clear and I’ll make it clear again, the House does not intend to take up the Senate bill," then-House Speaker John Boehner said July 2013. "The House is going to do its own job in developing an immigration bill." He reiterated his position in November 2013: "The idea that we’re going to take up a 1,300-page bill that no one had ever read, which is what the Senate did, is not going to happen in the House," Boehner said. "And frankly, I’ll make clear we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill." Our ruling Brownstein said, "They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013" for immigration legislation, and "each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up." Senators did pass immigration bills in 2006 and 2013 with 62 and 68 votes, respectively. Both times, House Republicans did not address the proposals on the House floor.

pomt-14324	"It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-us-negotiated-agreement-made-it-ea/	The United States needs to work more closely with Europe to stymie international terrorism, especially stopping westerners from flocking to the Islamic State, said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The recent terrorist attack in Belgium, not six months after the Paris attacks, has raised concerns about European security and intelligence sharing. At a March 23 speech in California, Clinton highlighted some perceived security deficiencies among European Union nations. "It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state," she said. This claim intrigued us, so we reached out to some experts to see if Clinton was on target. Clinton is talking about the United States–European Union Agreement on Passenger Name Records, a bilateral measure intended to increase the government’s ability to track who is coming into the country. The agreement was signed in 2011 and went into effect in 2012, when Clinton was in office. As a result of this agreement, the European Union provides the United States Department of Homeland Security with passenger name records for every flight from a European Union country to the United States, and vice versa. Passenger name records are essentially very detailed flight manifests, containing information like how far in advance travelers bought their tickets, whether they made specific seat requests and even how many bags they checked. (The European Union has similar agreements with Canada and Australia.) Every expert we queried pointed out that much of the negotiation legwork on this agreement took place before Clinton joined the State Department in 2009. Though the agreement currently in effect was finalized while Clinton headed the State Department, this was the final in a series of negotiations and precursor agreements spanning about a decade following the Sept. 11, 2001, World Trade Center attacks. The standing 2012 version responded to Europeans’ information privacy concerns, and this final push happened during Clinton’s tenure. "The agreement that Clinton was involved in is the culmination of successive agreements, beginning with the impact of 9/11," said Mai’a Cross, an expert in European foreign and security policy at Northeastern University. So, while Clinton's role is up for some debate, the United States does get flight manifests from the E.U. But Clinton also said that all E.U. nations don't share that information with each other. That's accurate, at least for right now. U.S. law requires passenger name record data for any flight entering or leaving the country, but the European Union currently does not. And flight information collection policies are not universal among all 28 European Union members. For example, the United Kingdom has had its own passenger name record system in place for incoming flights, noted Kaija Schilde, an expert on Europe and transatlantic security at Boston University. She added that this issue is further complicated by the Schengen Area, a group of 26 European countries that allow passport-free travel between member countries. So if the United States wants passenger information about a flight from Germany to the New York City, that is an easier get than if Germany wants the same passenger information about a flight from Italy, said Eva-Maria Maggi, a European Union expert at the University of Arizona. This is a result of the U.S.-E.U. agreement but also the fact that the European Union doesn’t have a passenger name record policy similar to the United States, Maggi said. To be clear, the United States does not collect this information for flights that do not enter or leave the United States, like an Italy to Germany flight. Proponents of a European Union-wide system say one of the benefits of such a system is that it would harmonize these differences among member nations. In fact, one such system is on the table, and experts told us the European Parliament will likely approve it in the next couple months. In direct response to the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the Council of the European Union approved text for a policy that would require passenger name record data for all international flights entering or leaving the European Union. The law would also allow, but not require, member states to collect passenger name records for flights between member countries. Cross noted that passenger name records are just a narrow slice of intelligence information. "If you’re talking intelligence sharing more generally, there has been more sharing within Europe than with other countries," she said. Our ruling Clinton said, "It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state." Clinton’s claim is, for the most part, on target. The European Union has an agreement with the United States to provide passenger name records for all U.S.-E.U. air travel. While this was mostly negotiated before Clinton took office, the final push happened in 2011, when she was serving as secretary of state. Countries within the European Union do not have a uniform passenger name record collection policy, so they might not be able to share the same information amongst each other as easily. However, the European Union is on the verge of enacting a policy that would require passenger name record collection for all flights entering and leaving the union.

pomt-09020	"At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/08/mark-kirk/senate-candidate-mark-kirk-says-rival-gave-mobster/	In a mud-slinging fest in the race for President Barack Obama's old Illinois U.S. Senate seat, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, the Republican candidate, has hammered Democratic opponent Alexi Giannoulias for his tenure working as a senior loan officer for his family's Broadway Bank. In a Kirk campaign TV ad called "Risky," the announcer says, "At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed." We decided to weigh in because this has been the most frequent attack on Giannoulias. And because we like the nicknames. Let's start with Michael "Jaws" Giorango. He was convicted in 1991 of federal bookmaking charges in Chicago. His business with Broadway Bank began long before Giannoulias joined the bank as vice president and a senior loan officer, a job he held from 2002 to 2006. But according to a March 2, 2010, story in the Chicago Tribune -- which has done much of the investigative heavy-lifting here -- Giorango and his new partner, Demitri Stavropoulos, came to the bank in mid 2004, and during a 14-month period when Giannoulias was a senior loan officer, secured about $20 million in new loans. As Broadway was financing land deals in Chicago, Florida, California and South Carolina, Stavropoulos in 2005 began a two-year sentence on a felony conviction for running a multi-state bookmaking ring, while Giorango served time for promoting a nationwide prostitution scheme, the Chicago Tribune found. In July 2009, Broadway Bank filed foreclosure lawsuits seeking to recoup $12.9 million in defaulted loans made to the pair. So there's no question that these were "risky" loans, as the ad put it. But what was Giannoulias' role in these loans? He was a senior loan officer at the bank at the time, but there's no evidence he approved them. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Giannoulias' older brother, Demetris Giannoulias, the bank's president and CEO, said he established Broadway's relationship with Giorango in the mid 1990s. And Alexi Giannoulias maintains that throughout his association with the bank, the client relationship with Giorango was managed by Alexi’s father and brother. "In a case like this, where Alexi had no role in managing the client relationship, his responsibilities were more administrative, like getting appraisals ordered and loan documents prepared, coordinating with attorneys, and preparing commitment letters," said Matt McGrath, a spokesman for the Giannoulias campaign. Initially, Giannoulias downplayed his relationship with Giorango as someone he had met at the bank a few times. But in April, Giannoulias said he traveled to Miami to inspect property the bank had financed for Giorango and met with him there, the Tribune reported. In addition to Giorango, the other two ne'er-do-wells pictured in the Kirk ad are former state Sen. John D'Arco and Boris Stratievsky. D'Arco -- convicted of federal corruption charges -- came into play because his name appeared in legal documents in connection with a Giorango company that purchased the Lorraine Hotel in Miami Beach. According to a 2006 story in Crain's Chicago Business, however, Broadway Bank released a statement saying that D’Arco's name does not appear on mortgage papers, "has never been a loan applicant, recipient, co-signer, guarantor or customer" of Broadway, and does not hold an ownership share in the hotel deal. According to Giannoulias' spokesman McGrath, "the Giorango loans included money that went to the purchase of the Lorraine Hotel in Miami in 2001, a land deal which state Sen. John D'Arco was involved in with Giorango." Giannoulias, however, "joined the bank in 2002 after graduating from law school, so this transaction predated his time there." Which brings us to reputed Russian mobsters Lev and Boris Stratievsky. According to a March 13, 2010, story in the Chicago Sun-Times, Giannoulias signed off on $20 million in loans to the father and son. According to McGrath, Giannoulias was not on the loan committee that approved the loans and he did not manage the bank's relationship with them. More importantly, McGrath correctly noted, Lev and Boris "Half Dollar" Stratievsky had no criminal background at the time of the loans. Boris Stratievsky pleaded guilty in May 2008 to federal money-laundering charges, and Lev has since died. "Even a criminal background check wouldn't have turned anything up," McGrath said. So it would be incorrect to say, as the ad did, that Stratievsky was a "convicted mobster" when Broadway Bank made him a loan. One last point. The ad says "At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed." The bank did collapse. On April 23, 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that Broadway Bank was closed by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. According to a press release, "the FDIC and MB Financial Bank, National Association entered into a loss-share transaction on $878.4 million of Broadway Bank's assets." And the FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be $394.3 million. The ad, however, suggests that risky loans to mobsters caused the bank collapse, and that's a big stretch. More accurately, the bank invested heavily in construction and development and could not weather the collapse of the real estate market. The losses sustained in loans made to Giorango while Giannoulias was a senior loan officer, while substantial, were a relative drop in the bucket in the overall scheme of the bank's woes. In summary, D'Arco's involvement involved a loan that predated Giannoulias' time at Broadway Bank. Stratievsky had not been charged with anything when Broadway made loans to him. As for Giorango, his relationship with Broadway Bank began long before Giannoulias came on board. But as the Chicago Tribune detailed, the bank made Giorango an additional $20 million in new loans while Giannoulias was a senior loan officer. There's no evidence Giannouias approved the loans, but he did some work on them. Still, we think it's awfully misleading to suggest losses on risky loans to convicted felons led to the bank's demise (though they certainly didn't help). In all, we think that all shakes out to a Half True.	None	Mark Kirk	None	None	None	2010-07-08T18:28:08	2010-06-30	['None']
pomt-08496	Harry Reid "voted to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/08/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-attacks-harry-reid-over-giving-sex-o/	Judging by her newest television ad, Sharron Angle, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate from Nevada, is banking on the idea that even Sin City voters have limits on acceptable behavior. In an ad released Oct. 7, 2010, Angle accuses Harry Reid of voting to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders. The ad begins by attacking Reid on immigration, repeating a charge from one of Angle's earlier ads that Reid voted "to give illegal aliens special tax breaks and Social Security benefits." When the initial ad came out, we rated those claims False and Barely True, respectively. In this article, we'll focus on the Viagra claim. The narrator says, "Here's the kicker: Reid actually voted to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders. What else could you ever need to know about Harry Reid?" Our friends at PolitiFact Texas analyzed a similar -- but not identical -- claim in June, so we'll rely in part on their reporting. The charge stems from the health care law passed by Congress earlier this year. By 2014, states must create exchanges in which individuals can buy insurance from a choice of four plans that must meet minimum standards, although premiums, out-of-pocket costs and benefits may differ. To limit costs for indigent residents, premiums and costs such as deductibles and co-payments will be subsidized for people with incomes between 133 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2009 ranged from $29,327 to $88,200 for a family of four. For instance, people with incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level will only be responsible for one-third of their out-of-pocket costs; the federal government will pay the rest. Last spring, Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican opposed to the Democratic-sponsored health care plan, requested a report by the Congressional Research Service -- the nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- that examined the Viagra question. CRS concluded that the law does "not appear to prohibit... coverage for drugs prescribed to treat [erectile dysfunction] for a non-incarcerated beneficiary who was previously convicted of rape, child molestation or another sex offense." Nor, the memo states, would those individuals "appear to be excluded from enrolling in a qualified health plan offered through an American Health Benefit Exchange in their state solely because of that conviction." The number of people potentially affected isn't trivial. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, about 704,700 sex offenders are registered in the United States, including the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. Coburn offered an amendment to the health care bill that would "reduce the cost of providing federally funded prescription drugs by eliminating fraudulent payments and prohibiting coverage of Viagra for child molesters and rapists and for drugs intended to induce abortion." By the time the Senate took up the amendment on March 24, 2010, the margin for passing the bill was extremely narrow, and the bill's sponsors knew that any changes, no matter how small, could effectively kill the bill. So they fought Coburn's amendment for procedural reasons, hoping to save the bill as a whole and knowing that they would almost certainly be called to account for their "no" vote during the 2010 campaign. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., encouraged his colleagues to reject the amendment, arguing, "This is a serious bill. This is a serious debate. The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of the Senate, the debate and the American people... It is a crass political stunt aimed at making 30-second commercials, not public policy." Ultimately, the amendment failed, 57-42, with Reid among those voting against it. The health care law eventually was signed into law, and Baucus was quite right that it would show up in 30-second commercials. So how accurate is Angle's charge? The ad implies that Reid actively wanted to give subsidized Viagra to sex offenders, but that isn't the case. First, what Reid actually did was vote against an amendment that would have stopped using taxpayer dollars for that purpose. Second, Senate Democrats made it clear at the time that they were not voting on the merits of the amendment, but rather to salvage their bigger legislative priority, the health care bill itself. Finally, Reid didn't actively bring up this issue; it was proposed by a senator opposed to the broader health care bill. We should also mention that the use of taxpayer dollars for sex-offender Viagra was -- and is -- a hypothetical. While CRS concluded that there was nothing in the current law to stop it from happening, the earliest it could start is in 2014 -- so there's ample time for lawmakers or federal officials to write laws or regulations to stop it before then. Finally, whatever taxpayer subsidies for sex offenders may materialize after 2014 would not go to all sex offenders; it would go to the subset of sex offenders who get their health care through the exchanges and who also qualify for subsidies. The ad is correct that Reid voted against a prohibition on taxpayer-subsidized Viagra for sex offenders. But the ad leaves out a lot of important context that, if it had been included, would have given a different impression. We rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11789	"The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr – more than average in-state college tuition."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/nov/22/stacey-abrams/claim-georgia-child-care-picks-its-numbers-make-ca/	While announcing her child care plan, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams claimed that the average cost of childcare in Georgia is more than the average in-state tuition. The claim first appeared on Nov.15 in a Tweet promoting "The Bold Action for a Bright Future Plan". "The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr – more than average in-state college tuition," read the post. The Abrams campaign pulled this information from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank that researches economic trends. The EPI's data says that in Georgia, infant care costs an average of $7,644 a year, 15.6 percent more than the state’s annual average in-state tuition. The EPI’s estimated infant costs come from Child Care Aware of America’s 2015 "Parents and the High Cost of Child Care" report. The report calculates the averages of two types of infant care, care offered at a facility and care offered at someone’s home.The $7,644 used by the EPI is the more expensive type of infant care, care offered at a facility. According to the report, the average cost of childcare provided in a caregiver’s home in Georgia is $5,980 a year. According to EPI, Georgia's average in-state tuition estimate was taken from a 2014 survey conducted by the National Center of Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Education Department. The total cost of tuition and required fees in a public university in Georgia averages out to $6,614 a year. So Abrams' number is accurate if the comparison is between child care at a facility and in-state college tuition. But it’s not correct if the comparison is with child care provided in a home. Abrams is not the first, and possibly not the last politician to make this type of comparison. Back in 2014, PolitiFact checked President Barack Obama's claim that in 31 states "decent" childcare cost more than college tuition. Back then, Obama also used Child Care Aware of America as a source. We rated his claim as Mostly True. Our ruling Abrams tweeted, "The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr – more than average in-state college tuition." Abrams is correct if the comparison is between child care at a facility and college tuition, at $7,644 vs. $6,614. But child care offered in someone’s home -- at $5,980 -- is less that in-state college tuition. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important facts. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-02588	During the past four years, "average wages have barely budged."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/28/barack-obama/state-union-obama-says-over-past-four-years-averag/	One of the key themes of President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was income inequality. "Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better," Obama said. "But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by - let alone get ahead. And too many still aren't working at all." Here, we will check Obama’s claim that during the past four years, "average wages have barely budged." At PolitiFact, one of our core principles is "words matter." So in this item, we will look at average wages -- not the median wage, and not the average (or median) family income or household income. We found two federal data sets that look at the average wage. • The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates These statistics are based on data collected from employers in all industry sectors and in all types of regions nationwide. The most recent year available is 2012. Year Mean annual wage, all occupations Inflation-adjusted mean annual wage in 2012 dollars 2008 $42,270 $45,076 2009 $43,460 $46,510 2010 $44,410 $46,760 2011 $45,230 $46,166 2012 $45,790 $45,790 So according to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 8.3 percent between 2008 and 2012. (We also looked at the changes between 2009 and 2012, since either date range seems a plausible "four-year" period to us, and the numbers were similar..) However, this raw wage data doesn’t take into account inflation -- something economists like to consider when determining whether a wage "barely budged." When you use an inflation calculator, the average wage from 2008 was equivalent to $45,075 in 2012 dollars, meaning that the inflation-adjusted wage rose during that period, but only narrowly -- about 1.6 percent. By this data, Obama is correct. • The Social Security Administration's National Average Wage Index These are the numbers used to calculate Social Security recipients’ benefit levels. Here’s the breakdown: Year National average wage In 2012 dollars 2008 $41,335 $44,079 2009 $40,712 $43,569 2010 $41,674 $43,879 2011 $42,980 $43,869 2012 $44,322 $44,322 According to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 7.2 percent between 2008 and 2012. After you adjust for inflation, the average wage from 2008 was $44,079 in 2012 dollars. So from 2008-12, the inflation-adjusted wage rose by less than 1 percent. Whichever data you use, the increases are pretty modest, particularly given that they were spread out over a four-year period. Our ruling Obama said that during the past four years, "average wages have barely budged." Two federal data sets broadly agree: Over the most recent four-year period, the average wage has risen no more than 1.7 percent above inflation. That’s a rising wage -- but by a small amount, about a half a percentage point above inflation per year. We think that’s a reasonable definition for "barely budged." So we rate Obama’s claim True.

pomt-09557	Health care reform "would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/01/barack-obama/health-care-reform-estimates-deficit-reduction-are/	President Barack Obama continued to promote Democratic proposals to reform health care during his State of the Union address. He rebutted charges that it costs too much and pointed out that budget experts believe it could reduce the deficit. "It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses," Obama said. "And according to the Congressional Budget Office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades." Obama is correct that the Congressional Budget Office, with its teams of economists and legislative analysts, has found that the Senate Democratic health care plan not only pays for itself but brings down the deficit. That's because the plan includes new tax provisions and cost-savings measures to pay for its spending. The CBO found the Senate Democrats' version of health care reform would reduce the deficit by $132 billion over 10 years. The deficit is expected to go down because tax increases and cost savings in the bill are expected to exceed the cost of the new programs and tax credits. So how does Obama get to $1 trillion over 20 years? The CBO usually only calculates the impact of legislation's cost over 10 years. But it will create calculations for a longer period if Congress requests it. The CBO doesn't like to calculate longer than 10 years because many variables are difficult to predict. Here's what the CBO had to say about calculating health reform's effect on the deficit between 2020 and 2030: "Although CBO does not generally provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period (2010 through 2019 currently), Senate rules require some information about the budgetary impact of legislation in subsequent decades, and many Members have requested CBO analyses of the long-term budgetary impact of broad changes in the nation’s health care and health insurance systems. A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal." In fact, the CBO won't even present its findings as a straightforward dollar number, but instead as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or GDP, which is a number that measures a nation's economic output. The CBO said that over the second 10 years, the Senate proposal should reduce the deficit by about one-quarter to one-half percent of GDP. Obama's $1 trillion figure is an extrapolation of what one-fourth to one-half of 1 percent of GDP might be. (The White House press office confirmed that this was how he arrived at that number.) According to the CBO's latest numbers, GDP will be $22.5 trillion in 2020. You can do a rough estimate and find that you could get to roughly $1 trillion over 20 years, especially if you lean closer to one-half of 1 percent rather than a quarter. We ran all this by Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Institution. He said that the numbers aren't phony, but that Obama tries to put a hard number on something that is inherently unpredictable. "You really can't model GDP 15 years from now," he said. Riedl also said he thought Congress would not be able to stick to some of the spending reductions contained in the Democratic proposals, especially in regards to Medicare. We also asked Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, what he thought of the formulation. Horney said the CBO officials don't give a precise number because they don't have official estimates for the overall economy, called a baseline, for the second 10 years. "They correctly hesitate to put in precise numbers that might make people think they do have a 20-year baseline," he said. As for Obama's $1 trillion number, Horney said, "It's a little speculative, but if you say in your speech it will reduce the deficit one-quarter to one-half percent of GDP, no one listening to the State of the Union would have a clue as to what you meant, and it would make it sound like a tiny amount when it's not." So Obama is relying on some very shaky estimates here. He would have been on firmer ground if he had simply said that during the second 20 years, the CBO found that health care would continue to improve the deficit. He gave himself some leeway was by saying it could be "as much as" $1 trillion, but that's an estimate that the CBO itself didn't produce. In fact, the CBO said the uncertainties involved are too great to create detailed projections. For putting a firm number on the CBO's carefully hedged projection, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-13332	Says GOP Congressional candidate Scott Jones "wants to build a wall. He wants to round people up and deport folks."	half-true	/california/statements/2016/oct/05/ami-bera/does-calif-republican-scott-jones-want-build-wall-/	Democratic Congressman Ami Bera has repeatedly described his Republican challenger’s immigration stance as "extreme," saying it compares with Donald Trump’s. Bera tried to draw that connection again during a recent interview with Capital Public Radio, in which he said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones "wants to build a wall" and "wants to round people up and deport folks." Bera and Jones are in a tight race for suburban Sacramento County’s 7th Congressional District. Here’s Bera’s recent statement in context: "I mean this is a guy Scott Jones who’s extreme, extreme on immigration. You know he wants to build a wall. He wants to round people up and deport folks and yeah I’m worried that Scott Jones and Donald Trump are right there in tandem on immigration and I disagree with that approach." In May, Jones said he planned to vote for Trump for president. Three months later, he said he did not know who he would vote for. Bera is backing Hillary Clinton. We decided to fact check whether Jones "wants to build a wall," and whether he "wants to round people up and deport folks." Our research Asked to back up the "build a wall" assertion, the Bera campaign pointed to a widely-viewed November 2014 video in which Jones calls on President Obama to reform immigration. Jones made the video weeks after Sacramento County Sheriff’s Deputy Danny Oliver was killed during a shooting rampage by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported twice. At the end, Jones says: "An American patriot, Ronald Reagan, once told Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev to ‘tear down this wall,’ to preserve democracy and secure safety and freedom for a nation. Mr. President, I’m asking you to build up that wall for the very same reasons." Scott Jones makes the "build up that wall" comment at the 7:00 minute mark in the video above. Jack Pitney, professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College and former Republican National Committee staffer, said "it’s a stretch" to say Jones was advocating for the same massive wall along the Southern border that Trump has since called for. "It’s an exaggeration of what (Jones) has said in the past," Pitney said, adding it’s not exactly clear what Jones meant by "build up that wall." In the "Immigration Reform Plan" released by the Jones campaign last month, Jones called for a "combination of beefed-up border patrols, increased fencing and technology, and certain consequences for illegal entry will help us keep America safe," to secure the border. A spokesman for the Jones campaign said in a statement: "Sheriff Scott Jones has never advocated for building a wall on the entirety of the Southern Border." "Round people up and deport folks" To back up its claim that Jones wants to "round people up and deport folks," the Bera campaign pointed to Jones’ support for the federal Davis-Oliver bill. That legislation, according to a Washington Post article, would authorize state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law and direct money to help in that effort. It would also punish localities that have created "sanctuary cities," where illegal immigrants need not fear being arrested for their immigration status. It is named after the Sacramento County deputy killed in 2014, and Placer County Detective Michael Davis, Jr., who was also killed in the rampage. Trump specifically mentioned and supported that bill during his immigration policy speech in August. The Bera campaign says the bill would "amount to a strategy for comprehensive mass deportation." Pitney said linking Jones to the federal bill shows the Bera campaign has "at least a smidgen of documentation" to back up part of its claim. The professor noted, however, that deportations are common under Republican and Democratic administrations alike. Jones has not called "for the mass deportation of those in our country illegally," his campaign said. In his reform plan, Jones says: "All immigrants currently living here illegally should be given a pathway to legal status, provided they register and pass criminal background checks. Working immigrants should be allowed to stay and support their families, pay taxes, and live out of the shadows." When the Sacramento Bee asked Jones in January about his immigration stance, he responded: "No. 1, you are not going to deport 11 million people. I wouldn’t even advise you do that because by and large they are productive members of our community. They deserve more than what we are giving them despite the fact that they are here illegally. I would advocate for a pathway to legal status for each and every one of them." In the 2014 video, Jones also said he was open to a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s undocumented immigrants. Our ruling Congressman Ami Bera said his Republican challenger Scott Jones "wants to build a wall. He wants to round people up and deport folks." There’s some truth to that: In a 2014 video, Jones calls on President Obama to reform immigration and to "build up that wall," to "preserve democracy and secure safety and freedom for a nation." The statement hints at Jones’ possible preference for border security. But his official immigration reform plan released last month calls for "increased fencing and technology," and doesn’t mention the word "wall." Bera’s next claim that Jones wants to deport people might be technically correct: Jones has called for deporting undocumented immigrants "who have committed serious crimes." Bera’s overall statement is partially accurate.

pomt-13876	Proposed NC law for body camera footage gives police "broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/01/aclu-north-carolina/aclu-north-carolina-police-will-have-significant-p/	A bill that passed the N.C. General Assembly on Wednesday will create statewide rules for police body camera and dash camera footage, if Gov. Pat McCrory signs it into law. UPDATE 7/11/16: McCrory signed the bill into law. The bill’s main sponsors – two Republican members of the N.C. House who are retired law enforcement officers – have said it strikes a balance between the interests of police and the public. But open-government advocates including the state American Civil Liberties Union chapter say the opposite – that this bill would give police inordinate power to keep footage shielded from the public. "Giving law enforcement such broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed – will damage law enforcement’s ability to build trust with the public and destroy any potential this technology had to make officers more accountable to the communities they serve," said ACLU attorney Susanna Birdsong in a news release. We can’t see the future, so we won’t try to say whether keeping video footage secret will damage law enforcement’s public image and accountability. But we can look at just how easily footage could be kept secret if the bill becomes law. Two levels of publicity The bill would establish two ways for members of the public to view police video – disclosure and release. 1. Disclosure: When people are allowed to watch the video but can’t make copies of it or otherwise show it to the general public. Disclosure would only be available to people who are seen or heard in their video (or people who represent them, like lawyers or guardians). And even then it’s not guaranteed. Like the ACLU said, police can still decide the video requires so much secrecy that even people in the video can’t see it. 2. Release: The more typical meaning of something being made public. It’s an option for anyone who believes the video footage should be available for the public to see at any time. That includes reporters who wish to show the footage the the public as well as people who want copies of the footage to use as evidence in lawsuits, for example. Under the proposed law, release would only be possible if a judge signs off on the request. The status quo For any type of police video footage right now, there’s no explicit statewide standard. What’s considered public varies from agency to agency, according to Frayda Bluestein, a UNC-Chapel Hill law and government professor. One of the bill’s cosponsors, Asheboro Republican Allen McNeill, argued that the bill will improve transparency since many agencies now make these videos personnel records, which are hard for the public to access. Bluestein has studied the issue for years. She said most videos are considered investigative records, although some are classified as personnel records. In either case, she said, it’s still possible for the public to successfully open up those records simply by asking the agency. And if that fails, the courts are there to decide who is right. But the proposed law would make a trip to court the only option, even for the most innocuous footage. Who gains from transparency? Nationwide, police footage of officers shooting, choking and beating people have given rise to civil lawsuits, criminal charges and movements like Black Lives Matter. The Raleigh News & Observer recently used jailhouse video obtained by a public records request in Harnett County to show the official account of an inmate’s death differed from what actually happened. Other times, the police themselves have released videos in order to defend their officers’ actions. It’s rare in North Carolina, but not unheard of. Greensboro officials released body cam video last month of an officer shooting and killing a woman in 2014. Last year Lincolnton police released body cam footage leading up to an officer shooting a dog. In 2009 Chatham County officials released portions of dash cam video of a car chase that led to a fatal shooting. Who watches the watchmen? Birdsong said police will have "broad authority" to deny people the right to see video, including video of themselves. For disclosure requests the bill gives six provisions, saying officials "may consider any of the following factors in determining if a recording is disclosed." Those give police a wide range of options for denial: if the video contains otherwise confidential information, if it’s deemed "sensitive" or revealing, if it might harm someone’s reputation, if it might harm someone’s safety, or if it’s related to an active, inactive or potential criminal or internal investigation. "The 'may consider' portion of that is the part that is the most concerning to me," Birdsong said. If denied, people can appeal to a judge. But the law will force the judge to give latitude to the police’s original decision – the judge can only overrule police if he finds an "abuse of discretion." Getting the record made public All that was just to be able to watch the video one time, without being able to make a copy or show other people. What about people who want to make it fully public? That decision would be entirely up to a judge. But one public records attorney we spoke with, Mike Tadych, said it could be difficult to argue to a judge that video should be released if no member of the public has been able to see the video. That’s because the law would also require judges to only release the parts of the video specifically described in court. "I don’t know how in the world, without knowing what's on it, you would be able to say you know what's on it," Tadych said. Furthermore, anytime a judge is deciding whether to make footage public, the law would require that the local district attorney, the head of the agency that took the video and any officer whose image or voice is on the video must be notified and given a chance to testify. There are no such rights for the private citizens whose image or voice is in the footage. Our ruling The ACLU said if the bill becomes law, police will have "broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed." Police can stop individuals who were filmed by police from viewing the video, using broad and sometimes vague reasoning. And even on appeal, judges have limited authority to overrule the police. Police won't be able to decide if a video is made completely open to the public. Only a judge will. But in any given case, a number of law enforcement officials will have rights of notification and testimony that aren’t given to the regular individuals who are also in the video.

Pat McCrory signed the body cam bill into law on Monday, July 11. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/236400b3-7fa7-47c7-b200-7ff1e8dd16ab	None	ACLU of North Carolina	None	None	None	2016-07-01T16:55:06	2016-06-29	['None']
pomt-01827	Amid the "crisis at our southern border," there are "reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/18/phil-gingrey/rep-phil-gingrey-says-migrants-may-be-bringing-ebo/	As a surge of unaccompanied children from Central America was arriving on the United States’ southern border this month, Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., expressed concern about the impact they could have on public health. On July 7, 2014, Gingrey wrote a letter expressing these concerns to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here are excerpts: "As you know, the United States is currently experiencing a crisis at our southern border. The influx of families and unaccompanied children at the border poses many risks, including grave public health threats. "As a physician for over 30 years, I am well aware of the dangers infectious diseases pose. In fact, infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of death in the United States. … Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning." Health experts agree that when large numbers of people from countries with spotty health care systems make an arduous trek and then get corralled into crowded holding facilities, it can pose a health risk. But the introduction of Ebola, the feared viral disease of African origin that kills up to 90 percent of victims through organ failures and leaking blood and fluids? That would be terrifying. So is it true that amid the "crisis at our southern border" there are "reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus" into the United States? After Gingrey’s letter became widely known, some commentators expressed disbelief that he had invoked Ebola, given that the disease is endemic to Africa, not Central America. On his July 17 show, Stephen Colbert mocked Gingrey, saying, "That virus has never appeared outside of Africa, but Gingrey may have caught it from an illegal already, because I believe one of the symptoms is baseless fear leaking out of your ass." When we checked with Gingrey’s office, however, spokesman Cameron Harley pointed us to a comment Gingrey made to NBC News’ Luke Russert that suggested he’s standing by the concerns he stated in the CDC letter. "The border patrol gave us a list of the diseases that they’re concerned about, and Ebola was one of those," Gingrey told Russert. "I can’t tell you specifically that there were any cases of Ebola, I don’t think there were, but of course tuberculosis, Chagas disease, many – smallpox, some of the infectious diseases of children, all of these are concerns." So is there anything to the Ebola claim? Experts we asked issued a resounding "No." First, we checked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose job includes tracking outbreaks of serious infectious diseases. Spokesman Daniel J. DeNoon confirmed that the CDC has received no reports of a human Ebola infection anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, much less the U.S.-Mexico border. "Ebola cases in humans have never been reported outside of Africa," DeNoon said. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agreed. "The congressman is misinformed," he said. "There is no Ebola in the Western Hemisphere." We also checked whether it was plausible for a child or adult entering the United States from Central America via Mexico to be infected with the Ebola virus. CDC scientists call it "extremely unlikely," DeNoon said. Independent experts agreed. "It’s very, very, highly unlikely if you are talking about someone from Central America who has not traveled to Africa," Thomas W. Geisbert, a microbiologist and immunologist specializing in Ebola at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Geisbert said there have been examples of travelers carrying similar exotic diseases by airplane to the United States -- for instance, a passenger infected with Marburg virus who arrived in Colorado a few years ago, and another who came to Minnesota infected with Lassa virus earlier this year. And it’s worth noting that there’s currently a major Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Through July 12, there were 964 Ebola virus cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, including 603 deaths, according to CNN. However, the profile of the jet-flying Ebola carrier doesn’t mesh with the types of people now flocking to the U.S. border. "The incubation period is two to 21 days, so theoretically, an African could fly from an infected area, land in a Mexican airport, take a bus toward the border, hire a coyote to take him across and then ‘present’ with Ebola," said Thomas Fekete, section chief for infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine. "But this presupposes a suicidal person who also has the resources for this kind of travel." Indeed, the prior, scattered examples of exotic and deadly diseases reaching the United States suggest that "the likelihood of an illegal migrant getting infected and introducing the disease to the U.S. is probably less than that of a ‘legal’ traveler," said Daniel G. Bausch, head of the virology and emerging infections department at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No.6 in Lima, Peru. Another problem: If you had such an infection, the chances are good that you would die on the journey to the United States, said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. "You would be too sick to make it to the border by foot," he said. So where did these "reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as ... Ebola virus" come from? Initially, when we asked for documentation, Gingrey’s office sent us a number of links to articles. Some discussed the one government-confirmed case of swine flu among recently arrived children, as well reports of scabies and lice and concerns that conditions in the centers holding newly arrived children could promote the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis. Here are the three links Gingrey’s office sent us that mentioned Ebola directly: • A post at a site called The Common Sense Show. It discusses the potential arrival of Ebola-infected migrants as part of a "coming series of pandemics" that "has some governmental agency fingerprints on this invasion. Smart money would say that the CIA is involved." • An outspokenly anti-President Barack Obama opinion piece in the American Thinker, a Web publication that, in turn, sources its Ebola information to an article on prisonplanet.com, a site run by Alex Jones, a broadcaster who describes himself as a "prominent figure of the 9/11 Truth Movement." Citing the continuing surge of migrants at the border, the article closes with this: "Obama is an enemy to the American people and seems determined to destroy us one way or another. The tyrant must be removed from office as soon as possible." • An article in WND, formerly known as WorldNetDaily, which has gained attention for publishing articles skeptical of President Obama having been born in Hawaii. The WND article, like the other two, didn’t offer hard documentation of Ebola being found in the United States -- only suggestions that it could. "Other diseases like dengue and Ebola virus also may be in this wave of illegals, since people are coming from Central and South America, the Middle East and West Africa," the WND article said. When we asked Harley, the spokesman for Gingrey, whether his office considered these three citations to be credible sources supporting the Ebola claim, he backtracked, saying, "These websites were not our source. The source was communication with border agents and organizations that we work with on immigration regularly." When we asked for further detail, we did not hear back, so we cannot vet these sources’ credibility. Our ruling Gingrey said that amid the "crisis at our southern border," there are "reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus." We don’t dispute that the conditions for newly arrived migrant children pose public health challenges. But Gingrey went well beyond that when he invoked Ebola, a particularly scary and untreatable disease with high mortality rates. The reality is that Ebola has only been found in Africa -- and experts agree that, given how the disease develops, the likelihood of children from Central America bringing it to the U.S. border is almost nonexistent. But most importantly for our fact-check, Gingrey’s office was unable to point to solid evidence that that Ebola has arrived in Western Hemisphere, much less the U.S. border. To the contrary, the CDC and independent epidemiologists say there is zero evidence that these migrants are carrying the virus to the border. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03099	"The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/sep/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-favors-defunding-obamacare-opposes-gov/	Sen. Marco Rubio is among the big names in the Republican Party salivating at the chance to defund Obamacare. But Florida’s Republican senator says there’s no need to shut down the federal government over it, and conveniently enough, he says the American public agrees with him on both fronts. After the U.S. House of Representatives passed a short-term continuing resolution to defund Obamacare and keep the federal government open, Rubio issued a press release on Sept. 20, 2013: "The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government. The House voted today to follow the will of the American people and the Senate should now follow suit." We decided to examine recent poll results to determine if Rubio correctly characterized the public’s view on Obamacare and a government shutdown. Polls about Obamacare The Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthy policy think tank, has repeatedly asked respondents since 2011 if they approve or disapprove of cutting off funding for the health care law, formally called the Affordable Care Act. The most recent poll, in mid August 2013, showed that 57 percent disapproved of cutting funding, while 36 percent approved. Those numbers have changed little since 2011. A few days after Rubio made his claim, CNBC released a summary of a poll that found Americans oppose defunding Obamacare by a plurality of 44 percent to 38 percent. (Due to the timing, we will not take this poll into account for rating Rubio’s claim, but we’re mentioning it since it is on point.) CNBC’s pollsters noted that people particularly oppose defunding Obamacare if it would lead to a government shutdown or other dramatic outcomes. "Opposition to defunding increases sharply when the issue of shutting down the government and defaulting is included. In that case, Americans oppose defunding 59 percent to 19 percent, with 18 percent of respondents unsure. The final 4 percent is a group of people who want to defund Obamacare, but become unsure when asked if they still hold that view if it means shutting down the government," stated the report. So where might Rubio get the idea that the majority of Americans support defunding Obamacare? We contacted spokespersons for Rubio for a response and didn’t hear back. But we did find an August poll released by the conservative group Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, which showed that 57 percent support defunding Obamacare. The poll done by Basswood Research also found that about 68 percent support temporarily halting funding to make sure the provisions "do not do more harm than good." The poll was conducted in 10 House districts -- six currently held by Republicans. But the Heritage poll was widely criticized as a push poll, including by the Washington Post’s conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin, who called it "Heritage’s Junk Poll." Still, many recent polls show either a majority or plurality of Americans are critical of Obamacare depending on how the question is asked. How is it that these people don’t also want to see it defunded? For an answer we turned to Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University. Not surprisingly, the answer is in the wording. When respondents are asked if they favor "defunding" Obamacare, they oppose that, Blendon said. But when respondents are asked if they support repealing the law, they support some type of repeal. For example, a July 2013 CBS poll found 39 percent support repealing the entire law and 18 percent support repealing the mandate. While Americans think the law spends too much money, they don’t want to cut it back to zero funding. The individual mandate is probably the most unpopular part of the bill, Blendon said. However, "defunding doesn’t sound like a way to get rid of the individual mandate -- it sounds like you’re taking money away from sick people." If President Barack Obama wants to keep the bill as is and Republicans want to repeal it, Blendon said, then the public "is in the middle, which is to keep some and get rid of some. ... Neither party is giving them exactly what it is they want." Polls about government shutdown As for a government shutdown, the polls we found -- whether by an impartial media outlet or the right or the left -- showed the majority of Americans opposed. A CNN/ORC poll conducted Sept. 6-8 found that if the federal government had to shut down for a few days, 38 percent said it would cause "major problems," and 11 percent said it would cause a "crisis." When asked about a shutdown lasting for a few weeks, about three-fourths said it would cause major problems or a crisis. A poll done for Republican members of Congress found a significant majority oppose a government shutdown. A poll done for the conservative Crossroads GPS found that despite opposition to Obamacare, voters say it’s a bad idea to risk shutting down the government. "Only tea party backers embrace the idea, while independents reject it two-to-one," stated the Crossroads GPS poll. A poll for the liberal Huffington Post found a majority believe a shutdown would hurt the economy. Finally, we found one poll, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from Sept. 12-15, that came close to combining the moves of defunding Obamacare and a government shutdown, but it didn’t actually use the phrase "government shutdown." Instead, it asked if people favored or opposed the health care law (not defunding it) and then asked those who opposed the law if they favored "shutting down major activities of the federal government." According to the Post, the poll found that "only about one-quarter of Americans (27 percent) want Congress to shut down the government rather than pass a budget that funds Obamacare -- a threat that is inherent in some GOP lawmakers' pledges not to support any such budget. (Another 20 percent oppose Obamacare but don't want to risk a shutdown, while 5 percent oppose the law but aren't sure what they want to come from budget negotiations.)" Our ruling Rubio said, "The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government." Rubio makes it sound like he has support from the public for his main objective, which is defunding Obamacare. He doesn’t. When asking the public about Obamacare, word choice matters, and "defund" leads to a different result than "repeal." While the law isn’t popular, a recent Kaiser poll found 57 percent opposed cutting off funding. On his second point, he’s right that most people tell pollsters they don’t want a government shutdown. But we’ll point out that both sides in the budget battle in Congress say they don’t want a shutdown. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01950	Mark Warner’s "record is one of acting against" the Keystone XL pipeline.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/23/ed-gillespie/ed-gillespie-says-mark-warners-record-against-keys/	Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie says Democratic incumbent Mark Warner voices support for the Keystone XL pipeline but works against it. The crude oil pipeline would extend 1,179 miles from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines that run to Gulf Coast refineries. The privately-built line could carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day. Environmentalists say Keystone would contribute to global warming. Supporters say it would create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Because the pipeline crosses a U.S. border, it must be approved by the U.S. State Department. The department began its review in 2008 and, three years later, determined there would be no significant environmental damage and asked other federal agencies to weigh in. But this April, the department indefinitely delayed its approval until after a challenge to the pipelines route in Nebraska is settled by that state’s courts. In the Senate, pipeline supporters have tried several times during the past two years to pressure the Obama administration to approve the project. After an effort last month was bogged by partisan infighting, Gillespie blasted an email and news release saying of Warner, "He likes to tell us he supports Keystone Pipeline, but his record is one of acting against it." We wondered whether Warner, who for years has said he backs Keystone, really does have a record to the contrary. Paul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, said the statement was based on Keystone votes Warner cast in 2012 and this May. Let’s take a look: The 2012 vote Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., on March 8 tried to attach to a highway funding bill an amendment saying that the State Department’s environmental sign-off on the pipeline the previous year satisfied all federal permitting and authorizations needed to start Keystone. The measure, which required 60 votes to proceed, failed 56-42 with Warner voting against it. Warner said then that although he supported Keystone, he thought it should be used as leverage to gain support for a comprehensive energy bill that would include tax incentives for the production of alternative energy. He said, "...I will not be voting for the Keystone amendment today because, by making this a straight up-or-down issue without taking advantage of the opportunity to put together the beginnings of an energy package, we’re missing a great opportunity." The 2014 vote On May 12, a Senate deadlock on a bipartisan energy conservation bill appeared to end any chance the the chamber would consider the pipeline before this November’s elections. The legislation -- sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. and Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- would have provided tax incentives for fuel efficiency in commercial buildings, houses and appliances. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., favored the measure but was concerned that senators facing reelection this year would weigh down the bill with amendments for Keystone and other controversial energy policies. So Reid, who opposes the pipeline, made a promise: If the Senate approved the Shaheen-Portman bill without allowing any amendments, he would permit a vote on legislation mandating that the White House move past its environmental reviews of Keystone and order it approved. Republicans, however, offered a series of amendments to the bill that included Keystone and a provision that would prevent the White House from moving forward on new regulations for coal-fired plants. Their efforts were cut off by Reid. Warner joined most Democrats in voting to end debate and allow the unadulterated energy efficiency bill to come up for consideration. But that motion was opposed by Republicans and fell five votes short of the 60 the bill needed to proceed. GOP leaders said the best hope for advancing Keystone was to stitch it into a bill with other energy measures. Democrats dismissed that reasoning, saying President Barack Obama was bound to veto legislation that would have prevented new regulations on carbon emissions -- as Republicans wanted. Gillespie adopts the GOP line and says that Warner, in voting to cut off debate without amendments, voted against the pipeline. "Reid's purpose in decoupling a Keystone vote from the energy efficiency bill was intended precisely to ensure that it failed," said Logan, the campaign’s spokesman. Logan’s comments point to an additional chapter in this story that Gillespie does not publicize: The decoupled Keystone bill that would have come up for vote had the Senate approved energy efficiency bill according to Reid’s demands. Warner was among 55 cosponsors of the bipartisan bill to advance the pipeline. Other Keystone activities Warner’s campaign sent us list of actions and votes the senator has made in favor of the pipeline: This April, Warner was among 11 Democrats who signed a letter asking Obama to approve Keystone by May 31. Warner was among 53 senators from both parties who signed a letter to Obama in January 2013 urging approval of the pipeline after Nebraska chose a route through the state. A month later, he was 18 senators who sent a similar letter to Secretary of State John Kerry. In March 2013, Warner voted for an amendment to a Senate budget resolution that supported Keystone construction. The amendment required no binding action to spur Keystone, but was was considered an indication of the Senate’s support for the pipeline. Virginia’s other senator, Democrat Tim Kaine, opposed the amendment. Warner has taken heat from environmentalists for his Keystone actions. Blue Virginia, a pro-Democratic blog, in January 2013 listed Warner among 53 "sell-outs to big oil" in the Senate. Protesters have picketed him and his office in Harrisonburg and Richmond. The League of Conservation Voters gave Mark Warner an 85 percent rating on its scorecard in 2013, a downgrade, partly due to his support of the non-binding Keystone resolution. Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club’s Virginia chapter, told us he considers Warner a solid pipeline supporter. "He’s not only said he supports the Keystone Pipeline, he’s voted for it, much to our chagrin," Besa said. Our ruling Gillespie says Warner’s "record is one of acting against" the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2012, Warner did oppose a procedural step that would have allowed a Senate vote on expediting the project. He explained that he even though supported the pipeline, he thought it should be part of a broad energy policy. Even so, its reasonable to count this vote as an action against Keystone. But after that, Gillespie’s claim runs into problems. Each party blames the other for the Senate’s failure to pass pro-Keystone legislation this May. Gillespie’s campaign notes that Warner helped block a GOP effort to amend an energy efficiency bill with a go-ahead for Keystone and a provision that would prevented new carbon emission regulations. On the other hand, Warner co-sponsored a clean bill that would have expedited the pipeline. A review of the record shows Warner voted in favor of a Keystone resolution in 2013. He signed two letters to the president and one to the secretary of state asking them to expedite the project. Many environmentalists put Warner squarely in the Keystone crowd. So we rate Gillespie’s statement Mostly False.	None	Ed Gillespie	None	None	None	2014-06-23T00:00:00	2014-05-14	['None']

pomt-02044	Says Hillary Clinton "defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/01/chris-wallace/chris-wallace-hillary-clinton-defended-syrias-assa/	Talk along the lines of Hillary, Hillary, Hillary dominated the network news shows Sunday, as hosts and their guests mulled Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, excerpts from her forthcoming memoir Hard Choices and her potential 2016 presidential bid. Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace countered praise of Clinton from Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., by listing some of Clinton’s troubles as President Barack Obama’s top diplomat. Wallace singled out developments in U.S. relations during Obama’s first term with Russia, Iran and Syria. "She defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war," he said. PunditFact wanted to dig into Wallace’s claim. Clinton’s remarks in early days of Syrian protests Clinton’s comments in question stretch back to the Arab Spring of 2011, when government revolts erupted in Middle Eastern countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Syria, too, spun into chaos with violent clashes between government forces of Assad, who assumed the presidency when his father died in 2000, and protesters. The starting point for what became a bloody civil war came in the remote city of Daraa, where 15 schoolchildren were arrested for spray-painting anti-government graffiti on their school with messages such as "the people want to topple the regime," according to CNN. The military used brutal force to address sit-ins in Damascus and Daraa over the treatment of the jailed protesters, which spurred thousands more Syrians to turn against Assad. Clinton talked about the developments Syria on CBS’ Face the Nation on March 27, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer pressed her on why the U.S. reaction would be different from its response to Libya with air strikes. Syria, Schieffer noted, is no friend of the U.S. as an enemy of Israel and ally of Iran, and Assad’s father had "killed 25,000 people, at a lick" in 1982. Clinton said: "Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don't think that it's yet clear what will occur, what will unfold. "There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer. "What's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning, but there's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities than police actions which, frankly, have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see." So Clinton did refer to Assad as "a reformer." But she crafted the line as the opinion of "members of Congress of both parties," not her opinion. And she never defended (as Wallace said) Assad, instead saying in that interview that he "exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see." Still, Clinton’s comments were widely reported and criticized. Clinton mentioned "both parties," but the Washington Post’s Fact Checker looked into Clinton’s statement and was unable to find public comments from Republicans along those lines. Two days later, Clinton addressed her comment at a press conference in London. She responded to a Wall Street Journal reporter’s question asking if it is her position that Assad is a reformer. "I referenced opinions of others," Clinton said. "That was not speaking either for myself or for the Administration." She said the administration deplored the Syrian crackdown on protesters and that it’s up to Syria’s leaders "to prove that it can be responsive to the needs of its own people." Clinton went on. "We’re troubled by what we hear, but we’re also going to continue to urge that the promise of reform, which has been made over and over again and which you reported on just a few months ago – ‘I’m a reformer, I’m going to reform, and I’ve talked to members of Congress and others about that,’ that we hear from the highest levels of leadership in Syria – will actually be turned into reality," she said. "That’s what we’re waiting and watching for." As the military crackdown on Syrians persisted and worsened, Obama and Clinton called on Assad to go. Clinton was interviewed in November 2011 for ABC News by Jake Tapper, who noted she "at one point seemed to have optimism that Assad was a reformer." Clinton said, "Well, we had hoped so because there was a lot at stake, we wanted to see an agreement, for example, between Syria and Israel. That was something that people have been working on for 30 years. We heard what Assad said about what he wanted to do for reform. But when it came to it, in the Arab Spring and as people actually demanded some freedom and their rights, he responded, as we have seen, very violently. "But he’s not going to be able to sustain what is a unfortunately growing armed opposition apparently fueled and maybe led by defectors from his army. It’s probably too late for him to change course, but there needs to be a change at the top of that government, and there needs to be an effort to engage in genuine dialogue and start on the path of reform." Reaction and context As we researched, we found that talk of the Syrian dictator being a reformer was a popular talking point when he took power. The enthusiasm for Assad began to dissipate with his opposition to President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq and the assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri, which Syrian security officials were faulted for but Assad denied. The Bush White House also said the government was allowing members of terrorist groups to pass through his country to fight the United States in Iraq. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, opposed to the Bush administration’s foreign policy, visited Assad in Syria in 2007. She said, "We came in friendship, hope, and determined that the road to Damascus is a road to peace." Then-U.S. Sen. John Kerry also had a hopeful view of Assad engaging the West, saying in a March 16, 2011, appearance as the first big anti-governments protests erupted in Syria that Assad "has been very generous with me" and fulfilled Kerry’s diplomatic requests. (Kerry changed his tune on Assad in a March 31, 2011, press release). Another person with "high hopes" that were dashed was Middle East historian and Trinity University professor David Lesch, author of The New Lion of Damascus: Bashar al-Assad and modern Syria in 2005 and Syria: The Fall of the House of Assad in 2012. Lesch interviewed Assad in Syria from 2004 to 2008, writing that he probably knows him better than anyone in the West. In the newest book, Lesch says he was initially impressed by the promise that London-educated Assad seemed to bring with his presidency compared with the 30-year repressive regime of his father, Hafez al-Assad. Instead of finally implementing political reforms with the uprising, Assad listened to his military and thought he could put it down, Lesch told us by email. "I think the Obama administration (and Secretary Clinton) were trying to give Assad some space in which to make the necessary reforms," Lesch told PunditFact. But Assad’s regime by then "had chosen and was committed to forcefully putting down the revolt." Our ruling Criticizing parts of Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, Wallace said Clinton "defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war." Clinton’s original comments in March 2011 were not that straightforward. The statement in question was actually, "Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer." Clinton was talking about the beliefs of Congress and didn’t "defend" Assad, as Wallace put it, instead saying that the use of force that he deployed was more "than any of us would want to see." Still, Clinton’s choice to talk about those members’ opinions of Assad without knocking them down suggests she may have found them credible and bolsters Wallace’s claim. Wallace’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08774	"Roy Barnes is part of the team that has run up trillions of dollars in debt that Americans will spend years paying off, and they've done it without creating one job."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/24/brian-robinson/barnes-part-team-blame-failed-policies-deal-spokes/	So who's responsible for the economic mess ensnaring Georgia and the rest of the nation? Democratic Party gubernatorial nominee Roy Barnes pointed his finger at his GOP challenger, Nathan Deal, and fellow Republicans during the Democrats' state convention on Aug. 14 in Athens. The Republicans have cut education funding and raised property taxes during their eight years in control of the Governor's Mansion, Barnes charged. "Nathan Deal is part of the team that brought Georgia to where we are now," said Barnes, a former governor. Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, wasn't going to let that slide. "Roy Barnes is part of the team that has run up trillions of dollars in debt that Americans will spend years paying off, and they've done it without creating one job," Robinson told the Athens Banner-Herald. Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia he based his statement on the results of the stimulus package passed by the Democrat-led Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in February 2009. AJC PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look at Robinson's claim, since it was more specific than what Barnes said. Republicans have portrayed Barnes as a supporter of Obama and some of the policies supported by Democrats in Washington, figuring they won't play well with voters in conservative Georgia. In fact, in 2008 Barnes donated $2,300 to "Obama for America" and $2,500 to the "Obama Victory Fund," records show. More recently, Barnes avoided the president when he came to Atlanta this month. Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter said he wasn't invited to two events Obama held on his visit. A Democratic National Committee spokeswoman said Barnes was invited to an Obama fundraiser. PolitiFact Georgia gave Carpenter a "Pants on Fire" rating for claiming Barnes wasn't invited to any of the events. Robinson cited Barnes' campaign contributions to Obama's presidential bid as part of his rationale for connecting the two Democrats. "If Nathan is a part of [the team of Republicans], then Roy is part of the Democratic team that passed the stimulus bill, bailed out [General Motors] and passed ObamaCare," Robinson said. But do campaign contributions really make Barnes "a part of the [Obama] team"? University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said it's common for state candidates to link opponents to the unpopular policies of their national party. Bullock said it's a "tenuous link" to connect Barnes, a former governor who's been out of office since 2003, to Obama administration policies -- or, for that matter, to link Deal, a former congressman, to the policies of Republican leaders at the state Capitol. "Barnes didn't vote for [those policies], he couldn't. He wasn't a member of Congress," Bullock said. "The only thing you can say [about Barnes and Obama] is there is a D on their jersey." So, what about Robinson's claim about the debt? The federal debt held by the public was nearly $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2008, which encompassed most of George W. Bush's last year as president, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2009, OMB data shows the debt rose to $7.5 trillion. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30 of the next calendar year. Fiscal year 2010 ends Sept. 30, 2010. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the debt held by the public will rise to $10.5 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2011 under Obama's budget and nearly double by September 2020. Now, let's deal with Robinson's claim about jobs. "There are fewer jobs today than there were [when the stimulus passed]," Robinson said. "You can't say you created a job if 30 others were lost." Federal labor statistics data show the number of Georgians employed has dropped by about 200,000 people since the 2009 stimulus was adopted. Georgia's unemployment rate rose in that time from 8.7 percent to 10 percent. Nationally, the unemployment rate has risen since February 2009 from 8.1 percent to 9.5 percent. The data suggest Robinson is right about fewer jobs being created since the stimulus. But that's not what he said. Robinson said the stimulus hasn't created "one job." Federal officials credit the stimulus for creating or saving 24,103 jobs in Georgia during the last three months of 2009, the AJC reported in January. There are some issues with the numbers. It combines some part-time jobs into "full-time equivalent" jobs. Raises funded through the stimulus are counted toward the job numbers, the AJC reported in January. Federal officials initially reported jobs "created or saved" by the stimulus. They changed the terminology to "recovery funded jobs reported by recipients" in January after consulting recipients, good government groups and members of Congress. The federal government counts stimulus jobs as positions funded by the money, even if the person worked at the company beforehand. Several private-sector economic-analysis firms say the stimulus has saved or created more than 1 million jobs. U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., made a similar claim during a February news conference that "the last stimulus bill didn't create one new job." Our friends on the national PolitiFact site asked Brown about that statement. A spokesman clarified the senator's statement to say the stimulus hasn't created "any new jobs." PolitiFact gave Brown a "Pants on Fire" rating for his initial statement. While Barnes did support Obama financially, he has not been a member of Congress and hasn't been a close adviser to the president. We agree with Bullock that it is tenuous to link Barnes to Obama's policies. As for the other aspects of the claim: Robinson is correct to say debt has risen since the stimulus, but we have trouble with the final portion of his quote to the Athens Banner-Herald. The way the federal government counts stimulus jobs has been problematic, but several independent groups say the stimulus has saved or created some jobs. It's a stretch, we believe, to say the stimulus has not created "one job." All in all, we rate Robinson's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07606	"Not even expensive bottled water, like Perrier and Evian, are of good enough quality to pump out of mines in Southwest Virginia, according to the EPA regulation."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/22/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-epa-standards-are-so-strict-p/	What do French bottled water and Appalachian streams have in common? More than you might think, according to Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-9th. A vocal opponent of the Environmental Protection Agency, the southwest Virginia legislator pledged in February to roll back regulations governing water from mountain-top mining areas. "Not even expensive bottled water, like Perrier and Evian, are of good enough quality to pump out of mines in Southwest Virginia, according to the EPA regulation," Griffith wrote. Standards so strict that Perrier and Evian would fail? We couldn’t swallow that without checking. We had two questions: Would fancy bottled water really fail a conductivity test? And would that sort of test actually tell us anything about the safety of the bottled water? First, a word about EPA the standards and how mountain-top mining works. This form of mining relies on explosives to expose coal seams in far southwest Virginia and West Virginia. The controlled explosions generate huge piles of debris that often bury nearby valleys. In April 2010 the EPA said "the resulting waste that then fills valleys and streams can significantly compromise water quality, often causing permanent damage to ecosystems and rendering streams unfit for swimming, fishing and drinking." The agency established a new purity standard for streams near coal mining areas, saying it was updating provisions of the Clean Water Act to set new conductivity levels. Conductivity is a measurement of how well water transmits an electrical charge and gives a reading on the amount of dissolved solids in water. The EPA set a maximum conductivity of 500 microSiemens per centimeter, which the agency says is about five times higher than a normal level and should "protect 95 percent of aquatic life in the coal regions." Emily Bernhardt, an associate professor of biology at Duke University, studies water quality in coal-mining areas. She told us conductivity is a "really inexpensive way to see if you have a lot of constituents in water." In coal-mining regions, she said, conductivity is correlated with sulfate. Pyrite, a mineral made up of coal and sulphur ions, is found in coal seams and filters into water. She said if water near coal mines has high conductivity, it usually contains a lot of sulfates and metals. Streams in mining areas often show elevated sulfur levels, as well as higher levels of iron, selenium and manganese. But the test is designed solely for rural Appalachia, not for use across the country. In urban areas, for example, high conductivity may occur when road salt is washed into streams. So how do Perrier and Evian seep into this debate? Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, told us the congressman’s comments were based on the EPA’s conductivity guidance. But the EPA website makes no mention of Perrier or other bottled waters. Griffith’s claim appears to come from Alpha Natural Resources, the nation’s third-largest coal mining company. A PowerPoint slide circulated by the company says Evian, Perrier and San Pellegrino would all fail EPA conductivity tests. We asked Rick Nida, a spokesman for Alpha, whether his company thinks the EPA test is a fair way to evaluate the impact of mountain-top mining. "We don’t think it’s a good standard to use," he said. "The point is rules are so stringent that bottle water doesn’t pass. Richard Yost, a spokesman for the EPA, said the standards are designed to protect aquatic species in the water, not necessarily determine whether the water is safe to drink. "The science demonstrates that stream life present in waters contaminated by mine waste is killed when salinity levels rise above levels that would not be toxic to humans who may drink such water," Yost said. "Aquatic organisms and people respond to salinity in very different ways, so it is not technically valid to make direct comparisons between healthy levels of salinity in central Appalachian streams and acceptable levels of salinity in drinking water." Rather than rely on Alpha’s conductivity data, we put these bottled waters to the test. Paul Bukaveckas, an associate professor of biology at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies river ecology, invited us to conduct the tests at his lab. Mac Lee, a laboratory specialist at VCU, used a sensor he and Bukaveckas employ on the James River. We tested the conductivity of distilled water, Evian, Perrier, Pellegrino and, last of all, a sample taken from the James River in downtown Richmond. Here were our test results: Distilled water: 2.2 microSiemens James River water: 139 microSiemens Evian: 584 microSiemens Perrier: 795 microSiemens San Pellegrino: 1266 microSimens So the bottled water has a conductivity level higher than the EPA’s 500 microSiemens threshold. We asked Bernhardt and Bukaveckas if that is a relevant piece of information. Bukaveckas, the VCU biologist, said the argument reminds him of those raised 20 years ago by power companies disputing the impact -- or even existence -- of acid rain. "They’d point to lakes and say, ‘These are naturally acidic.’ But if you did water tests, you’d find that undamaged lakes were acidic because of organic or naturally occurring acids," he said. The damaged lakes, in contrast, contained acids created by emissions from the smokestacks of power plants. Bernhardt, of Duke, said water is different in each environment, making a comparison between French springs and Appalachian streams pointless. "The EPA’s data find that high conductivity is most closely correlated with the loss of species," Bernhardt said about Appalachian water. "Salty water makes it harder for freshwater fish to live. So maybe it is bad for freshwater fish to be dumped in Pellegrino, but that’s not the right argument to have." Let’s review our findings. After conducting an independent test, we agree with Griffith’s claim that Perrier, Evian and Pellegrino all have conductivity levels above the limits the EPA sets for streams in Appalachian coal areas. But the fact that a Pellegrino bath could kill Virginia’s fish population is irrelevant to these water standards. According to independent water experts, high conductivity in coal country strongly correlates with the loss of aquatic species. Griffith sought to confuse the issue with a non sequitur about bottled water. Saying Perrier is good for humans and therefore must be OK for fish seems to us like saying that because humans eat oranges, fish should too. The congressman has ignored critical facts to give his constituents a skewed impression of an EPA rule. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11373	"Emma Gonzalez bullied school shooter, isn’t sorry; then retweets message blaming ‘white boys’ entitlement’ as cause of all school shootings"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/30/project-republic/no-emma-gonzalez-did-not-admit-bullying-parkland-s/	Online rumors suggest Parkland shooting survivor and gun control activist Emma Gonzalez bullied the shooter and blamed white male entitlement as the cause of all school shootings. "Emma Gonzalez bullied school shooter, isn’t sorry; then retweets message blaming ‘white boys’ entitlement’ as cause of all school shootings," read the headline on Project Republic, a website that claims to provide "relevant, thought-provoking, and factual news coverage." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article falsely claims that Gonzalez is on video admitting to bullying and ostracizing the Parkland shooter and saying she was justified in doing so. The website includes a video clip of a speech Gonzalez gave at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She says: "Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should not have ostracized him, you didn’t know this kid. Okay? We did." In reality, Gonzalez was responding to a tweet from President Donald Trump that implied people should have been more active in reporting the shooter’s disturbing behavior before people died. The full video clip showed Gonzalez talking about the shooter being mentally disturbed, but she never made any claims about bullying him. Here is Gonzalez’s comment in full context: "There is one tweet I would like to call attention to. ‘So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again.’ We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid. Okay, we did. We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He would not have harmed that many students with a knife." We found no other evidence to suggest that Gonzalez bullied Cruz. The article then refers to a tweet Gonzalez retweeted on March 27. The tweet from user @edennnnnn said: "If bullying caused school shootings, you would see trans shooters, queer shooters, female shooters, POC shooters. Bullying does not cause school shootings; entitlement does. And white boys are the most entitled demographic by far." Project Republic described Gonzalez’s retweet as sentiment to blaming "white boys’ entitlement" as the cause of all school shootings. But the tweet isn’t that specific in blaming all school shootings on entitlement. Project Republic has no evidence to show that Gonzalez bullied Cruz; she didn’t admit; and the retweet doesn’t say what Project Republic said. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12936	"About 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/10/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-favor-changing-Obamacare/	As congressional Republicans decide how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., published an op-ed on FoxNews.com titled, "ObamaCare failed Americans. Now it's time for relief." "By nearly any measure, Obamacare has failed: It didn’t lower costs, it didn’t increase choice, middle-class families continue to lose health plans they were promised they could keep, and Americans continue to call for Obamacare’s repeal," McConnell wrote on Jan. 9. "They spoke loudly again this November, and about 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether." "That doesn’t mean the law will end overnight," he continued. "There will be a stable transition period, and once repeal is passed we will turn to replacement policies that cost less and work better than what we have now." What caught our eye in this passage was McConnell’s citation of the eight of 10 figure. When we took a closer look, we found a credible source for it, but also some missing context. Let’s take a closer look. Where the number comes from McConnell’s office pointed to a Nov. 28, 2016, news release by Gallup that summarized one of its periodic polls on health care. The headline was, "Most Americans Want Changes to Affordable Care Act." Gallup’s release goes on to say, "Whatever the exact course of action that ensues once Trump and the new Congress take office, it is clear that about eight in 10 Americans favor changing the ACA significantly (43 percent) or replacing it altogether (37 percent)." This data is based on a survey conducted on Nov. 9 to Nov. 13, 2016. "The majority leader made an accurate statement that, according to Gallup, about 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether," said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell. "Given the myriad problems with the law and the impact on families, the poll was not a surprise." An outside specialist in health policy and polling, Robert J. Blendon of Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said McConnell has a good basis for supporting his claim, given Gallup’s framing of the results. "For years, politicians have taken what's in Gallup releases," Blendon said. Why it can be misinterpreted McConnell has been careful in how he relates what Gallup wrote. But the statistic's usefulness for supporting his larger point -- that Obamacare should be repealed in the way he's proposing -- is not as clear. Reading his op-ed, it’s easy to jump to the conclusion that 80 percent of Americans want to repeal the law. But that's not the case, according to the Gallup data. It’s true that only 14 percent of respondents said they would keep the law as is, and that’s less than the 37 percent who wanted to repeal the law entirely. However, a plurality of respondents -- 43 percent -- said they wanted to keep the law but make "significant changes" to it. Specifically, 28 percent said they approved of the law but wanted to see significant changes to it -- and this constituency included both people who generally approved of the law and those who generally disapproved of it. The inclusion of those who approve the law and want changes to it -- and who would be unlikely to be on board for a full repeal, as McConnell seeks -- is what inflates the number to 80 percent. Other recent surveys fill in some of the blanks about what these respondents might be thinking. An October 2016 survey by Harvard University’s Chan School and Politico gave respondents six options for handling the Affordable Care Act (not counting "don’t know," which registered 10 percent). The first three categories include people who either support the law or think it should go even further than it does today: Replace with universal Medicare: 14 percent Expand the existing program: 8 percent Keep the law as is: 18 percent Collectively, then, 40 percent either support an even stronger law or keeping the law as is. The other three categories align more closely with McConnell’s opinion, and they add up to 50 percent. Replace with a tax credit program: 16 percent Scale back and give states control: 14 percent Repeal completely: 20 percent The Politico-Harvard results broadly mirror other recent polls about repealing the Affordable Care Act. In general, more people favor a repeal than oppose one, but support levels for a repeal are in the 40 percent to 50 percent range, rather than the 80 percent range. For instance, a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll taken in mid December 2016 found that 49 percent favored repeal, 47 percent opposed repeal, and 4 percent were unsure or refused to answer. Our ruling McConnell wrote that "Americans continue to call for Obamacare’s repeal. … About 8 out of 10 favor changing ObamaCare significantly or replacing it altogether." McConnell has carefully worded a statistic from a credible source, the Gallup news release. However, it's worth remembering that a notable share of people whose favored "significant" changes to the law either want a single-payer plan or an even stronger Obamacare law -- two options that are off the table for McConnell.

Charlie Crist says he won't return money contributed to his U.S. Senate campaign while he was running as a Republican. "People gave to a good cause, and we're going to spend it on a good cause,'' Crist said minutes after switching his voter registration. "That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our message out and communicate with the people of Florida.'' The next day, in a wide-ranging interview with the editorial board of the St. Petersburg Times, the refund talk resurfaced. This time, Crist discussed a letter he received from 20 Republican heavyweights asking for refunds. He suggested that the letter was more a stunt than a sincere request. "I got a letter from 20 people who said they wanted their money back, 14 never gave me a penny," Crist told the Times, adding, "You gotta give it to me first before you can have the option." We wanted to see if Crist is right. The letter in question actually is published on Marco Rubio's Senate campaign website. It reads in part: "We helped to support, and yes to bankroll, your political career. For years you have been asking us for money. And for years we have put our names and credibility on the line by asking our friends to donate to you. Those days are over. "As part of your transition into this new phase of your political career, we respectfully request that you return every penny of donor money from every donor who asks for a refund. For those of us who have donated to your Senate campaign, you can start by refunding in full the contributions we have made. "Recent reports with the Federal Elections Commission indicate your campaign is sitting on a stockpile of approximately $7.6 million dollars in contributions. "Charlie, that is not your money." The letter is signed by mainly Florida Republicans, including former Florida GOP Chairman Al Cardenas, Outback Steakhouse executive Chris Sullivan, Palm Beach County GOP chair Sid Dinerstein and former U.S. Ambassador to Portugal Al Hoffman. Palm Beach Post reporter Mike Bender quickly took the list of letter writers and compared it to the list of Charlie Crist's campaign contributors. He published the results of his analysis on the Post's political blog. The analysis showed that of the 20 people listed on the letter, only nine actually donated to Crist's Senate campaign, and of the nine -- Hoffman -- got his contributions back in February 2010 (Hoffman asked for his money back in February over allegations of excessive spending by the Republican Party of Florida and Crist's hand-picked chairman Jim Greer). PolitiFact Florida checked Bender's reporting by searching the Federal Election Commission's electronic campaign database and came up with the same number. Here's a list of the signers and how much they contributed to Crist's campaign. Bill Becker, Vero Beach, FL - $0 Wayne Berman, Washington, D.C. - $0 Al Cardenas, Miami, FL - $4,800 Sid Dinerstein, Palm Beach Gardens, FL - $0 Ed Easton, Key Biscayne, FL - $2,400 Peter Feaman, Boynton Beach, FL - $500 Gay Gaines, Palm Beach, FL - $0 Phil Handy, Winter Park, FL - $0 Mike Hightower, Jacksonville, FL - $0 Charlie Hilton, Panama City, FL - $0 Ambassador Al Hoffman, North Palm Beach, FL - $4,800 Congressman Gary A. Lee, Ft. Myers, FL - $0 Anita Mitchell, West Palm Beach, FL - $0 Tom Petway, Jacksonville, FL - $2,400 Ambassador John Rood, Jacksonville, FL - $4,800 Peter Rummell, Jacksonville, FL - $4,800 Frank Schwerin, Naples, FL - $0 Jason Steele, Satellite Beach, FL - $0 Chris Sullivan, Tampa, FL - $4,800 Jason Unger, Tallahassee, FL - $2,400 Hilton did donate $2,000 to Crist's 1998 Senate campaign. The Post reported that one of the 20 to sign the letter, Gay Gaines of Palm Beach, hasn’t donated to Crist in at least 15 years. She gave $2,400 this year to Rubio. Crist, in his statement to the St. Petersburg Times editorial board, is off a little bit by saying 14 of the 20 have asked for a refund. Actually, 11 never gave Crist "a penny" for his 2010 Senate campaign. And a 12th person had his money back before sending the letter to Crist. That's close enough, however, to rate Crist's claim Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-05-17T14:34:42	2010-05-13	['None']

pomt-12193	"Twitter reaches only 15 percent of the population."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/jul/26/mark-cuban/mark-cuban-says-twitter-reaches-only-15-population/	Texas businessman and possible 2020 presidential aspirant Mark Cuban, who backed Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, challenged Kellyanne Conaway’s defense of President Donald Trump’s frequent Twitter posts by suggesting most Americans aren’t Twitter-philes. Cuban was reacting to a June 30, 2017, Fox News tweet quoting the White House counselor saying the president conveys his ideas through social media "because the middle man can't be trusted." "This is backwards," Cuban tweeted back. "Twitter reaches only ~ 15pct of population," Cuban said, adding: "For a tweet to reach the general population the MSM (mainstream media) has to report on it." Reporting matters. But it’s a reach to dismiss Twitter, which says its mission is to "give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers." The California-based platform, which permits individuals and groups to post brief messages generally viewable to anyone who cares to peek, became a durable social-media phenomenon after its embrace at Austin’s South by Southwest in 2007. As of July 2017, the president’s @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account had more than 34 million followers. By then, Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, had 92 million followers, a "followership" built over many more years in politics. So, do just 15 percent of Americans see Twitter directly? Cuban’s backup Twitter itself says that as of the end of June 2017, it had 328 million monthly active users. The company said that 79 percent of Twitter accounts were based outside the United States. When we asked Cuban the basis of his cited 15 percent figure, he said by email that he saw it in a report in 2016. He said we could confirm the number by talking to any analyst of Twitter’s stock or by engaging the company. A stock analyst Our emails to Twitter media representatives went unanswered, but we connected with Perry Gold, a New York-based stock analyst identified by Twitter Inc. as one of more than 30 analysts of its stock. Gold, of MoffettNathanson LLC, a media and telecommunications research firm, pointed out internal metrics made public by Twitter covering the first quarter of 2017. In the four months, according to the figures, Twitter had 70 million monthly active U.S. users, up 3 million from the last four months of 2016, the company noted in an April 2017 letter to shareholders. Our run at perspective: The U.S. population was 323 million as of July 2016 including nearly 249 million residents age 18 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So you could assert, roughly, that 22 percent of all Americans engaged with Twitter in the first few months of 2017. Removing minors from the population count leaves you with nearly 249 million residents, perhaps opening the way to estimate that up to 28 percent of U.S. adults used Twitter in the year’s first quarter--again, a rough estimate. Gold also pointed out that according to a June 2017 ranking of digital media platforms by Comscore, a cross-platform measurement company, Twitter that month ranked 13th nationally with 110,290,000 unique U.S. visitors/viewers. At No. 1, per Comscore, Google had 241,433,000 unique U.S. visitors/viewers. Another speculative calculation: If you assume the Google count reflects nearly every U.S. user of the Internet, then you could say the count of Twitter’s unique visitors/viewers was about 46 percent of all the U.S. online population for the month. Experts caution We sought independent expert analysis from professors pointed out by Kathleen McElroy of the University of Texas including Dhiraj Murthy, author of a book on Twitter for social communication, who called "monthly active users," the indicator aired by Twitter, "a very difficult metric with lots of limitations as even bots or quite occasional users can be incorporated into these numbers, depending on how calculations are done." Most research agrees, Murthy said by email, that most tweets go unread or passed along. Meredith Clark, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of North Texas, and a University of North Carolina "big data" colleague, Deen Freelon, each suggested we consider the results of a Pew Research Center survey of 1,520 U.S. adults taken in March-April 2016 finding that while 79 percent of online Americans reported using Facebook, 24 percent reported using Twitter. "On a total population basis (accounting for Americans who do not use the internet at all)," Pew wrote, that means 68 percent of U.S. adults are Facebook users and 21 percent use Twitter. SOURCE: Web post, "24% of online adults (21% of all Americans) use Twitter," Pew Research Center, Nov. 10, 2016 Per Twitter, survey respondents were asked: "Do you ever use the internet or a mobile app to use Twitter?" While 24 percent said yes to the query, 75 percent had not ever done so, Pew found. "Roughly one-quarter of online adults (24%) use Twitter, a proportion that is statistically unchanged from a survey conducted in 2015 (23%). "Younger Americans are more likely than older Americans to be on Twitter. Some 36% of online adults ages 18-29 are on the social network, more than triple the share among online adults ages 65 and older (just 10% of whom are Twitter users). "Twitter is also somewhat more popular among the highly educated: 29% of internet users with college degrees use Twitter, compared with 20% of those with high school degrees or less," Pew said. Both professors saw potential complications in Cuban’s statement. Clark said by email: "Cuban's claim rests on the assumption that everyone has an equal probability of seeing any other user's tweets, which we don't, because of Twitter's algorithms and our own decisions on whom to follow, re-tweet, mute, block, etc.," Clark wrote. Freelon elaborated: "Philosophically, your rating of Mr. Cuban's statement may depend on how the term ‘reach’ is defined. Limiting the focus to people who see a tweet directly on Twitter is one approach," he wrote, "but some tweets get seen because they’re mentioned in news coverage or discussed elsewhere online. Freelon said a "liberal definition of the term ‘reach’ pulls in many more people. Exactly" how "many is probably impossible to say with any degree of certainty." Our ruling Cuban said: "Twitter reaches only 15 percent of the population." A 2016 survey and more recent Twitter metrics suggest that around 21 percent of U.S. residents at least peek at tweets. Cuban’s larger point--that most of us are not Twitter-locked--holds up. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-01538	Of the 98 top oxycodone-dispensing doctors who used to live in Florida, "today, there are none."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/sep/16/pam-bondi/attorney-general-pam-bondi-says-floridas-pill-mill/	Attorney General Pam Bondi has launched her re-election advertising campaign with a major milestone in Florida law enforcement: The death of the state’s infamous "pill mills." In a Sept. 8 TV commercial, the incumbent touts her record of overseeing the demise of rampant prescription drug abuse enabled by Florida doctors. "With our amazing law enforcement, we closed down the pill mills," Bondi said. "Of the top 100 oxycodone-­dispensing doctors in this country, 98 of them lived in Florida. Today, there are none." That statistic implies Bondi was tough on crime, but PolitiFact Florida wanted to know if it was accurate. Closing the clinics The pill mill epidemic was a nationwide problem in 2010, driven by doctors who would write prescriptions and sell drugs out of clinics they owned themselves. Florida’s lax laws gave the Sunshine State a reputation for easy access to the drug, so much so that billboards advertised to "narco tourists" -- buyers from out of state who would come to Florida to buy the drug. With more than 1,000 pain clinics in operation across the state, Florida became known as the "Oxy Express." Bondi, who was elected in 2010, was a staunch supporter of HB 7095, a 2011 law that increased penalties for doctors who abused prescription privileges, banned them from prescribing drugs like oxycodone and strengthened state regulatory power over prescription pill trafficking. The bill passed both houses of the Legislature unanimously on May 6, 2011, and was signed by Gov. Rick Scott on June 3, 2011. Bondi’s camp told PolitiFact Florida the stat in the commercial came from the Statewide Task Force on Prescription Drug Abuse & Newborns 2014 Progress Report, which specifically dealt with the effects of opiate abuse by pregnant women on their children. The report credited changes in Florida law that shut down many clinics. "In 2010, 98 of the top 100 oxycodone pill dispensing physicians nationally resided in Florida," the report read. "In 2011, after the passage of HB 7095, only 13 of the top 100 resided in Florida, and by the end of 2012, not one Florida doctor appeared on the top 100 list." The report, which used figures that also were widely reported by the media, cited U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration data accessed January 2013. Bondi’s office also gave us a DEA press release from April 5, 2013, to back up that claim -- although that release said "90 of the top 100 oxycodone purchasing physicians in the nation were located in Florida." When we asked the attorney general’s office why there was a discrepancy in the numbers, they insisted the number was 98. The DEA stood firm, however: In 2010, the number was 90 of the top 100 oxycodone-purchasing doctors. The federal agency also told us the number of doctors in Florida in 2011, after HB 7095 passed, was down to 10 and not 13. But wait, Bondi’s commercial says "oxycodone-dispensing doctors," not "purchasing," as the DEA measured in 2010. That’s because the 2011 law no longer allowed physicians to simply buy the drug to resell, DEA public information officer Mia Ro told PolitiFact Florida. "When the Florida law changed, it prevented physicians from dispensing pills out of their clinics," Ro said. The agency doesn’t track "what’s filled or prescribed," she said. That means the DEA numbers weren’t tracking whether or not actual abuse had happened, just that Florida doctors were buying lots of oxycodone. Some physicians are still allowed to buy hydrocodone in large quantities, Ro said -- emergency room personnel, for example -- but private doctors could no longer buy the drug and sell it on their own. There was one unnamed DEA registrant from Florida who was in the top 100 oxycodone buyers in 2014, Ro said: A purchaser for a fleet of cruise ships, to use the drug in the fleet’s sick bays. That’s not to say pill mills weren’t a problem, or that the 2011 law didn’t make a difference. By the time HB 7095 was enacted, it was estimated as many as 11 people per day were dying from prescription drug abuse. From 2010 to 2012, overdose deaths from prescription drugs, illicit drugs and alcohol dropped nearly 17 percent, and overall prescription drug fatalities fell 23 percent, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. About 52 percent of that decrease was in deaths from oxycodone. Our ruling Bondi said that of the top 100 oxycodone-dispensing doctors, 98 were in Florida, and "today, there are none." She cited DEA numbers that since 2010, the number of physicians who dispensed the most oxycodone in the nation and also lived in Florida had dropped from 98 of the top 100 to zero. The DEA told us there are a few problems with that stat. First, it was for the biggest purchasers of oxycodone, not dispensers -- the DEA said the list didn't track dispensation. Second, the number in 2010 was 90 and not 98, although the 98 figure was widely reported by the state and the media in the past few years. Third, in 2014 there was one top 100 oxycodone purchaser in Florida, a buyer for a cruise ship fleet. The DEA data only tracks top purchasers, not whether actual drug use decreased, but other sources confirmed oxycodone abuse is on a downward trend in the state, although there’s debate over whether a 2011 law Bondi supported is the sole factor. While the specifics are a bit off, the gist and context of what Bondi is saying is accurate: There are no more Florida pill mill doctors in the DEA’s top 100. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07406	The Bush tax cuts "helped to create a substantial part of the deficit."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/29/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-bush-tax-cuts-caused-subs/	Cutting spending to reduce the deficit has been the focus of budget talks since Congress convened in January. Doubts that President Obama and House Republicans can do it by reconciling their deficit-cutting plans led the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s to lower its outlook on the United States from "stable" to "negative." It led S&P to warn that the U.S. could lose its coveted status as the world’s most secure economy if lawmakers don’t agree to bring spending in line with revenue. The GOP plan, approved by the House, would lower taxes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans and draw the bulk of its savings from cutting federal health care programs. Obama's plan would raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and reduce military and domestic spending. House Speaker John Boehner answered it by declaring tax increases "a non-starter." "We don’t have deficits because Americans are taxed too little, we have deficits because Washington spends too much," said the Republican from West Chester in Southwest Ohio. From both the other end of state and the political spectrum, Rep. Dennis Kucinich also said he was unsatisfied by the president's plan. But the Cleveland Democrat said he favored Obama's intention to end the so-called Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. The tax cuts, he said, "helped to create a substantial part of the deficit." Boehner's comment about too much spending was a statement of opinion. PolitiFact Ohio can't rate it. But we can look at Kucinich's claim about the tax cuts, which runs contrary to assertions that tax cuts pay for themselves. The Bush tax cuts refer to two pieces of legislation -- the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 -- that were enacted under President George W. Bush and written to expire at the end of 2010. They were extended for two years in December. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service examined them in "The Bush Tax Cuts and the Economy," a report issued last December, and in an earlier study of budget deficits and major legislation. Back in 2001, CRS said, the Congressional Budget Office projected gradually rising federal budget surpluses for the next decade. The tax cuts helped alter the outlook "dramatically," and the budget in 2002 recorded a deficit for the first time since 1997. "The Bush tax cuts, with a $1 trillion 10-year price tag, contributed to this shift from budget surpluses to deficits," CRS said. Other contributors included the 2001 recession, the increase in defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Medicare prescription drug benefit. But the tax cuts "generated the largest 10-year increases in budget deficits," CRS said. Estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation put the total cost for the tax cuts (including the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004) at more than the amount allocated to the Defense Department for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. "This means that even with the spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the federal budget would have been in surplus in 2007 if the tax cuts had not been enacted, or if their costs had been offset," said a 2008 analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The CBO last year projected a decrease in deficits if the tax cuts expired, and said extending all of them permanently would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits. PolitiFact has previously examined assertions that tax cuts increase revenues by stimulating economic growth. We found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth. "There's no clear relationship between taxes and economic growth," said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "Too many factors complicate the picture to draw clear conclusions about the taxes-growth relationship." Our colleagues at FactCheck.org came to a similar conclusion. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office reported in March, "Relative to the size of the economy, federal revenues are currently at their lowest level in 60 years." "There is no real dispute among economists that broad-based federal income tax cuts reduce revenue (except when tax rates are much higher than they are now)," said Alan D. Viard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Revenue is lower than it would be without the Bush tax cuts -- liberal and conservative economists are in accord on this question." Debate will go on about the effectiveness of tax cuts in stimulating growth. We won't enter it. But analysis backs up Kucinich in saying that the Bush cuts "helped to create a substantial part of the deficit." We rate his statement as True.

pomt-08628	"Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the nation."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/19/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-one-highest-taxed-stat/	In an effort to link taxes to the lack of job creation in Wisconsin, Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker is highlighting complaints that Wisconsin’s taxes are too high. "Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the nation, and it is no coincidence that our jobs are disappearing," Walker’s campaign website says. "Runaway government spending, paid for with high taxes, has led to the worst state unemployment rate in a generation. In the last year, Wisconsin lost a record-setting 130,000 jobs, and employers continue to lay off workers by the thousands. "From Harley-Davidson laying off hundreds of workers to Thomas Industries closing its doors in Sheboygan, one thing is clear: Wisconsin is not competitive. Other states are taking our jobs, and this must change." The question of the impact of taxes on job creation is a complicated one, and one hotly debated by candidates and economists alike. The question of where Wisconsin ranks is a bit easier to sort out. So is Walker correct? Are we "one of the highest taxed states in the nation"? The Journal Sentinel spent months examining tax burden rankings earlier this year and documented how far Wisconsin had fallen from its top-5 rating in recent years. The trend had received little attention up to that point, and in case you missed the April article, here’s a recap. (Some of the rankings are updated based on new Census Bureau data released this summer.) Under the latest figures, Wisconsin ranks 13th among the states for total tax burden. It was 14th the previous year -- the focus of the Journal Sentinel article. Those rankings measure total state and local taxes as a percentage of personal income. Wisconsin’s taxes are about 5 percent more than the national average. By another measure, taxation per person, the state was 18th in the latest rankings and its average burden was 1 percent below the national average. The year before it was 20th. The per-person measure is widely used but not as commonly as the income-based rank. The tax burden rank includes sales, property, income, fuel, alcohol and cigarette taxes, among others. The state ranks 12th on individual income tax burden, 8th on property taxes, 23rd on corporate income tax burden and 33rd on sales tax burden. Now, let’s look at the spending side of the ledger. Wisconsin is 25th of 50 in spending, with its governmental units consuming about 20 cents of every dollar of total personal income. That’s 1.5 percent above the national average. Wisconsin’s tax rank is higher than its spending rank because spending is also paid for by fees and federal revenues -- two sources Wisconsin relies less on than other states. Jill Bader, the Walker campaign’s spokeswoman, said the claim of "one of the highest in the nation" is based on three things. First, by the campaign’s accounting, Wisconsin’s total tax burden on income is right on the cusp of the top 10 because several states are bunched closely around the 11th spot. If you round up the tax burden percentage it’s a tie at that spot, instead of a 13th ranking, Bader said. The campaign also cites an informal prediction made in 2009 by Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization. Berry speculated that the big state tax increases enacted by Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature for 2010 and 2011 might eventually push the state back into the top 10, even as high as 6th. Because there is a two-year lag in Census Bureau tax data, those tax increases are not yet reflected in the rankings -- and won’t be until 2012. Finally, the campaign cites a national study by the Tax Foundation, a conservative research organization, that ranks Wisconsin in the bottom 10 of states on "business tax climate." Wisconsin was rated 42nd. So let’s take a look at the evidence and the Walker claim. Overall tax rank It may seem to be splitting hairs to distinguish between states when some are bunched up fairly tight. But that’s the way the tax rank game has always been played -- by researchers, politicians and the media -- so it’s not fair to change the rules now. We don’t remember hearing anybody rounding Wisconsin down to nearby states when we were top 5. When Wisconsin was ranked in the top 5 tax states, few would have disputed the state was among the highest. Now that Wisconsin has fallen to 13th in the latest rankings, on one measure, and 18th by another, we think the "one of the highest" claim misses the mark. When you factor in fees, which some consider taxes by another name, the state’s rank is 17th. Predicting the future Todd Berry’s prediction that the state will rise into the top 10 again is, he acknowledged in an interview, based on informed speculation. Only six states enacted bigger tax increases in 2009, so that’s a point in favor of Berry’s prognostication. But predicting future ranks is an imprecise science, at best, and his crystal ball doesn’t provide solid evidence of Walker’s claim, which is based on current rankings. Business taxes It strikes us as legitimate for Walker to base his claim in part on narrow business tax rankings. After all, he makes the statement in the context of businesses making hiring decisions. But he cherry-picks one study from the Tax Foundation, which criticizes states like Wisconsin that have progressive income taxation, under which high-income individuals pay at higher rates. If you look at that study, Wisconsin ranks at or near the middle of the pack on most of the taxes examined. The corporate income tax, for example, is in the bottom half of states in the study. Census figures put it just into the top half, but well below the national average. But the Tax Foundation penalizes Wisconsin overall because its individual income tax burden is 8th-highest. The foundation downgrades states that have a particularly high tax of one kind or another. Other studies by business-oriented groups portray Wisconsin’s business taxes in a much different light than the Tax Foundation’s study. Business taxes in Wisconsin are in the lower half of states based on how much those taxes consume of a state’s private sector economic production, according to a 2009 study prepared for the Council On State Taxation, a group of big corporations. So, to sum up: Walker claims that Wisconsin is "one of the highest taxed states." His campaign rounds the numbers up to put the state closer to the top 10 and it relies on a researcher’s prediction that is informed but speculative. The campaign also cherry-picks a study by a conservative group that finds business taxes are high, but it does not account for other data that show Wisconsin’s business taxes are middle or low. Overall, we found the state ranked 13th for total tax burden in rankings released this year and 14th in last year’s. There is some room for argument over what "one of the highest" means. But when you look at all state and local taxes combined, we think it’s a stretch to put Wisconsin’s current ranking up on that pedestal. We find Walker’s claim to be Half True.

Joe Biden alleged that Sen. John McCain said some time ago that the mortgage crisis had taken him by surprise. "Two years ago Barack Obama warned about the subprime mortgage crisis," Biden said early in the Oct. 2, 2008, debate. "John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a subprime mortgage problem." Then a few minutes later Biden said: "John McCain said as early as last December, quote – I'm paraphrasing – 'I'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis.'" This was likely an attempt to mute McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin's recent touting of McCain's advocacy in 2006 for stricter oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federally sponsored mortgage companies. McCain has cited that position to suggest he saw the mortgage crisis coming. (Indeed McCain did support more oversight of Fannie and Freddie, as we reported here .) But is it true that McCain said he was "surprised" at the mortgage crisis? We believe Biden was referring to McCain's remarks in this interview with the editorial board of the Keene Sentinel , a newspaper in New Hampshire, on Nov. 4, 2007. Turning to the subject of the mortgage crisis, one of the journalists asked him: "The dimension of this problem may be surprising to a lot of people, but to many people, many others, there were feelings that there was something amiss, something was going too fast, something was a little too hot, going back several years. Were you one of them? Or, you're a busy guy, you're looking at a lot of things, maybe subprime mortgages wasn't something you focused on every day. Were you surprised?" McCain: "Yeah. And I was surprised at the dot-com collapse, and I was surprised at other times in our history – I don't know if 'surprised' is the word, but –" Question: "S&L's?" McCain: "Yeah the S&L –" Question: "Is this bigger than that?" McCain: "You know, I don't know the dimensions of this. It's hard to know what the dimensions of it are. As I say, I never thought I'd pick up the paper and see a city in Norway somehow dramatically impacted by it. When I say 'surprised,' uh, I'm not surprised when in capitalist systems that there's greed and excess. I think it was Teddy Roosevelt who said unfettered capitalism leads to corruption or something like that..." McCain went on to say that a handful of people, including an adviser of his, Doug Holtz-Eakin, did sense something amiss in the economy. But he concluded with this: "I'd like to tell you I did anticipate it, but I have to give you straight talk, I did not." So yes, McCain said the mortgage crisis surprised him. And he concluded by acknowledging flat-out that he did not anticipate the crisis. So there is certainly truth to Biden's accusation. But McCain also said he didn't know if 'surprised' was the word. And he issued a blanket caveat about how greed and excess among capitalists never surprised him. So the context undermines Biden's claim a bit. (Not to mention that Biden flubbed the month that McCain made his comments.) We give Biden a Mostly True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-10-02T00:00:00	2008-10-02	['None']

pomt-07859	Says the foreman of the jury that convicted him was a Greenpeace activist.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/10/tom-delay/tom-delay-says-foreman-jury-convicted-him-was-gree/	Tom DeLay, the Republican former U.S. House majority leader convicted in Austin of laundering corporate contributions to bolster Texas House candidates, insisted he did no wrong and that the the case against him was just politics. In a Jan. 13 interview, DeLay told Matt Lauer, host of NBC-TV’s "Today," that his indictment and trial was driven by liberal Democrats and that the "foreman of the jury was a Greenpeace activist." Greenpeace is an international group that calls itself the leading independent "campaigning organization that uses peaceful direct action and creative communication" to expose and promote solutions to global environmental problems. "The point is is that this is a political campaign" against me, DeLay said. Greenpeace v. DeLay? We wanted background. An online search of news coverage showed that The Houston Chronicle identified the jury foreman in a Nov. 23 news article saying in part that the "forewoman" is a Greenpeace activist named Katie Stotts. The article’s author, R.G. Ratcliffe, told us in an interview that courtroom observers learned Stotts’ name when the judge inadvertently said it aloud. Ratcliffe said the Greenpeace information came from an entry on Stotts’ Facebook page indicating that she’d enthusiastically answered an invitation to a Greenpeace event. In our own Facebook check, we found that someone identified as Katarina von Stottsen said "HELL YES" to attending a September 2009 Greenpeace party in Austin. After DeLay’s trial, a letter from Katie Stotts of Austin appeared Nov. 30 on the Austin American-Statesman’s editorial page. In the letter, Stotts says that she was a juror in the trial, adding: "We did have a good mix of political affiliations on the jury, but what it came down to wasn't political sides. It took us three very difficult and intense days to come to a decision because we were considering all of the evidence to ensure that we came to the right decision." Stotts’ letter continues: "For those out there crying ‘liberal,’ they don't have a leg to stand on. It is an insult to my fellow jurors and I who put our lives on hold, and poured every last bit of our energy into making certain that a fair outcome was reached based only on the evidence, not any sort of political agenda... We performed our civil service with honesty and integrity, and stereotypes have no place in that." The letter makes no mention of Greenpeace. DeLay’s daughter, Dani DeLay Garcia, who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman, told us by e-mail that the foreman "wrote that she was a Greenpeace activist on her questionnaire," referring to written questions answered by prospective jurors before jury selection. Garcia also said she’s been told the questionnaires are public record. Not so, advised Michelle Brinkman, chief deputy clerk for the Travis County District Clerk’s office. She noted that the state’s Code of Criminal Procedure says information about a person collected by a court during jury selection is confidential and may not be disclosed unless a party to the trial or bona fide member of the news media applies for it. Then, "on a showing of good cause, the court shall permit disclosure," the law says. At our request, Brinkman asked the judge who presided over DeLay’s trial if questionnaire responses were available. The judge, Pat Priest, replied to her by e-mail Jan. 31: "I don't think we need dance either to Mr. DeLay's tune or to the reporter's, and the jurors made it clear they want their privacy protected. Tell him the information is unavailable." The same day, we reached Dick DeGuerin, DeLay’s lawyer in the case. DeGuerin declined to share a copy of Stotts’ questionnaire responses. But, he said, Stotts partly answered a question about club memberships including political involvements by writing: "I am a paying member of Greenpeace." DeGuerin said she answered the next question, per volunteer activities, with: "I’ve been to multiple rallies for environmental preservation issues." In a follow-up interview, DeGuerin said he did not use any allotted pre-emptory challenges to strike Stotts from the jury. "There were others" in the jury pool "much more objectionable," DeGuerin said. "I wish I’d had 20 strikes." Finally, we reached an Austin-area Greenpeace leader, who referred us to the group’s Washington spokesman, Joe Smyth. Smyth had no comment about Stotts but said via e-mail: "Every citizen enjoys the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, including serving on a jury, so it's bizarre that Tom Delay seems to think he can blame his criminal conviction on someone's politics or membership in an organization." Upshot: While Stotts reportedly self-identified as a Greenpeace backer, we’d need more information to deem her a Greenpeace activist. We rate DeLay’s statement Mostly True. UPDATE, 10:30 a.m. Feb. 11, 2011: After we published this article, Stotts responded to our Jan. 31 e-mail seeking comment. Stotts replied Feb. 10: "I contribute monetarily to Greenpeace, but I am not a Greenpeace activist. I went to, at most, a few local environmental rallies because a good friend of mine used to work for their organization. I have probably volunteered more times for the food bank in Austin than I have for official Greenpeace events. I also work for a conservative insurance company, but neither of these things had an effect on my ability to render an honest and fair verdict in the trial."

pomt-03629	"The port provides more than 297,000 jobs directly to the state of Georgia."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/06/johnny-isakson/isakson-ports-claim-target/	The deepening of the Georgia ports is one of the few issues in this state that has the support of the state’s top elected officials regardless of party affiliation. Shortly before President Barack Obama unveiled his proposed budget, U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., made his case for why more federal funding is necessary for the project. "There is nothing bigger right now for the entire state," Isakson said in a meeting with the Albany Herald’s editorial board, referring to the project. "The port provides more than 297,000 jobs directly to the state of Georgia." Isakson’s comments were picked up by several news sites across Georgia. We were curious if Isakson’s numbers were accurate and if there was any context missing. In 2015, a project to expand the Panama Canal is scheduled to be completed, allowing larger cargo ships to sail to America’s Eastern Seaboard. Political and business leaders in Georgia believe the deepening of the Savannah River will allow some of those larger ships to dock at its ports, thereby creating more jobs and boosting the Peach State’s economy. As an example of the significance of this issue, Georgia’s most prominent Republican and Democrat, Gov. Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, have worked together extensively to encourage Obama administration officials to provide more money for the ports. A week after Isakson’s comments, the White House released the president’s proposed budget. To the dismay of many Georgians involved in the Savannah project, the budget set aside $1.28 million to deepen the Savannah River, a drop in the bucket for the $652 million project. Georgia taxpayers already have put up $231 million, and the state will need to come up with at least $30 million under the federal-state formula to deepen the river. Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson forwarded us a report that referred to ports -- plural -- to back up his claim. The report was released in April 2010 and prepared by Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth. The report says there were 295,422 full- and part-time jobs in Georgia supported by the ports during the state of Georgia’s fiscal year 2009, which began July 1, 2008, and ended June 30, 2009. We had two specific issues. The first was that Isakson did not mention other ports in his comments. While the overwhelming bulk of the jobs are attributable to the Savannah port, a number of the jobs came from the Port of Brunswick and other private ports scattered along the Georgia coastline, according to Humphreys’ report. Culbertson agreed that the report included other ports. Humphreys said the senator may have generalized by referring solely to the Savannah port, since it is Georgia’s largest port. "It’s quite understandable," Humphreys said. The Savannah port generates an estimated $447 million in annual federal, state and local taxes, according to Humphreys’ most recent research. The Brunswick port, which is about an hour drive from Savannah, brings in about $23 million a year in tax revenue. Our other issue concerned whether all of these jobs could be directly attributed to the ports, as Isakson seems to have implied in his remarks to the newspaper’s editorial board. There is a more recent report on the ports, released in April 2012, as opposed to the report Isakson cited from 2010. In the newest report, Humphreys estimated there were about 352,000 full-time and part-time jobs resulting from the ports. Humphreys said 154,000 jobs could be attributed to companies that use the ports, and the remaining 198,000 jobs were indirectly a result from the ports. Humphreys said it’s valid for Isakson to include all of these jobs. Those indirect jobs, Humphreys said, range from companies that work with businesses at the port, to the diners that feed port workers. Humphreys also used the word "port-dependent jobs" to describe "indirect jobs." "It’s semantics," Humphreys said of the difference between "port-dependent jobs" and "indirect jobs." These jobs are across the state, the economist said. Although Chatham County is home to the Savannah port, Humphreys’ study concludes Fulton County is the recipient of more jobs from the ports. Humphreys didn’t quibble much with the senator’s argument. "Unfortunately, his numbers are a little out of date," Humphreys said. "In my opinion, he’s basically telling the truth." To sum up, Isakson said the Savannah port provides about 297,000 direct jobs to Georgia’s economy. The senator would have been more accurate if he said "port industry" or simply said "ports." Isakson underestimated the jobs impact in his argument. His estimate was based on a 2010 report, although the most recent report estimated the total at 352,000 jobs. Isakson’s remarks were not precise, but they are largely on target. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2013-05-06T06:00:00	2013-04-05	['None']

pomt-12210	Just 6 percent of Americans say Russia is the country’s most important issue, yet the story receives "75 percent of the coverage" in the media.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/23/kellyanne-conway/does-russia-take-75-percent-media-coverage/	The White House says the media is hostile to the president and is using some new evidence presented by a conservative blogger to make its case. But that evidence is faulty. On Fox News on Saturday, Kellyanne Conway, one of President Donald Trump’s top advisers, argued that the media blocks important White House messaging by covering issues the public sees as unimportant. "This is a media that has decided it’s going be very hostile," Conway told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on July 22, 2017. Conway then cited two different bits of research to contrast the percentage of news coverage devoted to different political issues and the public’s general interest in each issue. "People were asked, which of the following issues is most important to you?" Conway said. "Health care, 35 percent (of people said it was the most important issue, but it) got like 10 percent of the coverage. Russia, 6 percent most important issue, received 75 percent of the coverage. Immigration, 10 percent most important issue, zero percent of the coverage." New White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a similar claim on ABC’s This Week. "Look, there was a Wall Street Journal poll that came out this week that showed that the top three issues that Americans care about are immigration, health care, and jobs. The top three issues that the media cares about are Russia, Russia, and Russia," Huckabee Sanders said. "There's 15 times more coverage on Russia than on the three big issues that Americans care about. That's a problem. That's exactly the definition of Russia fever." The poll Huckabee Sanders is talking about came from Bloomberg, not the Wall Street Journal, and it found that health, jobs and terrorism were the top three important issues among respondents (not immigration, health care and jobs). That said, we wondered more broadly if the White House’s claim the media is devoting 75 percent of its coverage to the Russia investigation while few people claim it is the country’s most important issue. Genesis of this claim Conway’s claim stems from a post on the conservative blog Ricochet.com comparing a Bloomberg poll that asked Americans what they see as the most important issue facing the country right now to a June 27 Media Research Center survey of the time broadcast networks’ evening newscasts devoted to different issues. Bloomberg’s poll found that six percent of Americans said the United States’ "relationship with Russia" is the most important issue facing the country right now, behind health care, immigration, jobs, terrorism and even climate change. The Media Research Center, a conservative group, tracked coverage on the network news broadcasts of ABC, CBS and NBC from May 17 to June 20. The Ricochet’s Jon Gabriel put these two pieces of information together. He concluded that of 469 combined minutes of coverage of Trump during those broadcasts, 353 focused on either the firing of former FBI Director James Comey or Russia. Put another way, of the broadcasts it analyzed, the Media Research Center found 75 of coverage of Trump focused on questions about Comey or Trump. "The media have shown how drastically out of step they are with their own audience. If they want to earn back their hemorrhaging Nielsen numbers, perhaps they can spend time on something other than Russia Russia Russia." Where Conway’s claim falls apart Upon deeper analysis, however, the numbers don’t hold up. And experts we spoke to raised serious flaws in comparing the two pieces of research. The Ricochet post misreads the Media Research Center analysis. The Ricochet post appears to use this Media Research Center graphic to count the number of minutes the evening news talked about Trump. Those categories total 469 minutes, 75 percent of which are about Russia/Comey stories. But the Media Research Center said that it found 640 minutes of total coverage of Trump in its analysis not 469 minutes. That means, excluding anything else, that airtime devoted to the Russia probe constituted 55 percent of all coverage of the Trump presidency during the five weeks following the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. It’s also worth making clear that the Media Research Center study was only analyzing coverage of Trump, not all media coverage. The Media Research Center analysis is limited. It is important to note that this study was only looking at network evening newscasts from ABC, CBS and NBC. It doesn’t include Fox or Fox News, CNN, MSNBC or any other cable news channel. It also doesn’t include newspapers or radio or online publications like Politico. On top of that, the analysis only covers about a month (May 17-June 20). "A more extensive study would likely have somewhat different results of individual news outlets," said Stephen Farnsworth, director of University of Mary Washington's Center for Leadership and Media Studies. "One of the things you see when you compare newspapers with television is a much wider range of topics being discussed, much more material than in a 30-minute news broadcast." Other polls show that Americans are interested in the Russia investigation. The question in the Bloomberg poll Conway referenced was not about the Russia investigation. Other polls suggest that Americans are interested in the investigation. A June poll by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 48 percent of people surveyed said they were extremely or very concerned that Trump or others involved with his campaign had inappropriate contacts with the Russian government during last year’s presidential campaign. Another 20 percent said they were moderately concerned. The White House and Trump play a role in setting what’s covered. Experts told us that it’s also worth noting that the media often covers what elected officials say or do. So if they’re talking more about Russia, the media will, too. Farnsworth pointed to a dearth of committee hearings and public debate on recent Republican health care legislation and the newsworthiness of firing an FBI director. Albert May, Associate Emeritus Professor of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said Trump’s tweets calling attention to the Russia probe has helped fuel more coverage. At the same time, Trump has kept a relatively quiet public schedule, May said. None of the experts we talked with were surprised by the schism between the public’s policy concerns and the media’s coverage of the issue. "The longstanding criticism of the press is that you focus on the scandal and not the policy issue like health care, but the truth is that’s what people are most interested in," May said. "The media's issue agenda and the public's issue agenda are never a perfect match," said Thomas Patterson, a Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press at Harvard. "Typically, the public ranks a scandal below policy issues when asked in a poll their opinion of ‘the nation's most important problem.’ So I think what we're seeing in the numbers is business as usual by the national press." Our ruling Conway said just 6 percent of Americans say Russia is the country’s most important issue, yet the story receives "75 percent of the coverage" in the media. A credible national poll found that six percent of Americans listed the U.S.-Russian relationship as the country’s most important issue. The question did not include any discussion of investigating whether Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. At the same time, an analysis by a conservative research organization shows that network news on ABC, NBC and CBS have made the Russia story an integral part of their Trump coverage. But experts caution about reading too much into the network news analysis, which is limited in scope. And either way, Conway’s numbers are off by 20 percentage points.

pomt-06814	There are cities and counties in Georgia that don’t have websites, and where elected officials don’t have email addresses.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/12/sam-olens/olens-some-georgia-counties-cities-lack-websites-e/	A recent statement by state Attorney General Sam Olens had PolitiFact Georgia musing on the quirks of our digital age. Thanks to the Internet, you can track your ex’s new girlfriend on Facebook. You can watch a YouTube video of recording artist Nicki Minaj’s wardrobe malfunction, over and over again. You can even buy a 1963 Studebaker on eBay while reclining in your Barcalounger. But email your county commissioner? That’s not so simple, Olens told attendees at an Atlanta Press Club breakfast Aug. 4. The subject came up as Olens talked about the state’s open records and meetings laws, which journalists use to ferret out government corruption. It’s a bad idea to require all governments to use the Internet to inform residents about meetings, Olens told breakfast-goers. "[K]eep in mind, we still have cities and counties where the elected officials don’t have email addresses, where there are no websites," Olens said. No emails or websites? Surely, Olens jests. Nowadays, even pet cats have their own websites. Really. It so happens that the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, a group that represents county governments, conducted a survey in July to see which counties lacked websites. They found 30. The state Attorney General’s Office sent us a list of those counties, as well as information from the Georgia Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns statewide. The GMA lists 217 municipalities that don’t have their own websites. Some of these governments have a Web presence on a local chamber of commerce or regional development website but do not control or operate them, said Beth Brown, a spokeswoman for the ACCG. They often don’t have enough staff or money to run a website, spokeswomen for both groups told us. Others are so remote they can’t get high-speed Internet access. Consider Taliaferro County. In 2009, an estimated 1,812 residents lived in all of its 195.4 square miles, according to census and state data. Their commissioners work part time, so officials don’t see a need to spend the resources to give them their own accounts, the county clerk told us. Bacon County gives email addresses to elected officials who ask for them, but not all of them in this county of about 10,600 do. Their one-man IT department hopes to get the county’s official website up soon. It just takes a lot of manpower to get it done, he said. The city of Walthourville, population 4,000, just started its website this year and is in the process of assigning email addresses, the city clerk said. So Olens is right. Not only are there counties and municipalities in Georgia that don’t have websites or whose elected officials don’t have government email. State organizations place their numbers at more than 200. Or, to put it differently, the cats of certain pet-obsessed owners have pounced across the digital divide well ahead of scores of Georgia governments. Olens earns a True.
