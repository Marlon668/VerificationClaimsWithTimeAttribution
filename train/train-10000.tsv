pomt-02356	"Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/mar/20/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-vpk-no-1-country-access/	In a photo any candidate for re-election would crave, Gov. Rick Scott is seated alongside a couple of cute pre-kindergarten kids at a science museum as a girl chews on her fingers and a boy reaches in a container for a crayon. Scott was at the the Science and Discovery Center of Northwest Florida in Panama City on March 12, 2014, to tout funding for the state’s voluntary pre-kindergarten program, known as VPK. A few days later, he boasted about VPK in a tweet: "Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten. We need to keep it that way." Scott, a Republican, is expected to face former Gov. Charlie Crist, now a Democrat, in November. Education has become a hot topic in the race and PolitiFact Florida has previously fact-checked claims about K-12 and higher education. Here we decided to explore Scott’s claim about the state’s ranking on access to VPK. Report comparing states on preschool Florida’s VPK program launched in 2005 as a result of voters approving an amendment to provide free access to all of the state’s 4-year-olds to prepare them for kindergarten. Students learn how to identify shapes and colors, write their own name, recognize letters and recognize patterns, among other skills. The program is offered at public schools and private day care centers. Children can enroll in a school-year program that totals 540 hours. That typically translates to three hours a day during the school year -- though many parents pay for additional "wrap-around" hours. Parents can also elect a summer program of 300 hours instead of the school year. The National Institute for Early Education Research, a unit of the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers, publishes an annual State Preschool Yearbook that has tracked the funding, access, and policies of state-funded pre-school programs since the 2001-02 school year. We looked at the rankings for Florida, which was compared against programs in 40 states during the 2011-12 school year. (The next report is expected in April.) The report ranked the states on the following criteria: Access. Florida ranked No. 1 for serving 4-year-olds with 79 percent of the eligible population served in 2012. Participation has grown rapidly from about 100,000 students in 2005 to 175,000 in 2011-12. The program remains optional, so it may not continue to grow much higher in terms of the percentage served. State spending. Florida ranked No. 35 for state spending. The amount of state funding per student dropped from $2,755 in 2008 to $2,281 in 2012, according to the report. The state’s Office of Early Learning had a slightly different figure because it provides a per-pupil amount for the school year and a lower one for the summer. In 2010-11 -- the budget set before Scott was elected -- the per-pupil school year amount was $2,562. Then under Scott it dropped to $2,383 where it has stayed for three years. Scott has proposed a $100 increase. Quality benchmarks. Florida meets only three of the 10 benchmarks -- those related to early learning standards, class size and site monitoring. It did not meet benchmarks that related to teacher degrees, specialized training and other areas. Florida and Ohio both met three benchmarks. Only one state met fewer (Texas with two). Experts weigh in on Florida’s VPK program So what’s the big picture about Florida’s VPK program? Does it make sense for Scott to boast about access when the state lags behind in per-pupil spending and quality benchmarks? Many states face the tradeoff between broad access and commitment to quality, said Daphna Bassok, an expert in early childhood education and assistant professor at the University of Virginia. "Overall, Florida’s program is characterized by very high access but relatively low quality, as far as quality standards, length of school day, dollars per child," and other issues, she told PolitiFact Florida. Another expert said that the benchmarks set by the National Institute for Early Education Research, or NIEER, are subjective measures of quality. Grover (Russ) Whitehurst, a former U.S. Education Department official under President George W. Bush and a fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that one benchmark requires programs to provide one meal a day. But that doesn’t make sense for a program such as Florida’s that offers three hours a day. "Access and state spending are based on hard data, whereas the NIEER benchmarks are nothing more than the opinion of NIEER, an advocacy organization," Whitehurst told PolitiFact Florida. "I place little stock in the NIEER benchmarks." Scott’s spokeswoman referred us to the state’s Office of Early Learning for a response. "When it comes to the benchmarks that NIEER uses to rank states for quality and spending, we believe that the most important benchmark is not included," spokeswoman Cynthia Sucher told PolitiFact Florida. "How well does VPK prepare Florida 4-year-olds for kindergarten?" Assessments done by public school districts once students enter kindergarten show that almost 82 percent of children who completed a VPK program were ready for kindergarten, compared to about 53 percent of those who did not participate in VPK in 2013. That was the fifth consecutive year of an increase in the preparedness rate for those that completed VPK. But that data isn’t compelling, some say, because there are likely differences in the backgrounds and abilities between the two groups. Non-attendees may be poorer or have parents who don’t speak English, Whitehurst said. That makes it difficult to draw conclusions that it's the program that's causing better outcomes. "The present evidence that Florida's VPK is having a positive impact on school readiness and later academic achievement is weak to nonexistent," he said. "This doesn't mean it isn't having a positive impact. Rather, it means that the impact is presently unknown." Our ruling Scott said, "Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten." A national education group ranked Florida No. 1 in access for 4-year-olds during the 2011-12 school year, the most recent year available. However, the same report ranked Florida 35th in state spending per pupil. The report also concluded that the state only met three of 10 benchmarks, though it’s possible for education experts to quibble about the value of those benchmarks. Scott was careful with his wording because he only mentioned "access," but the rest of the report’s findings may provide a different picture of Florida’s VPK program. His statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-03-20T15:55:50	2014-03-16	['None']
pomt-07978	"We had a debate on whether ‘ObamaCare’ was the way to go to fix up health care and the American voters said no -- emphatically."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/20/jim-sensenbrenner/rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-americans-have-emphatic/	As Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives planned their January 2011 vote to repeal the health care reform bill, members turned to the results of the November election for support. In Washington, Republicans swept to power in the House and narrowed Democratic majorities in the Senate. In Wisconsin, the GOP won a U.S. Senate seat, the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature. Repealing health reform -- "ObamaCare," as they label it -- was a part of Republican campaigns at all levels. In the run-up to the House repeal vote, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, appeared Jan. 16, 2010 at a town hall meeting. In comments to reporters, including WTMJ-AM (620), he discussed the rationale for pursuing repeal of the law. (On Jan. 19, the Republican-led House voted 245-189 largely along party lines to repeal the health care reform bill, but the effort is likely to die in the Senate.) "The House of Representatives -- and this representative -- has listened to the American people," Sensenbrenner said. "We had a debate on whether ‘ObamaCare' was the way to go to fix up health care and the American voters said no -- emphatically." Of course, public opinion can be a moving target. And election mandates can grow over time, especially in the eyes of the winners. So we decided to take a look at Sensenbrenner’s statement, including at what current polls are showing. Asked for support for Sensenbrenner’s position, aides noted he held 101 town hall meetings in his district last year. "At these meetings, the overwhelming majority of attendees (public from the 5th District) were opposed to the healthcare bill and/or supported the law’s repeal," said communications director Wendy Riemann. She added that 70 percent to 75 percent of those who called or wrote Sensenbrenner’s office since last February "have been opposed to the law and would like to see it repealed." Sensenbrenner’s staff also pointed to a Jan. 17, 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll, the day after he spoke. That poll said 55 percent of likely voters favor repeal of the health care law, while 40 percent oppose repeal. Here’s the question Rasmussen asked: "A proposal has been made to repeal the health care bill and stop it from going into effect. Do you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose a proposal to repeal the health care bill?" On the face of it, 55 percent does not seem "emphatic." Indeed, according to the firm, the percentage strongly favoring repeal has fallen. The firm’s summary said: "Just 40 percent strongly favor repeal, matching the lowest level found since the health care bill became law. Thirty percent strongly oppose repeal." We found some other fresh polls, which provide a murkier picture than the one painted by Sensenbrenner. The Associated Press conducted its own poll and reported Jan. 17 that "strong opposition to the law stands at 30 percent." The figure was close to the lowest level found in AP surveys dating back to September 2009. "The nation is divided over the law, but the strength and intensity of the opposition appear diminished," the AP reported. "The poll finds that 40 percent of those surveyed said they support the law, while 41 percent oppose it. Just after the November congressional elections, opposition stood at 47 percent and support was 38 percent." The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4.2 percentage points. As for repeal, only about one in four said they want to do away with the law completely. Meanwhile, the Kaiser Family Foundation conducts a health tracking poll and in January 2011 issued an update about public opinion about reform. "The last Kaiser Health Tracking Poll of the year found that 42 percent of Americans held a favorable view of health reform, 41 percent an unfavorable view and 18 percent offered no opinion. This pattern has been roughly stable over the eight months since passage, suggesting that neither side has been able to make a definitive case for or against the bill." Kaiser’s report added that 26 percent of those surveyed want to repeal the law in its entirety; 25 percent want to repeal parts of the law and keep other parts; one in five want to leave the law as it is; and one in five want to expand the law. Finally, a Jan. 7, 2011 Gallup poll concluded that Americans "do not strongly endorse" House Republicans’ efforts to repeal the bill. Gallup found that 46 percent of Americans want their representative in Congress to vote to repeal the health care law, 40 percent want their representative to vote to let the law stand, and 14 percent have no opinion. That’s the view today. What about at the time of the election? PolitiFact Wisconsin addressed this topic last fall, during the race for U. S. Senate. We looked into a television ad by Ron Johnson that claimed, "A majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care" and rated the claim False. In that case, the polling was more mixed than Johnson presented and, in some cases, respondents opposed the law not because it went too far, but because it did not go far enough. Where does all of this leave us today? Sensenbrenner said American voters had "emphatically" rejected the federal health reform changes. District residents may have felt that way, though calls to a congressman’s office are hardly scientific -- and Sensenbrenner’s statement cited national opinion on the issue. Also, numerous polls after the November election indicated that voters had one issue foremost in their mind: the economy. Of four fresh looks at how Americans feel about repealing health care reform, his staff chose one -- Rasmussen’s poll of likely voters -- that supported his position. But that sentiment is not shared by the public at large, according to multiple other polls. And in the Rasmussen poll, the percentage strongly supporting repeal has fallen. We rate Sensenbrenner’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08373	Says Tom Perriello voted "to give tax breaks to foreign companies creating jobs in China."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/25/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-tom-perriello-voted-give-tax-brea/	State Sen. Robert Hurt says folks in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District do things "differently" than politicians in Washington. But Hurt is following the same playbook as other Republican candidates by attacking his Democratic opponent’s support of the stimulus by raising the specter of Communist China -- complete with a red Chinese flag on a make-believe TV set. "Differently" is a Hurt political ad that plays the China card against U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello, a Democrat from Charlottesville, for his vote in favor of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, better known as the stimulus package signed by President Obama in February 2009. The ad defends Hurt against accusations by Perriello that he wants to ship jobs overseas. "That’s just false," the announcer states. "But Perriello did vote to give tax breaks to foreign companies creating jobs in China." The ad says the accusation is based on a story published Sept. 9 in the Washington Times that says "as much as 80 percent of some green programs, including $2.3 billion of manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms that employed workers primarily in countries including China, South Korea and Spain, rather than in the United States." It’s an assertion that originates from a series of stories by the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University in Washington. The workshop report, "Blown Away," documents how foreign-based companies are using stimulus grants to develop wind farms in the United States. The workshop’s initial estimate in October 2009, was that foreign companies collected 80 percent of $1 billion in grants. An update in February pegged the estimate at 79 percent of $2.1 billion in grants. But those are allforeign companies, not just those from China. The Chinese connection comes from a $1.5 billion wind farm proposed last year in Texas by a consortium of American and Chinese companies that planned to buy turbines manufactured in China for the wind farm. Subsequently, the consortium partners have proposed to build a factory in Nevada to produce the turbines and most of their components. Here’s the problem for Hurt and other politicians relying on the Washington Times story: the $2.3 billion in manufacturing credits come from a part of the stimulus act that explicitly links the credits to creation of manufacturing jobs in green industries in the United States, according to the workshop report. By contrast, the workshop investigation focused on a provision that allowed payments in lieu of tax credits for development of alternative energy sources, including wind farms, without requiring the projects to produce manufacturing jobs in the United States. "They’re sort of freely mixing the two programs," Russ Choma, the journalist who produced the workshop report, told PolitiFact. So while the Times story may be correct in asserting that investments in alternative energy technologies haven’t created as many U.S. jobs as some supporters wanted, the story does not provide sufficient evidence to back up Hurt’s claim. Yet in campaign ads in many states, Republicans have portrayed a vote for the stimulus to be a vote to send jobs to China, glossing over the details of the actual program. They have exaggerated the total money that’s gone to this particular program and ignored the small portion that actually ended up in China. The same day Hurt’s ad first aired, Choma published an update on the workshop Web site that referred to a similar dustup in a West Virginia congressional race. In it, Choma said the IRW hadn’t found any examples of wind turbines built entirely in China. Choma cited the conclusion of a PolitiFact National analysis in February that debunked a similar assertion by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Subsequently, PolitiFact reports in Georgia and Wisconsin found little or no truth in similar accusations by Republican congressional candidates. He also revised his estimates that had originally said 80 percent of the money went to foreign companies. The revised estimate said 54 percent of a total of $4.4 billion in grants for wind farms had gone to foreign-owned companies, and that 65 percent of the turbines installed on those farms were constructed by foreign manufacturers instead of the original estimate of 79 percent. It is true that many companies taking advantage of the grants for alternative energy sources are based outside of the U.S., but most of them are in Europe and none was owned by a Chinese company. The American Wind Energy Association, representing the developers involved, said only three of the 33,000 wind turbines operating in the U.S. today were made in China and those included parts made in Minnesota and North Dakota. The association claims the tax credit provision in the stimulus act "saved" 40,000 jobs in the American wind industry by stimulating demand. It does not have an estimate of the jobs that would be created by the manufacturing tax credit cited by the Washington Times. Choma, the author whose article sparked the allegation, remains perplexed by the avalanche of ads that have relied on his work. "I don’t see how you can attach China to the manufacturing tax credit," Choma told us. We don’t see the connection either, so we find Hurt’s claim to be False.

pomt-14381	"Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/mar/17/hillary-clinton/clinton-ad-claims-arizona-lags-k-12-education/	With Arizona’s Presidential Preference Election set for Tuesday, presidential candidates -- and their accompanying advertisements -- have picked up steam. Hillary Clinton’s campaign aired a 30-second spot on Arizona airwaves on March 16 specific to K-12 education. "Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student," the ad states. "Hillary knows our kids deserve better, education means a good job, a decent living." The ad proposes preschool for every student as well as college without "crushing debt." The ad cites a January 2016 Education Week ranking for the 45th in the nation claim. Education Week uses several measures, including finance, achievement and chance for success. Arizona Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said the numbers were accurate based on the sources cited. For the dead last in funding per student part of the claim, the ad cites the Arizona School Boards Association, a statewide nonprofit. Clinton campaign spokesman Tim Hogan noted that both claims were from the Education Week report. Education Week uses data from several federal agencies, including the U.S. Education Department, U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Commerce Department. According to the data, Arizona spends $7,733 per student, almost 35 percent less than the national average of $11,841 per student. The numbers are adjusted for regional cost differences. In fiscal year 2013, Arizona ranked 49th, out of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, in per student spending, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. "That’s the sad reality, the lack of investment in human capital," said Arizona School Boards Association Executive Director Timothy Ogle. However, Arizona isn’t dead last in per-student spending -- Utah is. According to Education Week’s regionally adjusted numbers, Utah ranks 51st, spending $7,084 per student. The data includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. However, the actual text of the advertisement does mention that Arizona is 50th in per student funding though, which is correct. They’re just not dead last. Our ruling Clinton’s campaign said, "Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student." Education Week data vets the first claim, but the advertisement is off by one in its claim that the Grand Canyon State is dead last. Utah is. Both states still spend thousands of dollars less than the national average in funding per student. We rate the ad as Mostly True.

pomt-08149	Measures taken by my administration "have saved taxpayers $1 billion."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/05/donald-carcieri/carcieri-says-his-administration-saved-rhode-islan/	Forget the $64,000 question. That's chump change these days. With Governor Carcieri about to leave office, the question is: Did his administration save Rhode Island taxpayers $1 billion during his eight years in office? Carcieri made that claim in a commentary piece published in The Providence Journal on Nov. 8. "Today state government is leaner, more frugal and more accountable to the taxpayers than it was eight years ago," he wrote. "We have enacted separation of powers; cleaned up Resource Recovery and Beacon Mutual; reduced the number of state employees by over 2,000; implemented state employee pension and health-insurance reforms; rooted out government waste, and instituted scores of efficiencies over the years. Combined, these measures have saved taxpayers nearly $1 billion." That's a lot of money, especially in a state facing huge budget deficits. We wondered where those saving came from, so we asked the Carcieri administration for the details to back up that $1 billion claim. After a week and a half, administration officials provided a spreadsheet that shows savings in 16 categories totaling $1,067,484,418.97. We examined them all. But let's talk about the four big-ticket items that, together, account for $803.5 million of the savings. "Staff Reduction" The administration says it saved a total of $191.6 million by cutting the number of full-time-equivalent state employees from 15,312 to 13,050 -- a reduction of 2,262 jobs -- which matches Carcieri's claim that he reduced the number of state employees by "over 2,000." The administration uses numbers from the start of the 2003 fiscal year -- six months before Carcieri took office. If you start counting when Carcieri became governor, the job cuts total 2,033, House fiscal records show. But that's still "over 2,000." The administration excluded research positions at state colleges sponsored by third parties. But House fiscal officials, who have a big role in writing the budget, think it's best to include those positions, House spokesman Larry Berman said. If you do, the Carcieri administration has cut 1,761 jobs, he said. We then questioned whether the administration had replaced state employees with contract workers. Berman said it's tough to tell, but the Assembly has established greater scrutiny and controls over use of contractors in lieu of state employees. Rosemary Booth Gallogly, Carcieri's director of administration, said the state had 873 contract employees before Carcieri took office and now it has no more than 646. To calculate the $191.6 million in staff-reduction savings, the administration multiplied the number of full-time equivalents cut each year by that year's average cost of state employee wages and benefits. (The wage-and-benefits average rose from $68,315 in fiscal year 2003 to $95,197 in fiscal year 2010.) "Pension Reform" On the administration's original spreadsheet, the single largest category of savings was "Pension Reform," totaling $398.8 million. Administration documents show the pension savings came in three waves, beginning in fiscal year 2006 when changes in retirement age, benefits and cost-of-living adjustments saved $44 million a year. A second wave began in 2009 when changes in retirement eligibility, benefits and final average compensation resulted in savings of $59.4 million, on top of the annual $44 million amount. And a third wave began in 2010 when cost-of-living adjustments were limited to the first $35,000 of annual pension, saving an additional $16 million. Those cumulative savings are expected to continue, but the spreadsheet does not reflect pension savings for future years. Retiree Health-Care By contrast, the spreadsheet shows both past and future savings in retiree health-care costs as a lump sum of $111.3 million. Booth Gallogly explained those savings result from 2008 changes in eligibility and the requirement that those receiving retiree health care pay 20 percent of the cost. Those changes prompted many state employees to retire before the new rules took effect, she said. The state has already saved some of that money. For example, she said $10.6 million was saved in fiscal year 2009, but other parts of those savings will be realized over the next 30 years. So why count the pension reform savings year by year while counting the retiree health-care savings all at once? Booth Gallogly said full documentation for the year-to-year retiree health-care savings were not readily available. But, she said, "Actions you take now to reduce the unfunded liability should be counted in the year you take them. It's still good savings." "We drink from wells we did not dig," Booth Gallogly said, using a saying that stems from the Book of Deuteronomy. "Many of the things being done will have a very significant impact over time, as long as they don't get reversed." Russell Dannecker, a former state Senate fiscal adviser who is now the fiscal policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Poverty Institute, said the state will eventually save $111.3 million, but it hasn't saved that total amount yet. John Simmons, executive director of the business-backed Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (and a member of Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee's transition team), said the Carcieri administration and the General Assembly deserve credit for both the $111.3 million in retiree health-care savings and whatever the full impact of the pension reform will be over time because those are "structural changes" that will lower the amount of money the state must spend in those areas. While some of those savings won't be realized for say 20 years, "it's savings nonetheless," he said. And if you add all that up, it would exceed the $1 billion amount cited by the governor, he said. "Co-share savings" The last big category is savings on health insurance premiums for state employees. Booth Gallogly said state employees used to pay nothing toward their health insurance but now they pay up to 25 percent, for a total savings of $101.8 million. The changes started in 2005 with nonunion employees; union employees were added in later years. Other categories Those four categories account for about 75 percent of the $1 billion in savings cited by Carcieri, but it's also worth looking at a couple of smaller categories. For example, the spreadsheet lists $15.5 million in savings from moving state offices out of leased space and into state-owned properties, such as the move of the Division of Motor Vehicles from the Apex building in Pawtucket to state-owned property in Cranston. Dannecker said such moves undoubtedly save the state rent money. But the state can also incur considerable costs from renovating and operating state-owned properties, he said. The renovations to the Forand Building, which now houses the DMV, came to $17.9 million. The final category of savings was $37.1 million in "Department of Corrections Cost Avoidance." Corrections Director A.T. Wall explained that state prisons were becoming overcrowded, threatening to exceed agreed-up limits resulting a from federal court action, so officials considered spending $31.7 million to build new housing units at the John J. Moran Medium-Security Facility. But the state avoided that cost by enacting legislation in 2008 that allowed inmates serving shorter sentences to shave time off their sentences through good behavior and participating in rehabilitation programs, he said. Dannecker said it's good the state avoided the cost of a new prison construction. But, he asked, "Is cost avoidance a savings to the taxpayer? Isn't that really just good government? It certainly did not reduce the taxpayers' burden from what it was. When I think of savings to the taxpayer, I think we were paying this amount and now we are paying less. That's how I classify savings." He offered the example of a broken refrigerator: You could pay $200 to fix it or spend $2,000 for a new one, but if you choose the less expensive option, it's a good choice but it doesn't mean you have $1,800 more in your checking account. Simmons maintained that avoiding the cost of new prison construction does represent valid savings. Berman said, "It's important to note that the governor did not find these savings alone. Almost all of them were included in the budgets that the General Assembly enacted." Carcieri spokeswoman Amy Kempe agreed that, "without the cooperation of the General Assembly, significant amounts of that savings would not have been achieved." But she said the governor can set the agenda by making proposals, and he proposed going even further in areas such as pension reform. Bottom line In the end, Carcieri's statement that "these measures saved taxpayers nearly $1 billion" requires further analysis and explanation. It's clear, for example, that many millions of dollars in savings are expected in future years but haven't been realized yet; that some savings come with offsetting costs; and that even the best budget experts disagree about issues such as whether "cost avoidance" is the same as take-it-to-the-bank, cut-my-budget savings. Also, it appears Carcieri tossed out the $1 billion figure before completing a full, accurate analysis of those savings. It's also worth nothing that the total state budget grew from $5.77 billion in fiscal year 2004 to $7.86 billion in the current year. But that includes federal funding, a major portion of the budget. The state share of spending grew from $2.72 billion to $2.94 billion in that period, about 8 percent. Booth Gallogly said state spending would have gone up more had the cuts not been made. "We would have had to either increase taxes or other revenues or reduce expenditures in areas that might have been Draconian," she said. But there's no doubt that the Carcieri administration, mostly in concert with the General Assembly, helped save taxpayers a lot of money over the past eight years. If you take the most liberal interpretation claimed by the governor -- factoring in both past and future pension-reform and retiree health-care savings -- the final figure could be substantially more than $1 billion. If you take the most conservative estimate -- only counting pension-reform and retiree health-care savings to date and excluding "cost avoidance" -- the final figure, by our calculation, would total in the neighborhood of $930 million. We take the moderate approach, rating Carcieri's claim "Mostly True."	None	Donald Carcieri	None	None	None	2010-12-05T00:00:01	2010-11-08	['None']

pomt-09938	Says Vice President Joe Biden "admits that the American people are being scammed" with the economic stimulus package.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/08/john-boehner/boehner-claims-biden-said-stimulus-scamming-americ/	The White House has been trumpeting the success of its economic stimulus package. President Barack Obama claimed that in its first 100 days, the plan "saved or created" 150,000 jobs (which we rated Barely True ). On June 8, 2009, Obama promised that number would quadruple by the fall. Republicans are skeptical, however, saying the package hasn't delivered as many jobs as Obama claims. In response to Obama's latest promise, House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner offered this sharp criticism, calling the stimulus a "bloated government spending scheme" that hasn't helped the economy: "Democrats said [the stimulus] would immediately create jobs, yet nearly four months later unemployment has continued to climb and none of their rosy predictions have come true," he said in a statement. "Our plan to let the American people keep more of what they earn would have created twice the jobs at half the cost of the Democrats’ bloated government spending scheme. But instead of shifting course, Democrats are doubling down on their plan to spend taxpayer dollars as fast as possible, even as their own vice president admits that the American people are being scammed." We wondered if Boehner was right that Vice President Joe Biden had been so blunt in describing the legislative centerpiece of the Obama-Biden administration. Biden held a roundtable with business leaders on June 2 and discussed the stimulus plan and the administration's efforts to spend the money quickly but still avoid waste and fraud. An Associated Press account of that meeting said, "With so much money at stake, Biden said some waste was inevitable and that a team of federal auditors had already uncovered problematic projects. 'People are being scammed already,' Biden said, promising to expose abuses whenever they were detected." Biden was referring to the fact that some people have been lured by con artists who promise big stimulus bucks in return for personal information or a fee. Take Kristann Hartley, an Ohio woman featured in a National Public Radio report from March 9, 2009. Hartley applied for a stimulus grant to weatherize her home only to find out that the Web site offering the money was a scam. But Boehner's statement suggests Biden had a whole other meaning when he talked about 'people being scammed.' In reading the full text of Boehner's statement it's clear that Boehner was suggesting the stimulus spending plan itself is a mistake and that White House claims of positive economic effects are misleading. Using Biden's "scammed" remark in that context makes it sound like Biden was saying the same thing, acknowledging that the White House "scamming" the public by pretending the stimulus spending has been working. That's not what Biden meant at all. In fact, news coverage indicates the scammers Biden was talking about are garden-variety con artists merely using the stimulus as a cover, and that the programs they seek to exploit are just a minuscule portion of the $787 billion package. The Obama administration has emphasized many other anecdotes and news stories that show the stimulus working the way it is supposed to in helping local government avoid layoffs and helping states balance their budgets. Boehner may be technically correct that Biden mentioned people being scammed in the roundtable meeting. But Boehner incorrectly suggests the vice president called the stimulus a scam and he fails to note that Biden promised "to expose abuses whenever they were detected," as the AP reported. We find Boehner's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08782	Property taxes "are now 18% higher than when (Mark Sharpe) first took office."	false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/20/josh-burgin/josh-burgin/	First, incumbent Mark Sharpe sent out a mailer saying he cut property taxes by 17 percent, making the case that his fiscal conservatism is a top reason he should be returned to the Hillsborough County Commission in these trying times. Oh, no he didn’t, challenger Josh Burgin shot back in a flier of his own. It was the first of at least four mail pieces that carried the teaser: "Voter Fraud Alert." Property taxes are actually "18 percent higher than when (Sharpe) first took office," said Burgin, who is seeking to unseat Sharpe in the at-large District 7 Republican primary. Awesome, we thought. Two politicians vying for the same seat making wildly opposing claims. This is why PolitiFact Florida exists! We looked at Sharpe first, and ruled that his claim was Barely True. Now we turn to Burgin’s claim, first calling him to ask him how he derived his figures. He sent us the numbers he used – the overall property tax revenue figures for each of the years Sharpe has been in office since 2004. We confirmed the numbers were accurate using Hillsborough County budget documents. In 2004, Hillsborough County collected $553.4 million in property taxes. This year, the number is projected to be $659.8 million. That’s actually a 19.2 percent increase. So Burgin was being cautious, gentle even, right? There’s just one significant problem with his calculation. And there’s another big asterisk. The county prepares its budget books and calculates its revenues and expenditures by fiscal year. And the fiscal year doesn’t mirror the calendar year. Fiscal year 2004 covers the period from Oct. 1, 2003 to Sept. 30, 2004. Sharpe first took office in November 2004. To calculate changes in tax revenue or tax rates involving Sharpe, the proper base year would be fiscal year 2005. It was not until September 2005 that Sharpe cast his first budgetary votes, setting property tax rates for fiscal year 2006. This is indeed significant because, while this may be hard to remember with property values now plummeting, home and business values were soaring during Sharpe’s first years in office. From fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005, property tax revenues jumped from $553.4 million to $610.8 million. With fiscal year 2005 as the base year, that means overall county property tax revenue has increased by nearly 8 percent during Sharpe’s tenure. Burgin claimed a tax increase of well more than double that – a gross exaggeration. That one year could make such a difference is a reflection of how overheated the real estate market was in the middle part of the decade. We can illustrate the phenomenon in reverse now, with property values plummeting. Sharpe has voted on next year’s tentative budget. If the tax rate approved so far holds, county budget officials project another nearly $74 million drop in property tax revenue. By that time, tax receipts will have fallen 4 percent below what they were when Sharpe took office. That’s right: Up by 8 percent this year, down by 4 percent next year. Now for the other asterisk to Burgin’s calculation. Property tax revenues are not a perfect measure of how taxes increased or decreased. That’s because the revenue includes property taxes collected from new construction. Owners of those properties may be paying more in taxes, but it’s a reflection of, say, their home sitting on what a year or two earlier may have been an orange grove. Take new construction out of the mix, particularly during the heady building days of Sharpe’s early tenure, and the alleged tax increase is something less than 8 percent, potentially much lower. Even during the anemic market of the current fiscal year, when property values are dropping across Hillsborough County, a projected $1.2 billion in new construction is expected. Burgin knows, or should know, his way around a budget book. He spent part of 2004 and 2005 as an aide to former County Commissioner Brian Blair, who tasked him with just these sorts of exercises. Fraud is a serious charge to level at anyone, even though some politicians tends to toss the word at opponents rather casually. Burgin has done it at least four times so far this campaign. But before accusing someone of an intentional perversion of the truth, it’s probably good to double- and triple-check the basis of your claim. We have no way of knowing if Burgin’s claim was an intentional distortion or an innocent miscalculation. Either way, we find this statement to be False.

pomt-00860	Says that "Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/16/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-says-susan-rice-conceded-under-nuclear-/	In the space of a few days, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. -- who only won his office four months ago -- became a central player in the drama over a potential nuclear deal with Iran. Cotton spearheaded a letter to Iran’s leaders that was ultimately signed by 47 Republican senators saying that Congress could ultimately overrule any agreement. Democrats said the letter undermined presidential authority to carry out foreign policy. On March 9, 2015, shortly after news of the letter broke, Cotton appeared on Fox News Channel and said this: "We don't know what the final terms of the deal are. But we know so far that Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability. The president has said this bill will have a sunset, perhaps as little as 10 years (from now). Those two terms alone make this deal unacceptable." We see two related but distinct questions here. The first one is easier: Did Rice literally say what Cotton said she did? The second is trickier: Is what Rice said functionally equivalent to what Cotton claimed? Outline of the negotiations First, some background on the Iran nuclear negotiations. In November 2013, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, known as the P5+1, joined with Iran in signing an agreement that temporarily stopped Iran’s production of potentially weapons-grade nuclear material. In 2014, that agreement was extended, with continued sanctions relief, including the ability to sell oil and to gain access to assets frozen in overseas bank accounts, and some additional nuclear steps by Iran. This interim agreement expires in June. Under the interim deal, Iran was cleared to continue enriching uranium, though only to the diluted level of 5 percent and with its stockpile capped. That falls well short of what weapon makers would need to create a bomb. On the other hand, critics of the deal say the first 5 percent enrichment is the toughest, meaning it would be comparatively easy for Iran to reach 90 percent once it got to 5 percent. Still, supporters of the administration’s approach counter that it would take Iran roughly a year to make a bomb, leaving time for the world to detect what’s happening and respond. Rice’s speech to AIPAC Cotton’s office didn’t return two inquiries, but we found a quote by Rice that seems to be the one Cotton is referencing; it attracted attention in both the conservative and mainstream media. Rice made the remarks in a March 2 speech to a convention of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel group that includes many skeptics of President Barack Obama’s approach: "We cannot let a totally unachievable ideal stand in the way of a good deal. I know that some of you will be urging Congress to insist that Iran forego its domestic enrichment capacity entirely. But, as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable. Even our closest international partners in the P5+1 (the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany) do not support denying Iran the ability ever to pursue peaceful nuclear energy. If that is our goal, our partners will abandon us, undermining the sanctions we have imposed so effectively together. Simply put, that is not a viable negotiating position. Nor is it even attainable. The plain fact is, no one can make Iran unlearn the scientific and nuclear expertise it already possesses." This makes it clear that Rice didn’t use the word "robust." Two arms-control experts agreed that Cotton was taking liberties with Rice’s words. "I think Cotton exaggerated what Rice said," said Richard Nephew, the program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. " 'Robust' has a connotation that, to me, means more than just a capability. I use the term ‘robust’ to mean ‘healthy’ or ‘strong.’ What exactly that means probably depends on the eye of the beholder, but to me, ‘robust’ evokes some real weight, which isn't what Rice said." Matthew Bunn, an arms-control specialist at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, agreed that Cotton was "clearly incorrect" in how he quoted Rice. "If this is the quote Cotton was referring to, he’s simply wrong about what she said. She said they won’t have zero, not that they will have a ‘robust’ capability," Bunn said. The White House told PolitiFact that Cotton embellished Rice’s words. "Our goal is to effectively shut down the four pathways to fissile material for a nuclear weapon: uranium enrichment at Natanz; uranium enrichment at Fordow; the plutonium pathway; and the possibility of a covert pathway," said National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan. "We seek to do this by extending Iran’s breakout time to at least one year – which is significantly longer than what experts have publicly estimated is Iran’s current breakout time of approximately two to three months." Was Cotton’s implication reasonable? Rice argued in her speech that it’s unrealistic to expect diplomacy to reduce Iran’s enrichment capability to zero. But do nuclear experts believe that any amount of enrichment capability greater than zero is inherently "robust"? Or is there a sweet spot between "zero" and "robust" in which Iran’s potential nuclear-bomb ambitions would be weakened to the point of inefficacy? The experts we checked with said there probably is such a sweet spot, but they cautioned that it’s hard to know for sure. Nephew and Bunn said the enrichment capabilities currently envisioned would, combined with the restrictions and monitoring established under the agreement, leave Iran with about a year’s work to make material for a bomb at its inspected facilities. That, Bunn argued, would give the world time to notice what’s going on and respond, and "would effectively take that option off the table for Iran." A greater risk, Bunn said, is that if Iran decides to go full-steam ahead on building a bomb, "it is far more likely to build a secret site for that purpose, rather than trying to do it with the world knowing what they are doing at facilities that could readily be bombed." To be sure, that’s a worrisome scenario -- but it’s also one that doesn’t depend on how much enrichment capability is allowed under the deal currently being negotiated. Ultimately, there are too many unknowns to say with any certainty how "robust" Iran’s enrichment capability would be -- starting with the fact that the negotiations are still ongoing, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security. "The meaning of ‘robust’ is in the eye of the beholder," Albright said. "But knowing for sure who is right depends on knowing how much nuclear infrastructure will remain and what are the limits on its operation. We cannot know that for sure until we see a deal." Our ruling Cotton said, "Susan Rice, the president's national security adviser, has already conceded that Iran will have a robust uranium enrichment capability." Cotton essentially puts words in Rice’s mouth when he says she "conceded" that Iran will keep a "robust" enrichment capability. She didn’t use those words in the AIPAC speech. Meanwhile, what she did say -- that zero enrichment capability, "as desirable as that would be, it is neither realistic nor achievable" -- may or may not lead to Cotton’s conclusion that Iran will be left with a "robust" capability. Experts expect that there is a point between "zero" and "robust" where Iran’s nuclear ambitions are hampered, but there are too many variables and too much uncertainty to say so with certainty. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

pomt-10631	"I supported (the surge), I argued for it. I'm the only one on this stage that did."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/11/john-mccain/mccain-led-the-charge-but-he-wasnt-alone/	No candidate in the presidential race is more closely linked to President Bush's policy in Iraq than Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain. McCain's campaign nearly imploded last year — during some of the war's darker days — because of McCain's outspoken support for the president's troop surge policy, which was announced a year ago this month. But McCain was stretching the truth in a Jan. 10, 2008, Republican debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., when he said, in reference to the surge: "I supported that, I argued for it. I'm the only one on this stage that did." While McCain can make a case that he offered the strongest arguments in favor of the surge — and is now reaping the political benefits as violence has declined in Iraq — four of the other five candidates in the Fox News debate made arguments in favor of it. The one exception is Texas GOP Rep. Ron Paul, who supports an immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq. Three of the four remaining Republican candidates on the stage — Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Huckabee — supported the surge when it was announced and advanced arguments in its favor, although Huckabee expressed reservations early on. Now, he's an ardent surge backer. The final candidate, former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson, also spoke in favor of the surge when he joined the presidential race last summer. Romney in a statement released on the day Bush announced his surge policy said he agreed with the president that "securing Iraqi civilians requires additional troops." Later, in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in March 2007, he reiterated his support. Giuliani, likewise, put out an immediate statement endorsing the surge after Bush announced it. "I support the president's increase in troops. Even more importantly, I support the change in strategy — the focus on security and the emphasis on a political and economic solution as being even more important than a military solution." He, too, later made a speech in support of the surge. Thompson has been less clear in endorsing the surge. In an interview with the Hoover Institution's Peter Robinson in June, for example, he said the strategy in Iraq required evaluation on a "day-to-day basis." But he's always been forthright that he believes U.S. forces must remain in Iraq until the war is won and has repeatedly expressed confidence in Gen. David Petraeus, the surge's architect. Huckabee, who like McCain has accused fellow candidates of insufficient support for the troop surge, initially had qualms. Shortly after the surge was announced, for example, Huckabee told MSNBC's Norah O'Donnell that he wasn't sure he could support the troop increases in Iraq if it meant calling up more National Guard and Reserve forces. He now says he firmly supports Bush's military tactics in Iraq, and recently wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine that he would "not withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq any faster than General David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander there, recommends." There's no doubt that McCain is the surge's most powerful advocate among the candidates, and has been from the start. But to say that none of his fellow GOP candidates supported it, or argued in favor of it, is False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-01-11T00:00:00	2008-01-10	['None']

"Unbelievable: Navy destroyer strikes a building in downtown Houston," reads the headline on a Sept. 1, 2017, post on AmericanNews.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. "The city of Houston has already seen enough tragedy due to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, and unfortunately things took a turn for the worst today when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a building in the downtown area," the post read. The story, which was posted after Hurricane Harvey struck coastal Texas with record amounts of rain, noted it was unclear why the destroyer was 20 miles inland or how it struck an unidentified skyscraper (although it looks like the Heritage Plaza building). That’s because the entire incident is fake. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The story originated Aug. 29 on DuffelBlog.com, a site that posts satirical articles skewed to a military audience. For example, the site had a story that said the U.S. Army plans to move the entire South Korean capital of Seoul 300 miles south to ease tensions with the North. Another said the Navy plans to save money by giving up trying to rescue sailors who fall overboard. DuffelBlog.com’s disclaimer telegraphs its intent to resemble the satirical news website The Onion, and indicates its content is fake. "We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet. Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization," the disclaimer reads. The photo in the post about Hurricane Harvey and the Navy destroyer does show the Houston skyline, but the image is a composite of a snapshot from a blog showing flooding in 2015 and a real destroyer, the USS Mustin. You can see the name written backward on the hull of the ship. In case you were wondering, the Mustin was not anywhere near Houston or the Gulf of Mexico. According to the ship’s Facebook page, the destroyer is part of the Seventh Fleet and is stationed in Japan.

pomt-10732	"As governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes and fees almost 100 times, saving the taxpayers almost $380-million. I left a surplus of nearly $850-million."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/14/mike-huckabee/a-nickel-and-dime-defense-/	Ever since setting up his committee to explore a run for the presidency, Mike Huckabee has been drawing fire from the fiscally conservative and very vocal Club for Growth. The nonprofit organization and its political action committee often target political candidates who don't live up to the group's standards of low taxes and low spending. In the presidential race, the club is giving special attention to Huckabee, going so far as to set up a Web site (www.taxhikemike.org) to post attacks on the former Arkansas governor's fiscal record. In the summer of 2007, the club ran a TV ad in Iowa comparing Huckabee to his Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton and calling him a "tax-and-spend liberal." Huckabee fired back with a press release: "As governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes and fees almost 100 times, saving the taxpayers almost $380-million. I left a surplus of nearly $850-million, which I urged should go back to the people. ... I pushed through the Arkansas Legislature the first major, broad-based tax cuts in state history – a $90-million tax relief package for Arkansas families." But Huckabee's response has glossed over some facts. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette , a Little Rock newspaper, examined the boast. The paper obtained a list of the near-100 tax cuts passed during the governor's tenure and found they included such small-change items as a sales-tax break for manufacturing machinery amounting to $500 a year and a tax exemption for county fairs that cost the state $15,000 a year. Whitney McLaughlin of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration confirmed the Democrat-Gazette's budget numbers for PolitiFact. During Huckabee's tenure, taxes or fees were cut 90 times, which did reduce tax revenue by about $380-million. The paper concluded that Huckabee doesn't deserve credit for all of those cuts, noting that all but one required a vote from the legislature, and most were the product of larger negotiations between the branches of government. The one tax cut Huckabee undoubtedly had his hands on was a $90.6-million income tax reduction enacted in his second year as governor. His administration did, as he says, leave the state with an $844.5-million budget surplus (as of March 2007) that the current government is now figuring out how to dispose of. And Huckabee did advocate for sending surplus rebates to taxpayers in 2006, when the year's surplus was expected to be $332-million. All of those Huckabee figures are correct. But, where did the money in that surplus come from? Mike Stormes, the state budget administrator, said the surplus was the result of "a conservative budget combined with a booming economy." The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration estimated that tax revenues grew by $505-million between 1997 and 2005. As governor, Huckabee supported a number of tax increases, including hikes in the state sales tax, a cigarette and tobacco tax and a nursing home bed tax, to name just a few. The per capita tax burden in state and local taxes rose in Arkansas by 47 percent between 1997 and 2005. Huckabee correctly toots his own horn about a major tax cut in his second year as governor and he did leave a big surplus when he left office. But we give him a Half True for mischaracterizing his fiscal policies in between.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2007-11-14T00:00:00	2007-08-02	['Arkansas']

pomt-07083	Says Rick Perry of Texas was "the governor who relied most on stimulus funds to close his state’s budget deficit in 2010."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/25/martin-omalley/democratic-governors-association-says-texas-gov-ri/	The day after Texas Gov. Rick Perry filled in for Donald Trump at a gathering of New York Republicans, Democratic Governors Association Chairman Martin O’Malley of Maryland poked at Perry’s anti-Washington message. Suggesting that President Barack Obama is tackling the nation’s economic problems with "responsible budget cuts" and "smart investments," O’Malley added: "As the governor who relied most on stimulus funds to close his state’s budget deficit in 2010, Rick Perry surely understands the value of the president’s investments." Perry was No. 1 in using federal stimulus aid to make the budget balance? It’s no secret that Texas, like other states, leaned heavily on stimulus aid in 2009, when lawmakers wrote the 2010-11 budget. Earlier this year, we rated Mostly True Obama’s statement that Perry "helped balance his budget with about $6 billion worth of federal help." State budget-writers in 2009 used $6.4 billion in stimulus aid, accepted by Perry, to help pay for programs over the next two years that historically had been financed with state revenue. O’Malley’s assertion, in contrast, focuses on how stimulus dollars were allocated in the first year of the state’s biennial budget cycle. To back up the statement, a Democratic Governors Association spokeswoman pointed us to a news article on CNN.com titled "Texas’s love/hate relationship with Washington’s money." The article says that Perry "likes to trumpet that his state balanced its budget in 2009 while keeping billions in its rainy day fund" but adds that Texas couldn’t have pulled that off without Washington’s help. "Turns out Texas was the state that depended the most on those very stimulus funds to plug nearly 97 percent of its shortfall for fiscal 2010," the article states, citing the National Conference of State Legislatures. The conference, which says online that it does research and advocacy for lawmakers in every state, included the 97 percent statistic in a July 2009 report on state budgets. The information was collected through a NCSL survey that, among other questions, asked states about "the major actions they took to close (fiscal year) 2010 budget gaps" and the relative share of the gap that each addressed. Stimulus aid proved a popular solution; without it, "state fiscal problems would have been even more severe," the report said. Among the 25 states that reported using stimulus money "as part of their solution," the report says the states depending most heavily on these funds were Texas (where the aid "represented 96.7 percent of the total solution") and Nebraska ("88 percent of the total solution"). We noticed a wrinkle. The NCSL analysis draws on information from just 35 states. Asked which states they are, Arturo Perez, director of the conference’s fiscal affairs program, told us by email that he couldn’t say. "We do not have the ability to identify which states were part of the original data set" because the database has been updated since the report was produced, he said. The report gives information for all 50 states in only one category: budget gap figures for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. For 2010, the report says, the Texas "budget gap" was $3.3 billion, or half "of an overall shortfall of $6.6 billion" for the 2010-11 biennium. Todd Haggerty, a policy analyst for the Denver- and Washington-based group, told us that the Texas information in the report was provided by the state’s Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. John Barton, a spokesman for the board, explained that the $6.6 billion biennial budget gap was calculated by subtracting available state revenue from what lawmakers actually spent. The stimulus money covered 96.7 percent of the difference, he said. Remember, that $6.6 billion is a two-year figure. For the 2010 budget gap, the Legislative Budget Board split the number in half and reported that the same percentage was filled by stimulus funds that year: 96.7 percent. The Legislature didn’t make any significant cuts or raise taxes in order to balance the 2010-11 budget, Barton said. We sought other studies that could help us assess the accuracy of O’Malley’s claim but came up short. Next, we tried to find out why Texas’ reliance on stimulus funds to balance its 2010 budget was higher than that of the other states in the NCSL report. We got this response from Mike Leachman, assistant director of the state fiscal project at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington: "It’s true that Gov. Perry relied on stimulus funding (to balance his budget). He accepted the vast majority of the stimulus money, just like any other governor, and that allowed Texas to avoid most or all of the cuts that otherwise might have needed to happen in the current budget cycle. But what’s not true is that he depended on it more than other governors. Every governor accepted virtually all of the stimulus money." Because the stimulus funds that helped states balance their budgets were keyed to such factors as population, Medicaid spending and unemployment rates — and not the size of a state’s budget gap — big states such as Texas generally had more at their disposal. (Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier made the same point in an email conversation with us.) How much a state relied on stimulus dollars to close its budget gap depended on the size of its shortfall, Leachman said. His point: The smaller the gap, the larger the amount that could be closed with stimulus dollars. Texas had a relatively small shortfall in 2010 — 10.7 percent of the state’s general revenue budget, according to the center’s data — compared with other states. (Only six states had smaller budget shortfalls by percentage of the state’s general fund budget, according to the center's data.) By contrast, in states with relatively large shortfalls — for example, New Jersey, whose 2010 budget gap constituted about 40 percent of its general fund budget, according to the center’s data — stimulus funds alone were not enough to balance the budget. In February 2009, then-Gov. Jon Corzine said stimulus dollars would cover only about half the 2010 gap, according to a Salon.com article. And in California, where the budget gap was more than 50 percent of the general fund budget, stimulus funds accounted for less than 15 percent of the total budget "solutions," according to an October 2009 report by the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. On average, states closed about a third of their 2010 shortfalls with stimulus funds, Leachman said. The remaining holes were closed by cutting spending, raising taxes and fees, tapping reserve funds and using one-time funding sources. We circled back to the Democratic Governors Association, explaining our findings. Spokeswoman Lis Smith stood by O’Malley’s statement. So, what about our rating? Based on available information, O’Malley’s claim is accurate, though the survey backing up his claim did not include results from 30 percent of the states. It’s possible that some of them relied on stimulus dollars to close their 2010 budget gaps to the same degree that Texas did — or greater. O’Malley’s statement also ignores the mathematical reality that Texas received a greater-than-most share of stimulus dollars to plug a budget shortfall that was smaller than most. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Martin O'Malley	None	None	None	2011-06-25T06:00:00	2011-06-15	['Texas']

pomt-04914	"Under the Obama administration’s bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/02/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-ad-targets-obama-auto-bailouts-dealers/	Some things are so implicit there’s no need to elaborate. Darkness follows sunset. Children like ice cream. The 2009 auto bailout was better for some people than for others. What is missing from that last statement is blame, but the campaign of Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has made that implicit as well as explicit thanks to speeches, op-eds and interviews. It was President Barack Obama’s fault, says Romney, that the government brokered a bailout and bankruptcy plan for General Motors and Chrysler that had the government picking winners and losers. The government should have stayed out, Romney says. Which brings us to an Ohio-specific television commercial the Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee put on the air Wednesday. The short ad features Al Zarzour, a 61-year-old man from Lyndhurst who has spent decades in the auto industry. The ad doesn’t get this specific, but we know from coverage by The Plain Dealer and a telephone interview with Zarzour (who now is general manager of a Mitsubishi dealership) that he owned a Nissan dealership in Willoughby, sold it in 2006 and bought a Chevrolet dealership in Chardon. Both communities are in Greater Cleveland. What Zarzour says in the ad is, "Grew up here in Lyndhurst (another suburban community), started 1972, selling cars." Then an announcer says: "In 2009, under the Obama administration’s bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close." PolitiFact Ohio took a look a that claim. Zarzour explains in the commercial that General Motors suspended his credit line, and how "we had 30-some employees that were out of work. My wife and I were the last ones there. It was like the dream that we worked for, and that we worked so hard for, was gone." The ad’s message? It’s not exactly stated. But it is implicit: People like Zarzour, his family and his employees were harmed by the Obama auto bailout. The bailout set the terms through which GM and Chrysler were to restructure. According to a White House fact sheet issued at the time, "There are some dealers that GM has identified that will not continue with GM. It is expected that the terminated dealers will be offered an agreement to orderly wind down their operations over the next 18 months." Kristen Dziczek, of the nonpartisan Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, says she recalls that there was a general agreement to cut the dealer base as part of White House-automaker discussions, but she doesn’t recall seeing official documents directing the extent of the cuts. But Alan Spitzer, a prominent Cleveland car dealer who helped lead the movement to save dealerships across the country, told us that GM and Chrysler had discussed closures in an earlier proposal to the Obama administration "and the White House pushed them to be more aggressive." The White House told PolitiFact Ohio that the specific decisions on those cuts came from the auto makers themselves and that it merely noted that the U.S. auto makers had substantially more dealers (on a per capita or sale basis) than their foreign competitors. Yet a special audit in mid-2010 by a federal inspector general for the bailout program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, noted exactly what Spitzer said: The auto companies already planned to cut dealerships, but the White House’s auto team believed the pace would be insufficient and told GM to accelerate dealer closings. Many authorities say the auto bailout, however painful, was necessary. Obama’s auto team believed that when it came to dealers specifically, under-performers created a drag on GM’s brand and hurt the prospects of stronger dealers, who could boost the company’s incremental sales. It’s important to know that when GM first presented its plan to the White House , it proposed getting rid of 1,650 dealerships by 2014, itself a continuation of dealer "right-sizing" that had been occurring since 1970. About 30 percent of the cuts would come from phasing out the Saturn, Saab and Hummer brands. But with the White House’s prompting, GM stepped up the closure dates to the end of 2010 -- while dropping the number of planned dealership terminations to 1,454. It cut the number but stepped up the pace, a fact that has been overlooked by many critics. Obama’s action "saved nearly a million jobs," White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday. Others have used a slightly higher figure. Obama campaign spokesman Frank Benenati said in an email that there are now 2,200 more people employed in Ohio auto dealerships than when Obama entered office. The Center for Automotive Research said in a 2010 report that the government-backed bankruptcy appeared to save 1.14 million jobs. But according to the special inspector general’s report, also in 2010, the Center for Automotive Research was critical of the closing of rural dealerships. It believed a customer would not drive 80 miles to another dealership to buy a Cadillac; the customer would find a closer store and buy a different car. Whether the non-government bankruptcy solution proposed by Romney, and supported by many other Republicans, would have worked cannot be known, because the Obama auto rescue went forward. Yet in a literal sense, the Romney ad’s statement is true. The Obama administration agreed to to provide loans to General Motors if GM, on the brink of failure, would restructure through bankruptcy. Part of the plan was for General Motors and Chrysler to downsize, at least temporarily, reduce their liabilities and change their way of doing business. Bankruptcy allowed GM to bypass state courts that could have made it harder to shed franchise agreements. The White House auto team pressed GM to act more quickly than it planned earlier, raising a possibility offered by the inspector general’s office: the number and speed of the terminations might not have been critical to GM’s viability. Yet even before the White House pressed it, GM was planning to cut dealership franchises. The Greater Cleveland Automobile Dealers’ Association told us that in the 19-county area of Northeast Ohio alone, 18 GM dealers and 12 Chrysler dealers closed. Even dealerships that were profitable had to close so GM could reconfigure its sales markets. Zarzour did not fight his dealership’s closing. "With the bankruptcy that went down, it didn’t seem like a good decision to stay there and fight it," he said when we contacted him. His equipment was sold at auction and he accepted a settlement with GM, the specifics of which he did not wish to discuss. "It wasn’t drastic," he said. The worst thing, he said, was having to put people out of work, watch the community lose a business that supported its schools and sports teams, and see his hopes of passing the business to his sons disappear. We asked Lou Vitantonio, president of the Greater Cleveland Automobile Dealers’ Association, if the closings were necessary. "Looking back, I don’t know if there’s a right or wrong decision," he said. "But this is where were at at this point: We lost 30 dealerships in our region." Yet if GM and Chrysler had closed even more factories because of financial failure, another 50 dealerships might be out of business today, he said. We also asked Zarzour. "That’s difficult for me to answer," he said. But he added, "I don’t think it was done properly." So, back to the ad’s specific claim: "In 2009, under the Obama administration’s bailout of General Motors, Ohio dealerships were forced to close." "There’s no doubt" that is an accurate statement, said Dino DiSanto, chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette, a Republican from Greater Cleveland who authored successful legislation allowing dealers to challenge their closings through arbitration. The full extent of those appeals are not yet known. PolitiFact evaluates political claims on words that are stated, but it also considers the context in which the words are uttered. Otherwise, you would have ads like, well, like this one, all of them entirely true. It is true that auto dealerships in Ohio closed as part of the bailout of General Motors. But the clear implication of the statement is that those closures were solely a result of the bailouts and might not have otherwise occurred. The statement on its surface is accurate, but that implication is not. While it is impossible to say which dealerships might have closed and which might have survived, General Motors was already working on a closure plan. In fact, even before the White House auto team asked it to be more aggressive, it submitted plans to shutter 1,650 dealers by the end of 2014. As for the government’s involvement, including loans, GM said it did not have a lot of other options so it stepped up the pace. In U.S. bankruptcy court filings, GM said it tried to find private investors but failed because lenders were not willing to take a risk on a damaged automaker amid a financial meltdown. Without funding, the company might have been forced to liquidate, selling off all its factories and equipment. That’s information that puts the claim into context. When a statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important information needed to put the claim in context, it gets one rating on the Truth-O-Meter: Half True.

pomt-08766	Kendrick Meek claims he's the only candidate who said Sonia Sotomayor "will make an excellent Supreme Court justice."	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/25/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-only-big-3-us-senate-race-support-so/	Now that U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek has dispatched billionaire U.S. Senate Democratic rival Jeff Greene, Meek is quickly pivoting to a general election campaign where he will face Republican Marco Rubio and a former Republican, Gov. Charlie Crist. That means Meek will do everything he can between now and Nov. 2, 2010, to distinguish himself from his two opponents. At his Aug. 24, 2010, primary victory speech at the Westin Diplomat in Hollywood, Meek labeled his two major fall opponents conservative. He repeated a claim that PolitiFact Florida ruled Mostly True, that he is the only candidate who has consistently opposed additional offshore oil drilling. And he also talked about the 2009 Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor. "I will be the only candidate, ladies and gentlemen, that stood in there with Justice Sotomayor," said Meek, surrounded by his family and supporters. "When she was up for her nomination, I stood up and said she was the right selection and she will make an excellent Supreme Court justice." This fact check is pretty straightforward: Does the record support Meek's claim? President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court on May 26, 2009. She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Aug. 6, 2009. Here's what the three major candidates said about Sotomayor that summer. Kendrick Meek -- Meek joined Puerto Rican leaders in Miami on June 1 to support Sotomayor's nomination to the country's highest court. On June 2, he attended a similar event in Orlando. "She is an outstanding candidate for the Supreme Court," Meek said in Orlando. There is no record of him wavering from that position. Marco Rubio -- Rubio, meanwhile, is on record opposing the Sotomayor nomination. He wrote an Aug. 5 column published by Politico titled "Opposing the philosophy of Sonia Sotomayor isn't anti-Hispanic." Rubio wrote: "During the recent Judiciary Committee hearings, it became clear that I could not in good conscience support Sotomayor's confirmation and would vote against it if I were in the Senate today ... As a whole, Sotomayor's record reflects a view that judges can and should inject personal experiences and biases into what should be the objective interpretation and application of the law." Charlie Crist -- On July 21, Crist also came out against Sotomayor's confirmation. At that point, Crist was still a Republican. "While I have not had the opportunity to meet personally with Judge Sotomayor -- a crucial step in the selection process -- I have reviewed and reflected upon her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and come to the conclusion that I cannot support her appointment to the United States Supreme Court," Crist said. "Judge Sotomayor is worthy of respect for her many accomplishments and her remarkable story of success. However, I have strong concerns that Judge Sotomayor would not strictly and objectively construe the constitution and lacks respect for the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. For these reasons, I cannot support her appointment to the highest court in the land." In a May 2010 interview with the Miami Herald, no-party candidate Crist continued to say that he would have opposed Sotomayor over questions about the Second Amendment, though he could not recall specifically what those questions were. The fall ballot will include more names than just Meek, Rubio and Crist. But we couldn't find statements on Sotomayor from any of the minor or no-party candidates. None of those candidates has received more than 5 percent in any recent statewide poll. In his primary victory speech, Meek said that he is the only candidate who publicly supported Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Compared to Crist and Rubio, the two other major candidates, Meek is right. We rate his statement True.	None	Kendrick Meek	None	None	None	2010-08-25T16:20:55	2010-08-24	['Sonia_Sotomayor']

pomt-00849	"A few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/20/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-barack-obama-took-iran-hamas-us-te/	The confluence of elections in Israel and the possible culmination of international talks on Iran’s nuclear capabilities has vaulted United States policy on Iran to the top of the national agenda. A reader emailed us to note that on March 19, 2015, Glenn Beck -- a multiplatform commentator on the right -- took to Facebook to criticize President Barack Obama’s handling of policy with Iran. Here’s the beginning of the lengthy Facebook post: "This is just Evil," Beck wrote, "A few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list. He is negotiating with Iran WHILE their supreme leader said that they ‘will fly the Islamic flag of jihad over the White House.’ … Christians are being liquidated, beheaded and crucified, their children being sold into slavery, his big bombing plan to stop Isis is SEVEN bombing runs a day. 7!!! How many did we run in Bosnia: 165?!!!" Beck makes a number of claims in this short snippet, but the one that jumped out at us was that "a few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list." By diplomatic standards, that would be a pretty big deal, especially if it was a unilateral move before a major nuclear deal was even completed. And we certainly hadn’t seen any media coverage about this happening. Did Obama really take Hamas and Iran off the terror list? The short answer is no. Here’s the long answer. The State Department lists The most signifcant "terror lists" are the ones maintained by the State Department. One is for "state sponsors of terrorism." This includes countries "determined by the secretary of state to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism," and inclusion on the list establishes restrictions on foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, and a variety of financial and other restrictions. Currently, four nations are on the list: Cuba, Sudan, Syria … and Iran, which has been on the list since Jan. 19, 1984, when Ronald Reagan was president. Nothing with this status has changed in the last few weeks. The second State Department list includes "foreign terrorist organizations." Under United States law, it is unlawful to knowingly provide "material support or resources" to a group on the list. Other restrictions on financing and immigration come into play as well. Hamas -- a militant Islamic movement based in the Palestinian territories -- is on this list, and has been since Oct. 8, 1997, when Bill Clinton was president. Like Iran, it has not been taken off the relevant terror list. So what is Beck talking about? The Clapper report We failed to reach Beck through a representative of his radio network, but judging by previous posts in the conservative blogosphere, we believe he was referring to the 2015 report by the director of national intelligence, James Clapper. Clapper presented the annual report -- "Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community" -- to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Feb. 26. The report is divided into two parts "global threats" and "regional threats." The global section include such topics as cyber threats, counterintelligence, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, space, organized crime, global economics and natural resources. The regional section covers most parts of the world, including the Middle East and north Africa. Most of the recent discussion of the Clapper report on the Internet stemmed from a Hebrew-language analysis by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israeli think tank considered close to the country’s military and intelligence sectors. The center’s analysis received coverage in the Israeli media and then quickly spread to the United States. The center’s analysis noted that the "terrorism" section in the 2014 report mentioned both Iran and Hezbollah, but the 2015 section did not. Before we go any further, we’ll note that Beck wrote "Hamas" in his Facebook post when he presumably meant "Hezbollah," a predominantly Lebanese Shiite Muslim party and militant group that is backed by Iran and that has been on the State Department terrorism list since 1997. While Hamas was not mentioned in either of the past two Clapper reports, Hezbollah was mentioned in the terrorism section of the 2014 report but not in the terrorism section in the 2015 report. The conservative blog posts that preceded Beck's post correctly cited "Hezbollah," so we’ll chalk this up to carelessness. Now let’s take a closer look at what changed between the two reports. The strongest evidence for Beck is the disappearance of the following language, which had been included in the terrorism section of the 2014 report: "Iran and Hizbullah are committed to defending the Asad regime and have provided support toward this end, including sending billions of dollars in military and economic aid, training pro-regime and Iraqi Shia militants, and deploying their own personnel into the country. Iran and Hizbullah view the Asad regime as a key partner in the ‘axis of resistance’ against Israel and are prepared to take major risks to preserve the regime as well as their critical trans-shipment routes. Outside the Syrian theater, Iran and Lebanese Hizbullah continue to directly threaten the interests of U.S. allies. Hizbullah has increased its global terrorist activity in recent years to a level that we have not seen since the 1990s." The 2015 report only mentions Hezbollah once, and it’s in passing. Still, we should note that the 2015 report hardly lets Iran off the hook. The report accuses Iran of: • "Preserving (the) nuclear weapons option," • Remaining "an ongoing threat to US national interests because of its support to the Asad regime in Syria, promulgation of anti-Israeli policies, development of advanced military capabilities, and pursuit of its nuclear program," • "Pursuing policies with negative secondary consequences for regional stability and potentially for Iran," • And pursuing actions to protect and empower Shia communities that "are fueling growing fears and sectarian responses." Administration officials cautioned against over-reading the choices made in Clapper’s written report. "There is no change in the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment of the threat posed by Iran or Hezbollah," said Brian P. Hale, the director of public affairs in the office of the director of national intelligence. The report, Hale said, "was written to be an overview of top threats. … There were a lot of topics to consider this year -- ISIL, cyber, Ukraine-Russia, etc. Iran was included, too." Hale added that Clapper fleshed out the national-security concerns about Iran and Hezbollah during testimony at the Senate hearing. Responding to a question from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Clapper cited several entities linked to Iran, including Hezbollah, as methods for Iran to use as "a physical manifestation of their spreading their influence in the region." And Nick Rasmussen -- director of the National Counterterrorism Center, the principal adviser to Clapper’s office on intelligence operations and counterterrorism analysis -- testified on Feb. 12 that "beyond their role in Syria and Iraq, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah remain committed to conducting terrorist activities worldwide, and we are concerned their activities could either endanger or target U.S. and other Western interests." Reading between the lines We see two questions here. First, is it valid for him to call the Clapper report "the terror list"? And second, are the changes in the 2015 report -- the basis for his otherwise inaccurately worded claim -- noteworthy? On the first question, experts agreed that the phrase "terror list" is typically reserved for the one with the legal bite -- the State Department’s. Beck has "no justification for calling it 'the terror list,' " said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. On the second question, Beck may have a point, said Rick Brennan, a senior political scientist with RAND Corp. "The entire tenor of the 2015 report on terrorism focuses on Sunni terrorist organizations, and there is no mention of Shia terrorist organizations," Brennan said. "The reality is that that Islamist terrorism has both a Sunni and Shia variant. Focusing on one part of the problem and excluding the other is not analytically accurate." Brennan added that he doesn’t see any sign that Iran has "changed its behavior in exporting violence throughout the region" between 2014 and 2015, which raises the question of why the report "significantly softened the tone and tenor of the assessment" of Iran and Hezbollah. However, Beck buried this more justifiable point under several errors and hyperbole. Our ruling Beck said, "A few weeks ago Obama took Hamas and Iran OFF the terror list." Beck made a few clear mistakes here. First, it appears he mistook Hamas for Hezbollah. Second, Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah remain on the official, and legally binding, State Department terror lists, as they have for decades. Obama did nothing to change that "a few weeks ago." Beck's claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2015-03-20T09:39:08	2015-03-19	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11845	"There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/alyssa-milano/alyssa-milano-no-background-checks-texas-long-gun-/	Actress Alyssa Milano drew attention to gun background checks after a shooting at a Texas church left at least 26 people dead. "There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas. Thanks for the info @shannonrwatts," Milano tweeted on Nov. 5, crediting for the information Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, an organization seeking stronger gun laws. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com By mid-day Nov. 6, Milano’s message had been retweeted more than 3,200 times and "liked" by more than 7,800 Twitter users. Given the controversial national discourse on gun control, we wanted to know if Milano was right about background checks and long guns in Texas. We found her tweet to be partly accurate: licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must conduct a background check for the transfer of all firearms, but private sellers are not required to run such background checks. We reached out to Milano for comment but did not hear back. Texas shooting and gun background checks Law enforcement officials identified 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley as the gunman who killed 26 people and injured 20 others at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Nov. 5. Freeman Martin, a regional director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said at a Nov. 6 press conference that the shooting was not over religious beliefs. The suspect’s mother-in-law attended the church (though not present during the shooting) and had received threatening texts from Kelley. "There was a domestic situation going on with this family," Martin said. Kelley dropped a "Ruger AR assault-type rifle" and fled the church, according to Martin. Kelley was found dead in his vehicle after a car chase and crash. Details on the cause of his death are developing. Milano tweeted that in Texas there are no background checks on long guns, such as AR-15-style rifles. (AR-15-style rifles look like military rifles "but function like other semi-automatic civilian sporting firearms, firing only one round with each pull of the trigger," according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.) Texas does not have a state law requiring any seller to run a background check on purchasers of any gun, said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But there is federal law requiring background checks in some cases, she said. "Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers to run background checks before selling firearms of any kind to an unlicensed buyer," Freilich said. However, unlicensed, private sellers are not required by federal law to run background checks on individuals purchasing firearms. Many Twitter users pointed out this distinction to Milano. Appearing to have noticed the challenges to her claim, Milano tweeted less than two hours later: "Background checks aren’t REQUIRED in Texas on long guns. If you buy from Walmart, they’ll do one. If you buy privately they don’t have to." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Watts, whom Milano credited for her information, also later specified in tweets that no background checks were required for private sales of long guns. Some states do have restrictions on the private sale of firearms. For instance, in California such sales must be done through a licensed dealer. A study published in January 2017 asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. Twenty-two percent said they obtained their gun without a background check. Our ruling Milano tweeted, "There are no background checks on long guns (AR15s) in Texas." Federal law does require background checks when a firearm is sold or transferred by licensed gun dealers, importers, and manufacturers. That includes long guns. But private, unlicensed sellers are not required to conduct background checks under federal or Texas law, even though other states have added requirements to that effect. Milano noted these distinctions in a follow-up tweet, but her original tweet lacked important context. We rate Milano’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-02793	"Residents could have received nearly $48M for Local Schools, Fire District, Sheriff’s Dept. and Social Services."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/04/freedom-and-responsibility-pac/could-clackamas-county-residents-have-received-nea/	Local governments have long relied on urban renewal districts to redevelop blighted areas. The districts temporarily freeze the amount of property taxes collected for public services such as police, fire protection and schools, then redirect the money to improvement projects inside the district. The tax base is unfrozen when the district ends, allowing public service providers to begin collecting taxes on the new, higher property values. Urban renewal has become a hot-button issue. Critics, including some in Clackamas County, say it gives government unchecked power to spend money without sufficient oversight and that it amounts to a giveaway to developers. Clackamas County Commissioner Paul Savas, who is running for re-election, was targeted in a recent flier from the Tigard-based Freedom and Responsibility PAC. The flier, among other things, said Savas helped table a motion under which "Residents could have received nearly $48M for Local Schools, Fire District, Sheriff’s Dept. and Social Services." The flier noted that the money would have come from the Clackamas Town Center Urban Renewal District, which formed in 1980 and ended in June with money left over. With local service providers seemingly straining for every cent these days, we decided to check whether Savas actually voted to deny them $48 million in unspent urban renewal money. According to the flier, here’s where most of that money would have gone if not for Savas’ vote: $20 million to the North Clackamas School District; $8 million to Clackamas Fire District #1; $8 million to the Sheriff’s Office; and $8 million to Clackamas County’s general fund. The remaining $4 million, according to county documents, would go to the other 13 overlapping taxing entities that operated within the urban renewal district. We called Savas, who was part of a 3-2 majority that voted to table a motion to return the $48 million in unspent urban renewal district money. It made sense, he said, to use the unspent money on needed but not yet approved projects in the district. Shortly after tabling the motion, the board, by the same 3-2 split, authorized two road projects inside the district totaling $9.2 million. A discussion is set for early next year on what to do with the remaining $38.8 million. Savas took issue with two of the flier’s key points: that the money could have been returned to "residents" and that $48 million was eligible for return. He cited an email from Clackamas County Assessor Bob Vroman noting that Oregon law prohibits returning unspent urban renewal money directly to citizens. Instead, it has to go back to the individual service providers. State officials confirmed that prohibition. So residents would not have gotten a kicker-style check. On the other hand, taxpayers are residents, and they would have seen a benefit had agencies they support received millions of dollars. On the other point, Savas said his vote actually saved Clackamas County residents nearly $20 million. Why? Because the $20 million claimed on the flier as destined for the North Clackamas School District actually would have gone to the State School Fund. Savas forwarded an email from Michael Wiltfong, the Oregon Department of Education’s school finance director, who estimated that the North Clackamas District would have gotten only $600,000 of that $20 million. Information compiled by the county put the figure closer to $330,000. As for the flier’s other claims: $8 million for "Fire": Information compiled by Dan Johnson, the county Development Agency’s manager, sets the figure at $6.95 million. $8 million for "Sheriff": Johnson’s number is $4 million, but there’s a big caveat. The money would go only to the Clackamas County Enhanced Law Enforcement District, which provides services only for unincorporated Clackamas County and the cities of Happy Valley and Johnson City. $8 million for "Clackamas County": This refers to the county’s general fund. Johnson’s number is $7.8 million -- the same if rounded up. We called Richard Burke, treasurer for the Freedom and Responsibility PAC, for a response. "I recognize that only a portion of this money would go to local schools," said Burke, a self-professed Libertarian who lives in Beaverton. "But I stand behind my point that there’s a pot of money that could have gone back to taxing districts if not for Paul’s vote." In a followup email, Burke defended his $8 million figure for the sheriff, citing Sheriff Craig Roberts’ comments during budget hearings this year that his office was likely to get a good chunk of the $7.8 million headed to the general fund -- if commissioners had voted to return the money. But even if the money had gone to the fund, a sheriff’s office spokesman said, it would have been a "commissioners’ decision on how to spend it." The flier lists four figures. One -- the amount that would have gone to the general fund -- was accurate, and another -- the amount for fire services -- wasn’t far off. The figure given for the sheriff’s office was inaccurate and oversimplified, though, and the figure for schools was wrong in amount and recipient. On the other point, residents would have seen a benefit from the return of the money, but it wouldn’t have been given directly to them. We rate the claim Mostly False because it contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts.	None	Freedom and Responsibility PAC	None	None	None	2013-12-04T15:10:01	2013-11-25	['None']
pomt-02151	"Residential property taxes [in Providence] are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/04/gina-raimondo/gina-raimondo-says-providence-taxes-rose-nearly-27/	Read our lips: If you want to win an election, accuse your opponent of raising taxes. So it wasn't surprising when Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island's general treasurer and candidate for governor, accused one of her Democratic primary opponents, Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, of overseeing a hefty tax increase. On April 28, 2014, the Raimondo campaign issued a news release headlined, "Just the Facts: As Providence families pay their property taxes, residential property taxes are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras." "Under Mayor Taveras," it said, "residential property taxes were raised two separate times: by 5 percent in FY 2012 and by 20.7 percent in FY 2014. In total, residential property taxes, which hit working families hard, are up 26.7 percent since 2011." The news release even included footnotes that cite the pages in the city's budgets that supported the argument. The Taveras campaign quickly fired back that the allegation was wrong and the average increase for 2014 was about 6 percent, not 20.7 percent. We donned our referee jersey and decided to use the Truth-O-Meter to see who was correct. The references in the news release sent us to two Providence budgets. Raimondo spokesman Eric Hyers said we should be looking at the tax rates. In the 2012 budget, on page 137, the tax rate for homeowners goes from $15.19 to $15.94, a 4.9 percent increase. The following year, the tax rate remained the same. But in the 2014 budget, on page 161, the rate jumps to $19.25, for an increase of 26.7 percent over three years. "We said tax rates are up 26 percent, which is totally, totally accurate," said Hyers. But on the same page of the 2014 budget, it notes that the new budget is based on an updated estimate of property values in the city, and residential property values decreased by an average of 13.2 percent. Readers who don't immediately understand why this throws a ridiculously-large monkey wrench into Raimondo's claim need to realize how property tax rates are calculated. The amount you pay depends on how many thousands of dollars your property is worth. If your house and land are worth $100,000 and the tax rate is set at $22 per thousand, your bill will be $2,200, or $100 times $22. In Rhode Island, every community is required to reassess the value of all of its properties every three years. When that revaluation occurs, the tax rate will usually go up or down depending on whether property values fall or rise, even if government spending -- and the average tax bill -- doesn't change from year to year. Comparing tax rates in isolation before and after a revaluation ignores half the equation. When residential property values decline by 13.2 percent, you have to increase your tax rate by a hefty amount if you want to raise the same amount of revenue that you did the previous year. In that case, the average tax bill remains the same. (On a case-by-case basis, the people in areas of the city where their property values rose will see an increase and homeowners living where property values fell will see their tax bill drop. That's what happened in Providence, although the average homeowner increase on individual tax bills was 4.8 percent.) In short: a tax rate -- by itself -- becomes a meaningless number when a municipality has readjusted the value of its tax base. When you take Providence’s revaluation into consideration, a homeowner whose property value went from $150,000 to $130,200 after revaluation saw a tax increase of 10 percent over the three-year period Raimondo is talking about, not 26 or 27 percent, according to our calculation based on city data. We asked Hyers if the Raimondo campaign had realized there had been a revaluation. He said the campaign knew, but it wasn't relevant to the news release. "We're talking about rates," he said. "The math is very simple. We are not trying to claim, and you will never hear me try to claim, that tax bills are up 27 percent. We've never said that the bills went up 27 percent. All we're saying is that the rates have gone up 27 percent." But contrary to Hyers’ assertion, the Raimondo news release never uses the word "rate." And it does say the tax bills went up 27 percent. It even quotes Hyers as saying, "Providence property taxes are skyrocketing." Our ruling In a news release, State Treasurer Gina Raimondo said, "Residential property taxes [in Providence] are up nearly 27 percent under Mayor Taveras." If Raimondo had consistently said that the tax rate had increased nearly 27 percent, PolitiFact Rhode Island would have viewed this claim differently. But the Raimondo "Just the Facts" news release misstates the facts, claiming taxes increased by nearly 27 percent. That's a ridiculous assertion, especially coming from the campaign of the current general treasurer, who is also a finance expert and presumably understands municipal finance.

pomt-05884	"Private prisons do not chase escaped inmates past the perimeter like the public prisons do, which means more escaped prisoners in our communities."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/07/chain-email/do-private-prisons-chase-escaped-inmates/	Prison breaks are the stuff of movies: toothbrushes fashioned into wall-chipping chisels, bed sheets braided into escape ropes, secret routes to the outside via ceilings and pipes. While the resourcefulness of desperate inmates can be impressive, there's also a scary side. Opponents of the Florida Legislature's prison privatization plan have tapped into this fear, warning that if the plan is successful, more criminals will end up on the lam. "Did you know that private prisons do not chase escaped inmates past the perimeter like the public prisons do, which means more escaped prisoners in our communities?" wrote Christina Bullins, a South Florida correctional probation officer. Bullins wrote an email dated Jan. 30, 2012, that was distributed by the liberal group MoveOn.org. It urged people to sign a petition against the plan. The claim that private prisons don’t chase inmates seems widely held among state-paid correctional officers and privatization opponents. They warn that public safety is at risk, and the state could see more incidents like in 2010, when three inmates in Arizona escaped a privatized facility with the help of a faulty alarm system, lax guard patrols and a propped-open door. The trio, two of whom were convicted murderers, were connected to the murder of a New Mexico couple following their breakout. We wondered if private prisons really are more restricted in chasing escapees. What we thought would be an easy policy check quickly turned into an all-out truth chase. If you pose the question to correctional officers and their union reps, you get an unequivocal yes. Ask their private-sector counterparts and you get an unequivocal no. Outside experts are divided, and we ourselves were baffled by ambiguous statutes and redacted security policies. What the companies say We asked three companies that run private prisons in Florida -- Corrections Corp. of America, Management & Training Corp., and the GEO Group -- if their policies allow for employees to cross the perimeter in pursuit of an inmate. CCA spokesman Steve Owen said his company does. That's expected of a facility, per their state contract, he said. But employees are told to notify local sheriff's deputies or police about escapees, he said. "At some point ... it makes more sense for local authorities to pursue the inmate," Owen said. There's never been an escape at Gadsden Correctional Institution, said Management & Training Corp. spokesman Issa Arnita, but Gadsden correctional officers "have authority to pursue escaped inmates beyond prison grounds." A spokesman for the GEO Group said their private prisons operate similarly to public prisons. But he also said company policy prevents him from sharing specific security policies and procedures. "Correctional facilities operated by GEO and other firms are contractually required to follow the same operational procedures and policies that are followed by prisons operated by the state," said spokesman Pablo Paez. What state law says We then turned to state law, which presented more ambiguity. The law states "a private correctional officer may use force only while on the grounds of a facility, while transporting inmates, and while pursuing escapees from a facility." Private officers are also allowed to use non-deadly force to prevent an inmate from committing a felony or misdemeanor, which includes escape. Another law requires all prison officers and correctional officers to immediately arrest a convict who escapes. Officers or guards "may call upon the sheriff or other officer of the state" or of any county or municipality to search for and arrest convicts. Several experts told us that it’s not clear from these statutes that private guards have outright authority to chase after inmates beyond the property line. The first rule seems to imply it, but it does not specifically address what happens off prison property. "In my opinion that’s part of the problem with the privatization of prisons," said Michael Hallett, a University of North Florida criminal justice professor who has written extensively on privatization and is opposed to the Senate plan. "It blurs the line between the state and a private party." What the contracts say Next, we turned to the contracts between private prisons and the state to see how escapes are handled. PolitiFact Florida reviewed contracts for each of the state's seven currently privatized prisons, and those contracts contain requirements for security and emergency plans. Those policies are redacted from public review, however, due to security concerns. Republican Sen. Mike Fasano, who was removed from his longtime post atop the budget subcommittee for criminal justice programs for his adamant opposition, said he’s never heard of a company agreeing to go beyond their property in the pursuit of an inmate. Unlike the state, which is protected from lawsuits under "sovereign immunity," private operators would not be protected from lawsuits if something went wrong in a chase. "If he hurts somebody and gets sued, he's on his own," said Ken Kopczynski, director of research at the Police Benevolent Association, the officers' former longtime union. With that kind of burden, private prison vendors would call local public law enforcement for assistance, Kopczynski said. The vendors also have agreements with the Department of Corrections to bring in help in cases of escape, riot and hostage situations. PolitiFact Florida reviewed these agreements and found the state's help includes canine tracking teams, hostage negotiators and other emergency response teams upon the request of the private vendor. In Palm Beach County, home to GEO Group-operated South Bay prison, deputies would react to an escape with dog teams, horses, helicopters and patrols, said county sheriff's office spokesman Eric Davis. But they would do that for any escape, private or public alike, he said. "It’s not like guards are going to leave the facility unmanned (in a pursuit). That’s not how it goes," Davis said. Prison breakouts by the numbers State legislators who heard these arguments in debate were concerned enough to add an amendment to the legislation. The most recent version of the bill says contractors must pay the state for costs "associated with the pursuit or apprehension of an escapee" for the first 48 hours of the inmate's escape. Senators wanted to be sure state and local governments would not be on the hook if prisoners slipped through private facilities, which has happened in the past, Hallett said. Before we rule, we should note an important caveat to this discussion: Prison breakouts are not very common. Opponents’ evidence that privatization will lead to neighborhood chaos is anecdotal. The reason they envision more breakouts is that private prisons offer lower starting salaries and benefits, leading to high turnover and less experience. There were 167 escapes in Florida from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011, none of which were from inside a private or public correctional facility, according to the most recent state figures available. The majority of escapes are hardly the stuff of The Shawshank Redemption. Most involve inmates simply walking away from road prisons and work release. The last true prison break was in 2005 when three Dade Correctional Institution inmates built a ladder, tossed a sheet of carpet over the barbed-wire fence and climbed over, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. They stole a truck at knifepoint and remained free for about an hour -- until their vehicle plunged into a canal during a chase by police. That was at a public prison, by the way. Our ruling Private prison vendors say they have the authority to chase escaped prisoners beyond their property lines. Without getting into detailed security procedures, they say they have the same authority as public corrections officials. We've seen nothing to contradict those statements, but we’ve also seen nothing that strongly supports them, thanks to public records exemptions on their security plans. Even if they can pursue past their property lines, does that mean they will? The vendors say part of their escape plan is to immediately notify local authorities. The authorities we consulted said they would definitely take the lead if a prisoner went off campus, but they added that would be the case for a state-run facility, too. That brings us to the final part of the claim: This chase policy will result in "more escaped prisoners in our communities." While there are definitely horror stories resulting from inmate escapes, we don’t see the evidence that there are more escapes from private prisons. We would consider this point speculative. The email said, "Private prisons do not chase escaped inmates past the perimeter like the public prisons do, which means more escaped prisoners in our communities." We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14137	ColoradoCare would have higher revenues than McDonald’s.	mostly true	/colorado/statements/2016/may/04/colorado-health-institute/report-says-coloradocare-would-have-higher-revenue/	An independent analysis says Colorado's proposed universal health care system would have $38 billion in projected revenues -- dwarfing Fortune 500 companies like McDonald's, Nike and American Express. The report, by the Colorado Health Institute, is a primer on the potential benefits and drawbacks of ColoradoCare, a proposed state health care cooperative that would resemble single-payer health care systems like those in Canada and Europe. Coloradans will decide whether to create the giant system when they vote on Amendment 69 in the November election. "Supporters estimate ColoradoCare would have $38 billion in annual revenues," the report states. "If it were a private company, ColoradoCare would rank about 80th in the Fortune 500, just behind New York Life Insurance and ahead of well­-known companies such as American Express, 21st Century Fox, 3M, Sears, Nike and McDonald's." Need more perspective? Colorado's annual state budget is $25.7 billion. We examined the statement that ColoradoCare’s projected revenues would be $38 billion and overshadow huge corporates. We found that the number is right in theory, but it depends on the federal government signing off on a first-of-its-kind health system for Colorado. How ColoradoCare would work First, here’s how ColoradoCare would work. If approved by voters, Colorado would be the first state to have a health care system where every resident has coverage financed by taxes instead of private insurance premiums, according to the Colorado Health Institute report. The institute estimates that 83 percent of Colorado’s population -- about 4.4 million people -- would be eligible for primary health insurance coverage through ColoradoCare. The remaining 17 percent of residents would continue to be covered by federal programs, including Medicare and the Veterans Administration. People would still choose their own health care providers, but ColoradoCare would pay the bills. Members would not have to pay an annual deductible, but they would have co-pays. The system would be controlled by a powerful 21-member board, elected by the system’s members in seven districts across the state. The governor and legislature would have no role, except to select an interim board until elections were held. An economic analysis by supporters says ColoradoCare would produce a net savings of $4.5 billion for residents and businesses by eliminating private insurance profits, streamlining paperwork and more efficiently delivering services. Opponents say the proposed amendment will be costly, it won't impact rising health care costs and it will hamper the state’s ability to attract and retain medical providers. The ColoradoCareYes campaign confirmed the proposed nonprofit health system is projected to have $38 billion in annual revenues. About $25 billion would come from state taxes. Employers would pay 6.67 percent in payroll taxes and employees would contribute 3.33 percent, for a total of 10 percent of the payroll. Self-employed people would pay 10 percent of their net income. The projected $25 billion in tax revenues have been independently confirmed by an economist at the Colorado Legislative Council, which provided a revenue impact report to the state board that reviews the language and legality of an initiative's ballot title and summary. For the rest of its annual revenues, supporters say ColoradoCare would apply for waivers from the federal government, so that ColoradoCare takes over the state roles and funding for Medicaid ($10.8 billion) and the Affordable Care Act ($700 million). Out-of-pocket costs for medical care and dental care would each provide an estimated $1 billion. But experts said obtaining the federal waivers is a challenging process -- and there’s no certainty of success. Beginning on Jan. 1, states can apply for a federal waiver to create innovative, alternative health care programs that would take the place of the Affordable Care Act -- while staying true to its goals. ColoradoCare would have to pass a rigorous federal review, showing it would deliver coverage that's at least as comprehensive and affordable as the so-called Obamacare program, while covering the same amount of people. ColoradoCare would have to stay "revenue neutral" and not cost more than the existing federal program. Federal waivers, funding ‘not a sure thing’ What are the chances of obtaining the waivers and the federal funds that go with them? "Definitely, I would say it’s not a sure thing," said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who specializes in health care reform, an issue she worked on for both the administrations of President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton. Yet, if approved by voters, ColoradoCare would be among the first states to seek an Affordable Care Act (ACA) waiver and bring "the most far-reaching health care reform in any state since the ACA," according to the Colorado Health Institute report. "There's advantages for being the first one in the door. It lets you kind of establish the framework for the debate that's going follow," Pollitz said. Medicaid waivers aren’t automatic, either, though several states, including Colorado, have received the so-called 1115 waivers -- named for a Section 1115 of the Social Security Act "1115 waivers require a lot of work and back-and-forth between the state and the federal government and compliance with a number of criteria, including budget neutrality," said Elisabeth Arenales, the health care program director for the Colorado Center on Law and Policy. The center hasn't reviewed or taken a position on Amendment 69. "States have to be careful in how they negotiate those waivers because they're essentially locked into a spending contract, and they need to be very mindful that they're both not costing the federal government any additional money but also that their projections of state spending are accurate," Arenales said. The ballot initiative’s language makes it clear that getting the waivers are a do-or-die matter for ColoradoCare. No waivers means no program. Under the heading "Termination of ColoradoCare’s Operations," the initiative states: "If the board determines that ColoradoCare has not received the waivers, exemptions, and agreements from the federal government sufficient for its fiscally sound operation, the board shall: (a) shut down operations and return unused funds; (b) notify the governor of the State of Colorado of ColoradoCare's inability to function." ColoradoCareYES campaign spokesman Owen Perkins acknowledged the waivers’ critical importance. "ColoradoCare doesn't move forward without that," he said. But, at the same time, he said it should be reassuring to Colorado voters that health care system couldn’t launch until it passes a high bar set by the federal government. "I think everybody in Colorado should be thankful that there is that vigorous standard," Perkins said. "That ensures that we can't go into this willy-nilly. It could pass with a 75-percent vote and everything look perfect, but if it doesn't receive that waiver, it's not going to happen." He stressed that the architects of ColoradoCare have done their homework. The Colorado Health Institute is accurate in saying, given ColoradoCare’s projected $38 billion in revenues, if it were a private company is would rank about 80th on the Fortune 500 just behind New York Life Insurance ($38.7 billion in revenues). It’s revenues would be larger than American Express ($35.9 billion), Twenty-First Century Fox ($31.86 billion), 3M ($31.82 billion), Sears ($31.2 billion), Nike ($27.8 billion) and McDonald’s ($27.4 billion). On paper, the ColoradoCareYES campaign’s projected state tax and federal funding revenues add up to $38 billion. Our ruling The Colorado Health Institute analysis said the Colorado universal health care system would have a projected $38 billion in revenues, larger than major corporations. The numbers seem to add up if everything with ColoradoCare goes according to its supporters’ plans. The revenues would be larger than some big companies. However, the health care plan has a make-or-break need to obtain federal waivers that would allow it to assume the roles of state Medicaid and Affordable Care Act programs. No waivers means no deal. The statement is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-09162	"Every major study that has been done by a legitimate group ... shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our (cap-and-trade) legislation. And if you wind up pricing carbon."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/08/john-kerry/sen-kerry-says-cap-and-trade-bill-would-create-job/	The latest version of cap-and-trade legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases and encouraging a shift to more sustainable energy sources was unveiled by Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman on May 12, 2010. It's called the American Power Act. One of the biggest knocks on the bill from conservative opponents is that the bill would be a job killer. Sen. Kerry addressed that claim on ABC's ''This Week'' on June 6, 2010: "Every major study that has been done by a legitimate group ... shows that there are hundreds of thousands of jobs to be created if you pass our (cap-and-trade) legislation. And if you wind up pricing carbon." Kerry accurately cited the findings of the May 20, 2010, analysis of the American Power Act's job impact by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. According to the report, "The American Power Act prompts $41.1 billion in annual electricity sector investment between 2011 and 2030, $22.5 billion more than under business as usual. Given that the United States is currently below full employment with most economists projecting a slow labor market recovery, this investment is more stimulative than inflationary in the first decade, resulting in an average annual increase in U.S. employment of 203,000 jobs above business as usual, with the net of the jobs lost in fossil fuel production and as a result of higher energy prices between 2001 and 2020. In the second decade of the program, higher energy and product prices offset the employment gains from new investment." But was Kerry right that every other major study done by a legitimate group came to the same conclusion that the bill would create hundreds of thousands of jobs? First of all, we couldn't find any other studies that specifically analyzed the employment impact of the American Power Act. It was only introduced less than a month ago. Several economic groups have studies underway, but the Peterson Institute appears to have reached the clubhouse first. But there are plenty of economic studies of generic cap-and-trade plans, as well as ones that specifically analyzed the version passed by the House last year. And some of their conclusions about job impact contradict the findings of the the Peterson Institute. In fact, on May 5, 2010, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report on how policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could affect employment. The CBO's analysis of research "concluded that total employment during the next few decades would be slightly lower than would be the case in the absence of such policies. In particular, job losses in the industries that shrink would lower employment more than job gains in other industries would increase employment, thereby raising the overall unemployment rate." CBO reached its conclusion based primarily on the review of three economic modeling studies, by analysts at Resources for the Future (RFF), the Brookings Institution and the consulting firm CRA International. The CBO "basically found that most of the studies found there's likely to be a small decrease in employment levels, relative to not doing anything, with the cap-and-trade policy," said Adele Morris, policy director of Climate and Energy Economics at the Brookings Institution. They aren't the only ones. Last year, for example, the Marshall Institute produced a report that found "estimates of job losses (due to cap-and-trade legislation) range from hundreds of thousands to millions." Said Morris: "It is certainly not the case that every major study done by a legitimate group found that there would be hundreds of thousands of jobs created. I would like to consider Brookings to be a legitimate group." The primary difference for the disparate findings, said Trevor Houser, who led the Peterson study, is that the Peterson study specifically evaluated the effect of the American Power Act, while the reports in the CBO did not. The Peterson report also assessed the bill given the real-time reality of a U.S. economy with unemployment near 10 percent and economists predicting a slow recovery. The reports cited by CBO are "full employment" models designed to assess the long-term impact (30 to 50 years), Houser said. Whitney Smith, press secretary for Kerry, also stressed that the three studies cited in the CBO report were not about Kerry's American Power Act specifically. And Smith cited a Peterson Institute response to the CBO study, which argues that the "methodological approach of the studies included in the CBO report arguably overstates potential job losses." So what other reports was Kerry referring to when he said "every major study that has been done by a legitimate group, most recently the Peterson Institute of Economics..."? According to Smith, Kerry was also referencing a report from Third Way, which describes itself as a "moderate think-tank of the progressive movement." The report concluded that job losses in "old industries" will be more than offset by an increase in clean energy jobs so that "that carbon pricing will result in net job growth" of somewhere between 118,000 to 1.1 million jobs. But the Third Way report isn't a study of the American Power Act either. It's a review of two dozen studies over the last three years of various plans to put a price on carbon. Third Way rejected reports from the ideological left and right and considered just those "in the middle." While the Third Way review did not specifically address the American Power Act, there is nothing in this latest cap-and-trade bill that would make it differ much with regard to the projections about the broad impact on the economy and the number of jobs gained, said Josh Freed, director of the Third Way Clean Energy Program. If Kerry is going to hang his hat on the fact that none of the other studies (such as those cited in the CBO report) looked at the American Power Act specifically, then we are really only talking about one study, the Peterson Institute study. We aren't aware of any others. Neither are the folks at the Peterson Institute. And the Third Way study cited by the Kerry spokesman isn't an analysis of the American Power Act either. So the question then is whether the American Power Act is so different from past versions of the cap-and-trade bill, or the generic versions modeled by various economists, that it would render their conclusions irrelevant in analyzing the American Power Act. And many economists we spoke to said that's not the case, that the earlier versions are substantially similar to Kerry's, especially for the purpose of analyzing the bills' jobs impact. And the fact that Kerry's spokesman included the Third Way study suggests they think it's fair game to consider older versions of cap-and-trade legislation for comparative purposes as well. Economists at the Peterson Institute, the Brookings Institution -- or for that matter at, say, the conservative Heritage Foundation, which projected a cap-and-trade bill could cost millions of jobs -- certainly disagree about each others' methodology. Various economic models employ different assumptions about everything from the viability of doubling the number of nuclear power plants to the prospects for the economy. They all look at different timelines. You may agree or disagree with the findings and methodology of the Peterson Institute study, but the fact is that other "legitimate groups" have performed studies and reached different conclusions. Kerry's statement suggests there is some unanimity of opinion among legitimate organizations about cap-and-trade's effect on jobs. And that's just not so. There is quite a bit of disagreement. So we rate Kerry's claim False.	None	John Kerry	None	None	None	2010-06-08T14:50:07	2010-06-06	['None']

pomt-12189	"In order to sell insurance in Florida there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. ... far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jul/27/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-florida-mandates-coverage-more-co/	Republicans attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, have been met with concerns about whether health insurance will still offer comprehensive coverage under new rules. But U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says Florida law mandates that insurers cover more essential health benefits than the federal law. "In Florida, essential health benefits aren't just what the federal government requires, it is what state law requires," Rubio said on Facebook Live July 20. Then he continued "under state law, in order to sell insurance in Florida, there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. In essence, you cannot sell a health care plan in Florida if you don't cover these things -- far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare. Irrespective of what we do in federal law, we still have to follow the state law, and these plans will still have to go through the state. My point is much of what health insurance in Florida will look like will be determined by the state Legislature. That’s the way it should be." In Florida, are insurers required to cover more conditions than under President Barack Obama’s signature legislation? A reader emailed the Truth-O-Meter and asked us to check it out, so we did. Rubio has a point -- Florida did have a long list of health care mandates before the federal law passed in 2010. But multiple experts told us that comparing the number of state mandates to the number of essential health benefits in the federal law is not an apples-to-apples comparison. In some ways, the federal protections are more sweeping. Understanding what the laws say about coverage requires reading the fine print. Federal law requires coverage of 10 categories of essential health benefits Prior to the Affordable Care Act, every state had its own mandates. Some states had a longer list of mandates than others -- Florida’s list of mandates was long, said Timothy Jost, emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law and a supporter of the federal law. The Affordable Care Act took a different approach: It set 10 coverage "essential health benefit" categories for plans sold on the individual and small group markets nationwide. The categories were: Ambulatory patient services; Emergency services; Hospitalization; Maternity and newborn care; Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; Prescription drugs; Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; Laboratory services; Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and, Pediatric services, including oral and vision care. The federal law is a minimum standard -- states are allowed to provide greater benefits. For example, Florida law requires coverage of adult student dependents until age 30, with some caveats, while the federal law only requires such coverage until age 26. The 10 categories were intentionally broad so states could have flexibility to apply them. As part of the federal law, each state sets a benchmark plan which defines the essential health benefits. While the federal law sets 10 broad categories, Florida lists specific benefits. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation directed PolitiFact to the benchmark plan, a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan which shows about 34 covered benefits. The first thing we noticed is that the list of benefits has some overlap, so it doesn’t mean that the 34 benefits are three times more than the broader 10 required categories in the federal law. For example, in the federal law, mental health and substance use is one category, but in the Florida benchmark plan, that’s broken down into four benefits for inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance abuse. A spokesman for Rubio sent us a chart showing about 50 mandates and their accompanying state statutes. About half of the statutes related to health conditions or procedures such as newborn hearing screening, emergency room services and a mastectomy. The remainder were related to covering services by certain health providers, such as acupuncturists, or types of people covered such as dependent adult children. In the laws Rubio cited about providers, many don’t actually require that insurers cover certain services. For example, a statute Rubio cited about massage therapists states that if a policy covers massage, it must cover the services of a person licensed to practice massage if it has been prescribed by a physician. But the numbers alone don’t tell us much about the actual coverage patients receive -- we have to read the fine print to see who would get certain types of coverage under Florida’s laws, said Justin Giovannelli, an expert at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. For example, Rubio’s list references laws on substance abuse and mental health treatment, but state laws don’t require coverage for those services for the individual market. However, since the federal law supersedes state law, the Obamacare plans must cover those services. Rubio also cited a Florida law about maternity care. That statute isn’t a blanket requirement that insurers cover maternity care. Instead, it contains a few provisions that explain if a policy provides maternity care, here are the particular requirements -- for example, it must cover post-delivery services. Once the federal law defined maternity care as an essential health benefit, then all individual plans had to include coverage for that benefit -- regardless of existing state laws. (Before the law, some consumers purchased riders.) "So whereas the ACA requires an insurer in the individual market in Florida to offer coverage that includes these benefits, if the ACA went away, an insurer would not be obligated by federal or state law to provide coverage of these benefits," Giovannelli said. Joe Antos, a health expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says it’s not surprising that Florida law lists more than 10 benefits. "The tradition among insurance commissioners in most states is to be more precise about what has to be covered," he said. But comparing the number of state benefits with the ACA’s required essential health benefits isn’t the point, he said. "The number really doesn’t matter. What matters is, what is the economic impact on the premiums?" he said. "When most people talk about this, they seem to think there are huge savings from cutting out things like maternity coverage and mental health. The reality is maternity coverage is very small percentage of the total for a comprehensive plan. Mental health would be expensive, but Medicaid picks up vast majority of mental health expenses." Rubio has a point about the state legislatures having the power to set health care laws -- something it had before the ACA and will continue to have. Richard Cauchi, a health insurance expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that nearly half of Florida’s health care related laws were enacted before 1989 and only six in the last 10 years. The federal health care law has had a role in expanding the types of conditions covered in Florida. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, Florida Blue added pediatric services for dental, vision and habilitative services, said Doug Bartel, Florida Blue spokesman. Our ruling Rubio said, "In order to sell insurance in Florida there are over 40 separate individual conditions that must be covered. ... far beyond the essential health benefits included in Obamacare." Rubio’s spokesman pointed to a list of about 50 state mandates, about half of which pertained to health conditions. But many of the state mandates only apply if an insurer chooses to cover a condition. The federal protections are more sweeping and put more requirements on insurers to cover a broad range of services. Rubio’s comparison omits that state laws alone would leave Floridians on the individual market without certain types of coverage that are mandated by the federal law. He also ignores that state categories are defined more narrowly. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03588	"We had people that were getting killed (in Benghazi), we had people who are willing to risk their lives to go save them, and somebody told them to stand down."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/14/jason-chaffetz/rep-jason-chaffetz-says-special-forces-ready-save-/	With Americans under attack in Benghazi, did the U.S. military do all it could to save lives? Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, says no. Four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, were killed in attacks that began Sept. 11, 2012, on U.S. compounds in Benghazi, Libya. Meanwhile, four special forces troops "willing to risk their lives to go save them" were "told to stand down," Chaffetz told Fox News host Sean Hannity. Did the U.S. fail to send life-saving help? Who knew what, when? Gregory Hicks was deputy chief of mission in Libya the night of the attacks, working from the capital, Tripoli, more than an hourlong flight away. He testified before lawmakers May 8, 2013, about a four-person team he had hoped would fly from Tripoli to Benghazi — but didn’t get permission to get on the plane. Chaffetz, the national security chairman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, previewed Hicks’ testimony two days earlier for Fox News: Hannity: "Congressman Chaffetz, there was — we now have discovered through testimony, Greg Hicks among others — that there was a C-130 ready to bring reinforcements during the attack to help those that were under fire and they were ordered to stand down?" Chaffetz: "The administration including (Defense) Secretary (Leon) Panetta were very crystal clear, there were no military assets, but I got to tell you, we had proximity, we had capability, we had four individuals in Libya armed, ready to go, dressed about to get into the car to go in the airport to go help their fellow countrymen who were dying and being killed and under attack in Benghazi and they were told to stand down. "And Sean, of all the things I've seen, that's as sickening and depressing and disgusting as anything I have seen. That is not the American way. We had people that were getting killed, we had people who are willing to risk their lives to go save them and somebody told them to stand down." But Hicks’ testimony and a State Department review board report show it was clear the "people that were getting killed" were already dead when the security team was ready to go. Here’s the time line: Attackers streamed into the State Department’s temporary mission on Sept. 11 at around 9:45 p.m. The ambassador called Hicks to alert him to the attack. As Tripoli and Washington scrambled to respond, attackers set a diesel-fueled fire that killed Stevens and information officer Sean Smith. Around 11:30 p.m., the surviving Americans drove an armored vehicle to an "annex" — a CIA facility — a few miles away. They fought off attackers for about an hour and a half, and were able to "repulse them," Hicks said, by about 1:30 in the morning. Americans in Tripoli sent a seven-person security team to Benghazi, which landed around 1:15 a.m. Held up by lack of transportation and escort from Libyans, it got to the annex around 5 a.m. — just in time for a second attack. Mortar rounds rained, killing American security officers on the roof, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Hicks said there "was every reason to continue to believe that our personnel were in danger," so he wanted to send more help. "We determined that we needed to send a second team from Tripoli to secure the airport for the withdrawal of our personnel from Benghazi after the mortar attack," he said. The order of what happened next isn’t clear. In Tripoli, cars took Americans to meet a Libyan C-130 (a military transport plane) that would fly to collect evacuees in Benghazi. In Benghazi, Libyan militia members helped Americans evacuate around 6:30 a.m. to the airport, with a Defense Department drone watching overhead. A charter plane took a first group. The second group waited for the C-130. Here’s what Hicks told lawmakers: "The defense attache had persuaded the Libyans to fly their C-130 to Benghazi. ... Since we had consolidated at the annex, and the Libyan government had now provided us with external security around our facilities, we wanted to send further reinforcements to Benghazi. "We determined that Lieutenant Gibson and his team of special forces troops should go. The people in Benghazi had been fighting all night. They were tired. They were exhausted. We wanted to make sure the airport was secure for their withdrawal. As Col. Gibson and his three personnel were getting in the cars, he stopped. And he called them off and told me that he had not been authorized to go. The vehicles had to go because the flight needed to go to Tripoli, I mean, to Benghazi. Lt. Col. Gibson was furious. I had told him to go bring our people home. That's what he wanted to do. … So the plane went. I think it landed in Benghazi around 7:30." So the four men that Chaffetz talked about would have arrived more than two hours after the final deaths, after one group had already evacuated by charter plane. The C-130 landed back in Tripoli with the last evacuating Americans around 11:30 a.m. Chaffetz’s office says he never claimed that the "four individuals" would have saved lives — but that they were willing to go save people. "What is clear is that at the time they were told to stand down, it was not known whether they could/would have played a role in saving lives," said spokesperson MJ Henshaw. Panetta told senators in February that the Defense Department "employed every asset at our disposal that could have been used to help save lives of our American colleagues." During Hicks’ testimony last week, Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., read from a Defense Department press release explaining the security team was directed to stay in Tripoli because those in Benghazi "had shifted to evacuation." "We continue to believe that there was nothing this group could have done had they arrived in Benghazi, and they performed superbly in Tripoli," she read. "In fact, when the first aircraft arrived back in Tripoli, these four played a key role in receiving, treating and moving the wounded." Chaffetz’s spokesperson says it’s not clear exactly when the order was given that the special forces team stay in Tripoli, who gave it, or what was known about the safety of Americans in Benghazi when the order was given. "We have asked for exact times repeatedly, but haven’t received answers," she said. Our ruling Chaffetz told Fox News that "we had people that were getting killed, we had people who are willing to risk their lives to go save them and somebody told them to stand down." But it’s clear from Hicks’ testimony that four Americans "getting killed" in Benghazi were already dead when the decision was made to keep the special forces team in Tripoli. The mortar attack was over. A Defense Department drone watched overhead in Benghazi as Libyan militia members helped Americans get to the airport. Chaffetz, however, says the team was available to go save "people that were getting killed," calling the order to stand down "sickening and depressing and disgusting." His office clarifies he meant that the team might have prevented additional casualties if attacks had continued — an explanation utterly missing from his national TV appearance.

pomt-14416	Says Donald Trump "has said he wants to be neutral on Israel and the Palestinians"	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/mar/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-donald-trump-said-he-will-be-neutral/	The Republican candidates have competed to portray themselves as the top fan of Israel. During the GOP debate in Miami, Sen. Ted Cruz attacked Donald Trump for his stance on Israeli-Palestinian relations. "On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians," said Cruz. "As president, I will not be neutral." Trump defended his record on Israel, arguing that there is "nobody on this stage that is more pro-Israel than I am." Cruz has a point: Trump did say he wanted to be "neutral" in negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. However, that doesn’t capture the full spirit of Trump’s comments about Israel. Trump the negotiator Cruz was using an attack line we’ve seen before in an ad by Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Sen. Marco Rubio for president. Trump made the statement about being "neutral" at an MSNBC town hall in South Carolina on Feb. 17. (A Cruz spokeswoman on debate night sent us an article about Trump’s town hall comments.) MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough asked Trump whether Israelis or Palestinians were at fault for a lack of an agreement. So far, efforts have failed to work out a lasting comprehensive agreement on issues such as security, land claims, whether Israel can build settlements and recognizing each other’s right to exist. Trump refused to pick a side, saying that would hurt his ability to serve as a negotiator. "Let me be sort of a neutral guy .... I don't want to say whose fault is it," Trump said. "I don't think it helps." Trump made similar comments a couple of weeks later at a February debate in Houston. He said that when negotiating a deal, it wouldn’t help to pick a good guy and a bad guy: "It doesn't help if I start saying, 'I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage,' " Trump said, adding that he can’t negotiate as well if he takes sides. "With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel." During the debate at the University of Miami, Trump reeled off his pro-Israel credentials, including that he was a grand marshal for the Israeli Day Parade in New York. He stood by his words about his goal to remain neutral as a negotiation strategy. Trump said although he is "pro-Israel", in order to negotiate a peace settlement, "I would like to at least have the other side think I am at least somewhat neutral to them." Trump’s previous comments about Israel In December, Trump suggested to the Associated Press that to negotiate a deal, the big lift may have to come from Israel. "A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal, whether or not Israel's willing to sacrifice certain things," Trump said. "They may not be, and I understand that, and I'm okay with that. But then you're just not going to have a deal." Trump evaded specific questions about whether Palestinian demands are legitimate but said that Israeli housing projects were a "huge sticking point" in talks. The same week, Trump praised Israel by saying it had already "given a lot" in a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. But he said if elected, as a deal maker he wouldn’t want to give away his position ahead of time. "I’d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room," he said. Trump also told the coalition that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2013. "I am a big fan of Israel," Trump said in the video endorsement. "And frankly a strong prime minister is a strong Israel." During the 2016 campaign, Trump had planned on meeting with Netanyahu in Israel but canceled after Netanyahu faced backlash after Trump’s comments about Muslims. When asked at the Republican Jewish Coalition if he had relationships with any Arab leaders, Trump said, "I haven’t been working too much with the Arab leaders." Spokespersons for Trump did not respond on debate night. Our ruling Cruz said Trump "has said he wants to be neutral on Israel and the Palestinians" Trump did make that statement during an MSNBC town hall in February. He has repeatedly said that in order to be an effective negotiator he believes he must approach the two sides with neutrality.

pomt-12633	Says if a Florida bill (HB 697) punishing sanctuary cities becomes law "it will be the only law of its kind in the nation."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/30/carlos-guillermo-smith/fact-check-florida-considering-one-kind-legislatio/	Florida House Republicans are following President Donald Trump’s lead by supporting legislation that requires jurisdictions to do away with practices that shield undocumented immigrants, which are known as "sanctuary cities." Rep. Larry Metz, R-Yalaha, sponsored a proposal (HB 697) that would require county and local law enforcement agencies to comply with and support enforcement of federal immigration law or face stiff penalties. The bill has moved along party lines in a couple of House committee hearings. It needs a full vote in the House and approval in the Senate, where it has not been heard at all, before it can reach Gov. Rick Scott’s desk and become law.. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, has raised strong objections. Smith tried to weaken the bill with six filed amendments in a March 21 hearing. After all six of his attempts failed, Smith argued that the bill’s enforcement penalties are uniquely harsh. "It will be the only law of its kind in the nation," Smith said. This made us wonder: Is Florida considering one-of-a-kind legislation for sanctuary cities? It looks like Smith is basically right, if the law didn't undergo any significant changes and was signed by Scott. National experts agree that — to the best of their knowledge — while other states have taken up bills on sanctuary cities, no other law or pending bill goes as far in terms of the breadth of the prohibitions and the penalties imposed in HB 697. HB 697 offers an orginal mix of penalties There is no legal definition for sanctuary policies. The term is used to describe places that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The Trump administration has begun calling out cities and counties with these policies, and he promised to cancel all funding of sanctuary cities. Cities and counties that choose not to actively assist federal authorities in carrying out immigration enforcement duties argue that such practices negatively impact police-community relations, and that ultimately it's not their responsibility to enforce federal laws. Some argue that the tactics used to enforce these policies border on unconstitutional, too. The main way agencies refuse to comply is to not honor written requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain individuals for up to 48 hours longer than they would have been released. Metz’s bill doesn’t call out any specific places in Florida as sanctuary cities, but a staff analysis does mention a 2010 Miami-Dade policy as an example of place that might be affected by this bill. The county’s policy said that ICE detainers would only be honored if the federal government reimbursed the costs incurred. Miami-Dade mayor Carlos Giménez reversed the policy in January, putting him in the realm of compliance with Metz’s legislation. A major component of Metz’s HB 697 requires state and local entities, as well as law enforcement agencies to comply with the enforcement of federal immigration law 90 days after the law goes into effect. If they don’t? Cities and counties with those policies would face penalties that include: • a five-year suspension on receiving non-federal grant money from state and local entities that don’t honor immigration enforcement; • The threat of automatic suspension and removal from office for elected state officials accused of violating sanctuary prohibition policy; • A prohibition of public funds to reimburse or defend a public official who is accused of violating a sanctuary prohibition policy; and • civil fines if detainers are not honored starting Oct. 1. Smith said his research shows no other law in the United States goes that far. Smith found that Alabama, Georgia, Utah and North Carolina have laws that require entities to honor all ICE detainer and information requests, but still don’t go as far as HB 697. For example, Alabama law restricts funds, grants, or appropriations until a violation has ceased, but doesn’t have a provision to have a civil cause of action against an official if a person is injured by an undocumented immigrant. Georgia law authorizes local officials to cooperate with federal immigration officials, but doesn’t require it. Utah restricts sanctuary policies, but does not prescribe penalties. And North Carolina prohibits sanctuary cities, but there’s no enforcement mechanism. In addition, Indiana has a law that prohibited local governments from refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, but the penalties are lacking. It can be hard to say for certain if Smith is right, but national immigration experts agree with Smith’s point. "If passed, that statement is accurate in that no such law is currently on the books, although several state anti-sanctuary bills are pending with some similar provisions," said Avideh Moussavian, a policy attorney at the National Immigration Law Center. Smith’s research encompassed pending bills in other legislatures. While many states have pending legislation supporting compliance with ICE, he found, once again, that none of the penalties went as far as HB 697. Ann Morse, the director of the Immigrant Policy Project for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said her group is looking into 100 bills in more than 30 states related to local law enforcement and immigration. Morse said she couldn’t find any pending legislation with quite the penalties listed above. We also reached out to Monica Varsanyi, an associate professor at political science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, CUNY. Her research explores the explosion of state- and local-level "immigration" policy-making and she has authored several reports over the years regarding the topic. "I can say that I haven’t seen anything like this bill," Varsanyi said. "I can’t be 100 percent sure that there aren’t others out there, however." Three other immigration law experts from around the country gave a similar assessment. The only other state considering a bill anywhere close to Florida’s bill is Texas, which is considering a piece of legislation that would prohibit sanctuary city policies and apply some of the same penalties included in HB 697, including withholding grant money and civil fines. The penalties in Florida’s bill go further by restricting grant funds for up to five years. Texas’ bill only withholds funds for the following year. Metz told PolitiFact Florida he got the idea to withhold grant money from the Texas bill but considered its language too general. Because this is the second year Metz has proposed this type of legislation, he was able to survey bills from the 2016 and 2017 session to see what was out there before finalizing HB 697. "In some of the bills I surveyed, this year, they were looking at making it a criminal violation to have a sanctuary policy," Metz said. "I did not go that route. I felt it should remain in the civil arena, but with significant penalties." Our ruling Smith said that a proposed crackdown on Florida’s "sanctuary cities" HB 697 would be the "only one of its kind in the nation." Several states have come up with bills targeting so-called sanctuary cities. Among them, HB 697 in its current form is indeed unique in terms of the severity of the prohibitions and penalties against state and local entities that choose not to comply with federal immigration detainer requests. The Texas Legislature appears to have the next-closest version of this legislation. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-00777	"Wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the (NSA) database."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/09/edward-snowden/fact-checking-john-olivers-interview-edward-snowde/	Most Americans have a fuzzy understanding of exactly what the National Security Agency can and cannot see with its surveillance programs, much less what a former NSA contractor named Edward Snowden tried to do about it. That’s the finding, anyway, of informal street interviews by John Oliver’s crew at Last Week Tonight on HBO. Oliver devoted his April 5 show to the NSA spying story. It included an exclusive interview with Snowden, who is living in Russia after the State Department canceled his passport. And it included the topic of this fact-check: Can emails sent between two people living in the United States unwittingly end up on the computer screen of some NSA analyst? Oliver, who blends comedy with journalism, framed the discussion around the NSA peeping on nude pictures. Oliver asked Snowden to describe the capability of various NSA surveillance programs in relation to nude pictures sent by Americans, starting with "702 surveillance." This refers to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This section was added in 2008 and was renewed under President Barack Obama in 2012. Could the NSA see a picture of, say, Oliver’s privates under this provision, he asked? "Yes," Snowden said, "the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which section 702 falls under, allows the bulk collection of internet communications that are one-end foreign." After an Oliver joke about "bulk collection," Snowden continued, "So if you have your email somewhere like Gmail, hosted on a server overseas or transferred overseas or anytime crosses outside the borders of the United States, your junk ends up in the database." Oliver jumped in and asked Snowden to clarify that the racy picture — if you’ve seen the interview, you know we’re paraphrasing — wouldn’t necessarily have to be sent to Germany in order to end up in NSA storage. "No," Snowden said. "Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database." Is it really true that this situation (regardless of the content of the email) could happen, and if so, is it likely? You’ve got mail … being collected by the NSA Several experts in national security law agreed Snowden’s scenario is plausible, thanks to holes in international surveillance laws that affect data shared between Americans living in America. The law that Oliver mentioned, Section 702 of FISA Amendments Act of 2008, is labeled "Procedures For Targeting Certain Persons Outside The United States Other Than United States Persons." Going on name alone, that sounds like the opposite of a license for the NSA to collect private messages between Americans. Not necessarily. The section addresses spying on communications on U.S. soil in which one end of the conversation is foreign. Critics, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Center for Technology and Democracy, and American Civil Liberties Union, deem it a "backdoor search loophole" that allows the NSA to get access to information on U.S. citizens. The section says the government cannot "intentionally target" citizens of the United States with its surveillance, nor can it target a person outside the country to learn more about the communications of a person who is in the United States. "Intentionally," obviously, is a pretty big gap. NSA communications spying under Section 702 does not need an individual warrant. There are a few government spying programs that we know about, through Snowden’s leaks to journalists, that operate using Section 702, including Prism and Upstream. Prism, as outlined in a leaked slide, allows the NSA to collect via court order email, chats, videos, photos, stored data and files of foreign targets from technology companies such as Google, Apple, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Analysts reportedly use Prism in concert with Upstream, by which the NSA collects foreigners’ communications directly from the fiber-optic backbone of the Internet. A leaked NSA slide reported by the Washington Post describes Upstream as amassing "communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past." Through those spying programs, it is possible that American-to-American email could hit an overseas server and be pulled into NSA databases even though those emails are not the target of NSA searches. The law does not prohibit this kind of "incidental" collection of Americans’ communications, as long as it was part of an otherwise valid collection of non-Americans’ information, said Stephen Vladeck, American University national security law professor. Government reports, leaks and a scathing 2011 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinion offer more proof that the NSA cannot separate out communications between Americans from the emails involving a foreigner. "NSA’s knowing acquisition of tens of thousands of wholly domestic communications through its Upstream collection is a cause of concern for the court," wrote FISC Judge John D. Bates in the declassified opinion. It’s unknown exactly how often this happens, but it does not appear unusual. "It doesn’t matter whether it’s a d--- pic or a bland email," said Andrew Crocker, a senior analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which sued the NSA to release the Bates opinion. "These are all things that can be swept up." By law, the NSA is supposed to "minimize" wholly domestic communications it obtains, said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor who represented the United States on terrorism-related matters before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court while working for the Justice Department. This could mean deleting the email or not searching or using the information, something Snowden doesn’t say. "I can’t promise the email wouldn’t end up in an NSA database," she said, "but it’s not going to be accessible to the government if it does." Other experts pointed out that we don’t know for sure what happens to these exchanges when they are collected. Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity fellow at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society, said many important features of Upstream collection "haven’t leaked and remain classified," such as whether it involves bulk collection, massive-but-targeted collection or only individually targeted collection, he said. Email routes that cross international boundaries So, yes, it’s possible that an email between you and your wife or husband about the grocery list could wind up in the hands of the NSA. But to do so, the electronic footprint of that email needs to leave the confines of the United States. How likely is that to happen? Understanding how or why an email may hit an overseas server even if it’s sent to someone in the same area requires a basic knowledge of how the Internet works. But even then, it’s complicated. So we turned to technologists, who had different opinions. Predicting how an email travels to its destination once you hit "send" is not an exact science — and it can change from hour to hour. When a person sends an email, it goes through the Internet service provider to an email provider, is exchanged with another provider, and goes back to someone else’s Internet service provider. If the Internet provider is big, like Verizon, the most efficient, least congested path to route the bits of information might just be a cable that crosses a foreign country’s boundary. Chats, pictures and messages travel from senders to recipients through the Internet along fiber-optic cables, some underground and some undersea. These cables can send messages in milliseconds. "The way the network thinks about distance is very different from the way you think about distance in the real physical world," said Joseph Hall, Center for Democracy and Technology chief technologist. Hall mentioned an example using the concept of "trombone routing:" Two people could be on opposite sides of Denver, and the most efficient way to get bits of information to them may be through a cable that runs through Canada. Mayer, of Stanford University, suggested the odds are good that your message is stored domestically if you’re an American who is working within the continental United States and who is using Gmail. Mayer called Snowden’s example of an intimate picture shared between a couple in New York hitting a London server en route to its destination "hypothetically possible, but it’s unlikely." The route between providers would have to be unusual, and the connection would have to be unencrypted, he said. "There are enormous privacy implications from the one-end foreign rule, to be clear," Mayer said. "I just don’t think this is a very generalizable example." On the other hand, Hall said, "It’s not hard to see this happening at all," even though more providers are encrypting their networks in response to NSA practices. Even though Hall and Mayer have different estimations for how likely it is for a U.S. user’s communications to be transmitted over a national border at a given time, Hall agrees it’s more likely for an email to cross a border in places that don’t have a huge infrastructure. Because Snowden mentioned Google’s Gmail service as an example, we checked in with the company to figure out under which conditions this example could happen. The company has strengthened the encryption of its infrastructure as a way to dissuade the government from using "backdoor" methods of tapping its network data without its knowledge. Emails between Gmail accounts are encrypted as they go to Gmail servers, which essentially means they look like gibberish to outsiders, and as they move from Google’s data centers around the country and the world. Copies of emails could be stored in several places, including in data centers abroad, as a way to provide backups in case one center fails. If the NSA tried to collect emails between Google data centers, they may be able to pull the metadata of messages (the to and from) but not the content. If one side of the exchange is not a Gmail user, the message may not be encrypted and therefore may be more vulnerable. As for how often an email may end up in a foreign server, even if it’s between two American Gmail users, spokesman Aaron Stein said, "We aren't always able to predict how often that happens." The NSA press office did not return requests for comment. Our ruling Snowden said, "Even if you sent it to someone within the United States, your wholly domestic communication between you and your wife can go to New York to London and back and get caught up in the database." In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen. But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out. Moreover, the NSA is supposed to "minimize" domestic emails that get caught up in a broader sweep, either by deleting them or not searching or using the information. Snowden’s claim is accurate but misses that context. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Edward Snowden	None	None	None	2015-04-09T17:31:28	2015-04-05	['London', 'New_York_City']
pomt-00287	Says Florida Gov. Rick Scott "subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/sep/28/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-cherry-picks-rick-scotts-education-fun/	U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson says that under Gov. Rick Scott’s leadership, Florida has fallen short on education funding. "Rick Scott subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools," Nelson’s campaign said in a September Facebook post on the page Not for Florida. A narrator in the attached video makes the timeframe a little more clear, saying "when Rick Scott became governor he subtracted more than $1 billion from local public schools." Beside the words "$1.3 billion" in Florida ink, there’s a citation for a 2013 PolitiFact fact-check. Scott, the Republican challenging Nelson in November, has defended his education funding record. We found Nelson is cherry-picking Scott’s record on education funding by zeroing in on his first year and ignoring the next several years. Education funding under Scott The video cites our fact-check of former Gov. Charlie Crist, who unsuccessfully sought his old job against Scott in 2014. Crist said Scott "cut education by $1.3 billion" — in his first year — which we rated Mostly True. Nelson’s ad focused on Scott’s budget but left out what happened with the next seven budgets Scott signed. As Scott approached his first legislative session in 2011, he unveiled a budget proposal at a tea party rally that included billions of dollars in spending cuts, including to education. The Republican-led Legislature backed some of those cuts. The $1.3 billion figure included the reduction in state money and the expiration of the federal stimulus funds, which was the largest chunk of the cut. By the end of his first year, Scott changed his tune on education funding. He called for a $1 billion boost to education. The K-12 budget has since risen every year of Scott’s tenure, whether we count total K-12 funds or only the state share. Scott’s spokesman pointed to the fact that the total state share of K-12 funds rose from $8.7 billion in his first year to $11.9 billion in 2018-19, an increase of $3.2 billion. Fiscal year Total K-12 state share Total K-12 funds K-12 enrollment Per-pupil spending 2007-08 $9.7 billion $18.7 billion 2.63 million $7,126 2008-09 $8.6 billion $17.9 billion 2.62 million $6,846 2009-10 $8.1 billion $18 billion 2.63 million $6,846 2010-11 $8.91 billion $18.2 billion 2.64 million $6,897 2011-12* $8.71 billion $16.6 billion 2.67 million $6,217 2012-13 $9.5 billion $17.2 billion 2.7 million $6,376 2013-14 $10.5 billion $18.3 billion 2.705 million $6,769 2014-15 $10.7 billion $18.9 billion 2.74 million $6,915 2015-16 $10.93 billion $19.7 billion 2.77 million $7,105 2016-17 $11.3 billion $20.2 billion 2.8 million $7,196 2017-18 $11.6 billion $20.6 billion 2.82 million $7,221 2018-19 $11.9 billion $21.1 billion 2.8 million $7,407 * Scott’s first budget. The $21.1 billion for K-12 schools approved earlier this year included an increase of about $485 million, including for school safety following the Parkland shooting. While Scott has promoted the increases each year, his critics have said that the state’s education budget is underfunded and pointed out that Florida ranks 41st in per student expenditures nationwide. As we’ve concluded in similar fact-checks, the state’s total K-12 education budget has increased in raw dollars every year for the last several years. However, adjusting for inflation, we found per-pupil spending is not as high as it was before the recession crippled state tax revenues. Our ruling Nelson’s campaign said in a Facebook post that "Rick Scott subtracted $1.3 billion from public schools." Nelson is repeating a familiar attack line against Scott, but this attack has become increasingly inaccurate as we get further away from Scott’s first year in office. Scott did oversee a $1.3 billion education cut, in 2011. Over the next seven years with Scott as governor, the education budget grew each year. That's severe cherry-picking. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06044	"In 1790, the first Congress, which was packed with framers, required all ship owners to provide medical insurance for seamen; in 1798, Congress also required seamen to buy hospital insurance for themselves. In 1792, Congress enacted a law mandating that all able-bodied citizens obtain a firearm."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/13/einer-elhauge/harvard-law-professor-says-early-congress-mandated/	One complaint about President Obama’s Affordable Care Act is that it forces uninsured people to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty -- an argument the Supreme Court will consider when it takes up challenges to the health-care law in oral arguments March 27 and 28. If the court upholds the act, critics argue, what's to stop Congress from forcing us to buy, say broccoli. Harvard Law School professor Einer Elhauge focused on that issue in a Jan. 5, 2012, commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine titled "The Irrelevance of the Broccoli Argument against the Insurance Mandate." Some people, he said, "argue that the Constitution's framers could not possibly have envisioned a congressional power to force purchases. However, in 1790, the first Congress, which was packed with framers, required all ship owners to provide medical insurance for seamen; in 1798, Congress also required seamen to buy hospital insurance for themselves. "In 1792, Congress enacted a law mandating that all able-bodied citizens obtain a firearm. This history negates any claim that forcing the purchase of insurance or other products is unprecedented or contrary to any possible intention of the framers." We wondered whether those early Congresses -- some of whose members helped draft the Constitution -- did indeed mandate health insurance and gun purchases. First, we wanted to see whether that first Congress was actually "packed with framers." Fifty-five men are considered the framers. During the first Congress in 1790, only 20 of the 91 senators and representatives were framers. That's not exactly packing them in. Then we contacted Elhauge about the other parts of his claim. He referred us to three pieces of legislation. First was the 1790 law, passed by that first Congress, which applied to any U.S. ship that was at least 150 tons or with a crew of at least 10. It required the master or commander to either have a supply of on-board medicines (with instructions) or provide "all such advice, medicine, or attendance of physicians, as any of the crew shall stand in need of in case of sickness" and do it "without any deduction from the wages of such sick seaman or mariner." Sounds like mandatory health care to us. Then, in 1792, a Congress that included 17 framers passed a law requiring nearly every "free able-bodied white male citizen" age 18 to 44, within six months, "provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges," along with balls and gunpowder. A rifle could be substituted. The purpose was to establish a uniform militia. Again, that sounds like a mandated purchase to us. Finally, in 1798, a Congress that included five framers expanded the health coverage mandate, requiring every ship owner or master coming into a port to pay 20 cents per seaman for every month each worker had been employed. The funds, which could be withheld from the seamen, were used "to provide for the temporary relief and maintenance of sick or disabled seamen, in the hospitals or other proper institutions now established" in the port. Leftover funds were used to create hospitals for those mariners. How did the framers vote on these laws? There was no roll call for the House and Senate bills requiring health care for seamen. But on the proposal mandating the purchase of musket, firelock or rifle as part of the larger bill to establish a uniform militia, 10 of the 14 framers whose votes were recorded endorsed the measure. One side note: In November 1792, an attempt was made in the House to reconsider the weapon requirement in the militia bill because some people were complaining that it was too onerous, an argument that echoes complaints from critics of the new health-care law. The proposal was defeated 6 to 50. The vote among framers was 1 to 6. It should also be noted that the president who signed the first two of these laws was our Founding Father-in-Chief, George Washington. Elhauge, in an e-mail, stood by his characterization that the first Congress was "packed" with framers, saying, "20 framers sounds pretty packed to me. There were only 55 delegates who attended the Constitutional Convention, so 20 is around 40 percent of all the framers present in that Congress." We disagree. The issue is not how many framers went to Congress, but how many members of Congress were framers. And you can't pack a meeting when you only account for 22 percent of the representatives. More importantly, he said, "I don’t think anyone objected to any of these laws on constitutional grounds, which presumably someone would have if it was obvious that the original understanding was that such an obligation would be unconstitutional." Our ruling Harvard Law professor Einer Elhauge said that early Congresses, particularly the first Congress, had no qualms about forcing purchases. Our research confirmed that. Congress required merchant ship owners to purchase medicines or provide health care for their workers. Seamen were later taxed to pay for what might be regarded today as an 18th-century health maintenance organization to provide for hospital care. And most able-bodied men were required to purchase weaponry for their service in the militia. Although he correctly characterized the laws, to say that the framers of the Constitution "packed" that first Congress is too much of a stretch. "Packed" means at least a majority; 22 percent is not a majority. For that reason, we rule his statement Mostly True. (An earlier version of this item incorrectly reported that Washington signed all three bills. John Adams, a founding father who was not a framer because he was in Europe when the U.S. Constitution was written, signed the 1798 legislation.) (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

If you discharge guns on a school yard, you can get out of jail free."	false	/california/statements/2016/oct/07/loretta-sanchez/loretta-sanchez-misleads-prop-57-claim/	Will felons convicted of drive-by shootings, giving guns to gangs or firing a weapon on a school yard "get out of jail free" if California’s Proposition 57 passes? That’s the provocative claim Orange County Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez made this week during a U.S. Senate campaign debate in Los Angeles. Sanchez is competing against fellow Democrat and front runner Attorney General Kamala Harris to succeed retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. "If you give guns to gangs, you can get out of jail free, if (Prop 57) passes. If you do a driveby shooting, you can get out of jail free, if this proposition passes. If you discharge guns on a school yard, you can get out of jail free," Sanchez claimed. Sanchez makes her claims about Prop 57 at the 28:30 mark in the video above. Sanchez opposes Prop 57, a measure on the November ballot that aims to reduce the state’s prison crowding by making some offenders eligible for early release. Harris has declined to take a position on Prop 57, or any ballot measure, because as attorney general she is charged with writing an independent summary and title for each measure. She has generally supported what she calls ‘smart on crime’ efforts to reduce incarceration. Looking at Sanchez’s claim, we wondered: Would offenders convicted of those gun crimes really benefit from Prop 57? We set out on a fact-check. Our research This measure is officially called the Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016. It would make some prisoners convicted of what state law deems ‘nonviolent crimes’ eligible for early parole. It does not apply to inmates convicted of the state’s 23 ‘violent’ offenses listed in Penal Code Section 667.5 (c) including murder, robbery and kidnapping. This is where Sanchez’s claim appears on target: None of the gun crimes she listed are among the 23 violent crimes, meaning offenders who committed them would be eligible for early release if Prop 57 passes, a Sanchez campaign spokesman said. Experts who have examined the measure agree offenders convicted of most crimes not among the 23 would be eligible, with certain exceptions. All sex offenders, for example, would be excluded from consideration under rules state prison officials say will be enacted if Prop 57 passes. Some sex offenses are now considered nonviolent. No getting ‘out of jail free’ Sanchez cited three gun crimes that could apply to Prop 57. But the next portion of her statement, saying a felon convicted of those crimes gets "out of jail free," is flat wrong and misleading. The measure does not apply to jail inmates and does not directly set anyone free. It would make some eligible for a parole board hearing, which in turn could lead to an early release, or not. "To suggest any presumption that they will be paroled is, I think, a far step," state Sen. Mark Leno, a supporter of the measure, was quoted in the Voice of San Diego in July. "I don’t want to overlook the fact that this is just about eligibility and there will be a consideration by the [parole board] of all the facts." The Voice of San Diego article pointed out that "the state parole board doesn’t grant release lightly. According to [the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation], out of 5,300 inmates up for parole in 2015, only 902, or 17 percent, were released." Sanchez’s campaign spokesman said her ‘get out of jail free’ comment "is a figure of speech because that is how it will feel to the victims. She has said that early release is wrong and disrespectful to the victims." Our ruling Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez claimed in a U.S. Senate campaign debtate that: "If you give guns to gangs, you can get out of jail free, if (California’s Prop 57) passes. If you do a driveby shooting, you can get out of jail free, if this proposition passes. If you discharge guns on a school yard, you can get out of jail free." Experts agree prisoners who committed crimes deemed ‘nonviolent’ under state law, including the three gun crimes Sanchez listed, could be eligible for early parole if Prop 57 passes. Becoming eligible for a parole board hearing is far from getting "out of jail free." Particularly when less than 20 percent of hearings lead to early release. Sanchez’s figure of speech -- which she employed three times -- greatly alters what otherwise might have been an accurate or mostly accurate statement. The "get out of jail free" comment is deceptive and distorts what Prop 57 proposes. We rate Sanchez’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-14899	"How many concerts would Taylor Swift have to perform to pay off one day of interest on our national debt? She would have to perform every day for three years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/06/republican-party-florida/it-would-take-taylor-swift-3-years-pay-one-days-de/	Pop superstar Taylor Swift is known for being generous to her fans. But is she charitable enough to help Washington pay interest on the national debt? The #squad at the Republican Party of Florida asked (and answered) the question with a viral image on their Facebook page on Oct. 29, 2015, the same week Swift was in the Sunshine State for concerts in Miami and Tampa. "How many concerts would Taylor Swift have to perform to pay off one day of interest on our national debt? She would have to perform every day for three years," the post read. We just couldn’t shake it off. We wondered, would it take three years or more for the biggest pop star in the country to pay off the interest on the national debt, playing a concert every single night? We checked to see if it would be possible, even in our wildest dreams. Because there’s no telling just how much Swift is personally raking in these days (beyond, you know, a lot), there’s going to be a lot of estimating here, possibly a blank space or two. But we do know the national debt is up over the $18 trillion mark these days, so she’s got her work cut out for her. Just so we didn’t cause any bad blood, we reached out to the state GOP and asked them how they were figuring Swift’s tour schedule through 2019. They credited the stat to the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. We noted the original version was slightly different: "How long would it take Taylor Swift to pay off our debt? Forbes estimates that T. Swift earned around $80 million in 2015 and performed 55 concerts. She would have to perform every day for three years to pay for one day of interest that accrued on our debt." They also point out how hard other big names would have to work, like boxer Floyd Mayweather having to fight for every night for 331 years or Bill Gates having to fork over 229 lifetimes’ worth of personal income to pay the same bill. The foundation told us they figured out Swift’s workload by calculating that she took home 28.6 percent of the gross receipts from her March 2013-June 2014 Red Tour, then stretched it out as if she played for 365 nights straight. That ends up being $526,000 per show, or $192 million for a whole year of Swift concerts (and a whole lot of Instagrams). So how much is the daily interest on our national debt? Heritage used the 2015 estimate for interest from the Office of Management and Budget, which was $229.2 billion for the year. One day of that is $628 million. Break that down and Swift would have to play every night for just more than 3¼ years to pay for one measly day of interest on an $18 trillion debt. Now, the Heritage Foundation told us they used the Red Tour because it has a full net estimate. But we here at PolitiFact Florida always like to note when everything has changed. Swift is a megawatt star these days, and she has been practically printing money since this year’s 1989 World Tour began. The tour topped $185 million between May and mid October. That’s about about 60 shows, give or take, with 20-plus to go until Swift can take a breather. Forbes and Billboard do generally use a third of gross receipts as a rough guideline — remember, those tours have to pay for all sorts of things besides the artist, like sets and costumes and roadies. The $80 million Forbes estimate for June 2014-June 2015 is hard to parse, because it includes all income, which could range from t-shirts to albums to streaming royalties. We’ll note it’s really not possible to say what she makes from any given show, because every venue is different. The tour stood to make $2.75 million from her Halloween show in Tampa, with a $928,000 bonus if the show sold out. (We can’t confirm whether it did, but reports make it sound like it came close.) In any case, we figure these days it's fair to say Tay Tay is worth closer to a very rough average of $1 million per show, especially when she's playing bigger arenas. That would really help her put a dent in the nation’s outstanding bills. We could also cheat with some creative bookkeeping and use data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which puts 2015 debt interest at a slightly lower $223.3 billion. That works out to $612 million per day. Do the simple math and our estimate knocks Swift’s theoretical slate of shows down to about 612 nights. That’s a little over 1½ years of concerts. But there’s always the chance she wouldn’t want to fork over all her earnings for the interest payments. She could use a little walking around money, you know? Also, she needs a little time to go home to cats Meredith Grey and Olivia Benson. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida asked, "How many concerts would Taylor Swift have to perform to pay off one day of interest on our national debt? She would have to perform every day for three years." This viral image was inspired by the Heritage Foundation, and while their math is based on old estimates, it stands up to scrutiny. We’ll note that Swift likely makes a lot more money these days, so she could probably pay the bill faster. But the point that it would take an inordinate amount of time to pay just a single day’s interest on the $18 trillion-plus national debt stands. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02901	"What we said was, you can keep (your plan) if it hasn’t changed since the law passed."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-what-hed-said-was-you-could-keep/	President Barack Obama’s attempt at explanation has only fanned the flames of controversy over his campaign line, "If you like your health care, you can keep it." Obama was already dealing with a troubled rollout of the healthcare.gov website when reports of health insurance cancellation notices for many Americans started arriving. Such notices have been common only for people purchasing insurance on the individual market, which accounts for about 5 percent of Americans, a small minority. But the existence of people in that situation struck many critics as contradicting his like-it, keep-it promise on its face. Obama’s speech on Nov. 4, 2013, at a meeting of Organizing for Action, his campaign organization, seemed to offer a new, and confusing, wrinkle. "Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed," Obama said. The way we read that comment -- and, judging by the contentious White House press briefing the following day, the way other Washington journalists read it -- was that Obama was saying that people had been misreporting the pledge he had made. It wasn’t that he said "if you like your plan, you can keep it" -- it was "if your plan hasn’t changed since the law passed," you can keep it. We wondered whether there was any evidence that Obama had used this particular caveat in the past. Some background on "grandfathering" First, a brief reminder of why some Americans are getting cancellation notices. Under the new law, policies must cover a comprehensive set of benefits, including emergency care, maternity care, mental health or prescription drugs. If they don’t, they can be "grandfathered" in, but only if the plans have not been changed at all. To be grandfathered, the plans must have operated continuously since before the law’s enactment in 2010 and have made no significant changes. This means the insurer can keep the insurance plan essentially as is, without having to implement many (though not all) of the new law’s requirements. But the regulations defining what constitutes a significant change are tight -- and if it’s breached, the plan is on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policy holders 90 days notice, as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering. That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders are receiving in the mail. We should note that Obama’s comments often were aimed at the general public. And most people do get to keep their health plans under his law, especially those who get insurance through work or Medicare. His plan specifically left the existing health care system in place while reducing the ranks of the uninsured. Here at PolitiFact, we noticed last year that Obama’s comments were too sweeping and that it was unlikely that all Americans would be able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. Obama’s comments before the law passed We decided to look back from all the public statements we could find about people being allowed to keep their plans. We found at least 37 times where Obama made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it. (See all 37 mentions.) Obama used the phrase 26 times between his inauguration and when the law passed. Here are four representative samples. • Town hall in Green Bay, Wis., June 11, 2009: "No matter how we reform health care, I intend to keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you'll be able to keep your doctor; if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan." • Remarks at the American Medical Association, June 15, 2009: "I know that there are millions of Americans who are content with their health care coverage -- they like their plan and, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor. They trust you. And that means that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what." • Presidential weekly address, July 18, 2009: "Michelle and I don’t want anyone telling us who our family’s doctor should be – and no one should decide that for you either. Under our proposals, if you like your doctor, you keep your doctor. If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance. Period, end of story." • Remarks in Fairfax, Va., March 19, 2010: "If you like your doctor, you’re going to be able to keep your doctor. If you like your plan, keep your plan. I don’t believe we should give government or the insurance companies more control over health care in America. I think it’s time to give you, the American people, more control over your health." Obama’s comments after the law was signed We found 10 instances after the law was signed when Obama made the pledge again. In remarks in Portland, Maine, on April 1, 2010, Obama said that "if Americans like their doctor, they will keep their doctor. And if you like your insurance plan, you will keep it. No one will be able to take that away from you. It hasn’t happened yet. It won’t happen in the future." After the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations for the law on June 14, 2010, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius blogged: "The bottom line is that under the Affordable Care Act, if you like your doctor and plan, you can keep them." Obama then repeated the remarks during several campaign events in 2012, as well as at the first presidential debate in Denver on Oct. 3, 2012: "If you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around." Finally, as recently as a few weeks ago, Obama was playing down the impact. "Now, let’s start with the fact that even before the Affordable Care Act fully takes effect, about 85 percent of Americans already have health insurance -– either through their job, or through Medicare, or through the individual market," he said in a speech in Largo, Md., on Sept. 26. "So if you’re one of these folks, it’s reasonable that you might worry whether health care reform is going to create changes that are a problem for you -- especially when you’re bombarded with all sorts of fear-mongering. So the first thing you need to know is this: If you already have health care, you don’t have to do anything." Overall, we didn’t find one instance in which Obama offered a caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn’t changed after the law’s passage. What the White House says The day after Obama claimed that he’d said "you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed," reporters grilled White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Carney claimed Obama was referring to the rules that Sebelius issued in June 2010. "When the rule was issued, Secretary Sebelius and others spoke to the press about it … if insurance companies changed their plans or canceled their plans, they would give up the opportunity to grandfather those plans in June of 2010. There was a fair amount of coverage of that in major newspapers." The White House pointed us to a June 14, 2010, telephone news conference with Sebelius on the rules. "If you have a plan that you like, you keep it, but if indeed insurers or employers decide to make dramatic shifts, to the detriment of employees, huge cost shifts, huge increases in deductibles, slashing benefits, whatever, they then no longer qualify for the grandfather status, because that's really a change in the plan, and that isn't a plan that most people like very much," she said. The White House also offered several news articles published at the time that reported Sebelius’ comments. Of these, the one that offered the most critical assessment of the grandfather provisions, in the Washington Post, got most of its ammunition from Republicans, quoting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying on the Senate floor, "This is not only bad news for the vast majority of Americans who like the plans they have. It also flatly contradicts the president's repeated promises." By contrast, what Sebelius told the Post focused on the positive rather than the negative aspects of the change. She said Obama "wanted to make sure as much as possible that if people had plans that they liked they got to keep them and balance that with, you know, some overall protection for consumers," the Post reported. Finally, the White House provided a series of other comments in which the administration offered a more nuanced formulation of the like-it, keep-it policy, but they were all in the past month, during the time when such criticism was already emerging. Our ruling According to Obama, "What we said was you can keep (your plan) if it hasn’t changed since the law passed." But we found at least 37 times since Obama’s inauguration where he or a top administration official made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it, and we never found an instance in which he offered the caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn’t changed after the law’s passage. And seven of those 37 cases came after the release of the HHS regulations that defined the "grandfathering" process, when the impact would be clear. While Sebelius’ teleconference with reporters did provide that sort of caveat, in other instances, such as her blog post, she focused on the upside, not the downside. Her one mention of the extent to which grandfathered plans might be doomed strikes us as the equivalent of the fine print on a television commercial running in heavy rotation. Obama is ignoring the overwhelming majority of times he addressed the issue, where most people would have heard it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

An April 14, 2017, post on known fake news site USPOLN.com ran under the headline, "Fox News Sandra Smith: ‘Everybody could see from the United Airlines passenger’s behavior that he was not a genuine American.’" The story referred to United’s April 10 forcible removal of David Dao off a flight from Chicago to Louisville, Ky. The article was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake stories from news feeds. Smith and Geraldo Rivera did discuss the issue during a panel on Fox News on April 12. But beyond the initial quotes about Rivera hating airlines and Smith suggesting United faced too much regulation, the story is completely made up. According to the story, Smith began ranting about how airlines were over-regulated and how Dao’s East Asian racial background rightfully made other passengers nervous in a post-Sept. 11 world. "That goes especially in a situation in which the passenger in question was not a genuine American," Smith was falsely quoted as saying. "As a matter of fact, if you take a look at the video of what happened on the plane, it’s obvious that his behavior suggests that he’s from another part of the world, and that’s that." There’s more to the story, but it’s so ridiculous we’ll stop there. The privately registered USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) said in its About Us link that it is a "hybrid News/Satire platform to provide the latest and breaking news for for Political, Government, Cultural, and Religion news." Not only that, but the post links to the original source of the article, a website called Politicass.com, which posted the story on April 12. Politicass.com is part of the Newslo.com family of parody sites. Newslo.com, and refers to itself in a disclaimer as "the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web." The Newslo.com site is registered to an administrator named Eli Sompo, at an address in Greece, while Politicass.com is registered in Israel. What makes Newslo.com-related stories especially confusing is that they use a small piece of real news or quotes by real people and build fake stories around them. They feature a pair of buttons that allow readers to highlight the true parts of their stories, so readers can conceivably know the difference. But on other sites without the buttons, there’s no way to know. USPOLN.com used an already fake story from Politicass.com and removed the only indication the post was fake.

pomt-07538	"Corporate taxes will soon be the highest in the industrialized world."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/04/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-united-states-will-soon-have-/	Corporate taxes aren’t a topic to raise the heart-rate, unless you’re the one paying them. But this particular fact-check about corporate tax burdens needs a footnote because of changes brought by an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. It starts with a Wall Street Journal op-ed. In March, as Congress confronted a rapidly approaching federal debt limit, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., argued for tax reform, among other changes to federal policy. In an op-ed article on March 30, 2011, he said, "Our generation’s greatest challenge is an economy that isn’t growing, alongside a national debt that is." On his short-list of ways the United States inhibits business growth: high corporate taxes. "Current federal policies make it harder for job creators to start and grow businesses," Rubio wrote. "Taxes on individuals are complicated and set to rise in less than two years. Corporate taxes will soon be the highest in the industrialized world. Federal agencies torment job creators with an endless string of rules and regulations." It’s not the first time we’ve heard a claim about America's high corporate taxes, but we thought this one was worth a closer look: What’s about to change? And what did Rubio mean by "corporate taxes"? We asked Rubio’s office for evidence for his statement. Alex Burgos, his director of media affairs, provided a link to a Daily Caller story that declared "America to have the highest corporate tax rate in April." It reported that, according to the Tax Foundation, Japan’s corporate tax rate leads the industrialized world, with a combined state and federal rate of 39.5 percent. No. 2, by less than a percentage point? The United States, with a combined rate of 39.2 percent. But Japan, it reported, planned to lower its rate in April, leaving America "the corporate tax leader in the developed world." So far, so good, right? The tax rates reported by the Daily Caller are easy to confirm. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development publishes the combined rates of its member countries, about 30 large, industrialized nations. The most recent indeed shows Japan on top at 39.54 percent vs. 39.21 percent for the United States. Meanwhile, PolitiFact has previously cited a news item about Japan’s plan to cut its corporate tax rate by 5 percentage points, which, with parliamentary approval, was to take effect for the year starting April 1, 2011. It looks like Rubio’s on solid ground here. But are tax rates the whole story? After all, Rubio didn’t say "corporate tax rates," as Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said on Jan. 2, 2011. He said "corporate taxes." His spokesman said he uses the phrases interchangeably. But what would a typical reader think he meant? We started by asking Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, since his study was the one cited by the Daily Caller article provided by Rubio’s team "I think most readers understood that he meant rates, although if you really want to split hairs, I suppose he could have been more grammatically correct by specifically referring to corporate tax rates. In general discourse, most people understand that higher taxes mean higher rates," he said. But there are at least three ways to compare corporate taxes, said Bob Williams, senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. One of them — the share of GDP claimed by tax or other measures of how much revenue is collected — depends too much on the size of the corporate tax base to allow valid cross-country comparisons, he said. Another is to compare statutory rates, such as those reported by OECD. But statutory rates aren’t a good indicator of the amount of tax companies pay, according to the World Bank report, "Paying Taxes 2011: The global picture." (Consider, for example, a recent New York Times report that General Electric managed to escape paying any U.S. tax at all in 2010.) To compare what companies actually pay country by country, Williams recommends looking at the effective tax rate. "It measures what I think most people consider when they think about the level of taxes. … It’s not the rate that matters, it’s the amount of tax you pay that you care about." How would Rubio’s statement measure up when you consider what companies actually pay in corporate income tax? Hodge said the situation is exactly the same, citing a recent paper by professors Kevin Markle and Douglas Shackelford of Dartmouth and the University of North Carolina that examined financial statements for more than 11,000 corporations from 82 countries from 1988 to 2009: "They find that the U.S. has the second-highest effective tax rate among major industrialized countries. Like the statutory rate, only Japan has a higher effective rate." Indeed, the paper, "Cross-Country Comparisons of Corporate Income Taxes," finds multinational corporations in Japan face the highest effective tax rates, followed by the United States, France and Germany. Further, the authors find that although effective tax rates have declined worldwide over the last two decades — "most notably in Japan" — the rank from high-tax countries to low-tax countries has changed little. The effective tax rates are lower than the statutory rates: In the United States, the median effective tax rate is 25 percent for domestic companies and 30 percent for multinationals, far below the 39 percent statutory rate. But in Japan, domestic companies pay a median 41 percent and multinationals pay 37 percent, not far off its rounded 40 percent statutory rate. So it’s an open question whether a 5-percentage-point cut by Japan would pull its effective tax rates below the United States’ — the U.S. effective rates are more than 5 percentage points lower. That would point to a less-than-true rating for Rubio’s statement. There’s yet another measure to consider when it comes to corporate taxes, and that’s businesses’ tax burden beyond just income tax. Remember that World Bank study, "Paying Taxes 2011: The global picture"? On pages 98-100, it lists something it calls the "total tax rate" for more than 180 counties. The rate includes all taxes that might be borne by a standard firm with 60 employees in a given year: profit taxes, labor taxes and others. Why is the total tax rate interesting? The World Bank points out that corporate income tax is only part of the burden of taxes on business. Around the world, corporate income tax accounts for 38 percent of the total tax rate. We figured if Rubio is concerned about the burden on job creators, he would be interested in companies’ total tax burden. And here, the U.S. rank improves compared with other industrialized countries. If we highlight just the 34 OECD nations among those studied by the World Bank, the United States sits at 16th: Italy, France, Belgium, Spain, Austria, Sweden, Hungary, Mexico, Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Japan, Germany, Australia and Greece all have higher total tax rates than the U.S. rate of 46.8 percent. No. 12 Japan has a 48.6 percent total tax rate. Now, there’s more to the Japan story. Yes, the country planned a rate cut that would vault the United States to the top of the statutory rate heap. But on March 11, 2011, the nation suffered a catastrophic earthquake, tsunami and resulting nuclear crisis. And in the wake of the disaster, in turns out, government and business leaders have started to back off tax-cut plans as they debate how to pay for rebuilding. The week after Rubio submitted his op-ed, headlines said a Japan tax increase was unavoidable, and that the nation was weighing scrapping the corporate tax cut all together. In fairness, we only consider a statement’s truthfulness based on information available at the time, so we won’t count the changes in Japanese policy against Rubio. But it’s interesting to note that around the same time Rubio’s op-ed published, a major factor behind his claim shifted. Said Hodge: "By many accounts, they may postpone the rate cut. We will have to see." Where does that leave us? If most people think of tax "rates" when they hear a claim about "corporate taxes," Rubio was right. The United States ranked second just to Japan, and Japan planned to cut its own rate as early as April 1. Even a look at "effective tax rates" -- what corporations actually pay -- partly supports Rubio’s claim. The United States again came in behind just Japan. By a wider measure, the total tax rate calculated by the World Bank, Rubio’s not even close. And we think it’s a fair bet some readers would assume from Rubio’s statement that American corporations would soon face the world’s highest tax burden — rather than simply face the world’s highest corporate income tax rate. But since the total tax rate goes beyond income taxes to include other taxes, it doesn’t seem fair to weigh this measure as heavily against Rubio’s statement.

pomt-02492	Says "(President) Reagan's second inaugural was moved inside the Capitol. It was. Because of a terrible snowstorm."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/16/peggy-noonan/noonan-reagans-second-swearing-was-held-inside-cap/	That big dump of snow that hit the East Coast this week put the Sunday talk shows in a weather state of mind -- that and President Barack Obama linking extreme events to climate change when he spoke in California. The serious side got an airing in a discussion on ABC’s This Week, but so did the trivial. Host George Stephanopoulos gave the show’s panel of pundits a pop quiz. The question: "Which president's inauguration was held in the Senate chambers because of a blizzard?" (A blizzard means sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles an hour or greater and considerable falling and/or blowing snow.) Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan and ABC's Jonathan Karl both answered Ronald Reagan, while Fusion's Alicia Menendez and The Nation's Katrina vanden Heuvel had no answer. "Reagan was very cold but that wasn't the one -- William Howard Taft," Stephanopoulos said. While Menendez said that was going to be her guess, Noonan wanted to stick her answer. "Reagan's second inaugural was moved inside the Capitol. It was. Because of a terrible snowstorm," Noonan said. "PolitiFact time," vanden Heuvel jumped in. How could we not leap to respond? Our source is the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a body that since 1901 has planned and run the swearing-in ceremonies for each president. The committee’s website is testimony that there’s a place for everything on the Internet; the site includes its own tab just for weather. For the curious, it was clear and cool when George Washington took the oath of office in New York City in April 1789. To Noonan’s assertion, Reagan’s second oath of office in 1985 took place in the Capitol rotunda. She was wrong about the snowstorm but she certainly knew that the event was held inside. According to the congressional committee, event planners had good reason for the switch. "It was sunny, but bitter cold. Wind chill temperatures fell into the -10°F to -20°F range in the afternoon. Estimated noon temperature of 7°F." Actually, Reagan also took the oath the day before, on a Sunday, in the Grand Foyer of the the White House. Noonan might be expected to hold on to these details. She was one of Reagan’s main speechwriters. Stephanopoulos, meanwhile, was completely right about Taft. It was March 1909, and a blizzard forced the ceremony inside, and it was held in the Senate chamber. The storm dropped 10 inches of snow and packed winds that toppled trees and telephone poles. But while the swearing-in took place indoors, the parade still went on outdoors. "City workers shoveled sand and snow through half the night. It took 6,000 men and 500 wagons to clear 58,000 tons of snow and slush from the parade route," according to the committee website. By the way, that day Helen Herron Taft became the first First Lady to accompany the president on his ride back to the White House from the Capitol. Our ruling Noonan said Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration took place inside the Capitol due to a snowstorm. The day was clear, but she had the location largely correct. And if it wasn’t snowing, it was wicked cold. Whether it was a windchill of -20 degree Fahrenheit or a terrible snowstorm, we wouldn’t want to be out in it. We rate Noonan’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-11808	Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/16/duffel-blog/no-bowe-bergdahl-didnt-wander-during-court/	Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, held for about five years by the Taliban after disappearing in Afghanistan, has taken off again -- this time during his own court proceeding, says Duffel Blog. "Bowe Bergdahl wanders off during court-martial," said the October headline in Duffel Blog. Here’s the accurate backstory: Bergdahl walked off his remote post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban. The military searched for him, and officers were injured in the process. Bergdahl was freed by his captors in 2014. In return, the United States agreed to turn over five Taliban officials being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison to the country of Qatar. President Barack Obama’s controversial decision to exchange Bergdahl angered many Republicans, including then-candidate Donald Trump. The Duffel Blog says that Bergdahl now has walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing, prompting a statewide manhunt. "Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyer’s remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal," states the article. He left behind a note, the blog says: "Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others. I am ashamed to even be an American (deserter)." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This story is fake. The article then becomes more ridiculous. It says that a few military personnel were injured in the manhunt and that "ISIS and Al Qaida have both claimed responsibility for the casualties, though their claims have yet to be verified." The Pentagon offered a reward for information about Bergdahl’s whereabouts: "$25,000 or seven Guantanamo detainees, depending on the credibility of the information." "Officials are warning the public that if they see Bergdahl, they should not attempt to approach him, since he may try to surrender and become their responsibility for the next five years," states the blog. The article linked to an Oct. 12 Washington Post story previewing an upcoming hearing for Bergdahl. Multiple news outlets including the AP reported that Bergdahl entered a plea of guilty during the Oct. 16 hearing at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He didn’t wander off during his hearing. "I understand that leaving was against the law," Bergdahl testified. On Nov. 3, a military judge ordered that Bergdahl receive a dishonorable discharge from the U.S. Army and reduced his rank from sergeant to private. The Duffel Blog calls itself "the American military’s Most Trusted news source" but readers will have to find the disclaimer to learn this is fake news. "We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet," states the disclaimer. "Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization.

pomt-07654	"Democrats have now become the party of the [Atlanta] metro area and of blacks."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/14/alan-powell/georgia-lawmaker-says-white-rural-democrats-are-th/	The Democratic Party dominated Southern politics from the post-Civil War era through Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and decades beyond. But the debate over civil rights issues, the scope of government and other matters ignited a transformation that has left much of the South in GOP control in recent years. Some Georgia politicians, such as state Rep. Alan Powell of Hartwell, have abruptly switched teams, sensing the political winds have shifted. Powell bolted to the Republican Party just days after being re-elected in November to the Georgia House of Representatives as a veteran Democrat. Powell told the Washington news publication Politico: "Democrats have now become the party of the metro area and of blacks. That’s not to be derogatory. It’s just what it is." In an interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Powell said he was pointing to the metro areas throughout Georgia and not just the Atlanta metro area when he used that geographical designation. True, Democrats no longer dominate as they did during Reconstruction and the Great Depression. But has it gotten as bad for the party of Tennessee’s Andrew Jackson and Texan Lyndon B. Johnson as Powell said? Powell told PolitiFact Georgia that he saw the metro areas of Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon and Savannah as the only places where Democrats can win elections. "Just about everywhere else Democrats have ceased to exist," he said. "What you have now is a reversal of what you had 20 years ago." Charles S. Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia who specializes in elections, said Powell’s statement "captures the truth in broad strokes." Bullock points out that of 20 Democratic state senators, 13 are African-Americans and six are from metro Atlanta. Sen. George Hooks of Americus is the only white state senator who still represents a rural district in Georgia. Of the 63 Democrats in the state House of Representatives, five are whites from rural districts. They are Rep. Debbie Buckner of Junction City, Rep. Rick Crawford of Cedartown, Rep. Carol Fullerton of Albany, Rep. Sistie Hudson of Sparta and Rep. Barbara Massey Reece of Menlo. This is a stark change from 1971, when there were no women in the state Legislature, two African-Americans and a handful of Republicans, Bullock said. "The trend of the prototypical Georgia Legislature -- white, rural, male, Democrat -- is not extinct, but it’s on the endangered species list," Bullock said. Democratic Party spokesman Eric Gray said he never thought about the fact that the state Senate has only one white Democratic senator from a rural district. Even so, he disputed to a mild degree the idea that Democrats can only compete in metro districts and disparaged even bringing up the notion that Democrats are the party of "blacks." "We have Democrats, [sheriffs and county commissioners], throughout the state," Gray said. "I will acknowledge many of our Democrats are clustered around the larger cities and I think that proves it’s not just Atlanta, but as far as his racial assertion, I’m not going to get into that. As a state we should get away from that. It’s past time to stop judging people by skin color." But Powell’s statement seems less a judgment of the electorate based on the color of their skin than on the content of their ballot boxes. Statistics show he has a point. Of the 395,300 residents who voted in the Democratic primary in July, 235,800, or 59 percent, were African-Americans, according to an analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution of election data provided by the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office. About 78,800 Democratic primary voters, or 20 percent, were whites from the metro areas referred to by Powell. About 77,900 rural whites, or roughly 20 percent, voted in the Democratic primary. So the Democrats are not completely devoid of white voters outside metro areas, but as Bullock alluded, the situation for the party is grim. That’s because the Democrats’ numbers are dwarfed by the Republican success in rural counties. There were 276,200 rural whites who voted in the Republican primary, more than 3 1/2 times the number of rural whites who voted in the Democratic primary. Even more true than Powell’s assertion that the Democratic Party is the party of metro areas and blacks is that the Republican Party is the party of whites. Of 680,000 Republican primary voters in 2010, 666,800, or 98 percent, were white. About 3,000 African-Americans voted in the Republican primary. Emory University political science professor Merle Black said African-Americans and whites and metro residents and rural residents have different perspectives on many contentious issues, such as the scope of government services and taxes, so it makes sense that they would find themselves on the opposite side of the political aisle. Black said this change has been a long time coming. "What we’ve seen is a realignment from the top down," he said. "It started in the presidential elections and the Senate and the House and now the state government." Rural white Democrats do exist. About 78,000 participated in the Georgia primary last year, and there are six in the Georgia Legislature. But when compared with the hundreds of thousands of rural Republican voters, rural white Democrats seem to have much in common with the panda and the gray wolf -- their range is restricted and their numbers are thin. We conclude that Powell was correct in that the vast majority of Democratic voters are African-Americans or whites from metro areas. He did have to clarify his position by saying he meant to include major metro areas outside of Atlanta. We rate his statement as Mostly True.

ranz-00012	There's an $11.7 billion hole in Labour's budget	fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201857321/fact-or-fiction-fiscal-holes-and-child-poverty	National has taken issue with Labour's alternative budget on several counts, but the biggest and most important is that Labour has not included the extra money it wants to spend in its operating allowance in subsequent years. Steven Joyce claims this is where most of the gap comes from. Several economists have roundly rejected National's claims. Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson (left) and leader Andrew Little, at the party's launch of its budget plan. Labour finance spokesperson Grant Robertson with the party's budget plan Photo: RNZ / Jane Patterson Economic commentator Brian Fallow has told Checkpoint with John Campbell that the disagreement over the figures is a matter of interpretation. National's budget includes an $11.7bn operating allowance (essentially, a slush fund of unallocated spending). Labour's is just $4.5bn - but that doesn't mean $7bn has disappeared, Fallow says. Instead, Labour has allocated that money to the budget lines it intends to spend it on - mostly health, education, and increased paid parental leave and other provisions in its Families Package. Total Crown operating expenses are $440bn in National's budget and $448bn in Labour's budget - and the $8bn difference is mostly covered by the $7.4bn Labour gets by cancelling National's planned tax cuts. BERL chief economist Ganesh Nana - whose organisation reviewed Labour's alternative budget - agrees with Fallow's assessment. It is different to the way the National-led government treated the operating allowance, but it is not wrong or a mistake, Nana says: "From an accountant's perspective it makes sense."

pomt-13296	Says after Hillary Clinton helped a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, "she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/trump-says-clinton-laughed-about-rape-case/	Donald Trump offered a confusing mashup of unsavory accusations during Sunday night's presidential debate as he lumped allegations against Bill Clinton with a claim about Hillary Clinton's attitude when she discussed her defense of a man accused of raping a child in 1975. Trump, asked about his offensive comments while taping a segment of Access Hollywood more than a decade ago, said, "If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women." Trump continued: "Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight." The alleged rape of a 12-year-old had nothing to do with Bill Clinton. Trump was suddenly, and without explanation, shifting gears to Hillary Clinton's successful defense of the alleged rapist after she was reluctantly assigned to the case. That's the part of Trump's claim we'll fact-check here. At the time, Clinton, 27, was working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. The accused man was indigent and specifically asked for a woman to represent him. He ultimately pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a minor, receiving a year in jail and four years' probation. When we asked the Trump campaign about the allegations, a spokesman referred us to a July 15, 2014, article in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, which uncovered audio recordings of Clinton, although it's not clear when the recordings were made. The Beacon says they date from 1983 to 1987. In the tapes, she calls it a "terrible case" and "a fascinating case," for reasons that will become clear. The article notes that she can be heard laughing at several points on the tape, but it doesn't say she was laughing at the victim, as Trump claims. She is "discussing the crime lab’s accidental destruction of DNA evidence that tied (the accused man, Thomas Alfred) Taylor to the crime," destruction that led the prosecution to seek a plea deal on a lesser charge, according to the article. ​(For the record, DNA testing as we know it was years away, but labs did determine blood type in criminal cases in that era.) "I plea bargained it down because it turned out they didn't have any evidence," Clinton says. In the tape, available on YouTube, Clinton says of the case, "It's sad." "But you know what was sad about it was that the prosecutor had evidence," Clinton says. However, she recounts that the crime lab had taken a key piece of evidence — the accused man's underpants, which had blood on it — neatly cut out a piece, and then threw that piece away once testing was done, eliminating the ability to do independent testing. In this case, it's the interviewer, Arkansas journalist Roy Reed, who can be heard laughing, not Clinton. On the tape, in which Reed laughs a few more times at her story, Clinton can be heard chortling when she reports that the prosecutor didn't want her to see the underwear before it was presented at trial. Defense attorneys have the right to see all the evidence first. And when the judge is considering the plea deal, Clinton recounts that the judge wanted her to leave the room while he talked to the accused man. Clinton says she told the judge, "Judge, I can't leave the room. I'm his lawyer." The judge reportedly responded, "I know, but I don't want to talk about this in front of you." Again, Reed can be heard laughing after saying, "Oh God. Really?" It's not clear if Clinton is laughing as well. At another point, Clinton says of the accused man, "I had him take a polygraph, which he passed — which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs." She and the reporter laugh. And she laughs when she recalls telling the prosecution that she was prepared to bring in a top expert witness to testify "to prevent this miscarriage of justice." The reporter laughs as well. It should be noted that it's clear from the record that Clinton aggressively defended the man and did file motions questioning the victim's credibility. But there is no evidence, including this audio tape, that Clinton or Reed were laughing at the victim. Our ruling Trump said after Clinton helped a man accused of raping a 12-year-old, "she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped." Trump is referring to an audio tape in which she does respond with amusement at her recollections of the oddities of the case, which involve the prosecution and the judge. At no point does she laugh at the victim. We rate his claim False. CORRECTION, Oct. 18, 2016: This story was amended to note that the blood test referenced in the Washington Free Beacon story could not have been a true DNA match test. That technology was not available in 1975. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-10T00:49:26	2016-10-09	['None']
pomt-08669	Federal stimulus money went to a Georgia Tech project that will "apparently involve the professor jamming with 'world-renowned musicians' to 'hopefully also create satisfying works of art.'"	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/13/john-mccain/report-says-georgia-tech-professor-apparently-gets/	A Georgia Tech project funded with stimulus dollars gave two U.S. senators a case of the government spending blues. The "Summertime Blues" report issued by U.S. Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that the federal government gave more than $760,000 worth of stimulus funds to a Georgia Tech professor so he can play tunes with top musicians as part of a research project on creativity. The project, which the report dubs "Jamming for Dollars," will "apparently involve the professor jamming with 'world-renowned musicians' to 'hopefully also create satisfying works of art,'" the report states. Feds spent three-quarters of a million dollars so a professor can rock out? We had to check this one out. "Summertime Blues" is a critique of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was passed to boost the slumping economy. More than a year later, the economy's still in the dumps. The report singles out 100 projects funded by the act that accomplish "questionable goals" or are "being mismanaged or were poorly planned." "The projects featured in the report cannot be considered as an investment in long-term priorities to create and sustain economic growth that the Stimulus was designed to do," a press release from McCain's office said. The "Jamming for Dollars" entry quotes directly from a summary of the grant proposal on Research.gov, a website that lists information on federal research grants: The project "seek[s] to understand, model, and support improvisation, or real-time collaborative creativity, in the context of jazz, Indian classical, and avantgarde art music," according to the project description. "They will also conduct systematic evaluation of formal models in realistic performance contexts, and use brain imaging of improvising musicians to gain insight into highly creative mental activity." To verify this description, we interviewed Parag Chordia, an assistant professor of music at Georgia Tech and one of four researchers with backgrounds in music and computer science leading the project. We also reviewed information from Georgia Tech and the National Science Foundation, or NSF, which approved the grant. The NSF is an independent federal agency that promotes science and engineering. In 2008, before the stimulus bill passed, the agency asked researchers to submit grant proposals for its CreativeIT program, which funds research in the study of creativity and computing. Agency officials think such research can transform the way we innovate and solve difficult, important problems. An independent panel of scientists reviewed the music improvisation proposal using criteria that include the qualifications of the researchers, how well the project is designed and whether it will break new ground. The three-year effort, which was launched last year, studies how the brain improvises music. The larger goal is to create computers that are more intelligent, or can do more thinking for themselves, Chordia said. How can studying music improvisation do that? If a jazz trumpeter wants to improvise a solo that will complement what the drummer, guitarist, bassist and other musicians that are backing her up are playing, she can't play arbitrary sounds. She has to choose those that match up with the music from her band. If a scientist figures out how to describe the choices available to the trumpeter through statistical models, he can tell a computer how to make those choices, too. In other words, the researcher can teach a computer how to think on its feet. Established musicians do play music as part of the research, but they're doing so while hooked up to machines that record brain waves and other neurological activity as they improvise and play written music, Chordia said. Researchers will also find statistical models that can tell a computer how to improvise and use them to create computer software that can help budding musicians learn improvisation skills. More than 40 percent of the $760,000 grant is paying for salaries and wages for senior personnel and five graduate students, plus graduate student tuition. The rest is for travel, materials, overhead and similar expenditures. In its first year, the research project led to the launch of Khush, a company that employs five people. It created a well-received music IPod app, LaDiDa. The app instantly creates a musical accompaniment to any ditty you sing into your iPod. So are Chordia and his fellow scientists "jamming for dollars"? If you mean using statistical models to develop computing technology that helps foster creativity and leads to new products, yes, Chordia said. "Am I going to get up on stage and have a jam session and bill the NSF $50,000? The answer is no," he added. McCain's office did not respond to a request for comment. AJC PolitiFact Georgia agrees with Chordia. Experienced musicians will perform, but taxpayers are not just paying a professor to partake in jam sessions. They're paying for a team of researchers to study brain activity and break ground in the fields of creativity and computing. The project was vetted by an independent panel of experts on its merit and quality. It resulted in the launch of a company that employs five people, and pays for the tuition and stipends of five graduate students. Since the report said the project will "apparently" involve the professor jamming with musicians, rather than stating it as an absolute fact, we'll grant Sens. McCain and Coburn a little leeway. But not much. We rate their claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04754	Says they said "it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit" and "we did it."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-he-balanced-budget-11-billion-/	Gov. Chris Christie said he faced down the impossible when he took office. The Republican governor told an audience at the Republican National Convention during his keynote address Tuesday night that despite the doubts of naysayers, he steered New Jersey off a path that "we could no longer afford to follow." "Now they said it was impossible this is what they told me to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in eight years. That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit. But three years later, we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes," Christie said. "We did it." Here, we’ll assess the governor’s claim that he balanced a budget with an $11 billion deficit. New Jersey’s Constitution requires a balanced budget every year. Christie has met that obligation in every budget year. The major flaw with the governor’s claim is that the deficit he cites never went away. And Christie now dismisses that deficit calculation as the "old way of budgeting." The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year, when Christie proposed his first spending plan. A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded. But the state does not have to meet all of its obligations since the budget supersedes statute. So although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise. And that’s largely what Christie did in his first budget. The governor skipped a $3.1 billion pension payment. He didn’t fully fund the school aid formula. He didn’t fully fund the state’s property tax rebate program. And the next budget year, the state still had a projected structural deficit. For the fiscal 2012 budget year, OLS projected a structural deficit of about $10.5 billion, nearly the same size as the previous fiscal year. But Christie then dismissed that calculation, calling it the "old way of budgeting." In a budget speech last year, Christie said the projected deficit "assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday’s New Jersey." Now, Christie said, "the baseline is zero" for budgeting. Our ruling Christie said naysayers said it was "impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit" and "we did it." The state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation. The deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie uses to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting. That’s important context Christie’s statement lacks. So, we rate this statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean."	false	/california/statements/2018/aug/06/donald-trump/california-wildfires-made-worse-hot-dry-conditions/	In his first tweet about this summer’s California wildfires, President Trump blamed environmental laws for making the blazes worse by preventing firefighters from using a "massive amount of readily available water." He said it’s "being diverted into the Pacific Ocean." The problem with that claim? The state’s firefighting agency said it’s had no complications accessing water, while fire experts said the state’s hot, dry and windy conditions are to blame for the infernos, not any water policy. Here’s what Trump tweeted on Aug. 5, 2018: With blazes continuing to ravage the state, we set out on a fact check. We focused on the first portion of the tweet about water policy. Our research Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told us, it’s the hot and dry conditions taking place earlier in the year that are leading to the extreme fires. "We have had no issues accessing water to fight the fires," McLean wrote in an email. "This year’s changing weather pattern is leading to more severe and destructive wildfires." Keith Gilless is a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. He said he believes Trump is conflating two very different issues. There’s long been a conflict between farmers and environmental groups over how much water should go to crops versus rivers and lakes. But that fight hasn’t had any effect on firefighting. "I think there’s some real confusion in the tweet," Gilless said. "The issues over the allocation of water between environmental and agricultural interests have nothing to do with firefighting. And I’m not aware of any situation in which those conflicts have restricted the availability of water for firefighting purposes." Heat, dry conditions blamed for fires Gilless said the reason California’s wildfires are so destructive this year is the state’s "high heat, low relative humidity, high wind speeds and high fuel loading." He said climate change is making these conditions more frequent. "California is going through a really heartbreaking fire season right now," he added. "Environmental laws about water have nothing to do with it from my perspective." Gilless said Trump’s language about water "being diverted into the Pacific Ocean," doesn’t make sense, as water naturally flows to the ocean. The argument about how much water should be captured before it gets to the ocean, again, is part of a different, unrelated debate. The second portion of Trump’s tweet, that California "Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!", is also confusing. Forestry experts say thinning trees is a well-established practice that can reduce the severity of fires. But clearing trees is more commonly associated with commercial logging practices, not fire management. Leroy Westerling, a UC Merced professor and wildfire specialist, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Trump’s tweet, "On the water side, it boggles the mind." The White House did not immediately respond to a request for evidence to support Trump’s tweet. A day before the tweet, the Trump administration approved California's request to declare a "major disaster" as the state continues to fight wildfires that have claimed at least nine lives. The declaration makes federal funds available to residents of Shasta County, where the Carr Fire outside Redding, California, has destroyed more than 1,000 homes. Our rating President Trump claimed in a tweet that California’s wildfires are "made so much worse by the bad environmental laws" which prevent firefighters from accessing water. He added in the tweet that water "is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean." Trump appears to have conflated the state’s real water controversy between farmers and environmentalists with the unrelated issue of firefighting. The state’s fire agency, CalFire, said it has not had problems accessing water. And fire experts said it’s the state’s hot and bone-dry conditions, not environmental laws, that are making blazes more extreme. We rated Trump’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-05782	"Our small staff of 51 is still fewer than we had a decade ago, yet our caseload -- like that of other courts -- has grown."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/27/carol-hunstein/georgias-top-court-doing-more-less-chief-justice-s/	Hear ye, hear ye, PolitiFact Georgia readers. Georgia’s chief justice recently gave state lawmakers some ideas to improve how the justice system works -- and we listened attentively. They included alternatives to warehousing nonviolent drug offenders in state prison, a recommendation to explore ways to reduce the number of Georgia’s youths committing serious crime and the need for more money to help some areas of the court system as its caseload increases. Justice Carol Hunstein talked about the caseload problem in her own court, the Georgia Supreme Court. "Our small staff of 51 is still fewer than we had a decade ago, yet our caseload -- like that of other courts -- has grown," Hunstein said in an address to the Georgia Legislature. PolitiFact Georgia was surprised to hear Hunstein say the court has fewer employees than a decade ago. We wanted to see whether the judge was right. First, is the Georgia Supreme Court staff smaller than it was a decade ago? Court spokeswoman Jane Hansen said the court had 57 employees in 2002. The staff reductions included some layoffs in the wake of the Great Recession and a couple of employees who retired and have not been replaced. The cuts included reporters of decision, the people who help the court’s seven judges write their opinions, as well as law clerks and an administrative assistant, Hansen said. For a while recently, the court had no one to answer the telephone and had to rely on unpaid staff to perform that duty, Hansen said. "Our budget was cut," she said. "We had cuts like other people did in the last few years." The current staff consists of the seven justices, two law clerks each for six of the justices (the chief justice has three clerks), an administrative assistant for each justice, eight workers in the clerk’s office, five reporters of decisions, two information technology workers, five central staff employees, the spokeswoman and a fiscal employee. So is the high court handling more cases? The Georgia Supreme Court processed 760 cases between Aug. 30, 2010, and Jan. 31, 2011, according to the report it sent PolitiFact Georgia. The court processed 898 cases between Aug. 30, 2011, and Jan. 31, 2012, according to another report the court sent us. PolitiFact Georgia also reviewed three years of data from the National Center for State Courts concerning the number of cases that came to the Georgia Supreme Court. The Virginia-based National Center for State Courts was founded in 1971 to advocate for state courts. Here are the annual totals: In 2007: 1,877 cases. In 2008: 1,979 cases. In 2009: 1,979 cases. In 2002, the Georgia Supreme Court reported a total of 1,872 cases to the NCSC. The numbers we’ve seen show the Georgia Supreme Court does have fewer employees than it did in 2002. We’ve seen data from the court and the NCSC that show a higher caseload. Our verdict is in. We rate Justice Hunstein’s claim as True.

pomt-13956	American colleges amount to a "cartel."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/16/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-american-colleges-amount-cartel/	Several years ago, the phrase "college cartel" was used to describe the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which critics said enabled collusion among athletic departments. Then the use of the phrase expanded to encompass colleges in general. A 2012 National Review article headlined "The College Cartel" argued the college accreditation process gives accredited schools a monopoly on higher education and weakens incentives for them to control tuition costs. Today, those who want to reform higher education voice the same concerns — and the phrase "college cartel" is a go-to soundbite. "Why don’t we break up the college cartel & let students try different options?" U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, tweeted on May 14, 2016. "Let's give students a choice." The tweet included a link to a video clip from a Ryan town hall meeting focused on millennials from the same day. Ryan has argued that reforms in the accreditation process — including the embrace of non-traditional teaching formats such as massive online open courses — could help lower tuition costs. "College cartel" makes for great alliteration. But how accurate is it as a description? Going to the dictionary When asked for evidence, Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana began by sharing a definition from the Collins Dictionary: "Cartel: a collusive . . . association of independent enterprises formed to monopolize production and distribution of a product or service, control prices, etc." The ellipses in the definition stood in for "international," a word that wouldn’t apply to this case. A second, broader definition in the same dictionary seemed to better match Ryan’s argument: "an alliance of parties or interests to further common aims." "The word ‘cartel’ in the tweet is a figure of speech," Martorana said, "referring to the fact that the federal government controls the supply of higher education through the accreditation process." Martorana noted that to qualify for federal aid, schools must be accredited by a private educational association that has been certified by the Department of Education. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Education acknowledges accreditation plays a "gatekeeping" role in access to the annual $150 billion spent on federal student aid. "Accreditors are responsible for ensuring baseline levels of acceptable quality and performance across diverse institutions, degree types, and academic programs," the department said in a 2015 news release. But that does not mean the private accreditation firms are working with the government — nor that the more than 60 active accreditors, which are private entities, are working together. "I’m not sure how they constitute a cartel," said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of Colleges and State Universities. "If by cartel you mean a group that gets together behind closed doors to set policy, that does not happen." Meanwhile, there are approximately 4,200 accredited colleges and universities in the United States. And they compete against each other for students, government aid and grant money. Each institution decides what degrees to offer and what is required to attain them. Indeed, anyone can create a college — the accreditation only comes in as a means for students to get federal student loans. "As we know from Trump ‘University’ and from McDonald’s ‘University,’ you can use it as a euphemism," Nassirian said. "You can use it in any context you want to. And nobody stops you from awarding whatever degree you want to award." We also turned to somehow who knows cartels well — Ellen R. Wald, an expert on the OPEC oil cartel and a professor of social science at Jacksonville University. She defines cartel as "a group of companies or countries that coordinate and collude to set prices by increasing or decreasing production in unison." There is no indication that universities collude to determine the number of diplomas granted, let alone the price, she said. If they appear to act in unison, it is because they are responding to the same government regulation and accreditation requirements. "The only example in which universities coordinate to set prices is the Ivy League's decision to prohibit scholarships that are not need-based, which has the effect of raising overall prices," she said. Even then, the eight Ivy League schools are only a tiny portion of the 4,200 accredited institutions. Our rating Ryan called to break up the "college cartel," implying that collusion is preventing better options from entering the higher education market. While it is true that the accreditation process acts as a "gatekeeper" of federal student aid, but that is a policy standard and, in practice, is different than a cartel which would require collusion between institutions and many other factors. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression, we rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/060b4ac4-b038-4783-aeff-ab62c05fe309	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-06-16T05:00:00	2016-05-14	['United_States']
pomt-08682	Says state Rep. Diana Maldonado of Round Rock uses Craigslist to hire campaign block walkers.	true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/10/larry-gonzales/larry-gonzales-says-state-rep-diana-maldonado-uses/	Republican Larry Gonzales of Round Rock, challenging first-term Democratic state Rep. Diana Maldonado, says his "roadmap to victory" includes plans for volunteers to visit voters house by house. Tweaking Maldonado, Gonzales says in an Aug. 31 e-mail to supporters: "We are not soliciting paid walkers on Craig's List like my opponent is, who is offering to pay complete strangers by the hour to carry her message." We wondered whether Maldonado was in fact hiring campaign workers to walk blocks and ring doorbells through Craigslist, a website that enables people to post ads under categories such as jobs, housing, events and personals. Gonzales told us that he found out about the Craigslist entry from a supporter who had responded to it. Gonzales said he had not seen the ad but that the supporter, whom Gonzales would not identify, had forwarded him an e-mail conversation proving that the Maldonado campaign had placed it. Many Craigslist postings are free, according to its website, although there is a charge for posts including "brokered apartment rental listings in New York," ads for therapeutic services in the United States, and job openings in certain cities including Austin. The fee for posting a job in the Austin area: $25. Searching the ads, which include an e-mail address for responses, is free. Gonzales forwarded us a copy of the e-mail exchange between the Maldonado campaign and the supporter, whose name and address had been redacted. (According to Gonzales, the day before our inquiry, he sent a copy to a conservative blogger; we saw that version posted online.) The subject line of the e-mail response from kristin@dianamaldonado.com was "Paid Canvassers Needed for Highly Competitive State House Race (Round Rock)." Her e-mail said, "Thanks for responding to the ad, we are working really hard to win this race. If you are interested in a position send me your resume and 2-3 references and we will go from there." We searched Craigslist for the job posting, but it was no longer available. Mitra Salasel, communications director for Maldonado's campaign, confirmed that the campaign had posted a jobs ad on Craiglist. She e-mailed us a copy, which states: "Competitive Texas State House campaign seeks highly motivated door-to-door canvassers for part-time and full-time paid positions. The ideal candidate has experience volunteering and/or organizing for democratic or nonprofit campaigns." The ad says applicants "must be willing to work outdoors during irregular hours, including evenings and weekends." The location is listed as Round Rock, and the hourly pay is listed as $10.11. Neither Maldanado nor Gonzales is mentioned by name. Salasel told us that Maldonado's campaign field director, Kristin Fine, has the e-mail address kristin@dianamaldonado.com and that the ad was posted July 24 and expired after 30 days. Salasel said: "As I'm sure you're aware, our district is a commuter district where most people have family obligations. So we supplement our volunteer program — over 100 strong — with five paid canvassers that can work a regular schedule." Three of the five were hired through Craigslist, she said. Gonzales told us that he has not paid people to walk blocks or call voters on his behalf. A review of his campaign finance reports found no expenditures that suggested otherwise. Two Democratic political professionals told us that it's not uncommon to pay canvassers. Peck Young, who is director of Austin Community College's Center for Public Policy and Political Studies and who has worked as a Democratic campaign consultant, said many people can't afford to volunteer if they have to pay for child care while doing political work. "It's to compensate them so they can afford to be part of your campaign," he said. However, GOP consultant Chad Wilbanks, who said he has no connection to the Gonzales campaign, said that it happens more often in legislative races than statewide contests and that such hiring usually starts later in the game. "If you look at state legislative campaigns, there may be an effort to recruit people and pay them in the last 72 hours of a race, but it is rare," Wilbanks said. "When it is even more rare is 60 days out." Using Craigslist to recruit campaign workers is "unconventional," said Wilbanks, but Young had a different take. "In these big cities, with all the high-tech stuff, people are using all kinds of high-tech techniques," Young said. Maldonado's campaign confirmed using Craigslist to hire block walkers.

pomt-07167	Says the Austin City Council "may give $4 million a year to subsidize a race track."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/12/kathie-tovo/kathie-tovo-says-austin-city-council-may-vote-subs/	Kathie Tovo, facing Austin City Council Member Randi Shade in a June 18 runoff, says in a TV ad that debuted in April: "We’re in a budget crisis, but the council may give $4 million a year to subsidize a race track. That’s the wrong priority." City Hall coughing up for vroom-vroom? First, let’s brake to define "subsidy." Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary says it’s "a grant by a government to a private person or company to assist an enterprise deemed advantageous to the public." Offered examples are expenditures for public transit or to farmers in case of crop failure. To back her claim, Tovo’s campaign pointed us to an eight-page "fact sheet" on her website touching on money that could flow to support Formula One races to be held on a track being built east of Austin’s airport. According to the sheet, state Comptroller Susan Combs has agreed to provide $25 million a year for 10 years from a state trust fund to cover an annual sanctioning fee that local F1 organizers must pay to the British-based international race organization. The fund reimburses event organizers with some of the "extra" sales, hotel, alcohol and car rental tax revenue attributable to the event itself — i.e., money that the state theoretically would not have collected if the event had not been held. In the past it has been used to attract NFL Super Bowls and the Major League and NBA All-Star games. Per a 2009 state law, though, the state’s $25 million a year can only be spent if a local city or county government puts up $1 for every $6.25 in state aid. The law specifies that in order to get the state aid, local organizers need a local city or county to agree to endorse the event. So, $4 million a year is to be ginned up locally with the money would be dedicated to covering costs of staging the event -- police overtime, say, or erecting traffic barriers -- municipal expenses that might otherwise be charged to the promoter. Subsidy case closed? Not by the lights of Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell. A June 8 Austin American-Statesman news article quotes Leffingwell saying during a June 7 City Council work session: "The city will never put any money" into the Formula One project. During the session, Richard Suttle, the project’s Austin lawyer, said the first of the 10 payments will come from a local organizing committee, which in turn expects to get the money from the Formula One promoters. A city employee noted that the subsequent local contributions of $4 million will come from tax revenue the state expects to reap in connection with the races. Next, we asked Tovo’s camp why the $4 million amounts to a subsidy if the first installment is to come from a non-governmental source and future payments are expected to reflect tax revenue that presumably would not exist without the races. Jim Wick, Tovo’s deputy campaign manager, replied: "What you have happening right now is the mayor and some members of the council are trying to figure out how to structure this so that it doesn’t appear the city (is) giving the promoters of this event a subsidy. It looks like fuzzy accounting." Shade campaign spokeswoman Lynda Rife pointed out by email that the trust fund money can be spent on the races -- not construction of the track itself. Also, each race "is expected to generate more than $4 million in new tax revenue that wouldn't come to the city without the event taking place." Rife’s email continued: "If we don’t generate that $4 million in new tax revenue from the event, then the city doesn’t have to pay the whole $4 million. The city is not on the hook, if the event doesn’t meet the performance standard," she said. Notably, the city can use its contribution to the trust fund to pay race-related expenses. According to Rodney Gonzales, deputy director of the city's Economic Growth and Development Services office, any amount not spent to cover hosting expenses would remain in the trust fund the next year and could not be spent for other municipal purposes. Time to wave our checkered flag. Maybe we missed a hairpin turn or two, but it’s clear the council is gearing up to vote on an agreement committing tax revenue to a trust fund devoted to supporting the F1 races. Subsidy? Sure, though Tovo’s statement skirts the expectation that the area will draw tax benefits equal to or exceeding the local expenditures. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01017	"Al-Qaida has grown fourfold in five years."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/01/jack-keane/retired-general-says-al-qaida-has-grown-fourfold-l/	Al-Qaida has grown exponentially in recent years, retired four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane said. On Fox News Sunday Feb. 1, host Chris Wallace asked Keane if the administration has a strategy to combat Islamic extremism. Keane said, "We do not. Al-Qaida has grown fourfold in five years. ISIS, which began when we pulled out politically and military from Iraq, grew from an organization less than 3,000 to an organization over 30,000 in three years. Radical Islamists spread from Western Africa through the Middle East, all the way to South Asia to sub-Indian continent." Keane first mentioned the fact that al-Qaida has quadrupled since 2010 in testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee last week. We wondered if it was accurate. The short answer is maybe, depending on your definition. Experts cautioned that it’s nearly impossible to know how large al-Qaida is in terms of membership. And Keane’s figure is just an estimate extrapolated from an earlier analysis. It also relies on a broad definition of "al-Qaida." Defining al-Qaida So who is Keane talking about when he says "al-Qaida"? Back in the early 2000s, and before 9/11, al-Qaida was generally understood to mean the several hundred people who swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden, said Larry Johnson, a consultant specializing in counterterrorism and a former CIA employee. Now when people think of al-Qaida, they usually think of a much broader category consisting of that core group, plus affiliates and other Sunni Islamic extremists, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, located throughout the Middle East, North Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Under this broad definition, Johnson said Keane’s claim that al-Qaida has grown fourfold since 2010 -- while impossible to verify -- is probably accurate. "Fourfold is probably an underestimate," added Frederick Kagan, director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats project. But not everyone agrees to such a broad discussion. Anne Stenersen, a research fellow in terrorism at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, said the narrowly defined al-Qaida -- that is, its core members -- has stayed relatively stable at fewer than 300 members since 2010. She prefers this definition because the affiliates have varying strategies and objectives. For example, al-Qaida actually split from the Islamic State due to ideological differences. Johnson also noted that some regional groups that have al-Qaida in their names -- like al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb or al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- were given those names by the West, so they do not necessarily reflect how close those groups are to the core al-Qaida group. The evidence At the Senate hearing, Keane shared this map that shows various al-Qaida affiliates and other Islamic extremist groups throughout the region as of January: Keane told us his advisers came up with the fact that al-Qaida has increased fourfold by relying on a 2014 report from the think tank RAND. The RAND report found that between 2010 and 2013, the number of Islamic jihadist fighters doubled, and the number of attacks tripled. Given the continued rise in activity since 2013 and based on discussions with experts, Keane and his advisers concluded that the size of al-Qaida and its affiliates has essentially doubled again since the RAND report was published. The RAND report relied on both unclassified and classified primary sources to come up with its counts. The trouble trying to count However, every expert we spoke with -- as well as government spokespeople -- said it’s not feasible to quantify the size of al-Qaida and its global affiliates. Other than this RAND report, there’s no official count of the number of Islamic extremists that we can use to see how the group’s manpower has grown since 2010. "All that said, al-Qaida is almost certainly bigger than it was five years ago. It's the fourfold that I would question," said J.M. Berger, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution. "For each of these groups, we can only estimate their size, and all estimates are disputed." Kagan, of the American Enterprise Institute, said several al-Qaida groups are much larger than they were five years ago because of the 2011 Arab Spring. The revolutions left many countries without stable leadership and institutions, making them vulnerable to the rise of extreme religious groups. This is what’s happening in Libya with the rise of al-Qaida affiliates, in Syria with the al Nusra front and Yemen with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Kagan added that in the past five years, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in West Africa, as well as Boko Haram in Nigeria, which doesn’t have official ties to al-Qaida, have grown tremendously. And the United States invasion and later removal from Iraq destabilized the country, Johnson said, giving way to the rise of the Islamic State. "Al-Qaida and its affiliates have expanded enormously over the last five years," Kagan said. "They have transformed from being terrorists to insurgent organizations and in some cases insurgent armies." Kagan and Johnson both cited the United States’ limited response to the Arab Spring as well as its policies in dealing with Iraq and Iran as contributing to the rise in Islamic extremism throughout North Africa and the Middle East. Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Security Studies, said his research has shown that the number of al-Qaida affiliates has more than doubled from eight to 17 since 2008. Adding the Islamic State, once an affiliate, to that count would dramatically increase the number of fighters. "I can’t pin an exact number to Gen. Keane’s assertion — but it doesn’t sound wildly off base to me," Hoffman said. Our ruling Keane said, "al-Qaida has grown fourfold in five years." There’s two tricky parts to Keane’s particular claim. The first is defining al-Qaida. While the group that previously followed Osama bin Laden has remained at about the same size, there is no doubt among experts that we’ve seen a rise in the number of jihadist fighters overall. Many of those fighters were inspired by al-Qaida. The second is pinning a specific number on the growth. RAND said the number of terrorists has doubled between 2010 and 2013. Keane basically estimates that the number of jihadist fighters has doubled again. Is that right? Maybe. Maybe not. The evidence is thin, but the experts say his claim is a reasonable estimate. Weighing everything, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Jack Keane	None	None	None	2015-02-01T18:14:09	2015-02-01	['None']
pomt-02114	"Oregon today has 100,000 more jobs than it did when I was elected."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2014/may/13/john-kitzhaber/does-oregon-have-100000-more-jobs-today-it-did-whe/	Gov. John Kitzhaber, running for an unprecedented fourth term and taking a lot of flak for the collapse of the Cover Oregon website, has been trying to shine a light on his accomplishments. One of them struck a meat-and-potatoes campaign theme: jobs. The Claim In a recent campaign email, the Democratic governor claimed: "Oregon today has 100,000 more jobs than it did when I was elected." He repeated the claim to Harry Esteve, a reporter for The Oregonian, for a recent story, and that also got a lot of readers wondering about the figure. If the number is true, it would be great news in a state where the recession hit harder and lingered longer. We decided to check. The Analysis The standard way for economists -- and PolitiFact -- to analyze such statements is to use data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s source for employment data. The two most commonly cited sources of bureau data are a survey of households and a survey of employer payrolls. The first sample is smaller but more detailed. But for measuring raw numbers of jobs, payroll data is preferred. Within that data, "non-farm jobs," tallied monthly, are the most commonly used. Nick Beleiciks, an employment economist with the Oregon Department of Employment, said that’s because every state keeps those figures, making them comparable. To make comparisons over time, economists prefer "seasonally adjusted" numbers to smooth out cyclical differences. So we used the bureau’s interactive website to find the seasonally adjusted figures for non-farm jobs in Oregon when Kitzhaber was last elected, in November 2010, and for March 2014, when the email went out. Here’s what we found: November 2010: 1,609,600 March 2014: 1,708,900 Increase: 99,300 So Kitzhaber’s claim is very close to accurate. It’s mirrored in the unemployment rate, according to bureau data, which fell from 10.4 percent in November 2010 to 6.9 percent this past March. Job growth in Oregon even exceeded the national rate during that time, 6.1 percent to 5.8 percent, according to BLS figures. In March, Oregon’s seasonally adjusted monthly job gain of 8,900 jobs was the largest since November 2005, when 9,300 jobs were added. Still, two points detract from the accuracy of Kitzhaber’s claim. First, the claim is ever so slightly cherry-picked. He could have started the clock the month he was sworn in -- January 2011. That time frame would have produced an increase of 94,000 jobs. Christian Gaston, a Kitzhaber campaign spokesman, agreed that the start time should have been pegged to the start of Kitzhaber’s latest term as governor, not the final two months of Ted Kulongoski’s second term. Second, while Kitzhaber did not personally claim credit for creating 100,000 jobs, he did cite the statistic in an email that began, "Four years ago, you stood with me as together we promised Oregon that we could make critical progress on education, healthcare, and rebuilding our economy, even in the face of a significant partisan divide." Clearly, he’s aiming to make sure he and his administration get some credit for the job growth. But we should make clear that governors are not all-powerful in shaping their state’s economy. Their policies on taxes, spending and economic development can make a difference, but state economies are also tied to the national and global economies. The Ruling Kitzhaber’s email said, "Oregon today has 100,000 more jobs than it did when I was elected." He’s essentially correct on the numbers. Technically, it’s 99,300 – though it’s important to note that it would have been 94,000 if he had counted from the time he was sworn in and affecting policy. It’s also important to note that governors have a modest influence on their state’s economy. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-07416	Says Paul Ryan "voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/27/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-rep-paul-ryan-voted-wa/	In closed-door remarks to campaign supporters on April 14, 2011, President Barack Obama looked back in frustration at lengthy negotiations with Republicans over funding to keep the federal government operating. Obama opined, as a CBS News online story reported, that he expects Republicans to continue using the budget process to "enact their political agenda under the guise of cutting spending." The president singled out U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the House Budget Committee chairman who has authored a long-term deficit-reduction plan. "When Paul Ryan says his priority is to make sure, you know, he's just being America's accountant, trying to be responsible ...This is the same guy who voted for two wars that were unpaid for, voted for the Bush tax cuts that were unpaid for, voted for the prescription drug bill that cost as much as my health care bill -- but wasn't paid for," Obama told his supporters. "So it's not on the level." In making the remark, Obama pointed to several big-ticket items approved during the Bush administration while Ryan was in Congress -- ones he says have helped drive the nation’s record deficits. Given the prominence of the protagonists and the timeliness of the comments, we decided to take a look at Obama’s critique of Ryan. With the words, Obama is offering an opinion about how Ryan has framed his budget-cutting efforts. We can’t fact-check the president’s opinion about Ryan’s message. But we can focus on the factual assertions, and try to put them into some context. We started with the White House, which declined to comment, saying the president’s remarks spoke for themselves. Let’s look at the votes. There is no dispute Ryan voted for Afghanistan and Iraq war funding; for the major tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 (and extended in 2010); and for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created in 2003. All were big-ticket items. But Obama goes a step further to assert that all were "unpaid for." That’s Washington parlance for bills not offset by corresponding spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere in the federal budget. Budget experts we consulted and the historical record confirm there were no direct offsets built into those bills. Obama’s claim on the prescription drug bill was slightly different -- that it wasn’t paid for and "cost as much as my health care bill." Let’s break this into two parts. Obama appears to refer to the gross outlays needed for the two landmark bills. For the Medicare prescription drug bill, passed in 2003 and effective in 2006, we found a range of cost estimates for 10 years: $395 billion to $720 billion. The official Congressional Budget Office estimate was the low end. That was at the time. Now, government estimates show the original cost projections were too high, perhaps by as much as 40 percent, said Jon Gabel, senior fellow in health care research at the National Opinion Research Center. Obama’s health reform bill -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- was pricier, with estimates in the $800 billion to $1.4 trillion range. Ryan and Republicans opposed the bill. But the two measures were passed seven years apart, so inflation may be a factor. Paul Van de Water, a former Congressional Budget Office official who is now a senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, did an inflation-adjusted comparison and found the Medicare bill is probably two-thirds or three-quarters the cost of the Obama health care measure. That is, Obama’s health care bill is still hundreds of millions of dollars more costly than the Medicare drug bill. So the president was off in equating the gross cost of the bills. On the offset question, the Medicare prescription drug bill, however, indisputably added to the federal deficit. It was not offset by new revenue or other spending cuts. In contrast, the official government estimate of the 2010 health care law’s impact said it would actually reduce the deficit, in part because of the new taxes it enacts to help offset the cost of expanding health coverage. The source for that is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO’s estimate is hardly undisputed -- Ryan, other Republican leaders and various budget analysts have argued that the CBO’s report was skewed by questionable assumptions given to it by the Obama administration. They contend the law would actually add to the deficit. Nevertheless, we -- and Congress -- have used CBO estimates as the gold standard on such matters. So Obama has a pretty firm leg to stand on in saying his health bill was paid for while the Medicare bill was not. That covers the details behind the president’s remarks. In this case, it’s important to put them into their proper context. We consulted several experts and sought Ryan’s take. Ryan was asked in a recent interview about Obama’s citing the Medicare drug program, the two wars and the Bush tax cuts as major drivers of the deficit. He disagreed: "We still had these enormous, building, unfunded liabilities, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security -- I mean, the big drivers of our debt." His office sent us a defense of his votes on war funding, quoting his budget plan: "Like all categories of government spending, defense spending should be executed with greater efficiency and accountability. But responsible budgeting must never lose sight of the fact that the first responsibility of the federal government is to provide for the defense of the nation." On the Bush tax cuts, Ryan aides said the congressman believes that "we have deficits because Washington spends too much, not because Americans are taxed too little." He says the tax cuts helped fuel economic growth and bring in more tax revenue. Indeed, in December, Obama himself backed a compromise with Republicans, including Ryan, that extended the Bush tax cuts. "Bottom line: Ryan has voted for massive new spending and so has the president," said Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. Iraq war costs have topped $1 trillion, said Scott Lilly, former staff director for the House Appropriations Committee and now a research fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Neither Bush’s war effort in Afghanistan nor Obama’s escalation there has been paid for, both analysts noted. In April, both Obama and Ryan unveiled long-term deficit reduction plans in the neighborhood of $4 trillion over a decade or more. So where does this leave us? The president cherry-picked a handful of votes in an effort to show that Ryan is not pristine on the subject of the deficit. Obama got it right on Ryan’s support for the big-ticket bills, including war funding, Medicare prescription drugs and the Bush tax cuts. He was also on target in saying that none was offset or "paid for" by spending cuts or tax increases. That’s the main part of his claim. He was off the mark in asserting that one of the bills -- Medicare prescription drugs -- was as costly as his 2010 health care reform bill. That puts him at Mostly True.

pomt-04813	Says Reps. Rush Holt, Frank Pallone and Bill Pascrell are "willing to jeopardize seniors’ access to coverage by gutting $741 billion from Medicare" to pay for a "big-government healthcare takeover."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/19/national-republican-congressional-committee/house-democrats-support-gutting-medicare-more-700-/	Republicans are once again attacking Congressional Democrats on Medicare spending cuts, using a line of attack that has been roundly discredited. In a series of news releases dealing with the national health care reform law, the National Republican Congressional Committee on Aug. 14 claimed 37 House Democrats are "willing to jeopardize seniors’ access to coverage by gutting $741 billion from Medicare" to pay for a "big-government healthcare takeover." Those Democrats include New Jersey Reps. Rush Holt, Frank Pallone and Bill Pascrell, all of whom voted for the reform in March 2010. They’re also up for reelection this November against GOP challengers. PolitiFact National recently issued a Mostly False to presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney for claiming President Barack Obama "robbed" Medicare of $716 billion to pay for the reform. By attacking the congressmen, the committee makes the same mistake as Romney, but then goes one step further in rehashing that myth about the reform being a government takeover. First, we’ll talk about the reduction in Medicare spending. Over the last couple of years, Republicans have frequently criticized the reform for cutting $500 billion from Medicare. U.S. Reps. Jon Runyan and Scott Garrett have each received Mostly False rulings for repeating that claim. But the reform does not cut $500 billion from the current Medicare budget. Instead, the reform aims to slow the program’s future spending growth. So, that $500 billion has represented the reduction in spending increases during the 2012-2021 period, according to a 2011 estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In its latest estimate released last month, the budget office said the reform would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion between 2013 and 2022. The $741 billion figure cited by the committee includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs. Most of those Medicare savings come from reducing annual increases in payments to certain health care providers. The reduction in Medicare spending helps offset other costs created by the reform. But the committee is wrong to claim Democrats support "gutting" Medicare. Program spending will still increase under the reform, but just at a slower pace. Now, we’ll address whether the reform represents a "big-government healthcare takeover." That claim has been debunked numerous times and was ultimately named PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year. PolitiFact New Jersey issued a Pants on Fire to Gov. Chris Christie for repeating the line in October 2011. The reform does impose more government regulations on individuals, employers and private insurance companies. For instance, people must purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty, with some exemptions. Also, insurers can sell coverage through new insurance exchanges as long as they meet certain federal standards. But the reform does not create a new public health insurance plan, and it doesn’t eliminate the private health insurance industry. In fact, more people will become enrolled in private insurance plans under the reform, according to budget office projections. In response to our findings, the committee didn’t back down from its original claims. "Democrats stole from seniors’ Medicare benefits to pay for their government takeover of healthcare," NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said in an e-mail. "Their addiction to government spending sprees has crossed the line by threatening seniors’ access to healthcare, and New Jersey families will stop this reckless behavior this November." Our ruling In news releases, the committee claimed Holt, Pallone and Pascrell are "willing to jeopardize seniors’ access to coverage by gutting $741 billion from Medicare" to pay for a "big-government healthcare takeover." The health care reform is projected to reduce future Medicare spending by more than $700 billion between 2013 and 2022, but program spending will still increase. That increase will just be smaller than without the reform. The "healthcare takeover" claim remains bogus, because the private health insurance industry remains intact under the reform and stands to gain more enrollees.

pomt-00810	The Affordable Care Act is "a major reason why we’ve seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/31/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-health-care-law-has-led-50000-/	In a recent speech marking the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama touted a number of accomplishments he credited to the law. "The work that we’ve been able to do is already spurring the kinds of changes that we had hoped for," Obama said. "It’s helped reduce hospital readmission rates dramatically. It’s a major reason why we’ve seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals." We hadn’t heard the claim about preventable deaths, so we took a closer look. When we asked the White House for its evidence, they pointed us to a report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Prepare yourself for its very wonky title: "Interim Update on 2013 Annual Hospital-Acquired Condition Rate and Estimates of Cost Savings and Deaths Averted From 2010 to 2013." The agency is a part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, and its report takes a preliminary look at a program called Partnership for Patients that was created by the health care law. The program aims to get 3,700 hospitals -- along with physicians, nurses, employers, patients, government officials and others -- to work together to cut preventable hospital-acquired conditions by 40 percent between 2010 and 2014 and to reduce hospital readmissions by 20 percent over the same period. The report found that "approximately 50,000 fewer patients died in the hospital as a result of the reduction in HACs (hospital-acquired conditions), and approximately $12 billion in health care costs were saved from 2010 to 2013." This occurred "during a period of concerted attention by hospitals throughout the country to reduce adverse events," the report said. Independent experts said the report is credible. Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, "I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit." Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, "which has been a serious – and successful – effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections." He said it’s the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but "never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost. It's the first time we have seen measurable, significant decreases in any of the harms that we cause by treatment failures." David Nash, dean of the Jefferson School of Population Health in Philadelphia, agreed that the numbers are credible. "This is in part due to a huge amount of work on the part of hospitals," Nash said. We do see two fairly minor caveats. • These numbers are estimates. Obviously, it’s not possible to literally count the number of deaths prevented in the same way you can count actual deaths. So the authors of the report had to use a complicated set of estimating techniques to come up with the 50,000 figure. The authors of the report made a point of including some caveats, including that "the estimate of deaths averted is less precise than the estimate of the size of the reduction" in hospital-acquired conditions." The report also notes "uncertainty inherent in our statistical extrapolations" and says that it’s "clear" that "tens of thousands of deaths" have been averted, which is less specific than the 50,000 figure Obama focused on. • Preventable deaths had already begun falling even before the health care law was enacted. Periodically, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection has analyzed data on inpatient hospital deaths, with its most recent analysis covering data through 2010. That analysis found that the number of inpatient hospital deaths (not just preventable ones) decreased from 776,000 in 2000 to 715,000 in 2010 -- a drop of 61,000 over a decade. In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care law’s passage; it’s just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that "the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood." Our ruling Obama said the Affordable Care Act is "a major reason why we’ve seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals." Independent experts said the report Obama was using as evidence represents a credible attempt to quantify recent improvements in preventing hospital-patient deaths, even if the numbers are estimates rather than hard figures. They added that it’s reasonable to credit the health care law’s Partnership for Patients program with accelerating the gains, even if the improvements were already under way at the time the law was passed. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-03-31T10:54:35	2015-03-25	['None']

pomt-12380	Says a Congressional Budget Office report found low-income seniors in Florida will face "800 percent premium increases" under the American Health Care Act.	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/jun/02/chris-king/does-ahca-increase-health-care-premiums-low-income/	A Florida Democrat running for governor is warning about massive insurance rate increases for low-income seniors as part of the House Republican health care bill. Chris King, an Orlando-area businessman, recently called on Gov. Rick Scott and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam to disavow the health care overhaul based on analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. "The only thing as reckless and disappointing as the 800 percent premium increases Florida seniors will face under Trumpcare is Rick Scott and Adam Putnam's silence on the issue," King said in a May 25 press release that describes the bill as hiking premiums for low-income seniors. Putnam is running for governor, and Scott is considering running for the U.S. Senate. Is it true? Does the Republican health care plan -- the American Health Care Act -- portend an 800 percent premium increase for low-income Florida seniors. It depends on your definition of seniors. King’s comment could mislead readers to believe that seniors on Medicare face 800 percent premium hikes under the terms of the House bill, and that isn’t the case. The CBO report addresses the impact of the American Health Care Act on individuals up to age 64 who buy on the individual marketplace and not Medicare. However, King does have a point that low-income, older Americans would be hit harder than any other group under the bill that passed the House and earned President Donald Trump’s applause. Report says low-income seniors would face premium hikes CBO researchers considered the effect of the bill on a few different age brackets, including consumers who are 64 years old and not yet on Medicare. The May 24 report compares the average amount consumers who are 64 years old would spend in premiums under the current Affordable Care Act with what they would pay under the House legislation in 2026. As written, the House bill would create two choose-your-own-adventure scenarios for states that decide to obtain waivers to certain "essential health benefits" under current law. Either scenario, CBO found, means steep increases for older, poorer Americans than under current law. Here’s what the estimates say about average insurance costs for a person 64 years old who earns $26,500 a year in 2026: • Under the Affordable Care Act, that person would pay a net of $1,700 in premium costs for an individual market plan after subsidies. (A 21-year-old and 40-year-old would pay the same amount.) • That net premium rises to $16,100 for states not requesting waivers to certain "essential health benefits" under current law. That’s an increase of about 847 percent. • For states that obtain those waivers, the premium rises to $13,600, or a 700 percent increase. Due to those rising costs for low-income older Americans, the CBO predicted that many will lose insurance. "Although the agencies expect that the legislation would increase the number of uninsured broadly, the increase would be disproportionately larger among older people with lower income — particularly people between 50 and 64 years old with income of less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level," the report states. How the House bill drives up costs for older Americans The reason that low-income consumers who are 64 would face such a massive hike in premiums is due to what happens to age rating and tax credit subsidies in the House legislation. "The changes to the subsidies and age bands all explicitly increase net premiums for seniors. That piece of the CBO score isn’t really up for debate," said Chris Sloan at Avalere Health consulting. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. The House bill increases the ratio to five times as much starting in 2018. Also under the current Affordable Care Act, tax credits are tied to income, so low-income older Americans receive large tax credits. Subsidies under the House bill, however, are based on age rather than income. The credits also don’t vary based on the cost of insurance in a person’s area. Tax credits for older adults under the House bill are only two times the size of that for younger adults, even though they face premiums that are five times as high, said Linda Blumberg, a health expert at the Urban Institute. The CBO report shows that wealthier older Americans -- 64 year olds earning $68,500 -- would fare far better: They would pay a 5 percent increase in non-waiver states and an 11 percent decrease in waiver states. Overall, the legislation would mean cheaper premiums for some consumers and higher costs for others, said Cynthia Cox, an expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "If you looking for an extreme scenario — someone the most hurt by AHCA — it would be a low- income senior living in a rural area," she said. "The person benefiting the most is a young affluent urbanite." The CBO figures are based on a national average; insurance premiums can vary from county to county with costs rising in rural areas, according to other estimates. The Kaiser Family Foundation’s map shows that under AHCA a 60-year-old earning $20,000 a year would face a 772 percent increase for a premium in Miami-Dade. The same senior would pay a 1,594 percent increase in the Big Bend’s Gadsden County. The Senate has not released its version of the health care bill, which could result in a drastically different situation for older Americans. Trump officials have talked about making other legislative and regulatory changes that they say would drive down the cost of health insurance. Our ruling King said a Congressional Budget Office report shows that low-income seniors in Florida will face "800 percent premium increases" under the American Health Care Act. King was referring to a report that analyzed premium costs for seniors who are 64 and therefore not yet on Medicare. The report showed that average premiums for a 64-year-old earning $26,500 will rise dramatically if the bill becomes law — between 700 and 847 percent depending on a state’s choices. That puts low-income, older Americans in a disproportionately affected position compared to other age and income groups. But the King said seniors, which certainly would include people 65 and older. Most of those people are covered by Medicare. The CBO report does not apply to them. King’s statement is partially accurate but missing needed context, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-05443	Under Republican economic policies, "the typical American family saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-family-incomes-have-fallen-6-per/	During an April 18, 2012, speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio, President Barack Obama painted a picture of economic decline for American families resulting from Republican economic policies. "I’m always confused when we keep having the same argument with folks who don’t seem to remember how America was built," Obama said. "They keep telling us, well, if we just weaken regulations that keep our air and water clean and protect our consumers, if we just cut everybody’s taxes and convert these investments in community colleges and research and health care into tax cuts especially for the wealthy, that somehow the economy is going to get stronger -- and Ohio and the rest of the country will prosper. That’s the theory. "Ohio, we tested this theory," he continued. "Take a look at what happened in Ohio between 2000 and 2008. It’s not like we didn’t try it. And instead of faster job growth, we had the slowest job growth in half a century. Instead of broad-based prosperity, the typical American family saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent. Outsourcing, rampant; phony financial profits all over the place. And instead of strengthening our economy, our entire financial system almost collapsed. We spent the last three and a half years cleaning up after that mess. So their theory did not work out so well. Maybe they haven’t been paying attention, but it didn’t work out so well." This passage includes a lot of claims, but the one we’ll focus on here is whether "the typical American family saw their incomes fall by about six percent" during the time when Republican economic policies were in force. As we typically do with claims of this sort, we’ll look both at the accuracy of the numbers and the question of whether Obama has justification for blaming Republicans for the nation’s economic challenges. Checking the number We’ll start by noting that Obama' remarks were confusing. He mentioned "Ohio between 2000 and 2008," but then he spoke of the decline in the incomes of "the typical American family," which would include families outside of Ohio. And the dates he used were mentioned three sentences before the decline in income he cited. Since that’s all we had to go on, though, we began our analysis by looking at national data on family incomes between 2000 and 2008. We looked at the most straightforward measurement that seemed to fit Obama’s claim -- the median income for families, adjusted for inflation. This is one of the standard measurements taken by the Census Bureau every year. According to the Census Bureau, the inflation-adjusted median income for families fell from $64,232 in 2000 to $62,299 in 2008, a decline of about 3 percent. That’s half of the 6 percent figure Obama used. The White House confirmed that it had used the same data set we did but said the 6 percent figure came by comparing the numbers between 2000 and 2010. Indeed, when we checked the math for those years, median family incomes declined by just under 6 percent. However, doing it this way is problematic. First, Obama didn’t say 2000 to 2010; he said 2000 to 2008. The two additional years make a big difference, because 2009 and 2010 encompassed one of the weakest economic periods in recent American history. The White House did point us to two speeches in which Obama accurately described the time period for the 6 percent statistic. However, we’re not sold on the idea that using the period 2000-2010 bolsters his argument that Republican economic policies caused a 6 percent decline in median incomes. On the one hand, you could argue that Democrats, who controlled the White House and Congress, bear some of the blame for the economic decline in 2009 and 2010. On the other hand, you can argue that Obama doesn’t deserve the economic blame for 2009 and 2010 since the decline was shaped by the policies of his predecessor. But if you do, then it’s not equitable to hold his predecessor, President George W. Bush, to a different standard. If you argue that the economic outcomes in 2009 and 2010 result from Republican policies, then being consistent requires attributing a share of the blame for what happened in 2000 and 2001 to the policies of Bush’s predecessor, President Bill Clinton. And what happens if you make the calculation using the years 2002 to 2010 instead? It works out to a 3.6 percent decline -- still lower than the 6 percent the president cited. How much does a president or a party deserve credit or blame for the economy? We asked several economists of various ideological perspectives how much blame the GOP deserved for the recession that started in December 2007. None said the Republican Party deserved all of the blame, but none said the party deserved no blame at all, either. The consensus was that it was somewhere in the middle. Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said, "I fully agree that Republicans deserve a lot of blame. But the reason the economy was anemic is that the burden of government spending almost doubled, the regulatory burden increased, and other statist policies were implemented." In other words, in Mitchell’s view, you could say the GOP deserved blame because they weren’t staying true to the party’s fiscally conservative, anti-regulatory rhetoric and were instead acting like stereotypical Democrats. (On a non partisan note, Mitchell praises a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, for offering economic policies that were superior to Bush’s.) Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Carter administration, said it’s "fair to blame government for regulatory failures in the areas of housing and finance and the resulting financial crisis." He said the blame for that extends to both parties. "I think the Republican philosophy of unfettered markets bears the greater blame, but Democrats also allowed excesses to develop in the housing market and were happy to take Wall Street’s money," Bosworth said. Several of the experts we contacted emphasized that the U.S. government, while powerful, is not all-powerful. "Republican policies certainly didn't help," said Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business. "But the fundamentals are technological and global forces." "There was a worldwide credit bubble that led to a worldwide financial collapse that led to a global Great Recession," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. "If you accept that observation, it becomes hard to blame anyone in the U.S. overly for the results." Foster added, "The simple political narrative is to blame the other side. Fair enough to a point. The party in power always gets too much blame and too much credit, depending on circumstances." Our ruling Obama has a point that incomes for the "typical" family have fallen since 2000 when adjusted for inflation. But using a time frame that treats Obama’s tenure and Bush’s tenure equally, the decline was about 3 percent, not the 6 percent he cited. Meanwhile, on Obama’s larger point of blaming Republicans for the weak economy, we found a consensus that Obama is partly, but not completely, on defensible ground. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-04-26T13:57:01	2012-04-18	['United_States', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09637	Charlie Crist broke the quarter "record for fundraising in a U.S. Senate race in Florida."	true	/florida/statements/2009/dec/21/charlie-crist/crist-campaign-manager-says-governor-broke-fundrai/	The man running Gov. Charlie Crist's campaign for U.S. Senate is bragging that Crist set a fundraising record in 2009. "In our first quarter we broke the record for fundraising in a U.S. Senate race in Florida," Crist campaign manager Eric Eikenberg wrote Dec. 18 in a campaign update to supporters. "And we have met our goals time and again thanks to many of you who have invested in the Governor's message and vision of commonsense conservative leadership." Crist raised $4.37 million between May 12 and June 30, 2009, according to federal election campaign documents . Is that a record for a single reporting period? To check, we turned to the two most trusted repositories of federal campaign finance information -- the government-run Federal Elections Commission and the nonpartisan, not-for-profit Center for Responsive Politics. According to them, Florida's overall Senate fundraising benchmark was set in 2006 by U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Nelson raised a little more than $18 million for his re-election campaign against Republican Katherine Harris. But his best quarter -- from January through March 2006 -- netted only $2.82 million, according to FEC records . Crist's number crushes that mark. Other than Nelson, former U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez seemed to be a possible state recordholder. But Martinez's biggest haul was only $1.7 million , from January through March 2004. He repeated the feat again from April through June 2004. Martinez ended up raising a little more than $12 million for the 2004 election, slightly more than Democratic opponent Betty Castor in that cycle. No one else comes close to Crist's quarter fundraising total, records show. Crist raked in $4.37 million in his first campaign fundraising quarter and has raised $6.89 million through September. Nelson raised $6.53 million for his entire 2000 race, compared with $8.66 million for that year's GOP candidate, Bill McCollum. In the 1998 campaign between Crist and former Sen. Bob Graham, the candidates combined to raise about $7 million. Crist's take from May 12 to June 30 is the largest three-month gain for any Senate candidate in Florida history.

pomt-13247	Says Warren Buffett has publicly said his secretary "should not be paying a higher tax rate" than him.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/18/hillary-clinton/clinton-correct-buffett-claimed-pay-lower-tax-rate/	During the second presidential debate, Hillary Clinton argued against tax rules that allow the ultra-rich to pay lower rates than the middle class. She said she would change them as president, a move that has become known as the "Buffett rule." "Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary," Clinton said. Warren Buffett is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Forbes estimates him to be worth $64.3 billion and one of the richest men in the world. He is also a Hillary Clinton supporter and has sparred with Donald Trump over Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns. Urging major tax changes, Buffett has repeatedly said he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary and other employees. In 2007, Buffett told NBC Nightly News that he pays a smaller tax rate than multiple employees in his office. In 2011, Buffett wrote an op-ed in the New York Times called "Stop Coddling the Super-Rich." In the article, Buffett said that his taxes amounted to "only 17.4 percent of my taxable income — and that’s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office." In 2013, he told CNBC that while his tax rate rose 8 to 9 points more that year, "The differential between me and the rest of the office, not just my secretary but the rest of the office, was greater than that. It'll be closer, but I'll probably be the lowest-paying taxpayer in the office." A quick phone call to Buffett’s office confirmed this fact-check. Buffett’s assistant Debbie Bosanek -- the secretary Buffett mentions -- confirmed her boss pays a lower tax rate than she does. So, how can this be? Buffett’s op-ed says his tax rate is lower than his employees’ because money made off investments is taxed at a lower rate than wage income "If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot," Buffett said. Personal income is taxed based on how much a person makes each year. In 2016, the brackets range from 10 percent for those making $9,275 or less, to a top marginal rate of 39.6 percent for those making $415,051 or more. Meanwhile, the tax rate on long-term capital gains -- the profits from investments -- is 15 percent. However, if the taxpayer's taxable income is greater than $415,051, their long term capital gains are taxed at 20 percent. Here are the current rates for a single taxpayer. Taxable Income Tax Rate $0 to $9,275 10% $9,276 to $37,650 $927.50 plus 15% of the amount over $9,275 $37,651 to $91,150 $5,183.75 plus 25% of the amount over $37,650 $91,151 to $190,150 $18,558.75 plus 28% of the amount over $91,150 $190,151 to $413,350 $46,278.75 plus 33% of the amount over $190,150 $413,351 to $415,050 $119,934.75 plus 35% of the amount over $413,350 $415,051 or more $120,529.75 plus 39.6% of the amount over $415,050 On Oct. 10, 2016, Buffett released details about his personal tax data in a statement titled, "Some Tax Facts for Donald Trump." He says he paid $1.85 million in federal taxes in 2015, and his adjusted gross income was $11.6 million. That means he paid 15.9 percent in effective federal income tax. Lawrence Zelenak, a Duke University law professor, said in an email most taxpayers with incomes in the low six figures have a higher rate than 16 percent. "That's true even if you consider only federal income tax. Add in payroll tax and Buffet's rate becomes even lower compared with his secretary," he said. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes, and are deducted by your employer before you get your paycheck. These taxes pay for Medicare and Social Security. The employee tax rate for Social Security is typically 6.2 percent of your gross income, up to $113,700, and 1.45 percent on all income for Medicare. These two rates are not progressive or applied to all income, so as income increases, they make up a smaller percentage of the total income. Since Buffett makes the majority of his money from investments, his wage income -- and therefore his payroll taxes -- are low. But those who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. We don’t know what salary Buffett’s secretary earns, but it’s likely much higher than the median pay for secretaries. (Remember that Buffett is one of the richest men in the world.) A study from the nonpartisan The Tax Policy Center says that people making between $100,000 and $200,000 pay an average 19.6 percent in taxes, including payroll and income taxes. Our ruling Clinton said Buffett claimed to pay a smaller tax rate than his secretary. Buffett’s secretary confirmed she pays a higher rate than her boss. Buffett said he pays about 16 percent in income taxes, while any employee making between $100,000 and $200,000 typically pays about 20 percent in taxes.

pomt-04915	The Congressional Budget Office "has already doubled its estimate for the cost (of Obamacare) so far from roughly $800 billion to $1.7 trillion."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/02/michael-riley/ri-congressional-candidate-michael-riley-says-cong/	Cost is one of the key objections critics raise when the topic is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The issue came up July 26 during a debate on the public access program State of the State among Republican candidates for Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District seat. (It will begin airing Aug. 4.) "I have a problem with almost every aspect of (Obamacare)," said one of the candidates, Michael Riley. He said it would create too many new agencies and "we also have skyrocketing health-care costs, even in the first two years of implementation. The CBO has already doubled its estimate for the cost (of Obamacare) so far, from roughly $800 billion to $1.7 trillion." The CBO is the Congressional Budget Office, the widely respected nonpartisan agency that generates estimates and reports about the effect that proposed laws will likely have on the federal budget. We asked Riley’s campaign for his backup and, while we waited for their response, began our own research. PolitiFact has checked similar claims and found them, to be kind, less than factual. The CBO's initial estimate on March 2010 was that the gross cost from 2012 to 2019 would be $931 billion. Its newer estimate from March 2012 put the gross cost at $1,762 billion, which is where the complaints about doubling originated. But that was for a different time frame -- from 2012 to 2022. PolitiFact National found that if you compare the CBO figures for 2012-2019, a period covered by both reports, the estimate of the gross cost hadn't doubled, as Riley claimed. It had risen 8.6 percent, from $931 billion to $1.01 trillion. The $1.7 trillion figure was so widely misused, the CBO issued a statement saying that its estimates had not shifted significantly. "The projections for each given year have changed little, on net, since March 2010," the statement said. But wait, as they say in the commercials, there's more. The $1.7 trillion estimate doesn't include money saved from spending cuts, revenue from new taxes on the wealthy, penalties paid by individuals and workers who decide not to buy insurance, and other cost-saving measures included in the law. When the CBO took all of that into account, which it did in a 2010 report, it concluded that the health-care law would actually save money, lowering the deficit by about $132 billion between 2012-2019. In a 2011 update, it found that the projected deficit reduction had slipped to $119 billion, but it was still a net savings. In July, before Riley made his statement, the CBO updated some of its estimates in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to uphold most of the 2010 law. The CBO said the cost would be lower still, although the new projected savings would come from the fact that several states have vowed not to expand the eligibility requirements for Medicaid to help more uninsured people, invoking an exemption opened up by the Supreme Court ruling. At the same time, the CBO estimated that if the Affordable Care Act were to be repealed, that would add $109 billion to federal budget deficits from 2013 to 2022. Riley responded to our question by sending us a handful of links, most of them editorials from the conservative Washington Examiner that compared estimates from different time frames or disputed Obamacare supporters who say the cost estimates haven’t doubled. None mention the CBO's statement saying that the cost estimates have not changed appreciably over time. Our ruling Congressional candidate Michael Riley said the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the cost of Obamacare has doubled. The CBO itself says that's not true and that its estimates, on a year-by-year basis, have not changed significantly. Furthermore, the numbers cited by Riley are misleading because they represent only the gross costs of the health care law, not any savings. According to the CBO, the savings will actually reduce the deficit, although that estimate hasn’t been updated in two years. Information debunking similar claims has been available for the last four months here, here, here and, most recently, here. We rate his claim False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-01666	A "regulatory thing" means you can’t show someone drinking beer on camera.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/20/heineken/neil-patrick-harris-heineken-ad-we-cant-drink-tv/	For all the fun you see people having in beer commercials, the one thing you won’t see is someone actually drinking beer. The Dutch brewer Heineken made this the centerpiece of an ad campaign that features the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris. In this version, Harris is touting the taste of Heineken Light. The video shoot jolts to a halt when Harris tips a bottle to take a sip only to find that the cap is still on. This exchange between Harris and the director follows: Director: "Cut! Neil, you can’t drink the Heineken Light. Just hold it up." Harris: "What do you mean? Why can’t I drink it?" Director: "There are rules about drinking in the commercial." Harris: " ‘Cause it’s airing during a children’s program or something." Director: "No." Harris: "Then why?" Director: "It’s a regulatory thing. We can’t actually show you drinking Heineken Light on camera." It’s actually a pretty funny ad as Harris gamely and utterly misses the director’s point But we wondered about the director’s claim that a "regulatory thing" stops people from drinking beer in commercials. We’ve seen plenty of beer commercials and just always assumed that someone was drinking at some point. The fact is, however, ad makers successfully are getting us to see more than is on screen. In case you were wondering, it’s not the long arm of government that’s stopping people from a sip of sudsy brew. A press officer at the Federal Communications Commission, the body in charge of decency and other rules for broadcasters, said FCC rules are silent on drinking on camera. "Congress has not enacted any law prohibiting broadcast advertising of any kind of alcoholic beverage, and the FCC does not have a rule or policy regulating such advertisements," she said, citing the agency’s website. If there’s an iron fist, it belongs to the broadcasters. Tara Rush, senior director of corporate communications at Heineken USA, said the rules come from TV networks. "This is a regulation with the actual TV networks," Rush said. "It’s a long-standing rule." The broadcasters’ trade group, the National Association of Broadcasters, has no policy itself, but a spokesman sent us articles that describe how each network is free to set its own standards and, as it stands, when it comes to beer, they frown on public displays of ingestion. The Heineken ad alludes to this. Near the end, the director talks about network execs getting in a room to agree on a set of rules. A spokeswoman for The Beer Institute, the voice of brewers, told us their members are loath to take chances with network policy. "If you’re putting an ad together, you will be as conservative as possible so you know it will get past all the networks," said Megan Kirkpatrick, director of communications at the Institute. Kirkpatrick said the brewers have no desire to stir things up and risk stirring a cry for a new law. "The fact that it is self-regulated now, that’s not something brewers would want to put in jeopardy," Kirkpatrick said. "It’s the way they have operated for decades. You show a lot of people enjoying a football game or enjoying a baseball game but you don’t show any consumption. I don't think you’re going to see that change." Perhaps. Rush left us with this tantalizing thought about the long-standing rule. "Some networks are now beginning to change it," Rush said. We doubt Heineken is hoping for a quick shift. If commercials start showing people sipping away, that Heineken ad will be about as enticing as, well, old beer. Our ruling A Heineken beer commercial said regulations ban showing someone drinking beer on camera. If you take a more relaxed view of regulations, that’s close to the truth. The rules come from the television networks, not the government. The restriction might not have the force of law but it’s just as effective. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-10535	"Could I just point out that ... I seem to get the first question all the time?"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/27/hillary-clinton/shes-often-first-but-is-that-a-bad-thing/	Suggesting that she's being treated more harshly by the press than her opponent, Sen. Hillary Clinton noted toward the start of a debate with Sen. Barack Obama that she often has to answer the first question in televised debates. The comment was surprising in tone and content, coming abruptly after a long back-and-forth on health care and in answer to a question about who's right on NAFTA. "Well, could I just point out that, in the last several debates, I seem to get the first question all the time? And I don't mind," Clinton said during a Feb. 26, 2008, Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio. "You know, I'll be happy to field them, but I do find it curious. And if anybody saw Saturday Night Live , you know, maybe we should ask Barack if he's comfortable and needs another pillow." A few boos could be heard before the debate continued. Clinton is right. She has received the first question in five of the six debates this year. Here's a look at the opening question for each of those debates: • Jan. 5 in Manchester, N.H.: Moderator Charles Gibson of ABC News asks Sen. Barack Obama if he stands by a foreign policy speech in which he said he "would go into western Pakistan if (he) had actionable intelligence to go after (Osama bin Laden) whether or not the Pakistani government agreed." • Jan. 15 in Las Vegas: Moderator Brian Williams of NBC News asks Clinton how, on Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, race became such a prominent issue in the campaign. "How did we get here?" he asks. • Jan. 21 in Myrtle Beach, S.C.: CNN correspondent Joe Johns asks Clinton: "How much money would your stimulus plan put in the pockets of the average South Carolinian?" • Jan. 31 in Los Angeles (first one-on-one debate): Doyle McManus, Washington bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times, asks Clinton what she thinks is the "most important policy distinction between" her and Obama. • Feb. 21 in Austin, Texas: Univision anchor Jorge Ramos starts things off in Spanish: "The question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?" • Feb. 26 in Cleveland: NBC's Williams questions Clinton about the change in tone between the Feb. 21 debate and rhetoric on the campaign trail: "You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking," he says. Still, it's funny that Clinton would complain about getting the first question all the time because it wasn't too long ago that there were so many Democratic contenders that many were complaining about not getting enough questions. Besides, in a debate format, isn't it a good thing to go first? "In terms of receiving the first question, I have not seen people make a big deal about that," said Gordon R. Mitchell, University of Pittsburgh professor and director of the William Pitt Debating Union, one of the nation's oldest debate organizations. "There are issues about who gets to speak first in terms of opening speeches and closing speeches ... but in this format, where there were a series of questions ... if there was an advantage or disadvantage to receiving the first question, it quickly was counteracted by the many follow-up questions that evened things out." Mitchell thinks Clinton got her message wrong. "My impression of what was happening here is Hillary was actually trying to say, 'Hey, I always get all of the hard questions,' and it just came out as, 'Hey, how come I'm always getting the first question?' " he said. Perhaps that's what she meant, but we can only evaluate what she said. We rate her statement True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-02-27T00:00:00	2008-02-26	['None']

pomt-02335	"Americans increasingly want (the Affordable Care Act) to be repealed."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-americans-increasingly-want-healt/	Many Republican legislators commemorated the fourth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act on March 23 by calling for its repeal. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., spoke out against the law in a video message to his supporters. "We cannot give up," he said. "Obamacare is not something that’s set in stone. It can be repealed —and Americans increasingly want it to be repealed — and that’s what we’ll continue to do." PolitiFact wanted to know if Rubio’s assessment of polling on the law is accurate. Do more and more people want the law repealed? We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s folks. Many major pollsters include a question about repeal in their periodic surveys. Reports from the nonpartisan RealClearPolitics and the conservative American Enterprise Institute, both institutions that cover politics, don’t match up with Rubio’s claim. These averages across polling platforms are useful, but they also draw from a small number of polls and combine results from a question each group asked in a slightly different way. RealClearPolitics shows that in December 2013, about 52.3 percent of the public favored repealing the law. Since 2011, that number hasn’t wavered much. RealClearPolitics arrived at these figures by averaging reports from Quinnipiac, Rasmussen, Fox and CNN surveys. American Enterprise Institute included a broader swath of polls in their analysis, which ended up making for a much lower aggregate. Senior fellow Karlyn Bowman said she’d peg the repeal rate at anywhere between 35 to 45 percent, depending on the poll. Although the numbers vary based on question wording and possible responses, the trends themselves don’t, experts said. The percentage of the country that wants to repeal Obamacare is sizable, but not growing. "If you look poll to poll, it’s not clear that they’re rising dramatically, but it’s still a big number and something people should pay attention to," Bowman said. "Repeal sounds radical, and we’re just not a very radical kind of people. We like to take the middle ground if possible." Our ruling Rubio said, "Americans increasingly want (Obamacare) to be repealed." Depending on which polls you consult, anywhere from about 35 to 50 percent of the nation does want the law repealed. That’s not insignificant. But we take issue with his claim that as time goes on, more voters are calling for repeal. Experts say the percentage of voters who want Obamacare repealed is staying consistent within each poll. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-02938	The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned that the SAVE "database is not a foolproof means of verifying (citizenship on) the voter rolls."	true	/florida/statements/2013/oct/30/league-women-voters-florida/league-women-voters-says-homeland-security-warned-/	Florida led an effort to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls last year that faced widespread criticism from county election officials. So Secretary of State Ken Detzner hit the road in October to make amends and unveil a revamped process for round two. During his stop in deep-blue Broward County, Detzner -- an appointee of Republican Gov. Rick Scott -- faced a new heap of criticism. Voting rights activists peppered him with questions about the program Florida will use to purge noncitizen voters, called Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. "Using the federal SAVE Program to conduct this ‘cleaning’ of the voter rolls is like taking a chihuahua on a hunting expedition -- it is an inappropriate tool for this application," said League of Women Voters President Deirdre Macnab in an Oct. 10 statement, the day after the meeting. "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has already warned that this database is not a foolproof means of verifying the voter rolls." The League of Women Voters filed an amicus brief in a lawsuit currently before the U.S. District 11th circuit challenging the state Division of Elections’ use of the SAVE program. Some of Macnab’s statement is a matter of opinion -- as fact-checkers we won’t weigh in on whether using SAVE is appropriate to search for noncitizens on voter rolls. But we decided to check if the Department of Homeland Security warned that SAVE "is not a foolproof means of verifying the voter rolls." Florida’s controversial noncitizen voter purge First, here’s a brief recap of the state’s effort to ferret out noncitizens on the voter rolls before the November 2012 presidential election: Florida started with a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizens and whittled it down to about 2,600 names that later turned into 198. The list was rife with errors -- it even flagged a Brooklyn-born World War II veteran. (The best data PolitiFact Florida could nail down from the state was that there were about 85 noncitizens actually removed as of Aug. 1, 2012.) The first round was based on driver's license data, which was a poor method to identify current noncitizens, because it isn’t updated when someone later obtains citizenship. After a battle with federal officials, Florida gained access to the SAVE program in August 2012. But by then, many county election supervisors were fed up with the timing and process and it was scrapped. Detzner hasn’t indicated when he will start the next round. But unlike last year, the state plans to review the data before sending an electronic file to supervisors with supporting documentation. This time, county election supervisors have the option of accessing SAVE themselves. SAVE database Implemented in 1987, SAVE wasn’t originally intended as a way to clean up voter rolls. SAVE is a Web service used by government agencies to verify immigration status in order to determine if someone is eligible for benefits including Medicaid, housing loans and unemployment. The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service administer SAVE. During the past couple of years, several states including Florida sought to use SAVE to verify voter rolls. We asked the League of Women Voters for the source of their claim that the department warned that SAVE is "not a foolproof means of verifying the voter rolls." The League pointed to a New York Times article about Detzner’s tour which stated, "In the 2012 agreement with Florida which allowed the state to use the information, the Department of Homeland Security said that the database was not a foolproof way of verifying citizenship." That agreement between the department and the state Division of Elections doesn’t use the literal word "foolproof." But that's the essence of a Homeland Security fact sheet the state forwarded to us that explains some caveats about using SAVE to verify a voter’s eligibility: "Because the SAVE program cannot confirm your citizenship status based upon information provided by the agency, you must be given an opportunity by the voter registration agency to provide the correct documentation or correct your records with USCIS and/or appeal the denial of your voter registration. Please note there are a number of reasons why the SAVE program may not be able to verify your citizenship, e.g., the SAVE program can only verify naturalized or derived citizens, to the extent that a derived citizen received an official determination on U.S. citizenship by USCIS. The inability of the SAVE program to verify your citizenship does not necessarily mean that you are not a citizen of the United States and are ineligible to vote." SAVE is intended to show if someone is not a citizen but it does not contain a database of people who are U.S. citizens. "SAVE relies on DHS records, which do not include a comprehensive and definitive listing of U.S. citizens..." stated a letter from the U.S. Justice Department to Detzner in July 2012. For example, if someone has recently participated in a naturalization ceremony and that information isn’t yet loaded into SAVE, then it could be possible for an elections supervisor to obtain outdated information on a voter. "The information in the database is only as good as the information inputted into the database," Christopher Bentley, a spokesman for USCIS, told PolitiFact Florida. When Florida’s state elections director Maria Matthews talked about the SAVE database during a meeting in Sarasota County, she said "Is it foolproof? No, obviously it's not," according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. While state elections officials have said SAVE isn’t perfect, Detzner has said: "This is the best database we have to deal with." Currently, there are four states with signed DHS agreements to access the SAVE Program for voter verification services: Florida, Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina -- plus five counties in Arizona. Several additional states have pending applications including Virginia, Oregon and Georgia. Our ruling The League of Women Voters in Florida said, "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has already warned that this (SAVE) database is not a foolproof means of verifying the voter rolls." That warning is essentially what the federal government conveyed in a document that explains SAVE may not be able to show citizenship status for all voters. The document didn't use the literal word "foolproof" but that is the message that the feds tried to communicate to the state. SAVE is intended to show if someone is not a U.S. citizen -- it is not a full database of people who are citizens. A state elections official said that SAVE isn't "foolproof," but the state argues that it is the best available resource. We rate this claim True.

pomt-12340	Says the Senate Intelligence Committee has held 10 public hearings this year, "more than double that held by the committee in any recent year."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/jun/14/richard-burr/russia-investigation-senate-hearings-have-uncommon/	As the investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign continues, has one side-effect been increased transparency on Capitol Hill? That’s what North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr said Tuesday as he kicked off the latest hearing in the Russia saga, this time with Attorney General Jeff Sessions under oath. The week before that, it was former FBI director James Comey. Both testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Burr, the committee’s chairman, said he wants the American people to hear what key officials have to say, "so that they may make their own judgments" on the investigation. "It is for that reason that this is the committee’s 10th open hearing of 2017 — more than double that held by the committee in any recent year — and the fifth on the topic of Russian interference," Burr said Tuesday. We wondered if Burr was right about how transparent his committee has been while conducting this investigation. Just six months into Trump’s presidency, has the committee investigating Russia ties already been so much more publicly active than in previous years? What the committee does The Senate Intelligence Committee, as the name implies, is tasked with overseeing the nation’s intelligence agencies. It gets briefed on classified missions and threats, helps write secret portions of the federal budget, vets the president’s nominees for high-level intelligence jobs and conducts investigations into intelligence-related matters. For nearly a year now, Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. election (including in Burr’s home state of North Carolina) have been a major national news story. And Burr is correct that his committee has held 10 open hearings already in 2017, including five related to the Trump/Russia investigation. In fact, Russian election meddling was the very first thing the committee tackled in public this year, on Jan. 10 — before Trump was even sworn in as president. Comparison with recent history So Burr is right on one part of his claim. But is he also right that that amount of hearings substantially outpaces the committee’s recent history? Senate records show that the Senate Intelligence Committee met in public five or fewer times in nearly every year of the Obama administration. That backs up Burr’s claim. Burr took over control of the committee in 2015. Already in the first six months of 2017, he has held more public hearings than in his first two years as chairman combined. This year’s public schedule has also been at least twice as busy as most of the years under his predecessor from 2009-14, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Also noteworthy is that the Senate Intelligence Committee doesn’t have sole responsibility for intelligence investigations. There’s a similar committee in the House of Representatives. And again, Burr’s committee has been more transparent. The House Intelligence Committee has held four hearings this year. Two were closed, one was open and one was mixed. To be clear, Burr’s not particularly happy about the committee’s transparency. "I have said repeatedly that I do not believe anything the committee does should be done in public," Burr said just before he made the claim we’re checking now. Comparison with past investigations Finally, we compared its current Russia investigation with a few others the Senate Intelligence Committee has tackled. Two major investigations the committee wrapped up in 2004 and 2014 were conducted with zero public hearings, although they both ended with a partial report being made public. Those focused on intelligence failures leading up to the Iraq War and the CIA torture program, respectively. (On the torture report, Burr has fought fiercely to seize every copy of the full, still-classified 6,700-page report to keep it from being leaked or made public through a lawsuit.) This year’s action has clearly been more transparent than those. However, it pales in comparison to the 1987 investigation into the Iran-Contra Affair under President Ronald Reagan. That year, investigative committees in both the House and Senate interviewed 500 people over the course of 40 days of public hearings, according to a book by L. Britt Snider, who was the Senate Intelligence Committee’s top lawyer during that investigation and later became the CIA’s inspector general. Our ruling Burr bragged about the transparency of his Senate committee’s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. He said Sessions’ testimony was the 10th public hearing his committee has had already in 2017, "more than double that held by the committee in any recent year." Burr is right, and the committee has also been holding more public hearings now than its House counterpart, as well as more than it did during past investigations into topics like CIA torture, intelligence failures leading up to the Iraq War and intelligence failures before 9/11.

pomt-03142	President Barack Obama "had the legal authority" to strike Syria without a vote from Congress.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/12/joe-lieberman/joe-lieberman-says-obama-had-legal-authority-strik/	For people who strongly favor U.S. action against Syria, one of the questions they’re asking is why President Barack Obama hasn’t acted already. Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., who supports intervention, faced that question on CNN’s Crossfire. Host S.E. Cupp asked, "After two years and 100,000 people dead, two chemical attacks, (and) two million refugees, why is pausing yet again to dither on this conflict the smart or moral decision? "Well, I wish we were not pausing," Lieberman said, adding, "I was really surprised and disappointed when he decided to toss it to Congress. He was right. He had the legal authority to do it himself. I wish he had done it." We wondered whether Lieberman was right. (Lieberman was traveling and did not respond.) United States law The Constitution and the War Powers Resolution set the terms for military engagement. In Article II, Section 2, the Constitution says the president is commander in chief of the armed forces. Then, in Article I, Section 8, it assigns the right to declare war to Congress. The last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II, when Franklin Roosevelt was president. Since then, presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions. In 1973, Congress, frustrated with the Vietnam War, passed the War Powers Resolution, which was enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon. The resolution required that, in the absence of a declaration of war, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and must terminate the use of U.S. armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise. No president has ever conceded that Congress can limit the president’s power as commander in chief. Even as Obama announced that he would seek a congressional resolution, he affirmed that "I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization." Presidents have danced around the War Powers Resolution. They will report military engagement to Congress but specifically omit mention of the section of the law, Section 4(a)(1), that triggers the 60-day limit. Only one president, Gerald Ford, has ever referred to that clause in a report to Congress. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush never did. There is debate over the legal weight of the War Powers Resolution and what the Constitution allows. Sen. Rand Paul, R- Ky., who appeared on CNN’s Crossfire on Sept. 9, seemed to invoke both against presidential authority. Paul speculated on what Obama would do if Congress voted against the use of force in Syria. "The real question is would he even abide by our verdict, would he abide by the congressional verdict," Paul said. "Would he obey the Constitution and say, ‘I've been told I don't have authority; therefore, I can't do it?’" But in a case involving Clinton and Kosovo, the courts have said members of Congress lack the standing to sue to get a president to comply with the War Powers Resolution. The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal, letting the decision stand. During the Libyan conflict, Walter Dellinger -- former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton -- wrote that by regulating the principle that the president "may introduce troops into hostilities or potential hostilities without prior authorization by the Congress," the War Powers Resolution effectively confirms that the president can act unilaterally. Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said while the Constitution trumps all other laws, "many legal scholars have concluded that the War Powers Resolution unconstitutionally restricts the president's authority." Arend said the president has the authority for "quick, limited uses of force." Other experts we’ve asked have generally agreed with this line of argument. In short, even under the War Powers Resolution, the president can send in forces without approval from Congress. An unresolved legal issue is what happens if forces are kept in place for a longer period of time, but at this moment, no one is proposing that military option. Lieberman was discussing whether Obama had the legal authority to act without Congress within the framework of U.S. law. We should note that there's a separate question of whether the United States as a country would have legal authority to attack Syria; we addressed that question in a separate story. Here, we're only considering Obama's legal authority within the context of U.S. law. Our ruling Lieberman said the president has the authority to use force on his own when it comes to limited military strikes. There is ample precedent under many presidents to support that view. The War Powers Resolution creates a process for a president to act first and ask for permission later. Lower courts have ruled in favor of the White House in the use of force, and the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal on that point. Until the court rules otherwise, presidential prerogative is the law of the land. We rate the claim True.

pomt-09745	A report by the health insurance industry "ignores some of the key policies that are part of the Senate Finance Committee bill."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/13/nancy-ann-deparle/study-health-insurers-says-premiums-will-rise-its-/	The day before an important vote in a Senate committee, the health insurance industry group released a report saying that health care reform will dramatically increase the cost of insurance. The Obama administration attacked the report as a last-ditch effort to derail reform. "I was disappointed to see that the health insurance industry had contrived a report like this at the last minute, right on the eve of a historic vote," said Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform. The report "ignores some of the key policies that are part of the Senate Finance Committee bill, such as the health insurance exchange, which is really a central feature that allows people to be pooled together to save administrative costs and to lower people's cost in achieving getting coverage," DeParle said. For this item, we're checking DeParle's statement that the report ignores parts of the bill that would reduce costs. The 26-page report was put together by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It examined four parts of a bill under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee. The report examined four separate parts of the bill and found that all of them would increase costs for health insurance companies and health care providers. These increased costs would then most likely be passed on to consumers. Among the report's complaints about the Finance Committee bill: • Weak mandate. The legislation requires insurance companies to cover everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions. The report says this might be all right if everyone were required to buy insurance, but the rules requiring people to buy coverage are weak and take too long to phase in. That means insurers would have to raise rates overall to pay for coverage of sick people that they can currently exclude from coverage. • Excise taxes on "Cadillac" plans. Insurance companies would pay an extra tax on the most generous health insurance plans people buy. The report said these taxes would be passed directly to consumers, and they projected that more plans would meet the definition of a "Cadillac" plan. • Increased cost-shifting. The report claims that Medicare pays health care providers below cost for treatment, so the providers have to charge people with private insurance more. If the legislation reduces payments for Medicare, that means people with private insurance will be charged more, according to the study. • Taxes on medical devices. The Senate Finance Committee bill raises taxes for the makers of certain medical devices, particularly the more expensive devices such as pacemakers and X-ray machines. The report says these taxes also would be passed on to consumers and result in higher premiums. DeParle's criticism is that the report doesn't consider other parts of the bill that would lower costs for consumers. In particular, she points to health insurance exchanges, online marketplaces where people could comparison-shop for policies that meet their preferences for coverage and cost. We read the report and found that DeParle is correct. The report does isolate aspects of the bill without considering the overall effects. It does not appear to consider how incentives or administrative efficiencies could result in reduced costs. The report even acknowledges that. "The reform packages under consideration have other provisions that we have not included in this analysis," the report states. "We have not estimated the impact of the new subsidies on the net insurance cost to households. Also, if other provisions in health care reform are successful in lowering costs over the long term, those improvements would offset some of the impacts we have estimated." This caveat makes the report's findings incomplete, so we're skeptical that the specific dollar figures it presents as cost increases will reflect actual outcomes for consumers. However, it is reasonable to think that health insurance companies will pass on increased costs to consumers to the extent that they are able, which would drive up premiums. So the report isn't entirely off base, but it does present its evidence selectively. The report did not derail Democrats' hopes for a successful vote in the Senate Finance Committee. The proposal was approved 14-9, with Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine joining the Democrats. The next step is for the Senate Finance bill to be combined with a bill from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. Getting back to our ruling, DeParle criticized the health insurance industry report on the grounds that it was an incomplete analysis. She said it "ignores some of the key policies that are part of the Senate Finance Committee bill." The report itself admits as much. We rate her statement True.

pomt-12223	Says of Georgia, "for four years in a row, we are the No. 1 state to do business in."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/jul/19/casey-cagle/lt-gov-cagle-says-georgia-no-1-state-business/	Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle has pitched his candidacy for Georgia governor as a promise to maintain Georgia’s reputation as one of the most business-friendly states in the country. "Keep Georgia the No. 1 state to do business," the Republican's campaign website says. "There is no doubt. When you look today, for four years in a row we are the No. 1 state to do business in, and there is room to grow," Cagle told small-business owners in Thomasville, Ga., June 22, according to WALB news. Is that true? In saying Georgia is the No. 1 state to do business, Cagle was citing a list put together by Site Selection, a magazine that specializes in business relocation and expansion, campaign spokesman Joseph Hendricks told us. Site Selection said Georgia had the best business climate in the country for the fourth year in a row. As evidence of Georgia’s success, the Site Selection article pointed to growth in foreign direct investment and the film, health and auto industries. It also listed several major corporations that have recently decided to expand in Georgia: athletic shoes manufacturer Adidas, health benefits company Anthem, diversified technology company Honeywell, and tire manufacturer Sentury Tire. Site Selection is the "go-to magazine for site selection professionals," said Jeff Humphreys, director of the Simon S. Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia Terry College of Business. Cagle is far from the only Georgia official to reference the Site Selection ranking. It's been touted by the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Gov. Nathan Deal and the Georgia Chamber of Commerce. Site Selection is a credible source, experts told us — but they added it’s not the only one. Among the better-known and respected rankings, CNBC places Georgia second, while Forbes places it seventh. Those aren’t first-place rankings, but they’re still pretty high. Other credible rankings, though, have Georgia lower. The Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research, for instance, placed Georgia 24th. Indeed, when researchers at Ball State University created a composite score for each state using a number of these best-state-for-business rankings, their measure placed Georgia No. 15 in 2016. That’s basically in the top one-third of states. "The problem with rankings always lies in the factors they include," said John E. Gnuschke, director of the Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Memphis. "No standard scale exists for saying that one state is better." The Site Selection methodology gives half its weight to a survey of corporate site selectors, and the other half to an index of seven metrics, including facility locations and expansions, total projects, and tax burdens. "This topic is an enormous can of methodological worms," said Lee McPheters, an economist at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. As researchers at Arizona State University noted in a 2014 report, the list of factors important in siting a headquarters or research and development facility "can be quite different from the most important factors in locating a manufacturing plant or some other type of facility." In addition, experts said, the question of how much weight to give to low business taxes and regulation ultimately owes something to a value judgment about what’s important. Michael Leeds, who chairs the economics department at Temple University, cautioned that "the best place ‘to do business’ is not always the best place to work." Our ruling Cagle, talking about his state of Georgia, said, "for four years in a row, we are the No. 1 state to do business in." A well-regarded business magazine, Site Selection, has listed Georgia as its best state for business for the past four years. But that’s just one publication’s ranking; others offered different ratings, and it’s impossible to say that one methodology is the perfect one. Cagle's statement is partially accurate.

pomt-14960	To abide by Environmental Protection Agency rules when mining or drilling you have "to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/oct/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-epa-rule-covers-water-barely-bigg/	On the presidential campaign trail in Ohio, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called for reversing some of President Barack Obama’s environmental policies and vowed to allow more drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Rubio argued that Environmental Protection Agency rules are too burdensome, pointing to two businesspeople who joined him at his speech, James Mackall, president of Artex Oil, and Tom Mackall, president of East Fairfield Coal. "The EPA has unilaterally changed how the Clean Water Act is interpreted. Now it not only protects rivers and lakes, but also drainage ditches and private retaining ponds. So when mining or drilling, Jerry and Tom now have to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle." We wondered: Does the Clean Water Act allow the government to regulate how mining and drilling affects bodies of water "barely bigger than a puddle?" A spokesman for Rubio declined to comment. However, Rubio was presumably referring to a recent rule change to the Clean Water Act in which "puddles" have emerged as a matter of contention. A Clean Water Act rule change stayed by court First, some background. The Clean Water Act originally passed in 1972, in the wake of a highly publicized incident in which Ohio’s Cuyahoga River caught fire. Another factor that led to the passage of the federal law was a record number of fish kills caused by pollution -- of which the largest was in Florida at Lake Thonotosassa in 1969. Broadly, its goal was to regulate discharges. But which bodies of water should be included has been a hotly contested issue for many years. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty about the law’s reach. EPA officials said those decisions rolled back federal protections for about 60 percent of streams and for millions of acres of wetlands. In May 2015, the EPA announced a new rule intended to clarify which bodies of water fall under the act. The new rule followed months of public comment and took effect on Aug. 28, except in 13 states where a court held up its enactment. Then, earlier this month, a different court held up enactment nationwide. The first thing to know about the new rule is that size doesn’t matter. What matters is whether a body of water can carry pollution into other larger waters. Under the rule, the federal government intends to regulate bodies of water -- including tributaries, ponds, streams, and wetlands -- so that companies or other entities do not dump waste that could flow into larger ecosystems. This definition of a water of federal jurisdiction actually pre-dates the new rule, stemming instead from the Supreme Court cases. In 2001, the court held that the use of "isolated" non-navigable intrastate ponds by migratory birds was not by itself a sufficient basis to apply the Clean Water Act. In the 2006 case, Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded that a critical factor in determining whether the Clean Water Act applies is whether a water has a ‘‘significant nexus’’ to traditional navigable waters. So a narrow stream -- even if it dries up for part of the year -- could still fall under federal jurisdiction if it can flow into more significant waters during the rainy season. But an isolated pond that doesn’t connect to other major waters doesn’t fall under the jurisdiction of the act. "Even if some very small bodies of water may be covered by the Clean Water Act when they are sufficiently connected with another body of water, his statement evokes the image of a small, isolated body of water that would not be covered," said Todd Aagaard, vice dean at Villanova law school and former Justice Department environmental lawyer. Even though jurisdiction under the act is determined by connectedness, rather than size, it was the size of water bodies that became a rallying cry for critics who saw the new rule as federal overreach. During the comment period, the regulation of puddles became a talking point for conservatives and business advocates. Presumably for that reason, the final rule explicitly addressed the question of puddles: "The proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a 'water of the United States,' and it is an inexact term. A puddle is commonly considered a very small, shallow, and highly transitory pool of water that forms on pavement or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or similar precipitation event. However, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. The final rule does so." The rule also specifically excludes certain types of water in addition to puddles, including groundwater, most ditches and small ornamental waters, for example. So would it include puddles or anything similar? So if the rule specifically says puddles do not fall under the rule’s jurisdiction, why have critics continued to argue that it encompasses puddles or something not much bigger? We interviewed seven environmental experts, including one who works for an organization that sued the EPA. All of them were skeptical that the rule would cover anything resembling a puddle. That’s because a small body like a puddle, or something a little larger, that doesn’t connect to other waters should have no ultimate impact on the types of navigable waters the Clean Water Act regulates. "What type of water body is barely bigger than a puddle? How large is the puddle? If he is referring to a small puddle that a kid splashes in, a fair reading of the rule is that it does not cover such an area," said Stetson University law professor Royal Gardner, an expert in wetland law and policy. Meanwhile, Rubio specifically mentioned mining and drilling -- two activities that are already highly regulated. While mining and drilling can adversely affect groundwater, the law explicitly excludes groundwater. We reached out to some of the industry groups that have sued the EPA over the rule, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S Chamber of Commerce. Both argue that the rule language is so broad that it could ultimately include something not much larger than a puddle. Don Parrish, a senior adviser to the federation, pointed to the first footnote in the new rule: "The agencies use the term ‘water’ and ‘waters’ in categorical reference to rivers, streams, ditches, wetlands, ponds, lakes, oxbows, and other types of natural or man-made aquatic systems, identifiable by the water contained in these aquatic systems or by their chemical, physical, and biological indicators. The agencies use the terms ‘waters’ and ‘water bodies’ interchangeably in this preamble." To Parrish, this means "you don’t even need water in them. You just need indicators of chemicals, physical and biological indicators. What in the hell is that? It's very broad." Asked for real-world examples in which the EPA regulated something roughly the size of a puddle, farm bureau spokesman Will Rodger sent us a photograph of a farm field in Tennessee that appears to show the beginning of a nearly dry stream. He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declared this swath of land as "waters of the United States" by virtue of being a tributary. (This occurred in 2014 before the new rule took effect.) Environmental experts we checked with said that water on land that appears even during only part of the year can end up flowing to larger bodies of water. But again, the key is that the water must be poised to flow into other significant waters, which seems distinct from a small, isolated puddle. "It’s true that headwaters of streams are small, but small rivulets goes into a river," said Karl Coplan, of Pace law school. "The whole point of the Clean Water Act is to cover that river up to the point where it starts." Environmental experts, for their part, said they could not think of any examples in which the EPA attempted to regulate something barely bigger than a puddle. "It is an absurd assertion, said William L. Andreen, University of Alabama law professor. "There are no cases on point because the agencies have never asserted jurisdiction in such fantastical situations." Our ruling Rubio said that to abide by EPA rules when mining or drilling you have "to take caution not to disturb bodies of water barely bigger than a puddle." A new final rule -- currently on hold due to lawsuits -- does seek to clarify what types of bodies of water the EPA can oversee through the Clean Water Act. But the rule explicitly excludes puddles, along with most ditches and ornamental bodies of water. In addition, the key factor for determining Clean Water Act jurisdiction is how connected a body of water is, not how big or small it is. To the extent that a puddle, or something slightly larger, shouldn’t be a "significant" contributor to bigger, navigable waters located far away -- a standard set by the 2006 Supreme Court decision -- it should not be subject to regulation under the new rule. This issue remains in litigation, but the best evidence we have collected suggests that Rubio’s claim is at least significantly exaggerated.

pomt-12959	"Electoral College elector commits suicide to avoid voting for Donald Trump."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/03/universe-politics/fake-news-michigan-gop-elector-didnt-choose-suicid/	Readers should not put any faith in a fake news story about a would-be faithless elector who chose death over Donald Trump. "Electoral College elector commits suicide to avoid voting for Donald Trump," read a Dec. 19, 2016, headline on UniversePolitics.com. It appeared the same day members of the Electoral College voted to officially elect Trump the 45th president. The story said a 47-year-old Michigan elector named Jeremy Hashville killed himself in an absurdly complicated fashion, revealing in a note that he could not bear to vote for Trump. The post was flagged by Facebook as part of the company’s efforts to fight fake news online. Nothing about the story or its extreme premise is accurate. For starters, we found no evidence of an elector named Jeremy Hashville, in Michigan or any other state. While there had been a lot of talk about electors potentially switching their votes to deny Trump the 270 needed to win the Electoral College, little came of it. Only two Republican electors, from Texas, changed their votes to avoid choosing Trump (another Texan elector had resigned and was replaced). No electors nationwide committed suicide. Michigan electors said prior to the vote that they were not going to attempt to flip, but they couldn’t have even if they had wanted to do so. Electors in Michigan are bound by state law to vote for the winner of the state’s presidential election. If they don’t, they will be replaced with someone who will. A photo included with the story said it was of Hashville, but was actually an Associated Press image of Washington state Democratic elector Bret Chiafalo. He was part of an effort called the Hamilton Electors — members of the Electoral College who hoped to flip enough Republican electors to deny Trump the presidency. (Their effort clearly failed.) There’s nothing on the UniversePolitics.com site to indicate the story was fake, but it did include a source link to another site called WorldNewsDailyReport.com. The same story and photo appeared on that site, which says in a disclaimer that the posts on the site are "entirely fictional." We attempted to contact both websites but did not get a response from either. But it’s clear that the story is completely made up, and posted in an attempt to capitalize on a real event.

pomt-03698	The "working tax cut" created "over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/apr/19/associated-industries-florida/associated-industries-florida-says-insurance-tax-c/	Good news, opponents of job growth (whoever you are): Tallahassee lawmakers are out to make it harder and costlier to create jobs. That’s the thrust of a TV ad airing in Tampa Bay from the business-backed lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida. The group does not want the insurance industry to lose a tax break it has enjoyed for more than three decades. Here’s the transcript: "It's the working tax cut that creates jobs -- over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years. Major employers are moving to Florida and hiring. That's growth our economy needs. But now some in Tallahassee want to end it and make it harder and more expensive to create jobs. It doesn't make sense. Say no to Senate Bill 1832. Keep the working tax cut. Keep the jobs." The ad ignores the real keywords of this debate, which are "insurance companies" and "motor vehicle registration fees." "Working tax cut" is a euphemism for "taxpayer-subsidized premium tax credit." Since 1987, insurance companies use a 15 percent premium tax credit for Florida-based employees, excluding insurance agents. The Senate’s chief budget-writer, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, proposed eliminating the tax credit in exchange for rolling back the Legislature’s 2009 hike on motor vehicle registration fees, a move that will save vehicle owners $12 a year. We wondered what evidence AIF had to support its claim that this 26-year-old tax cut created 40,000 jobs in the last four years. Debunking the jobs number AIF’s public relations consultant, Bascom Communications and Consulting, directed us to 2009 and 2011 reports about the state’s insurance industry by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the 2012 report is not out yet). The reports run a year or two behind for job estimates for the industry. The 2011 annual report references 2010 jobs data, and the 2009 report includes 2007 jobs data. According to state reports, the insurance industry accounted for 144,184 jobs in Florida in 2007 and grew to 188,290 in 2010. Boom, AIF says, 44,106 new insurance jobs created. Not so fast. This picture of dramatic jobs growth is not supported by evidence. The state reports cited by AIF say their jobs data is backed up by two sources: the Bureau of Economic Analysis, run by the U.S. Department of Commerce; and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, run by the U.S. Department of Labor. State insurance regulators were still collecting information about how it compiles its data by our deadline. It appears, though, that the dramatic jobs growth AIF is crowing about is the result of the state using two very different starting places to calculate job growth. Here's what most likely happened: The state's count for insurance jobs in 2007 (the 144,184 number) is backed by BEA jobs data for full- and part-time wage and salary employees, excluding proprietors and general partners. But the 2010 state number relied on a different calculation, one that includes proprietors and general partners. It's a significant difference. An apples-to-apples comparison of job growth -- whether or not you include proprietors and general partners -- shows that the state actually lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010. We'll say that again. If the state compared the same set of data -- either one -- they would have found that the state lost insurance industry jobs between 2007 and 2010. BLS data does not help, either. From December 2007 to December 2010, the industry gained 100 jobs, according to BLS. Not 40,000. Does the credit lead to jobs? Tax credits save businesses money. But is this one entirely responsible for an uptick in insurance jobs? "Extremely unlikely," said William Seyfried, Rollins College economics professor. "General economic conditions and other factors would be expected to have a larger impact." Florida should enact a premium tax break for every industry "and just watch the jobs pour in," joked Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist. The business-backed research and advocacy group Florida TaxWatch created a brief report detailing its concerns with ending the tax credit, which the group said was created to encourage "mobile jobs" that are administrative or in call centers (our analysis does not get into whether the credit created the kind of jobs it was supposed to, though lobbyists ticked off a few recent examples of call centers opening in Tampa and other Florida cities recently). TaxWatch argued this tax cut, while not the primary reason companies come to Florida, may be the tie-breaker, and it offsets the insurance industry’s disproportionate tax burden compared to other industries. "While there has been no research attempting to show a direct correlation between the tax credit and growth of the insurance industry in Florida," the report states, "it is hard to argue that Florida’s business climate is more attractive to insurers with the credit than without it." AIF's own lobbyist, Brewster Bevis, said at an April 18 committee hearing on SB 1832, "One of the reasons for the job creation and industry growth in the face of national economic uncertainty has been the attractiveness of Florida as a place to do business due to the premium tax cut that this bill would do away with." Several insurance lobbyists at the meeting testified SB 1832 would increase the industry’s tax burden on top of what carriers will pay in additional taxes under the new national health care law. Several Republican senators were skeptical, saying the Legislature had historically worked to improve the business climate for the insurance industry and too many years had passed since the tax incentive was reviewed. Repealing the insurance tax credit would bring about $230 million to state coffers each year, which would pay for reducing motor vehicle fees, according to a committee analysis. "Not only will this bill rid our state of an antiquated government subsidy for the insurance industry, but, more importantly, it will keep money in the pockets of our hard-working taxpayers," said Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, in a statement. Our ruling AIF rolled out a big ad campaign to combat SB 1832, saying the insurance industry’s "working tax cut" created "over 40,000 new jobs in just the last four years." The problem is the number, which is cherry-picked and wrong. And even if the jobs number was right -- and again, it's not -- experts say the tax cut would only be one factor in a company's decision to expand operations in Florida.

pomt-06165	"In this country … we have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-us-natural-gas-greater-supply-sa/	Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman says that protecting the environment while securing new sources of energy and creating jobs will be a "balancing act" for the next president. "The job we've got to undertake as American people is to fuel our future," Huntsman said in a Republican presidential debate in Iowa on Dec. 15, 2011. Where does he want to find the fuel? Right here at home. Huntsman frequently decries U.S. dependence on foreign oil while trumpeting the need for energy independence. To support his point, in the debate he cited a statistic that "in this country … we have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil." Our New Hampshire team checked this exact claim before and found that Huntsman is comparing apples and oranges and getting it wrong. Complex math PolitiFact's New Hampshire team contacted the U.S. Energy Information Administration to break down the issue, which involves comparing energy sources that are measured differently. Oil supplies are calculated in barrels, while natural gas supplies are calculated in cubic feet. And the two fuels have different energy content, which means it takes still more math to compare them. Converting the energy content into the standard measure British thermal units, 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 165 million barrels of crude oil, according to Steven Grape, an EIA expert in the Office of Oil, Gas, and Coal Supply Statistics. In addition, there are two ways to look at how much of each resource is available. One is to look at proved reserves -- those that are likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions. Another, more uncertain approach is to look at technically recoverable resources. These are resources that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost. Starting with proved reserves, Saudi Arabia has 24 percent of the world’s proved reserves of crude oil, or about 264 billion barrels, Grape said. The U.S. proved reserves of natural gas are 284 trillion cubic feet. Punch those figures into the equation, and U.S. proved reserves are equal in energy content to about 46.8 billion barrels of oil -- considerably less than Saudi Arabia's proved reserves of oil. Now let’s look at the technically recoverable figures. Resource estimates for Saudi Arabia are thought to be as high as 700 billion barrels of crude oil, and the technically recoverable resource estimate for the United States is about 2,500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, which is equivalent to 412.5 billion barrels of oil. Again, that's much less than the 700 billion barrel estimate for Saudi Arabia. Current production Huntsman’s claim is correct only if taken to be referring to production. "We don’t have more natural gas in this country than Saudi Arabia has oil, but we produce more natural gas in this country per year than Saudi Arabia produces oil," Grape said. The U.S. produces the equivalent of 12.14 million barrels per day, compared with Saudi Arabia's 9.8 million barrels of oil per day, Grape said. But Huntsman didn’t say we "produce" more natural gas than Saudi Arabia produces oil. He said we "have" more. Our ruling In the debate, Huntsman said, "we have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil." By two of the three measures to consider that claim, Huntsman is off base. Looking at proved resources, Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are far larger than U.S. natural gas reserves. Considering technically recoverable resources, Saudi Arabia is still the front runner. Only when comparing current production levels does Huntsman’s statistic hold up. But Huntsman didn’t refer to production. Additionally, in talking about moving America toward energy independence, we think reserves are more relevant than current production and rule his claim Mostly False.

pomt-03239	Says that each year, about 25,000 American women become pregnant through rape or incest.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/aug/15/wendy-davis/surveys-show-wide-disagreement-number-rape-related/	In an opinion piece in the July 15, 2013, Washington Post, state Sen. Wendy Davis gave reasons "why I stood up for Texas women" in a filibuster against abortion restrictions that drew national attention. Among them: "Each year, about 25,000 American women ... become pregnant through rape or incest," wrote the Fort Worth Democrat. A Democratic effort to exclude victims of rape and incest from the Texas restrictions eventually proved futile, as did Davis’ filibuster; the measure was signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry on July 18, 2013. We remained curious about Davis’ rape-or-incest statistic. Davis spokesman Rick Svatora told us via email that the number came from a media fact sheet posted online by NARAL Pro Choice America, an abortion rights advocacy group formerly called the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. The fact sheet says, "Each year, approximately 25,000 women in the United States become pregnant as a result of rape." There are no incest pregnancy statistics on the sheet, and we found none in other sources. Dean Kilpatrick, director of the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, told us by phone that although rape and incest often are mentioned together in abortion laws, there is little research on incest, a difficult area to study for reasons that include underreporting. By email, Svatora provided two articles on rape-related pregnancy: A 1996 Medical University of South Carolina analysis of the federally-funded 1990-92 National Women’s Study of 3,031 women over 18. (Kilpatrick worked on both the study and the analysis.) The analysis concluded that among rape victims aged 12 to 45, 5 percent of rapes resulted in pregnancies, and, using the study’s figure of 683,000 "forcible rapes" in 1990, estimated that "there may be 32,101 rape-related pregnancies annually among American women older than 18 years." A 2000 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, using the 1996 analysis’ estimated rate of 5 percent pregnancies from rape, assumed a 50 percent drop in rapes since 1992 to reach an estimate of 25,000 pregnancies from rape in 1998. The NARAL Pro Choice America fact sheet attributes its 25,000 figure to the 2000 article, and a spokeswoman for the group, Samantha Gordon, said via email that is its most recent estimate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don’t keep data on pregnancy due to rape, nor does the U.S. Department of Justice, spokeswomen told us via email, while spokesman Greg Phillips at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the 32,000 figure is "the best estimate we have now." Kilpatrick said reasons why the 1996 analysis he worked on is still cited include the National Women’s Study’s large population sample and the fact that more recent research has tended to support its 5 percent rate. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, a Washington, D.C.-based charity, reached a much lower figure by doing the same calculation with an estimate from the Justice Department’s 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey. On its website, the network takes the survey’s annual average of 64,080 rapes committed in 2004 and 2005 and applies the 5 percent pregnancy rate to reach an estimate of 3,204 pregnancies a year from rape. That’s ten times less than the 1996 estimate of 32,000. The biggest reason for that difference: According to federal statistics, rapes -- like other violent crimes -- declined significantly in the U.S. during those years. Crime experts have said the decline shown by federal data that began in the 1990s was part of a long-term pattern. They cited falling crack cocaine use, a strong economy and other societal factors, with some citing tougher police strategies. A March 2013 federal Bureau of Justice Statistics report, "Female Victims of Sexual Violence, 1994-2010," compiled statistics from the National Crime Victimization Survey showing that average annual completed rapes dropped 65 percent from 402,000 in 1995 to 143,300 in 2010. Using the method the 1996 and 2000 researchers did -- multiplying the rape counts by the 5 percent pregnancy rate -- we calculated that there could have been 20,100 pregnancies from rape in 1995 and many fewer, 7,165, in 2010. On the other hand, Kilpatrick disagreed with the results of the federal survey, which he said misses most rape cases in large part because its questions are framed in the context of crime and can leave doubt about exactly what’s being asked. An Interviewee, he said, might respond "no" to the question "Have you ever been raped?" but answer yes when asked if she had ever experienced specific behaviors such as a man forcing his penis into her vagina. He and his colleagues estimated higher numbers of rapes in the 1990-92 survey and in a 2007 follow-up, estimating in both studies that only about 17 percent of rapes were reported. In fact, their data showed a 61 percent increase from 1990 to 2006, from 683,000 to 1.1 million rapes. Kilpatrick noted that a 2010 CDC report found a similar total -- 1.3 million women raped in the previous 12 months. His work indicated the percentage of women raped has not changed significantly since the 1990s, he said, while the U.S. population increased. Applying the 5 percent pregnancy rate to a rounded estimate of 1 million rapes yields his 50,000 figure. We also checked FBI-collected crime statistics, mindful that they include only rapes reported to local law enforcement agencies. In 2011, according to the FBI’s most recent finalized rape statistics, 83,425 forcible rapes were reported to law enforcement. Multiplying that by the 5 percent rate suggests 4,171 pregnancies resulting from reported rapes that year. If that FBI figure represented about 20 percent of rapes committed, in line with Kilpatrick’s research, the total would be 417,125 rapes. Applying the 5 percent pregnancy rate suggests about 20,900 pregnancies could have resulted from rape in 2011. To sum up, we found or calculated these estimates cited from 2010 through 2012, all taking into account unreported plus reported, all based on an assumption of 5 percent chance of pregnancy: 3,200 -- From national anti-sexual-violence organization. 7,165 -- Our calculation with federal data for 2010 released in 2013. 20,900 -- Our calculation with FBI reported-rape data for 2011, adjusting for assumption that only 20 percent of rapes were reported. 32,000 -- Based on 1990 study but still in use by the obstetricians and gynecologists’ group. 50,000 -- Kilpatrick’s estimate based on 2007 and 2010 research showing approximately 1 million rapes. By phone, Svatora noted that Davis’ number fell within that range. Our ruling Davis said, "Each year, about 25,000 American women ... become pregnant through rape or incest." She offered no backup for the incest part of the statement, and we found none. Estimates of rape-related pregnancies per year vary from 3,200 to 50,000. Davis’ number, despite dating from 1998, fits inside that range, but there is too much disagreement for us -- or Davis -- to pin any one statistic as the definitive number of rape-related pregnancies per year. We rate her statement as Half True.	None	Wendy Davis	None	None	None	2013-08-15T15:16:11	2013-07-15	['United_States']
pomt-08508	"It’s coming. Nobody can stop this train."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/07/raymond-lahood/transportation-secretary-raymond-lahood-says-nothi/	When it comes to the proposed $810 million high-speed rail link between Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin’s gubernatorial candidates are on opposite sides of the tracks. Democrat Tom Barrett strongly favors the link, one of 13 rail projects nationwide that are part of an $8 billion federal stimulus allocation. President Barack Obama has made the projects a cornerstone of his transportation agenda. And outgoing Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle is hustling to get the Milwaukee-to-Madison train rolling. Meanwhile, Republican gubernatorial hopeful Scott Walker has vowed repeatedly to stop the project "dead in its tracks." That’s a strong statement. So is this one from U.S. Transportation Secretary Raymond LaHood, who on two separate visits to Wisconsin flatly declared the train could not be stopped. "It’s coming," he said at a Labor Day rally in Milwaukee. "Nobody can stop this train." LaHood’s statement was not one of opinion, a promise for the future or a prediction on what is likely to happen. It was stated as fact. So we wondered: Is it true none can stop the project? We tried to talk to LaHood, a former Republican U.S. House member from Illinois, minutes after his Labor Day speech, but he declined to be interviewed. His office refused follow up interview requests. Like Walker, Republicans running for governor in several other states have declared their opposition to proposed high-speed rail lines. In Ohio, John Kasich has vowed to block the "3C" train that would link Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati; In Florida, Rick Scott opposes service between Tampa and Orlando; and in California, Meg Whitman is against a San Francisco-Los Angeles line. For his part, LaHood has called the rail projects an important economic development tool and is baffled by the opposition. "We're talking about nothing short of transforming transportation much the same way the interstate highway system did under President Eisenhower," LaHood wrote on his blog Oct. 5, 2010, a day after a New York Times article looked at opposition to the projects. "Can you imagine if Ohio or Wisconsin or any other state had said, "No, thanks -- we don't think that highway thing is going anywhere?" Let’s start with a little background on the Wisconsin project. In January, the state’s application for an extension of Amtrak’s Milwaukee-Chicago Hiawatha line won $810 million in federal funds. Plans call for service to reach 79 mph in 2013 and 110 mph by 2015 -- actually not a high speed train compared with "bullet train" service of up to 220 mph planned in other parts of the country. The federal government agreed to pay the full cost of building the line, but the state would be required to spend an estimated $8 million a year to run it. The state agreed to buy two 14 car train sets from the Spanish company Talgo for $47 million. Those trains would be built at the former Tower Automotive site on Milwaukee’s north side, creating an initial 125 jobs. Despite the opposition, and the uncertainty of who will win the Nov. 2 election, the Doyle administration in August announced plans to dramatically escalate spending on the train -- from about $50 million to $300 million in 2010 alone. By the end of the year, the state will have spent or entered into contracts for nearly $300 million but won't necessarily have spent that much, according to Cari Ann Renlund, and aide to state Transportation Secretary Frank Busalacchi. The breakdown: $52.4 million for design work on stations and the overall rail corridor, $140 million in contracts for work on building raised land bridges, and up to $100 million in contracts for steel and railroad ties. Of course, a new governor -- and new Legislature -- will take office in January. What could happen then? DOT’s Renlund scheduled and canceled two interviews on the topic. Meanwhile, LaHood’s press secretary Olivia Alair refused to discuss what could happen: "We’re not going to get into speculation about hypothetical scenarios." So we turned to Walker and asked him how he plans to stop a speeding train. He laid out several scenarios: Tie the purse strings. Walker said he would refuse to authorize the annual state operational funding. "If we don’t appropriate that, they can’t operate the train," he said, calling it "the easiest, most direct approach." Cancel the contracts already approved. This could prompt its own legal fight, including from companies who have signed contracts to build trains and supply materials. Walker downplayed that likelihood, arguing "they’re not going to completely alienate themselves" from getting other state work by fighting too hard over the train. Go to court. Walker hinted he might seek an injunction against the train -- even before the election arguing the state shouldn’t have sped up the work. Walker noted the Marquette Interchange was just rebuilt, in part, with federal money that had been set aside years ago for a light-rail system. A similar nothing-can-stop-this declaration back then would not have held much water. Outside experts agreed the train could be stopped, focusing on control by a Gov. Walker of the state Transportation Department. He would probably succeed in canceling the contract with the federal government, they said. "I think he’s got the power to say no," said Erich Zimmermann, senior policy analyst with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington D.C. watchdog group. Steven Polzin, director of mobility policy research at the Center for Urban Transportation Research, University of South Florida, Tampa, said that control of the state Transportation Department is probably the most powerful tool Walker would have. "They could choose not to pursue that project," said Polzin. Zimmermann noted there could be significant economic and political costs to the state if the contracts were cancelled. And Polzin, whose group has been criticized by some for favoring cars over rail, argues the projects have not been adequately studied before they were approved. As for the $810 million, Walker said he would urge Congress to allow the state to use the money for other transportation purposes, such as roads. He noted if Republicans win the House, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, would likely become chairman of the Budget Committee, and may look favorably on that. Of course, Obama would still be around with his veto pen. Zimmermann and Polzin say the cash is likely to just go to rail projects in other states. Of course, all of this gets us well past election day and campaign pledges. By then, whoever is governor may face heavy pressure from business leaders with train-related contracts, labor unions and community leaders to keep the project -- and related jobs -- moving ahead. So, let’s bring this all back to the starting point. In his enthusiastic support for the Milwaukee-to-Madison train, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has proclaimed -- twice -- that the train could not be stopped. That statement overlooks an obvious obstacle: the voters. If Walker wins, experts say he will have numerous avenues open to him to stop the project, even though those steps may carry repercussions. And if Congress turns red, he would have a major ally in the effort. We rate LaHood’s statement False.	None	Raymond LaHood	None	None	None	2010-10-07T09:00:00	2010-09-06	['None']
pomt-11077	Says the "Pope calls for world wide gun confiscation except for the UN"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/20/common-sense-news/fake-news-says-pope-called-world-wide-gun-confisca/	The Common Sense Show, an online program with the tagline "Freeing America one enslaved mind at a time," took Pope Francis to task for his stance on weapons. "The Pope has said we need to take away all guns -- total gun confiscation across the planet " show host Dave Hodges said May 3, 2018. "But he does say the U.N. should be the only group that has guns." Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. We reached out to Hodges through his website to learn the source behind his statement. We didn’t hear back. We searched the Nexis database of news reports and did not find anything that backed up this claim, but it’s possible that he’s conflated a couple of speeches from the pope. Address to the United Nations Pope Francis spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015. There, he called for a world free of nuclear weapons, and an end to "violence against ethnic and religious minorities." Speaking of the Middle East and Africa, he decried the situations where innocent people "have been forced to witness the destruction of their places of worship, their cultural and religious heritage, their houses and property, and have faced the alternative either of fleeing or of paying for their adhesion to good and to peace by their own lives, or by enslavement." In that speech, Francis spoke of "the negative effects of military and political interventions which are not coordinated between members of the international community." If that’s the source of Hodges’ statement, it doesn’t match what he described. There’s no call for universal collection of guns, nor did he specify that the United Nations would be the only group that can coordinate military interventions. In fact, when the pope visited Central African Republic, his call for peace between warring Christian and Muslim factions acknowledged there is an appropriate role for arms. "To all those who unjustly use weapons in this world, I appeal: Put down your weapons of death; arm yourselves instead with justice, love, mercy and authentic guarantees of peace," he said August 2015. Pope Francis opposed the unjust use of weapons, meaning in his eyes, there can be a just use of weapons. In his 2015 speech to the U.S. Congress, Francis also called for an end to the international arms trade. Speech to teens in Turin, Italy Hodges might have also reworked fake news that twisted remarks the pope made three years ago in Turin, Italy, in 2015, when he was at a rally of thousands of young people. The pope was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry. "People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn’t it?" he said, as reported by Reuters. In the minds of some, that translated into the pope saying that gun owners can’t be Christians. We rated that interpretation Pants on Fire. Our ruling An online program said Pope Francis had called for worldwide gun confiscation, except for the United Nations. The pope has not said those words or called for such a change. The most generous reading is that this is based on interpretations of remarks the Pope has made about regional and ethnic conflicts. In keeping with Christian doctrine, one would expect the pope to speak against violence. What is striking is even with that, the pope said that there can be just uses of weapons. We shoot down another bit of fake news and rate this claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Common Sense News	None	None	None	2018-06-20T09:00:00	2018-05-03	['None']
pomt-00496	There were "63 murders this weekend" in Chicago and Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s legacy is "more murders in his city than ever before."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2018/aug/06/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-says-there-were-63-murders-chicago-over-w/	Following another violent weekend on Chicago’s South and West Sides, President Donald Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani unleashed a series of spelling and fact-challenged tweets aimed at pinning responsibility for unprecedented bloodshed on Mayor Rahm Emanuel. "63 murders this weekend in Rahm Emmanuel’s Chicago," wrote Giuliani, the former New York mayor. "His legacy [is] more murders in his city than ever before." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com No and no. Giuliani’s attack was framed around an attempt to give a shout-out to one of Emanuel’s expected challengers in next year’s mayoral election, Garry McCarthy, the former Chicago Police superintendent fired by Emanuel in 2015. Except Giuliani misidentified McCarthy as "Jerry" instead of Garry. "Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades," Giuliani wrote, apparently unaware that McCarthy contends he is a Democrat. "Policing genius Jerry McCarthy can do for Chicago what I did for NYC." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com There’s no question that gun violence remains a great challenge for Chicago, but Giuliani’s claims don’t come close to squaring with reality. Preliminary media reports of the weekend carnage referred to 63 shot, not 63 dead. The figure has since been updated. A spokeswoman for the Chicago Police Department said Monday afternoon that a total of 66 people had been shot between 6 p.m. on Friday and midnight Sunday, 12 of them fatally. That is, undoubtedly, 12 too many, though it also important to note the number of homicides this year are down substantially from 2016 when murders spiked to a two-decade high. To put Giuliani’s claim in perspective, 63 gun-related deaths would be greater than the toll in last October’s mass shooting in Las Vegas where a gunman using high-powered weapons claimed 58 lives. The second beat of Giuliani’s tweet holds up no better. The city suffered 762 murders in 2016, the highest number of Emanuel’s tenure. Still, that is well below the Chicago record of 970 in 1974. Murders also topped well over 900 during several years in the 1990s. The weekend death toll decried by Giuliani was hardly a record, either. On an October weekend in 2016, 17 people were killed in shootings. In 2014, when McCarthy was still running the Chicago police, 13 people were killed and at least 58 wounded during the July 4th weekend despite the deployment of hundreds of extra officers on the streets. Giuliani is hardly the first in Trump’s orbit to to use distorted claims to pick at Chicago’s lamentably persistent rate of gun violence. The president, his spokesperson and his attorney general have all at various times contended that the carnage persists despite the city having the toughest gun laws in the nation. It does not, and we have repeatedly rated such claims as Pants on Fire! The tweet storm from Giuliani fits into that pattern. Our ruling There were too many shooting deaths in Chicago over the weekend, but nowhere near 63. And murders in Chicago began surging in 2016, but the numbers are still well below the city record of 970 set decades ago. The murder tally, while high under Emanuel, is nowhere near the worst in city history. It is possible Giuliani may have confused shootings with murders. Or, he may have simply been misinformed. Or, he may have made it all up. It’s impossible to tell, though it is worth noting that Giuliani’s numbers were quickly and widely called into question by news reports yet he did not seek to clarify them or delete his tweets. But Giuliani is not only a former New York mayor, he was also once a crime-busting U.S. attorney in that city. If anyone should have a feel for what is real and unreal when it comes to urban violence, it’s Giuliani. Yet he disseminated a wildly exaggerated claim, and that is why we rate it Pants on Fire!

obry-00021	In a Feb. 21 tweet from his personal Twitter account, Wisconsin state Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, responded to FOX6 Milwaukee political reporter Theo Keith, writing, “The truth is school shooters almost exclusively have passed background checks.” The reply was in response to a tweet that Keith wrote, linking to a story from Fox6Now describing the passage of a bill in the Wisconsin Assembly that will pay for armed guards in schools. According to Fox6Now, the bill’s passage followed a “raucous debate” in the Assembly, during which GOP leaders rejected a proposal by Democrats for a mandatory background check on all gun sales. The truth is school shooters almost exclusively have passed background checks. Background checks aren’t likely to prevent the shootings while additional security measure may. 	mostly true	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2018/03/19/wisconsin-assembly-leader-most-school-shooters-pass-a-background-check-we-check-it-out/	None	None	None	Mason Muerhoff	None	Wisconsin Assembly leader: Most school shooters pass a background check.

pomt-12643	"Somebody observed this week that you have to go back to the very founding of the government to the first administration of George Washington to find a time when it’s taken longer to put a Cabinet in place."	false	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/25/roy-blunt/fact-check-roy-blunt-wrong-about-donald-trump-cabi/	Last month during Trump’s Cabinet nomination hearings, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt stood up to deliver his support for the confirmation of Jeff Sessions for U.S. Attorney General. To open his remarks, Blunt pointed out how lengthy the process had become. "Somebody observed this week that you have to go back to the very founding of the government to the first administration of George Washington to find a time when it’s taken longer to put a Cabinet in place," Blunt said. Blunt’s claim was made on Feb. 8, 2017 — just 19 days into Trump’s presidency. This seemed like a very short time period to be considered the longest Cabinet appointment process. So we wondered, whose Cabinet took the longest to put in place, and how did Trump compare 19 days in? The data A spokesperson for Blunt provided data taken from the Senate Historical Office to back his claim. The data showed every presidential nominee since 1789, their position, the date of their nomination and whether the nominee was confirmed, withdrawn or rejected. For the purpose of this fact check, we wanted to look at how many days it took after a president was inaugurated for his Cabinet to be completely in place. Part of Blunt’s claim deals with how George Washington’s Cabinet appointment process was the longest and the only one that took longer than Trump’s. So we decided to start there. The Washington administration After counting the number of days between a president’s first elected term inauguration and the date his Cabinet was in place, we found that Washington did in fact rank as the longest. Even though it only took the Senate a day to confirm most of Washington’s nominations, there were still 149 days between the time he was inaugurated and the time his Cabinet was fully in place. Much of this had to do with the fact that the country and its government were so new. The Top 5 After Washington, Barack Obama had the second-longest Cabinet appointment process. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius was confirmed on April 28, 2009 — 98 days after Obama was inaugurated. It took 42 days from the time Sebelius was nominated till the day she was confirmed. She was also just one of four Obama Cabinet members who took longer than the 19-day benchmark that was set by Blunt’s claim. Following Obama, in the third spot was Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson became president in 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so for the purpose of this fact-check, we looked at Johnson’s first elected term in 1965. His Cabinet took 64 days to be finalized, with the confirmation of Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. Fowler. Next is George H.W. Bush, with the fourth-longest Cabinet appointment process. It took 56 days for his Cabinet to be fully in place. Like Obama, four of his nominations also took 19 days or longer to be confirmed. However, one of Bush’s appointments for Secretary of Defense, John G. Tower, was rejected by a 47-53 vote on March 9, 1989. Five days later, Bush nominated Dick Cheney, who was then confirmed on March 17, 1989, to complete his Cabinet. Rounding out the top five of the longest Cabinet appointment processes was Bill Clinton. It took 50 days for Clinton to have his entire Cabinet confirmed, and the process ended with the confirmation of Janet Reno for Attorney General on March 11, 1993. His previous nominee for Attorney General, Zoë E. Baird, withdrew six days after her nomination. The context So why do some Cabinet processes taking longer than others then? Paul Light, a professor at NYU Wagner and an expert on the Cabinet appointment process, said it really has to do with each president’s preparation beforehand. "What’s unusual is the slowness with which Trump has made nominations," Light said. "Once these nominations are made, the process is just very difficult." What Light is referring to here is the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2015. The act gives presidential nominees money, office space and the opportunity to pre-clear potential nominees before they take office. According to Light, Trump did none of this. "He was starting from scratch the day after the election, and he took many of those weeks after Election Day for a victory tour," Light said. Light also said the public isn’t always aware of what goes on before an announcement of a nomination is even made— a process that can be very lengthy . "This is a process that is highly constrained by all the questions that have to be answered," Light said. "We hear about all the delays that occur once a candidate is nominated, but we don’t hear about the delays in between making the phone call and the official announcement." During this time frame, potential nominees are subjected to a questionnaire, as well as an ethics test. Light said that in recent years these questionnaires have become much denser. Once someone is officially nominated, the process isn’t just reserved to the Senate confirmation hearing. The FBI compiles a list of all potential problems with nominees. This happens by sending out students in the FBI Academy to speak with people who know the nominee, including neighbors. The FBI then compiles a report that is handed over to the Senate committee chairs. Where Trump falls So where does Trump fall in all of this? As of Feb. 8, when Blunt made his claim, six of Trump’s nominees had been confirmed, with the last being Jeff Sessions for attorney general. However, the Cabinet confirmation process is still ongoing, so it’s hard to tell exactly where Trump will fall when all is said and done. As of March 23, there are two nominees who have yet to be confirmed— Sonny Perdue for Secretary of Agriculture and Alexander Acosta for Secretary of Labor. But at 19 days into his term, Trump technically would fall behind Clinton, who took 50 days to have a complete Cabinet in place. Our ruling Blunt said the only Cabinet that took longer to be put in place was that of Washington's, who had the very first in U.S. history. Blunt made the claim on Feb. 8, 19 days into Trump’s presidential term. At PolitiFact, we rate statements based on the information available at the time they were made. And in that context, Blunt is clearly incorrect. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Roy Blunt	None	None	None	2017-03-25T10:30:29	2017-02-08	['None']

pomt-04644	$50,000. That's what every child owes today because Washington politicians have run up a huge spending tab and left our kids the bill."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/12/frank-guinta/us-rep-frank-guinta-points-each-childs-share-natio/	U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta’s two children, Colby and Jack, are still years away from college. But, like every other child in the country, they’re already facing thousands of dollars of federal debt, according to the first-term Congressman. "$50,000," Guinta, a Manchester Republican, says in an ad, "Future," released August 21, 2012 on New Hampshire airwaves. "That's what every child owes today because Washington politicians have run up a huge spending tab and left our kids the bill." Of course, children shouldn’t sit at home waiting for the bill to arrive, nor should parents fret about a $50,000 bill coming from the government. No one in Washington is planning to pay downthe country’s debt immediately. Still, it’s fair to ask if Guinta is on target with his claim. To support the claim, representatives from Guinta’s campaign led us first to the national debt clock. This week, the total debt passed the $16 trillion mark. But, as of August 21, when the Guinta campaign released the ad, the figure stood at $15.97 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The campaign then pointed us to the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates the current population to be 314.3 million. Doing the simple math shows that, to pay off the total debt, each person would have to pay an average of $50,810, which included children. This number may look right, but it doesn’t support Guinta’s claim entirely. The first-term Congressman said that each child owes $50,000 to the debt. According to the Census Bureau, there are currently about 73.9 million children under age 18 in the United States. By that count, each child would have to pay $216,102 to erase the total debt. So if you limit the count to kids, Guinta islowballing the bill. Still, that number doesn’t paint a full picture of the debt, some analysts said. Rather than using the total debt figure, which includes both the debt held by the public ($11.18 trillion) and intergovernmental loans ($4.79 trillion), some analysts drew a distinction between the two. The public debt category includes all debt held by individuals, corporations, state, local and foreign -- in other words, all the money borrowed by the federal government. Meanwhile, the intergovernmental loans includes the money owed to beneficiaries in the future, such as the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office and other federal agencies, typically use the public figure alone. "At some point, those (Social Security and Medicare) bonds are redeemed, and that money is used to pay benefits, but in terms of the actual fiscal health of the government, it’s just not a useful measure," said Howard Gleckman, an analyst with the Tax Policy Center, an independent tax analysis group, and author of the blog TaxVox.org. Still, other analysts contend that both the public debt and the total count are useful and appropriate measures, as noted in past PolitiFact rulings dealing with variations of this claim. In April of 2011, PolitiFact gave former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty a Mostly True ruling on his claim that each child born into the United States inherits a $30,000 share of the debt. Pawlenty’s figure referred to the public debt, which stood at $9.4 trillion at the time. But it also applied to the total debt, which, if spread out to each person in the country left each facing an average debt share of $45,000. Around the same time, U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, an Ohio Republican, cited the $45,000 number in a video posted to YouTube. PolitiFact ruled the claim True using the total debt figure. "Most people use public debt, but total debt is a good measure too," said Ron Haskins, co-director of the Brookings Institution’s Budgeting for National Priorities Project. "What difference does it make if debt is owed to the public or to another part of the government? For every dollar you owe, you have to repay it -- and to do so you have to raise a dollar of revenue." What’s more, since no one is collecting payment today, it’s difficult to say what share each child, or each person, will bear of the national debt. With interest, the total figure is constantly rising, and the point he’s trying to make could actually be far worse. Our Ruling: Guinta’s terminology is clouded. Children alone aren’t paying for the debt, and they certainly don’t owe any money today. But, taking a step back, as the Congressman tries to illustrate the weight of the debt, his numbers are on target as long as they are spread across the entire population, at this moment in time. To pay off the debt, each person in the country, including children,would have to pay an average of $50,810 -- slightly above Guinta’s $50,000 figure. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02190	Says a pro-Democratic ad is "false" for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in 2012 to "resign."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/25/thom-tillis/thom-tillis-senate-majority-pac-disagree-disgraced/	Both Republican and Democratic super PACs are jumping in local races to criticize candidates this year. One tit-for-tat war has broken out in North Carolina, where the Senate Majority PAC, a pro-Democratic group, has publicized two-year-old dirt from the office of Thom Tillis, the state’s House Speaker and leading contender for the GOP Senate nomination. The Senate Majority PAC, which supports Democratic incumbent Kay Hagan, released an ad on April 15 reminding viewers of how two Tillis staffers -- one of whom he shared an apartment with -- got caught having affairs with lobbyists just days apart. "Thom Tillis’ reaction?" the narrator said. "He claimed he was surprised by his roommate’s affair, but then rewarded both aides with taxpayer-paid bonuses." The ad also specified that the staffers -- Charles Thomas and Amy Hobbs -- resigned. Tillis’ Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, released a similar radio ad. Two days later, Tillis’ campaign offered a decidedly different take. "Seen those ads attacking Thom Tillis?" the narrator said. "They’re false. Tillis fired the staffers." Who’s right here? PolitiFact concludes that the Senate Majority PAC’s description of the situation -- not Tillis’ -- is closer to the truth. What happened in 2012 The News & Observer, a newspaper based in Raleigh, N.C., reported that Charles Thomas, Tillis’ chief of staff and roommate, resigned in April 2012 after his affair with a lobbyist was caught on video. Less than one week later, policy analyst Amy Hobbs resigned after an affair of her own was exposed, the paper reported. Tillis then offered the two former staffers a payment of one month’s salary -- $12,500 for Thomas and $6,833.33 for Hobbs. The listed purpose was "payment in lieu of notice," a term he took from Wikipedia that referred to a British policy. Under North Carolina law, Tillis wasn’t obligated to pay either staffer a month’s salary upon resignation. In defending his decision to pay staffers, Tillis said, "I stand by my decision to accept their resignation while recognizing the difficult transition period they are now entering." In other words, Tillis at the time did not claim that he had fired the staffers -- only accepted their resignations. This supports the pro-Democratic ad, and clashes with what Tillis’ 2014 ad claims. Indeed, after our colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker expressed skepticism about Tillis’ ad, his office now appears to be backing off the term "fired." "Speaker Tillis initiated the action that resulted in the termination of employment. He asked for their resignations," Tillis spokesman Jordan Shaw told PolitiFact. That’s closer to Tillis’ initial phrasing, that he "accepted" the resignations, but it’s still not the same thing as "fired." And in any case, Tillis’ response ad was not aired with the "forced resignations" terminology that Tillis’ office began using after the fact. Our ruling Tillis’ ad called a pro-Democratic ad "false" for saying that he allowed two disgraced staffers in 2012 to "resign." But the news coverage at the time painted a different picture -- he accepted their resignations. This generally supports the Democratic ad’s description, so we rate Tillis’ claim Mostly False.

pomt-01623	Says Tom Cotton "voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/28/mark-pryor/pryor-says-cotton-voted-no-pandemic-prevention-bil/	While it’s highly unlikely that Ebola will make it to the United States, the pandemic has wormed its way into one of the most contentious U.S. Senate races -- in Arkansas. Despite the fears of many Americans, experts on infectious diseases -- including the Centers for Disease Control -- say there is a very, very low likelihood that the United States would experience an Ebola outbreak. Compared to west Africa, America has well-resourced health care services, as well as federal programs and agencies dedicated to preventing public health crises in the United States. But that’s no thanks to Rep. Tom Cotton, says incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor in his most recent ad. Pryor’s running against Cotton, a Republican, to keep his seat. "Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola," the ad’s narrator says. "Congressman Cotton voted to cut billions from our nation’s medical disaster and emergency programs. He was the only Arkansas congressman to vote this way. Just like he was the only one to vote against Children’s Hospital. Instead, Cotton voted massive tax cuts for billionaires. Not protect our families’ health and safety." As a tea party Republican, Cotton has a history of voting against federal government spending, including spending on disaster relief. But tying Cotton to a potential Ebola outbreak caught our attention. The vote This year, Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people in west Africa as of Aug. 20 and is the largest ever recorded outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. No cases have been recorded in the United States, though two American health care workers contracted the virus while in Liberia and were treated in an Atlanta hospital. We asked Pryor’s campaign for evidence backing up their claim, and they said the ad refers to the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. The law -- passed in March 2013 -- continues funding various medical and public health emergency preparedness programs through 2018. (The first iteration of the law was passed in 2006.) As you might guess from the name, the law pertains to preventing pandemics, like Ebola, from breaking out in the United States. Several programs funded under the act are already working on Ebola response, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said Gretchen Michaels, a spokeswoman for the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). Additionally, the law’s 2013 reauthorization gave the Food and Drug Administration the ability to authorize use of unapproved products in the case of an emergency. So earlier this month, the FDA authorized use of a new tool for diagnosing Ebola, as well as an experimental treatment. Did Cotton try to stop this legislation? At first, it seems that way. The House passed the legislation Jan. 22, 2013, with strong bipartisan support and very little opposition -- 395 to 29. Cotton voted against it, along with 28 other Republicans. The bill moved on to the Senate, where lawmakers made a few changes, passed it by a voice vote, and sent it back to the House to approve the changes. The House once again passed the Senate’s version of the bill with an overwhelming majority from both parties. This time around, Cotton changed his position and voted for the bill. (Seven other Republicans who previously voted "nay" also changed their vote.) It’s not clear why Cotton didn’t vote for it the first time. The law passed with such little debate that it went over without much media attention. We reached out to Cotton’s campaign but haven’t heard back -- though they posted an article on their website refuting the claim. According to CQ Weekly, the major difference between the House and Senate version of the act is that the House version approves funding and programs through 2017, while the Senate version goes through 2018. We also used a tool to compare differences between the two texts and found that the final version includes a clause clarifying that state and local workers asked to temporarily take on a different assignment in case of an emergency would not be required to accept that reassignment. Regardless, the country’s ability to address a pandemic does not hinge on either of those changes. There is no readily available evidence showing that Cotton actively campaigned against the bill. And the final version, which got Cotton’s vote, also got positive votes from nearly every Senate and House Democrat -- including Pryor. Our ruling A Pryor for Senate ad said, "Tom Cotton voted against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola." Cotton voted against one version of a 2013 pandemic and emergency preparedness bill. However, Cotton voted for the final version, which Pryor also supported. The bill easily became law. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00653	"Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had" fast-track trade authority.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/17/paul-ryan/fast-track-trade-authority-has-every-president-fdr/	President Barack Obama has an unusual ally in pursuit of his foreign trade agenda -- Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan believes that Congress should grant Obama trade promotion authority, something many pro-union Democrats oppose. Trade promotion authority would allow trade agreements (such as the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership) to move through Congress under special rules intended to speed up the process, thus it is known colloquially as "fast-track." Congress would not be able to amend or filibuster a trade agreement, and the deal would only need 51 votes in the Senate to pass, as opposed to the 60 votes otherwise necessary. "Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had this ability," Ryan said on CNN’s State of the Union May 17. The claim that every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt has been granted some sort of fast-track authority is a common talking point among supporters, so we decided to look into it. We found that today’s fast-track has a connection to 1930s trade policy, but the particulars have evolved significantly over the past several decades. First, we’ll go over the broad history of fast-track authority, then we’ll get into whether every single president had it. Tariff-ic "Fast-track and (trade promotion authority) trace their origins to the Trade Act of 1934," said Hal Shapiro, an international trade adviser who wrote a book on fast-track authority. But the trade promotion authority bill currently before Congress has more in common with legislation passed in 1974 than the original 1930s legislation, which was narrower in scope and had more limitations on Congress. First of all, the fast-track of the 1930s only pertained to tariffs -- taxes imposed on imported goods. For most of the country’s history, Congress set tariffs. But in 1934, they gave that authority to Roosevelt under the the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. Congress pre-approved a range of tariffs, and Roosevelt settled on the final rate in negotiations with foreign countries. Today’s fast-track authority requires Congress to give final approval to trade agreements. But the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act did not. Setting the pre-approved range of tariffs was Congress’ final involvement in the tariff negotiation process. Roosevelt’s signature was the final word. Congress renewed presidential tariff reduction authority about a dozen times through the 1960s, into President Lyndon Johnson’s administration. So how did it morph into today’s law? A big shift in international trade talks happened in the 1960s: Tariff reductions became less important in negotiations; instead countries focused on non-tariff barriers, which are aspects of domestic policy that are believed to hinder trade. Johnson returned from a round of international negotiations having struck a deal that modified tariff policy but also two non-tariff policies that required changes to domestic law. Because the trade agreement went outside the scope of tariff policy changes, many members of Congress felt Johnson had overstepped his bounds, and Congress decided not to implement the parts of the agreement pertaining to non-tariff barriers. This debate eventually led to the creation of the Trade Act of 1974, which has been renewed periodically since then, and is currently in front of Congress as the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015. The idea behind the 1974 legislation was that it would give Congress more oversight than it previously had on trade negotiations -- specifically non-tariff barriers policy -- by increasing review processes and requiring final congressional approval. But by implementing the fast-track procedures, such as prohibiting amendments and filibusters, Congress would not be able to dismantle a long-fought final deal. Nearly ‘every president’ A 2015 Congressional Research Service report treats both the tariff legislation and today’s fast-track policies as one in the same in comparing trade authority given to each of the 12 presidents since Roosevelt until Obama. (See Appendix A.) Going by that account, Ryan is close but wrong. Presidents Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Johnson, all had tariff reduction authority at some point in their administrations. And Congress gave Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, trade promotion authority. But missing from this list is Richard Nixon, who was president during -- and involved with -- the debates that led to the 1974 trade promotion authority law. "Technically, Nixon never had the authority, but the process was well advanced when he resigned," said Mac Destler, an expert in American trade politics at the University of Maryland. In other words, Nixon would have gotten the authority had he not resigned. (Gerald Ford did get fast-track authority.) Ian Fergusson, the Congressional Research Service report author, affirmed Ryan’s claim -- saying, "Every president except Nixon" had fast-track trade authority. Fergusson noted, though, that Clinton only had trade promotion authority in the first two years of his presidency, and Congress denied his 1997 request to renew. (Obama hasn’t had it yet.) Of course, reasonable people can disagree over whether the 1930s legislation is equivalent to the fast-track authority that’s been around since 1974, affecting interpretation of the list. "No, FDR did not create fast-track trade authority. And, JFK did not celebrate its renewal," wrote fast-track critic Lori Wallach, director of global trade for advocacy group Public Citizen, in a 2014 blog. Wallach, who wrote a book on fast-track, argued that allowing the president to negotiate non-tariff barriers, not just tariffs, sets modern legislation apart. Our ruling Ryan said, "Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had" fast-track trade authority. From the 1930s until today, Every president except Nixon (and Obama) has had the ability to negotiate aspects of foreign trade policy with limited congressional involvement. But these policies aren’t 100 percent apples to apples. For one, today’s policy involves more congressional oversight than the policy in place through the 1960s. Additionally, the original policy only pertained to tariff reductions, while today’s policy includes non-tariff barriers to trade. (Up until the late 1960s, foreign trade negotiations focused nearly exclusively on tariffs.) On balance, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True.

pomt-07573	"One. That's the number of new drilling permits under the Obama administration since they came into office."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/29/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-there-has-been-just-one-ne/	By most accounts, Rep. Michele Bachmann's slide show of numbers critical of the Obama administration got the most audience feedback among potential 2012 GOP presidential candidates addressing the Conservative Principles PAC Conference in Iowa on March 26, 2011. Bachmann was particularly critical of Obama's energy policy, including his decision to put a temporary moratorium on new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon explosion and subsequent oil spill. During the moratorium, the administration enacted new safety and environmental requirements, including regulations for spill response and containment capability. "Let's look at the number one. Number one," Bachmann said. "That's the number of new drilling permits under the Obama administration since they came into office. "Gee, maybe that has something to do with this next figure. Let's take a look, $1.83. That is the price that gasoline was the day before Barack Obama took office as president of the United States. "Is it time for a change?" Audience: "Yes!" "It is time for a change," Bachmann said. "Absolutely, it's time for a change." "You cannot create jobs when you have a president that is unwilling to use American energy resources to solve our problems here in the United States," she said moments later. Just one oil drilling permit approved during the entire Obama presidency? We recalled that in a March 11, 2011, press conference, Obama said, "we’ve approved more than 35 new offshore drilling permits that meet these new safety and environmental standards." And he was talking only about permits issued after the Gulf of Mexico moratorium. So somebody's got to be wrong. We went first to the Department of the Interior press office, which sent us a link to a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE, report on the "Status of Well Permits and Plans Subject to Enhanced Safety and Environmental Requirements." According to the report, 39 shallow-water permits for new wells have been issued since June 8, 2010, when new rules and information requirements were put into effect. Shallow water drilling operations were not affected by the deepwater drilling moratorium following the gulf oil spill. And there were lots more shallow-water well permits issued by the Obama administration prior to June 8, 2010. Remember, Bachmann's statement referred to permits issued "under the Obama administration since they came into office." In addition, there have been six deepwater well permits issued since Oct. 12, 2010, when the gulf moratorium was lifted. Five of those were for projects that were under way prior to the moratorium. The operators were required to come back and meet the new, modified standards. And last week, BOEMRE approved an "exploration plan" submitted by Shell Offshore Inc., for deepwater oil and gas exploration. It was the first new deepwater exploration plan approved since the gulf oil spill. According to a BOEMRE press release, "An exploration plan describes all exploration activities planned by the operator for a specific lease or leases, including the timing of these activities, information concerning drilling vessels, the location of each planned well and other relevant information that needs to meet important safety standards. Once a plan is approved, additional new applications for permits to drill can be issued." In other words, it's not a permit. Permits come down the road. In all, BOEMRE has received 45 deepwater drilling permit applications that are subject to the new regulations. These include applications to drill new wells, bypasses, and sidetracks. Twenty-four of these permits have been returned to the operator with requests for additional information (most regarding subsea containment). BOEMRE has approved seven of these permits (for six unique wells), with 12 applications pending. Again, these are deepwater permits issued after the moratorium. The Obama administration issued lots of deepwater permits prior to that. In addition, BOEMRE has received 31 deepwater drilling permit applications for activities such as drilling water injection wells and drilling from a fixed rig with a surface blowout preventer that were allowed under the moratorium. BOEMRE has approved 28 of these permits. According to Andy Radford, senior policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, permit approvals have dropped 65 percent, post gulf oil spill. Prior to the gulf disaster, the Obama administration reported approving 217 new well permits (shallow and deepwater). "The devil's in the details on these things," Radford said, noting that permits include a lot of different drilling activities. But the pace of permitting is picking up, he said. "We'll get to the new normal eventually." Lee Hunt, executive director of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said there has been a "molasses effect" with permitting by the Obama administration. Even the 39 permits for new shallow water wells is dramatically lower than previous levels. And even with six deepwater permits issued in the last month, as well as the ones projected to be approved this year, permits for deepwater wells are likely to be a third of what was projected prior to the gulf oil spill. The permitting process has undeniably slowed, Hunt said, but as the numbers above show, Bachmann's statement -- at least the way she worded it -- is wrong. "We are encouraging offshore exploration and production," Obama said in his March 11 press conference. "We're just doing it responsibly." Bachmann's press office did not return our call, so we are relegated to playing the "perhaps she meant" game to test whether there is a sense in which she might be accurate. Perhaps she meant permits since the moratorium, not since Obama administration came into office, as she said. (There were hundreds issued pre-gulf oil spill). Perhaps she meant just deepwater drilling, not shallow water drilling. There have been 39 shallow-water permits for new wells since June 2010. And many more before that. Perhaps she meant to exclude permits issued for projects that were under way prior to the oil spill (and which had to come back and meet the new, modified standards). Five of the six new well permits were underway prior to the moratorium. Perhaps she meant not permits, but exploration plans. The first exploration plan since the oil spill was approved last week. Perhaps. But that's not what she said. She said: "One. That's the number of new drilling permits under the Obama administration since they came into office." It's not even close, and the claim is ridiculously false. Pants-On-Fire.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-03-29T18:02:32	2011-03-26	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-06245	Says "out of 588 school districts, we give 31 (former Abbott) districts 70 percent of the aid."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/01/chris-christie/Chris-Christie-claims-31-former-Abbott-districts-r/	Staring at his audience, Gov. Chris Christie took a long pause after delivering this sobering statistic about how schools are funded in New Jersey: 70 percent of the state aid lands in 31 so-called Abbott districts. During his Nov. 18 visit to the University of Notre Dame, the Republican governor explained how a court decision has delivered most of the state’s education dollars to 31 low-income, urban districts, formerly known as Abbott districts. "The same way that the Abbott decision in New Jersey, which said that we must give 31 failing districts (a) disproportionate amount of the state aid has not solved the problem either," Christie said. "We now give 31 districts in New Jersey, out of 588 school districts, we give 31 districts 70 percent of the aid." PolitiFact New Jersey determined Christie’s funding statistic is mostly accurate. Between K-12 education aid and preschool aid for the 2011-12 school year, the 31 former Abbott districts — including towns such as Hoboken and Phillipsburg — are set to receive about 60 percent of the aid, according to our analysis of figures on the New Jersey Department of Education’s website. Christie also was slightly off on the number of school districts. There are 590 districts operating school buildings, and 15 others that send students to other districts without operating their own facilities, according to the state Department of Education. Justin Barra, an Education Department spokesman, confirmed our analysis of the percentage of aid dollars going to the former Abbott districts. "The Governor made the point in his speech to Notre Dame that a very small percentage of districts in New Jersey receive a majority of state aid, which is undeniably true," Barra said in an e-mail. Here’s a quick history lesson about the former Abbott districts: In a legal battle stretching about 30 years, the Abbott vs. Burke court decisions have ensured greater state funding for certain districts as a way of addressing disparities between poor urban areas and the wealthier suburbs. The Abbott designation itself was effectively eliminated a few years ago when the new school funding formula was instituted. The New Jersey Supreme Court issued the most recent decision in May, ordering the Christie administration to increase state funding to the former Abbott districts by nearly $500 million. With that additional funding, the 31 former Abbott districts are slated to receive a total of about $4.4 billion in K-12 state aid in the 2011-12 school year. That’s about 57.6 percent of the roughly $7.6 billion in total K-12 aid. Among the former Abbott districts, Newark is to receive the largest K-12 aid award at about $714 million, followed by Jersey City with about $417 million; Paterson with roughly $398 million; and Elizabeth with about $356 million. The 31 districts also are set to receive 92 percent of the state’s preschool aid during the current school year, totaling about $569 million. So, between the K-12 aid and the preschool aid, the former Abbott districts are to receive about 60 percent of the state aid in New Jersey. Here’s the breakdown of our analysis for each former Abbott district: County Former Abbott District K-12 Aid Preschool Aid Total Aid Atlantic Pleasantville $64,996,534 $7,090,753 $72,087,287 Bergen Garfield $55,339,655 $8,563,251 $63,902,906 Burlington Burlington City $16,953,788 $2,703,880 $19,657,668 Burlington Pemberton Twp. $84,756,033 $7,294,335 $92,050,368 Camden Camden City $281,437,116 $25,533,940 $306,971,056 Camden Gloucester City $30,418,261 $2,920,972 $33,339,233 Cumberland Bridgeton $77,077,206 $9,534,330 $86,611,536 Cumberland Millville $67,936,623 $8,746,430 $76,683,053 Cumberland Vineland $136,433,400 $17,614,890 $154,048,290 Essex East Orange $179,617,054 $18,974,400 $198,591,454 Essex Irvington $113,133,130 $16,946,880 $130,080,010 Essex Newark $714,990,694 $81,093,908 $796,084,602 Essex Orange $71,158,031 $9,602,799 $80,760,830 Hudson Harrison $24,805,543 $4,757,571 $29,563,114 Hudson Hoboken $9,399,671 $8,930,595 $18,330,266 Hudson Jersey City $417,859,149 $60,292,769 $478,151,918 Hudson Union City $174,449,158 $25,340,662 $199,789,820 Hudson West New York $89,900,673 $15,742,994 $105,643,667 Mercer Trenton $227,907,566 $26,910,920 $254,818,486 Middlesex New Brunswick $119,688,982 $17,421,352 $137,110,334 Middlesex Perth Amboy $159,416,958 $20,217,042 $179,634,000 Monmouth Asbury Park $57,632,816 $7,811,335 $65,444,151 Monmouth Keansburg $28,010,210 $2,910,258 $30,920,468 Monmouth Long Branch $41,895,464 $11,193,300 $53,088,764 Monmouth Neptune Twp. $32,632,790 $6,255,811 $38,888,601 Passaic Passaic City $226,148,279 $25,126,258 $251,274,537 Passaic Paterson $398,844,161 $46,602,175 $445,446,336 Salem Salem City $16,494,552 $1,797,920 $18,292,472 Union Elizabeth $356,039,611 $48,381,036 $404,420,647 Union Plainfield $117,635,080 $19,168,606 $136,803,686 Warren Phillipsburg $37,863,535 $4,471,549 $42,335,084 It’s worth noting that although the districts only represent about 5 percent of all school districts in New Jersey, they educated nearly 20 percent, or one-fifth, of students during the 2010-11 school year. Our ruling At the University of Notre Dame, Christie claimed "we give 31 (former Abbott) districts 70 percent of the aid." The governor wasn’t too far off.

pomt-12275	CNN’s ratings are "way down."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/03/donald-trump/trumps-pants-fire-claim-cnn-ratings-are-way-down/	Days before President Donald Trump tweeted a video of him assaulting a CNN logo, Trump took aim at another place he said CNN was hurting: its ratings. "Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories," Trump tweeted June 27, before adding: "Ratings way down!" The reality TV star-turned-president has a well-documented fixation on television ratings that predates his time in office, and we've been checking Trump on statements about TV ratings as long ago as 2011. Since the stakes of television viewership appear to loom large in the mind of the president, we decided to look more closely at CNN’s trendline. The upshot: Trump is flat wrong Trump’s claim that CNN’s ratings are down raises the question: compared to what? Because his tweet made no mention of other cable news networks, we assume Trump is comparing CNN’s current ratings to past ratings. Television experts we spoke to about how to gauge CNN’s trajectory suggested we compare CNN’s numbers from one year to the next, based on data from the second quarter (in 2017, second quarter ratings went from March 27 through June 25). To get a comprehensive view, we were told to look at ratings across several benchmark metrics, broken down by audience demographics and viewing times. Bottom line: CNN is at a five-year high in each of the categories we looked at, according to data provided by the Nielsen Company. CNN Ratings Primetime, Total Viewers Primetime, 25-54 Total Day, Total Viewers Total Day, 25-54 2017 Q2 1,055,000 371,000 788,000 263,000 2016 Q2 959,000 312,000 627,000 188,000 2015 Q2 560,000 195,000 430,000 138,000 2014 Q2 459,000 156,000 341,000 105,000 2013 Q2 666,000 228,000 475,000 161,000 See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So when it comes to comparing CNN’s current ratings to past ratings, the verdict is clear: They’ve moved up in several major categories compared to recent years. For its part, CNN called its second-quarter figures a "ratings milestone," with the cable news network tallying a record number of total viewers, and its best second quarter since 2003 in terms of total day viewership among 25-54-year olds. "CNN just posted its most-watched second quarter in history," a CNN public relations account tweeted in response to Trump. "Those are the facts." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said CNN’s ratings are "way down." In fact, CNN is at a five-year high in several key categories, according to data provided by the Nielsen Company.

pomt-05099	Says Ann Kuster said the debate over America’s debt limit is not an important issue of the day.	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/29/charles-bass/charlie-bass-goes-attack-and-distorts-opponents-st/	Since there’s no Miranda warning when running for office, politicians never know if something they say on the campaign trail will be used against them by an opponent. New Hampshire Democrat Ann McLane Kuster found that out during the earliest stages of her rematch for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District against Rep. Charles Bass, R-NH. He narrowly beat Kuster in 2010, 48.3 to 46.7 percent. The day after Kuster filed papers in the Secretary of State’s office, Bass criticized her remarks and said she was out of touch. "After filing to run … Democrat Annie Kuster stated that debate over America’s debt limit is not an important issue of the day," Bass said in an email to the press. That seemed like a curious thing to say, so PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to tune in to Kuster’s statement to find out if Bass was right. Bass cited a video recorded by a Patch reporter that captured the filing. "I think the voters are just fired up," Kuster said in the video. "They realize Congress is broken and we need a new approach and honestly, we need a voice for hardworking New Hampshire families in Washington and people realize that their needs are not being met, that Congress is bickering over the debt limits and they’re off on arguing about things that aren't even the issues of the day. We need to create good jobs right here at home and so I’m going down to Washington to work hard for New Hampshire families and let’s bring some good jobs and let’s give people opportunity, that’s all they’re looking for." We contacted Bass’ campaign to get his reasoning behind the claim. Bass’ "Victory Committee" spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne pointed to the video, quoting Kuster as saying, "Congress is bickering over the debt limits, they're off on arguing about things that aren't even issues of the day." "It is fair therefore by her own statement that she believes that ‘bickering’ over the debt limit and ‘…arguing about things that aren't even issues of the day.’ It’s apparent from her own words that she does not believe the deficit is an important issue of the day," Tranchemontagne said in an email. Not quite. For one, Tranchemontagne left out the word "and" when quoting Kuster. It’s a small word, but words matter. And his selective quote ignored the full context of her claim. Tranchemontagne went on to give "debt-limit" definitions from the United States Treasury Department, pointed to the last budget resolution passed in the Senate was on April 29, 2009, and that Bass was one of the cosponsors of the Cooper-LaTourette alternative budget, a bipartisan plan that got only 38 votes in the House. When we talked to Kuster’s people, they said Bass missed key parts of Kuster’s statement in his characterization. "I guess I could creatively edit this to say that she says that," Kuster Campaign Manager Garrick Delzell said."I don’t even think they’re taking something out of context, they’re trying to make something be there that isn’t there." Indeed, a careful reading of Kuster's statement shows that Bass’ news release left out two parts. It skipped over the introductory part that says people’s "needs are not being met," and they omitted the "and," which separates her two statements about bickering over debt limits and arguing over unimportant issues. "Clearly, anything that affects our economy at such a fragile time is a very important issue and the debt limit is one of those things," Delzell said. "Annie believes that representatives in Congress did a terrible job by holding our economy hostage when we were negotiating on whether to increase the debt limit." In other words, Kuster backed up a statement about unmet needs with a statement about debt limit bickering. She ended with another statement about Congress’ focus on other subjects that aren’t "issues of the day" -- however Kuster does not say the debt limit is one of them. Our ruling: Bass said that Kuster said the debate over America’s debt limit is not an important issue of the day. But a review of Kuster's full remarks show that's not what she said .

pomt-14144	"Here in California, Donald Trump has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/may/03/ted-cruz/yep-donald-trump-gave-12k-jerry-brown-gavin-newsom/	Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is no ally of California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. But Cruz is hoping to paint his rival for the GOP presidential nomination, Donald Trump, as a political friend of Brown and two other top Democrats in the Golden State: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Kamala Harris. "Here in California, Donald Trump has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris," Cruz said during his speech on April 30 at the California Republican Party Convention south of San Francisco. Cruz went on to tell the GOP California audience: "Y’all are experiencing first-hand the consequences of those misguided liberal policies." We wondered if Cruz’s claim about Trump funding three top California Democrats was correct? And if so, how recently had Trump helped out these Democrats? Our research Turns out, Cruz’s claim is accurate, based on campaign finance data on the California Secretary of State’s website. But Trump’s donations to the Democrats aren’t recent. The GOP frontrunner contributed $3,500 to Brown’s run for state attorney general, making donations in 2004 and 2006. He gave $2,500 to Newsom’s 2009 truncated run for governor. And he chipped in a total of $6,000 to Harris in 2011 and 2013 for her successful re-election campaign for attorney general. Source: California Secretary of State's website Trump has acknowledged financing both Republicans and Democrats during his long business career, all to gain political influence. Records show he gave $25,000 to the California Republican Party in 2005 and $12,000 to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state’s former Republican governor, a couple years later. What Cruz doesn’t mention about Trump’s donations to the Democrats is that they took place before Trump’s run for the GOP presidential nomination. A Cruz campaign press release included a timeline for the donations, but we are fact-checking what Cruz said during his speech. Our ruling Ted Cruz said Donald Trump gave $12,000 to three top California Democrats, including Gov. Jerry Brown. Campaign finance data show Cruz’s claim is accurate. But Cruz leaves out the fact that the donations to the California governor took place a decade ago, before the Democrat ran for re-election to the state’s top office. Trump’s contributions to the other Democrats took place in 2009, 2011 and 2013.

pomt-03124	Says potential Democratic opponent Mary Burke "implemented the policies of Jim Doyle. Those are the policies that, in his last term, saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/18/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-policies-democrat-jim-doyle-/	Gov. Scott Walker took an early swipe at a likely Democratic opponent, by criticizing his predecessor’s record on jobs. On Aug. 30, 2013, Walker brought up jobs when discussing Democrat Mary Burke, who is considering a gubernatorial run in 2014. A former Trek bicycles executive, Burke served as state commerce secretary for two and a half years under former Gov. Jim Doyle. Walker, who has not officially launched his re-election campaign, said in an interview with Wisconsin Eye that electing Burke would be a mistake and a return to the past. Burke, he said, "implemented the policies of Jim Doyle. Those are the policies that, in his last term, saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs." We’ve been tracking Walker’s promise to create 250,000 private sector jobs in his four-year term. The state has added 84,482 jobs in the two and a half years since Walker took office, according to our most recent monthly Walk-O-Meter update. But what about the governor’s claim that the policies of Doyle cost the state more than 133,000 jobs in the previous four years? Let’s start with the numbers. Doyle’s second term was from 2006 to 2010. At the start of that time frame, Wisconsin had 2,404,928 jobs, according to the state Department of Workforce Development. Four years later, when Doyle left office, the state had 133,943 fewer jobs. So Walker is on point on the raw number of jobs lost in Doyle’s final term. But Walker’s claim was about more than the numbers. In going after Burke -- Commerce Secretary from 2005 until the end of 2007 -- he attributed the loss to the policies of the Doyle administration. To support his claim, Walker’s office provided an email statement, links to news clippings and portions of an "issue book" produced by state Senate Republicans in for the 2009-’10 term. "Governor Doyle’s vision for Wisconsin included bigger government, the use of one-time funds and budget gimmicks (raid of segregated funds), out-of-control spending, and tax increases," said the email from Walker spokesman Tom Evenson. "These policies led to an environment unfriendly to workers and job creators and contributed to the loss of over 133,000 jobs in his last term." The email also said that under Doyle, the state raised taxes by "nearly $5 billion and used one-time stimulus money to fill a budget hole." "These taxes fell on employers both directly and indirectly as well as on working families taking away more of their hard-earned income and sending it to Madison. Also, employers and others knew that using one-time money would grow future deficits which could fall on them in the form of higher taxes." The email states: "These actions contributed to Wisconsin’s job loss of more than 133,000 private sector jobs." Let’s pause right there. In the Wisconsin Eye interview, the governor said that Doyle administration policies were responsible for the job losses. The statement from Evenson says only the actions "contributed" to the job losses. The view from experts When we asked several experts for their view on the 2006-’10 employment situation in Wisconsin, all had the same general observation: In that period, the U.S. economy suffered the worst economic downturn in more than 75 years -- and Wisconsin was not immune. In fact, they said, Wisconsin fared somewhat better than the country as a whole. "I'm pretty sure there is plenty of blame to be shared by a lot of people, but it might be unfair to pin it all on one person or administration," said Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo Bank and lecturer at Wisconsin Lutheran College. "Considering employment in Wisconsin declined 5.3% during that time while U.S. employment declined 5.6%, blaming it on Doyle might not be all that fair." Jacobsen said the jobs decline "probably wasn't exaggerated by Doyle's policies. If his policies were to blame, we probably would have seen a larger percentage decline in employment in Wisconsin. I do think it is fair to criticize previous policy decisions, especially related to tax policy, in making the bounce back tougher." In a previous PolitiFact item about the recession, Jacobsen noted that the National Bureau of Economic Research, which declares the start and end of recessions, says "economic activity in the U.S. peaked in December 2007 and reached a trough in June 2009." Marquette University economics professor Abdur Chowdhury attributed the loss of jobs mainly to the Great Recession. "If you think about it, Wisconsin fared much better than many other states -- the total U.S. job loss during the Great Recession was about 8 million and Wisconsin's share was less than 200,000," he said. "I wouldn't blame the Doyle administration solely for this job loss. In the face of a national economic collapse, there wasn't much that the Doyle administration -- or, for that matter, any other administration -- could do." We also checked with Richard Freeman, a Harvard University professor and the director of the the National Bureau of Economic Research, the organization that determines, among other things, the official start and end of recessions. He also said the key to understanding the state’s performance during the recession was that Wisconsin’s job loss was smaller than the rest of the country. Freeman’s time frame differs slightly from the others but his conclusion was the same: "Wisconsin had 2.132% of (the nation’s) private-sector jobs in 2007 and 2.149% of those jobs in 2010. This means that Wisconsin had a smaller job loss than other states." Freeman added: "I doubt that state government had much impact on private sector job loss." Our rating Walker said that the policies of Doyle, his predecessor, led to the loss of more than 133,000 jobs in Doyle’s last term. He’s correct about the number. But experts agree that Wisconsin’s economy was caught in the same economic crash that crippled the entire country -- the recession was deeper and more severe than any single state’s policies, including those of Doyle. They note that Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country. This leaves us with a statement that’s numerically true, but with scant evidence at best when it comes to blame. That’s Mostly False on our meter. To comment on this item, visit this page.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-09-18T05:00:00	2013-08-30	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Jim_Doyle']

pomt-06847	Says Sen. Luther Olsen, his recall opponent, supported the sale of state-owned power plants "not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors" with no oversight.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/04/fred-clark/candidate-fred-clark-says-state-sen-luther-olsen-s/	Two Democrats working to knock off Wisconsin state senators in recall elections on Aug. 9, 2011, are reviving the short-lived controversy over Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to sell off state-owned power plants. In a strongly worded TV ad, Nancy Nusbaum and Fred Clark pair up to accuse their respective opponents, GOP senators Robert Cowles and Luther Olsen, of an abuse of power -- or at least an attempted one. "Power. We gave it to senators Robert Cowles and Luther Olsen, then they tried to sell it," intones a narrator in the ad. "Supporting the sale of Wisconsin’s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption." Two contested races, a high-stakes election and a provocative claim -- in other words, right up our alley. Because the case against each is slightly different, we are looking at them in separate items. You can find the Nusbaum vs. Cowles analysis here. So, did Olsen support selling the plants to the biggest campaign donors with no oversight? Walker’s budget-repair bill, proposed in February 2011, would have allowed a no-bid sale of up to 37 heating and cooling plants, primarily at University of Wisconsin campuses. Walker said the sale would avoid costly plant upgrades at taxpayer expense. The clause immediately triggered accusations that Walker was setting up a deal to benefit Koch Industries, which the Journal Sentinel reported was the largest corporate contributor to Walker in the 2010 campaign. At the time, Koch Industries denied any interest in the plants. The power-plant controversy all but died out amid the massive protests over Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. In fact, the power-plant sale provision was removed from the bill in the chaotic endgame that allowed Republican senators to approve the collective-bargaining changes without the Democrats who had fled to Illinois to block a quorum. Let’s look at the three components of the claim: Supporting the no-bid sale approach. The state Democratic Party, responding on behalf of the two Democrats, pointed us to a vote by Olsen. As a member of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, Olsen voted to approve an amended version of Walker’s budget -- at a time when the bill still included the no-bid sale language. Olsen told us the potential lack of transparency concerned him, but that the power plants were unique facilities. In 2005, Republicans also pushed for sale of the plants, trying to insert it into the budget. When the matter came up at Joint Finance. Olsen opposed adding it into the budget. (It ultimately went in over his objections but was vetoed by then-Gov. Jim Doyle). Supporting a sale of the plants to the "biggest donors." This is an apparent reference to campaign donors. It’s true that Koch or Wisconsin utilities who have given to Walker and Republicans could have emerged as buyers and purchased state plants. And they may have had an easier road without a formal bidding process. But contrary to the dramatic accusation in the TV ad, the language in the bill didn’t select any winners, much less winners who are fat-cat campaign contributors. The bill would have authorized the no-bid sale, but who the ultimate bidders -- or buyers -- would be in that scenario can’t be known. Supporting the sale without any oversight. The original bill drew criticism in part because it went beyond the 2005 attempt by Republicans to sell the plants. That earlier effort would have required bids, and called for Public Service Commission review on whether the sale is in the public interest. The 2011 plan submitted by Walker did not include those steps. But amid the criticism, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee beefed up the oversight, requiring that any proposed sale forwarded by Walker’s administration first go through the committee. Olsen voted for the additional oversight of the selection process. Let’s review. Democratic challenger Clark race accused Olsen of "supporting the sale of Wisconsin’s power plants, not to the highest bidder, but to the biggest donors. No bid contracts, no oversight, an invitation for corruption." For Olsen, they cite only his committee vote. Some viewers -- perhaps most -- may assume from the ad that Olsen actually voted to sell the plants to a big campaign donor. The ad is misleading on that score alone. It would have allowed a no-bid process for the sale, but did not designate any specific buyer. The ad’s claim starts off OK by saying Olsen supported a no-bid approach. So there’s an element of truth in the claim. But some critical facts are ignored and evidence missing on part of the claim. Olsen backed legislative oversight of any sale, and there is no evidence that his vote was "supporting" a sale to the flashiest campaign donor. We rate Clark’s claim against Olsen as Mostly False.

pomt-05364	New Jersey has "the highest property taxes in the nation and not by a little. They are the highest property taxes in the nation, more than double the national average."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/10/lou-greenwald/lou-greenwald-says-new-jerseys-property-taxes-are-/	New Jersey often ranks high on lists in categories ranging from beach quality to education. Unfortunately, according to Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald, the state tops another list – one with a particularly dubious ranking. New Jersey has "the highest property taxes in the nation and not by a little," Greenwald (D-Camden) said in an April 1 interview with Michael Aron on NJTV’s "On The Record." "They are the highest property taxes in the nation, more than double the national average." New Jersey having high property taxes isn’t new. But are they more than double the national average? Greenwald’s statement is largely on the money, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Let’s first explain the source of Greenwald’s data and how tax rankings are reviewed. Greenwald got his data from a 2009 list compiled by the business-backed Tax Foundation in Washington, DC. The 2009 data shows that New Jersey ranked number one in three key tax metrics: median property taxes paid on homes; taxes as a percentage of home value; and taxes as a percentage of income. Nick Kasprak, a Tax Foundation analyst and programmer, said taxes as a percentage of home value is "the most relevant statistic" of the three because it can apply to most people, ranging from those who own condominiums to those in McMansions. "It’s a good way of comparing apples to apples across the states," Kasprak said of the metric, adding that the Tax Foundation’s numbers are estimates and come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. So how long has New Jersey worn the highest property taxes banner? That depends on the metric. We found that New Jersey property taxes have topped the rest of the nation’s at least back to 2004 when looking at median property taxes paid on homes and taxes paid as a percentage of income. When looking at all three Tax Foundation metrics for years 2004 through 2009, New Jersey’s median property taxes paid on homes was more than triple the national average; more than double the national average for taxes paid as a percentage of income; and at least one and-a-half times the national average for taxes paid as a percentage of home value. Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University, said comparing states by property taxes alone is disingenuous because states fund certain needs differently. For example, some states use property taxes to fund education, others do not. "In reality, we need to look in total at the entire tax burden," Harrison said. "The implication is that New Jerseyans pay the highest taxes in the country, right? That’s what people think. What I’m saying is that New Jersey pays a very high tax burden. What we need to do is look at the total tax burden: gas tax, sales tax, security, user fees, certainly property taxes and sales taxes as well." Jon Bramnick, leader of the Assembly Republicans, agreed property taxes are high but credited a slowing of their growth to Gov. Chris Christie’s implementation of a 2-percent property tax cap, changing arbitration procedures for police and firefighters, and other measures. "We obviously have to have mergers, shared services and consolidations across New Jersey," Bramnick said, adding that a bipartisan effort is key. "These are the factors that you have to have to continue down that road. If you do, you will see a slowing of property taxes." Our ruling Greenwald said in a TV interview that New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, more than double the national average. He was referring to 2009 statistics from the Tax Foundation. Statistics from 2004 through 2008 show the state leads the nation in two of three key metrics, according to the Tax Foundation. New Jersey led in all three metrics in 2009. Greenwald’s overall point is clear: when it comes to property taxes, New Jersey is king. We rate this statement True.

pomt-02238	Says Mark Udall "decided Obamacare. ... He passed Obamacare with his vote."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/15/cory-gardner/colorado-senate-race-cory-gardner-says-mark-udall-/	The race for a U.S. Senate seat representing Colorado is one of the most closely watched of the 2014 election. And like other Democrats around the country, incumbent Mark Udall is taking heat for his vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act. In a Fox News interview on March 31, 2014, Udall’s likely Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, said Udall cast the vote that made the bill now commonly called "Obamacare" law. "And 335,000 Coloradans lost their health insurance, had their health insurance canceled because of Mark Udall's vote, a vote that decided Obamacare," Gardner told Fox host Neil Cavuto. "He passed Obamacare with his vote." This is far from the first time a politician has claimed that an opponent’s vote was the deciding vote for the controversial health care bill. Still, we thought we’d check to see whether Udall’s situation was different in any way. We have checked many claims that different senators were "the deciding vote." Ken Cuccinelli said in November 2013 that U.S. Sen. Mark Warner cast the deciding vote on the Affordable Care Act. An ad in Florida made the same claim about Sen. Bill Nelson, while another made the claim about Udall’s colleague from Colorado, Sen. Michael Bennet. We’ve also looked into the same allegation coming from candidates in Ohio and New Hampshire. All of these senators were inaccurately accused of casting the "deciding" vote. (We should note that PolitiFact Virginia also looked at an instance where the statement about a critical vote was more carefully phrased, and that earned Mostly True.) As we have in the past, we’ll note that the first Senate vote relevant to the issue came on Dec. 23, 2009. The vote was needed to overcome a filibuster and end debate on the bill, in order to bring it to a vote for final approval. Senate rules require 60 senators to approve such a motion. This vote received exactly the number of supporters necessary to defeat the filibuster, so having just one fewer vote in support would have indeed been insufficient to pass the Affordable Care Act the next day. Udall voted with the rest of his party to overcome the filibuster. "When a bill passes by just one vote, every single senator who voted for it bears responsibility for its passage," said Alex Siciliano, a spokesman for Gardner. "Sen. Udall cannot duck this fact. Without his 'yes' vote, Obamacare would not be law today, and 335,000 Coloradans would not have had their health insurance cancelled." Still, it’s hard to say that his vote was any more important than those of the other 59 senators who approved the motion, particularly because his vote was not up for grabs until the last moment. He consistently sided with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in votes relating to the health care law, and he offered several amendments to the bill either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor. By contrast, then-Sen. Ben Nelson was widely considered a holdout whose late-in-the-game announcement of support was key to the vote’s success. The second important vote, on Dec. 24, 2009, passed the original version of the Affordable Care Act. This was less of a challenge, since the bill only need a majority of senators to pass. In the end, 60 voted for it, meaning any 10 senators could have been responsible for the bill’s passing. Finally, on March 25, 2010, the Senate held a vote that officially approved the bill after it had been passed by the House. Udall supported the bill along with 56 other senators, again making it all but impossible to say whether his was the vote that made the difference. Our ruling Gardner said Udall "passed Obamacare with his vote." This statement has an element of truth to it, since without Udall’s vote in favor, the bill would not have been able to come up for a vote on Dec. 24, 2009. However, this ignores the other 59 senators who also voted to end debate -- and the exact same thing could be said about them. Because Udall had consistently sided with the Democratic leadership in votes related to the act, he was not among the handful of undecided senators who Reid had to wrangle as the vote was approaching. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Cory Gardner	None	None	None	2014-04-15T10:41:49	2014-03-31	['None']

pomt-13546	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/26/donald-trump/clinton-wants-tax-african-american-businesses-50-p/	Donald Trump’s newfound focus on black voters collided with a prior talking point on Hillary Clinton’s tax plan during a speech at a New Hampshire rally. But in the process he made an already inaccurate argument even more wrong. The GOP presidential candidate attacked Clinton on several fronts Aug. 25 in Manchester, including over alleged elements of her tax plan. "She wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now," Trump said. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests to show us how Clinton’s tax targets black business owners with close to a 50-percent tax increase. It appears Trump’s penchant for going off-script further undermined his own attack. Wrong about rates Let’s acknowledge immediately that Trump’s focus on African-Americans, as if Clinton planned to tax them as some vindictive measure against black-owned businesses, is misleading. Trump has been attempting to woo black voters lately, so he likely was trying to present his point about taxation in a way that resonated with African Americans. But it comes across as Clinton targeting blacks in a way that would not apply in the tax code. There’s nothing in her tax plan that spotlights the country’s 2.6 million or so black-owned businesses in such a way. "The tax code is race neutral. Nothing targets — or gives preference to — anyone based on race," said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "Whether a provision disproportionately affects people of one race relative to those of another race depends on particular situations but isn't based on race." We have an idea what Trump was trying to say. Earlier this month, he told a Detroit crowd on Aug. 8 that Clinton "would tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent." We rated this statement Mostly False in a previous fact-check. The Trump campaign told us then that his earlier statement referred to a 4 percent surcharge Clinton has proposed on high earners. Using an analysis of Clinton’s plan from the Tax Policy Center, the campaign pointed out the top tax rate is currently 39.6 percent. A business owner also could potentially be paying 3.8 percent in Medicare taxes, reaching a rate of 43.4 percent. Add the 4 percent surcharge on top of that and you reach 47.4 percent. That was the "nearly 50 percent" part. Except it’s not as simple as that. Clinton's proposed 4 percent tax increase only applies to taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of over $5 million, and only income in excess of $5 million would be taxed at that extra 4 percent. That’s not a lot of business owners. Only about 0.5 percent of all small businesses in the nation reported a profit of more than $1 million in 2011, according to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis. Overall, only a bit more than 34,000 of the 150 million or so tax returns filed in 2013 reported income of more than $5 million. That's an even smaller fraction — about 0.02 percent of all earners. But Trump made it worse for himself in this new description. The prepared remarks for his speech read, "She wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent." This is important to note, because he then ad-libs and changes the meaning of the sentence by adding "more than they're paying now." That means instead of saying they will be taxed at 50 percent, they will be taxed at a rate almost 50 percent higher than they are currently. That’s a different assertion. Experts told us it’s difficult to find anything in Clinton’s plan that telegraphs such a hefty increase. Leonard Burman, director at the Tax Policy Center, said the effective tax rate for the highest-earning self-employed people would only go up by about 7 percent. If Trump were referring to corporations, which are affected by the rise in tax rates on capital gains and dividends, the marginal effective tax rate on new corporate investment would still go up by less than 10 percent. Williams further noted that Clinton’s proposed "Buffett Rule" requiring people with income greater than $1 million to pay a minimum 30 percent tax rate could theoretically boost a person’s tax by more than 50 percent. But the conditions would have to be specific, so that result probably wouldn’t bump tax rates on business income by 50 percent. Her proposed 28 percent cap on the value of tax preferences — think credits, deductions, exemptions and so forth — also doesn’t appear likely to produce such a dramatic change. "There might be an odd case in which that would boost taxes a lot but nothing pops into my brain," Williams said. He added that it’s difficult to be certain absolutely no one would face such an increase, but "it doesn't look like any of (Clinton’s) plans could increase a person's tax bill by half." Our ruling Trump said Clinton "wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent more than they're paying now." Putting aside the irrelevance of the comment about African-Americans, the campaign never specified exactly how Clinton’s tax plan would do that to anyone. Clinton has proposed some tax increases on higher earners, but barring an extremely unusual case, nothing she has proposed approaches boosting taxes by almost 50 percent.

pomt-05336	Says Mitt Romney would deny gay people the right to adopt children.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/14/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-opposes-gay-adoption/	Within a day of President Barack Obama announcing his support for same-sex marriage, his campaign released an ad chiding Republican rival Mitt Romney for opposing it. It’s true that Romney does not support gay marriage -- he reaffirmed that position the same day as Obama’s historic announcement. But the Obama campaign video claims that Romney would deny certain rights to gay partners, including the right to adopt children. The ad shows short clips of both candidates talking about gay marriage -- Obama saying he supports it, Romney saying he doesn’t -- then the words "What rights would Romney deny?" appear onscreen. "Health insurance for your partner and kids," it says on the screen, followed by "adopting children together," and finally "emergency medical decisions for partners." The words are all stamped with "DENIED" in red letters. We wondered about the adoption claim: Does Romney’s opposition to gay marriage go that far? Obama campaign’s evidence Asked for evidence to back up the ad, the Obama campaign pointed to Romney’s support for a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman. That bill, as proposed, would override any state laws, such as the one in Massachusetts, making marriage between people of the same gender legal. The amendment does not address adoption by gay couples. The day of Obama’s announcement, May 9, 2012, Romney said he also opposes civil unions "if they are identical to marriage other than by name." But we found Romney has repeatedly expressed support for domestic partnership rights, on a state-by-state basis. The Obama campaign cited this "states’ rights" stance -- in which states would be empowered to allow or deny certain domestic partner benefits -- as evidence that Romney would deny the rights. But we find a flaw in that logic, because when Romney has argued that position, he has listed those rights in positive terms. "My preference again would be to have a national standard, with one standard for the nation. Now that doesn’t mean that same-sex couples can’t enter into domestic partnerships, and the benefits associated with domestic partnerships could be, developed from, by enterprise, by the state, by the federal government," he told the Ames (Iowa) Tribune editorial board in 2011. "So one could say for instance that in Iowa, a same-sex couple can come together, can adopt a child. And they can have hospital visitation rights and so forth. I mean you could decide what benefits, each state can decide the benefits associated with people who live in domestic partnerships." In other words, Romney didn’t frame the issue in terms of rights the states could deny gay couples. He listed adoption and hospital visitation as rights that states could grant. More from Romney on the topic Other statements from Romney do not offer resounding support for the rights of gay couples to adopt. His words are measured, and often accompany a statement about his opposition to gay marriage. But they make clear that, at least, Romney does not favor state laws prohibiting gay couples from adopting. 2006: In saying he planned to pursue a law in Massachusetts exempting religious groups from allowing adoption by gay parents, Romney was quoted in the Boston Globe, "I know that there will be some gay couples who will say that this could be discriminatory against us, except that there are many, many other agencies that can meet the needs of those gay couples, and I recognize that they have a legitimate interest in being able to receive adoptive services." June 2007: "There are other ways to raise kids that's fine: single moms, grandparents raising kids, gay couples raising kids. That's the American way, to have people have their freedom of choice," he said, according to the Associated Press. July 2008: Wolf Blitzer, then on CNN, asked, "If the states -- whatever state said, you know what, it's fine for gay couples to adopt kids, that would be OK with you?" Romney answered, "I didn't oppose that here in Massachusetts. My view was the best setting for a child to be raised is where there's a mom and a dad, but I did not say let's put in place a law that would prevent a court from deciding that a child, instead of being in an orphanage, should be with a same-sex couple or with a single mom or a single dad. You leave that up to the court and let them make the decision." Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told BuzzFeed in February 2012: "Gov. Romney believes a family with one mother and one father is the ideal setting to raise a child. That doesn't mean adoption by other parents — whether they be single or same-sex — should be outlawed. States have to make decisions that are in the best interests of children, and where possible that should be in a home with one mother and one father." And the day after Obama’s announcement, Romney told Fox News host Neil Cavuto: "I also know many gay couples are able to adopt children. That’s fine." He also said, "If two people of the same gender want to live together, want to have a loving relationship, and even want to adopt a child -- in my state, individuals of the same sex were able to adopt children. In my view, that's something which people have the right to do. But to call that marriage, is, in my view, a departure from the real meaning of that word." Our ruling Obama and Romney have starkly different positions on gay marriage, but Obama’s ad distorts Romney's position when it says he would deny gay couples the right to adopt children. We found nothing in Romney’s past statements to support that claim. He is a clear opponent of gay marriage, and does not seem to favor civil unions if they afford all the same benefits as marriage. But he is on record as supporting domestic partnerships, with specific rights determined individually by states. The Obama campaign interprets this as Romney saying states would be allowed to deny gay couples the right to adopt. But when he has articulated his position, he has often mentioned adoption as one of the rights states could grant. And this year, Romney called adoption by same-sex couples "something which people have the right to do." The claim in the Web ad is not accurate. We rate it False.

pomt-00923	"When you have 8,000 veterans a year committing suicide, then you have a serious problem."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/27/johnny-isakson/rate-not-just-number-helps-explain-vet-suicide-ris/	Georgia’s senior U.S. senator took control of the U.S. Senate Veteran Affairs Committee in January, and within a month, had bipartisan support for a bill aimed at improving mental health care for veterans. Johnny Isakson noted the broad support for the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention For American Veterans Act in an Associated Press article just days before it cleared the Senate and headed to President Barack Obama’s desk. "When you have 8,000 veterans a year committing suicide, then you have a serious problem," Isakson said. That statistic – based on the math that an average of 22 military veterans take their lives every day – is often repeated by the same broad groups. The AP story that quotes Isakson also cites it. But just how accurate is the figure? PolitiFact Georgia already tackled the problems with the figure in a fact check about "solider suicides" made by Democratic Congressman David Scott, who represents part of metro Atlanta. Now that the bill is law, the government will repay student loans for psychiatrists who join the Department of Veterans Affairs and also will develop peer support groups and community outreach with veterans’ service groups. So what about those veterans? The figures in question come from a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs report released in 2013, based on the most extensive data the agency has collected on veterans’ suicide. The study examined death certificates in 21 states, to conclude that veterans accounted for 22 percent of suicides. Applying that percentage to about 38,000 suicides in the United States annually that translates to about 8,300 veteran suicides, or 22 a day. However, it’s important to acknowledge the study looked only at 21 states. Georgia was not among them. The death certificates themselves also were imprecise. The report itself acknowledges that about 5 percent of a sub-group of the sample were misidentified as veterans or non-veterans, when checked against VA records. In other words, the figures are an estimate. Although the study was the first analysis of its kind, it does not offer an actual count of the number of veterans who take their own lives. A study published this month does finally offer a specific number, at least for recent veterans. The study published in the February issue of Annals of Epidemiology matched military records of nearly 1.3 million active-duty veterans who served between 2001 and 2007 with the National Death Index. It found 1,868 suicides through the end of 2009. That translates into a rate of one suicide per day for that specific group of recent veterans. So which is accurate -- estimates of 22 suicides daily among all veterans or 1 a day for recent vets? Most likely, both, said Michael Schoenbaum, an epidemiologist who specializes in military suicides at the National Institute of Mental Health. Not that either number matters, without a frame of reference. And that’s where it gets tricky. Schoenbaum points out 22 or 1 are simply numbers. Their significance is meaningless, until they are applied to how they stack up against comparable non-veterans suicides. There, the data is far more clear. Suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in the United States, with a rate of 12.6 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Both studies, the estimate for all veterans and the actual count of recent veterans, show a much higher rate for veterans. The VA study shows a rate that is 20 percent higher than the civilian population. The most recent study is even more alarming, showing a 50 percent higher rate, with 29.5 deaths per 100,000 veterans. "To say 22 veterans a day, 8,000 veterans a year, commit suicide, it’s a defensible statistic," Schoenbaum said. "When people ask me about suicide risk in veterans, I don’t talk about that. I talk about rates," he continued. "The general insight there is yes, there is something about the veteran population that is leading them to have higher rates of suicide than other people. And I believe we have a national obligation to help them." Isakson said he knew of "shortcomings" in the VA data but said the estimates were the best available when he spoke during committee hearings. He made the issue a priority when he took over the committee, he said, because of the need for more attention and information on the issue. "The intent is to have a number that can reflect that this is an alarming rate, and we must address it, given our obligation to all veterans," Isakson said. The $22 million in funding is designed to pay that debt, as federal agencies work to compile more accurate data. The VA is working with the Department of Defense, to assemble the Suicide Data Repository, Schoenbaum said. Like the latest study, it will pair death records to military and healthcare records, but for all veterans. "The reason to do these calculations, to track this data, is to first see if there is a problem. Now we know, there is," he said. "The next step is to process where it is. Who is at risk? Why? That requires more data that we don’t yet have." And the information we do have? Isakson said 8,000 veterans are taking their own lives every year. The number comes from a VA study that is statistically reliable, if somewhat lacking context. It is the context that matters here. The number fails to impart the fact that research shows veterans commit suicide at a higher, perhaps much higher, rate than their civilian counterparts. Isakson was correct on the numbers. But there is a bit of context missing in what those numbers mean. We rate Isakson's statement Mostly True.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2015-02-27T00:00:00	2015-02-02	['None']

pomt-05561	"In his very first budget, (Milwaukee) Mayor Tom Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/05/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-milwaukee-ma/	The Republican Governors Association is back on Tom Barrett’s case. The pro-Scott Walker group is reprising its 2010 attacks on the Milwaukee mayor, who lost to Walker in the governor’s race and is seeking the Democratic Party nod in the impending 2012 recall election. Topic A (again): Taxes. In 2010, we rated Mostly False an RGA claim that Barrett, as a Milwaukee congressman, "voted for the largest tax increase in history." Now on a sharply worded website dubbed "Higher Taxes, Fewer Jobs," a political arm of the RGA (the Right Direction Wisconsin PAC) alleges: "Instead of making government live within its means, Mayor Barrett paid for all his spending by raising taxes, even in these challenging economic times. In his very first budget, Mayor Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since. In fact, property taxes are up more than 20 percent and fees have doubled." The website is a detailed complement to an RGA TV ad on Barrett -- the ad featuring an elevator going down. (We’re working on several claims from that ad, which also goes after Democrat Kathleen Falk, also running in the all-but-certain recall election against Walker). Barrett, in addition to running in the Walker recall race, was re-elected as Milwaukee mayor on April 3, 2012 against underfunded candidate Edward McDonald. No one disputes that total tax levy collections rose during Barrett’s two terms, and the RGA gets the numbers roughly right. But we were interested in whether Barrett broke an old campaign promise on taxes, and has raised taxes and fees every year. On the campaign promise, an RGA spokesman pointed us to an Aug. 7, 2003 Journal Sentinel article on a candidate forum from Barrett’s first bid for mayor. "As mayor, I will not raise property taxes," Barrett said at the forum. We found a similarly forceful pledge in the paper’s coverage of another forum on August 23, 2003. "I'm not going to raise property taxes," Barrett said at that one. The tax levy has grown 25 percent under Barrett, from 2005 to 2012, according to official city figures on tax changes under Barrett. Case closed? No. There’s more to this story. After both Barrett quotes, the stories immediately noted Barrett had made clear his pledge was to freeze the tax rate, not the overall tax levy -- the total amount collected from all city taxpayers. So what happened to the rate? The rate actually went down 5.5% in Barrett’s first budget -- the "very first budget" the RGA website refers to. To be sure, its not an especially impressive feat -- rising property assessments meant the rate could go down even if more money was collected in taxes. What’s more, those same rising property values meant many homeowners faced a higher out-of-pocket bill despite the lower rate. But that was the pledge Barrett made. The RGA website also says Barrett broke his pledge to "keep a lid on" property taxes in his first budget. That’s another line right out of the 2003-’04 campaign. It came later in the race, when Barrett, under pressure to toughen up his tax pledge, said he would impose a virtual freeze in the overall tax levy in his first budget. "Pledges to keep lid on amount collected from property tax," the Journal Sentinel said of Barrett in a Nov. 12, 2003 issues story. "Would allow increase in first budget, for 2005, to account for increased tax base from new construction. Would review this pledge on ‘a year-by-year basis.’ Not considering any fee increases." So Barrett made the same "freeze" proposal that state legislative Republicans championed at the time -- allowing only for tax increases to cover the new growth in a community. How did Barrett do on that second pledge, which was only for one year? He proposed a 1.99 percent levy increase for 2005, compared with new construction growth of 2.175 percent. He did not renew his tax pledge for his next budget. For the record, in subsequent years, Barrett signed budgets that raised the levy by 5.0 percent, 3.3 percent, 3.3 percent, 4.3 percent, 4.1 percent, 0 percent and 0.5 percent. The rest of the RGA claim is that Barrett has continued increasing taxes and fees "ever since" that first budget in 2005. What does that mean? One way to hear the statement is an allegation that both fees and taxes went up every year. Another is that taxes or fees -- one or the other, not both -- went up every year. Either way, there are problems with that part of the RGA claim. It’s clear that both taxes and fees have not both gone up every year. Barrett’s 2011 budget -- presented as he ran against Walker -- actually cut the tax levy a tiny amount. It was the only time he had done so in his eight years. Indeed, the RGA’s own TV ad says: "Taxes went up every year but one." Collections from major fees usually went up, year to year under Barrett from 2005 to 2012, but they went down twice compared with the previous year, city records show. In 2011 fees didn’t go up, so that year neither taxes nor fees went up. This is based on the collective take from the city’s major property-related fees, including fees for solid waste, snow and ice removal, stormwater and sewer. But it’s worth noting that if you define fees much more broadly -- as every service charge city departments collect -- fees in fact have gone up every year on Barrett’s watch, as his budget documents note. And even in 2011, when fees against residential property owners fell overall, one fee, for stormwater, went up. An owner of a one-to-four unit residential property saw an increase per quarter in that fee. For the city, fees are a stand-in for property taxes, we noted in a September 2010 item. We reported that revenue from major fees had more than doubled under Barrett. A new fee -- the stormwater management charge -- went into effect under Barrett. Our conclusion The Republican Governors Association said, "In his very first budget, (Milwaukee) Mayor Barrett broke his pledge to keep a lid on property taxes and has continued increasing taxes and fees ever since." The group is wrong on Barrett’s first budget, no matter which of Barrett’s promises you consider. But there’s an element of truth in the part of the claim alleging continual fee and tax increases, depending on how you define fees. We rate the RGA statement Mostly False.

pomt-02220	"Pregnant women who stand for five to six hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term pregnancy by 80 percent."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/20/michael-solomon/providence-city-council-president-michael-solomon-/	On April 3, 2014, legislation intended to protect pregnant women from workplace discrimination and safeguard the health of both the mother and child was introduced before the Providence City Council. It called for accommodations such as extra break times and the right to transfer to lighter duty. Arguing in support of the legislation, Council President Michael Solomon, a co-sponsor, said in a news release, "Pregnant women who stand for five or six hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term pregnancy by 80 percent." Pre-term pregnancy means a woman gives birth before 37 weeks -- about eight and a half months -- of pregnancy; 37 to 42 weeks is considered normal. Currently about 1 in 8 babies are born pre-term in the United States and they account for about 35 percent of infant deaths. We knew that studies have shown that most physical activity does not pose a risk during pregnancy, but we were unaware that prolonged standing could hike the risk of prematurity by 80 percent -- which is almost double the normal risk. In his news release, Solomon attributed the information to the Women's Fund of Rhode Island. We are fact-checking his statement because, although he clearly cited the source of his information, public officials are still responsible for the statistics they repeat. Solomon released a statement defending the idea behind the proposal, saying, "Providing reasonable accommodations and taking common sense steps to protect the health of pregnant women and their babies is the right thing to do." He did not offer any evidence to support the 80 percent statistic. As it turns out, the issue has been studied for years and the findings have been all over the map, with some researchers discovering a risk comparable to 80 percent -- and sometimes greater -- but most finding a much smaller risk, if any risk at all. Also, the definition of "prolonged standing" can vary from study to study, which can make it hard to compare studies. "The Face of Pregnancy at Work" page on the Women's Fund website essentially has the same claim Solomon made: "Women who stand for 5 to 6 hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term delivery by 80 percent." It lists no source. A spokeswoman promised to get back to us with more information. Meanwhile, we called the 57,000-member American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which sent us some material that raised questions about the 80-percent claim. For example, the American College sent us a 1995 study that involved women who stood at work for longer periods -- in this case five hours per day. They were 20 percent more likely to have a premature delivery than pregnant workers who stood for two hours or less each day. That's significantly lower than 80 percent. An overview of such studies was published in 2000 in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology. It combined the results from 14 studies published between 1983 and 1998. Eight found no link between prolonged standing (defined as more than three hours a day, not five or six hours), two showed a clear link and three showed a barely significant increase. The studies from the mid-1990s onward tended to show no link. Overall, the researchers calculated, prolonged standing increased the risk by 26 percent. When the people at the Women's Fund got back to us, they directed us to the summaries of seven studies. Some were part of the Obstetrics and Gynecology analysis (which was included in their list). There were also some more-recent examinations of the question. One found no significant risk for premature delivery for women standing more than seven hours a day. A second found that the risk was 69 percent greater. A third, a 2004 report in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, found that a woman would have to stand for more than six hours a day to produce a significant risk. Doing so increased the chances of preterm birth by 26 percent. It was the same degree of risk seen among women who reported that the satisfaction of their job was low. However, in the countries where the infant mortality rate was low and women could take long prenatal leaves, standing for more than six hours did not increase the risk at all. When it comes to body posture, "the worst position a pregnant woman can be in is standing and being motionless," said Dr. Raul Artal, chairman of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine in Missouri. A woman who is on her feet but moving around doesn't face the same risk, he said. "Actually, I would encourage women to walk around." Instead of a risk that's 80 percent higher, an estimate in the 20-30 percent range "is much more reasonable," said Atral, who edits the Clinical Updates in Women's Health Care for ACOG. In general, "healthy pregnant women should be encouraged to continue to live a normal life," he said. We also note for the record that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a list and poster of things a woman can do to prevent a pre-term delivery. Avoiding prolonged standing is not listed as a big risk factor. Our ruling Providence City Council President Michael Solomon said, "Pregnant women who stand for five or six hours at a time increase their risk of pre-term pregnancy by 80 percent," attributing the statistic to the Women's Fund of Rhode Island. That's a very specific claim. But the evidence is based on a few studies, cherry-picked from a larger body of research that suggests that the risk, if there is one, is significantly smaller. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12259	Says "James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With" Debbie Wasserman Schultz.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/10/freedomcrossroadsus/its-fake-news-james-comey-and-debbie-wasserman-sch/	Take an FBI director controversially fired by President Donald Trump (James Comey), add in an ousted Democratic National Committee chairwoman (Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.), and whip up an air of illicit love and it’s not hard to assemble clickbait gold. If you can suspend all common sense, that is. The website Freedomcrossroads.us -- topped by a patriotic flag, a bald eagle, and the motto, "AMERICA -- LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT!" -- recently ran an article headlined, "BREAKING: The Democrat James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With Was JUST REVEALED! (DETAILS)." The article posits that the website has uncovered an affair lasting at least eight months between Comey and Wasserman Schultz. (For the record, both are married.) Let’s get quickly to the bottom line: This allegation is complete and utter hooey. We are fact-checking it because Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. As of July 7, 2017, the post had been shared 2,200 times. A reprinted version at a separate site, thelastlineofdefense.org, prompted additional shares. Comey’s paramour, according to the article, is "none other than the DISGRACED former Chair of the DNC, Debbie "Whiny Democrat" Wasserman Schultz — talk about a match made in Heave… errrrr… Hell! These two dimwits were probably attracted to each other because they are both LOSERS who can’t accept defeat, but that doesn’t really differentiate them from the rest of the crybaby Democrat Party, now does it?" The website cites "our exclusive sources" to support the idea that the two "couldn’t put aside their lust for each other and decided to have an affair. Not exactly shocking, considering they’re two liberal sickos — and we all know, ANYTHING goes for them." The article suggests that Comey’s criticism of Trump, the man who fired him, stems from a desire to "impress his GIRLFRIEND. Pathetic." Neither Comey’s nor Wasserman Schultz’s camp commented for this article, but debunking this item is straightforward: Freedomcrossroads.us is a self-styled parody site that operates for clicks that earn advertising money. Its modus operandi is to troll social media users susceptible to believing overheated conservative rhetoric. At the bottom of the home page, the site says, "We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here." On another page, the site informs readers, "Freedom Crossroads is a magical place where patriots and God-fearing, Trump-loving Americans can go to find like-minded friends, read all about the buzz in the conservative community and be a part of the revolution to make America great again." The site, it says, "uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth. In fact, there is likely no truth at all in what you will read here. All of our articles are basically a crock of doody and should be considered satirical whimsies for today’s aging conservative. All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations." Such disclaimers, however, are nowhere to be found on the actual article page, which makes it easy for some readers to miss the joke. Our ruling Freedomcrossroads.us published an article that said "James Comey Has Been Having An Affair With" Debbie Wasserman Schultz. As the website itself acknowledges on another page, this is all a "crock of doody." Only one rating fits: Pants on Fire.

pomt-04099	"Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/16/providence-city-council/providence-city-council-resolution-claims-semi-aut/	In the wake of the deadly school shootings in Newtown, Conn., the Providence City Council passed a resolution calling for "a ban on the sale, use, and possession of all semi-automatic firearms within Providence." The Jan. 3 resolution, approved on a 8-6 vote with one abstention, begins with a preamble, outlining a variety of claims about gun violence to support a ban. It opens with 14 "Whereas" statements, beginning with the definition of a semi-automatic firearm as "a weapon that fires, extracts, ejects and reloads once for each pull and release of the trigger." (By contrast, fully automatic weapons continue to fire as long as the trigger is being pulled.) But it was the second statement which caught our attention. It says, "Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield." There is no doubt that some of the semi-automatic weapons sold to consumers these days are either very close to those used by soldiers or designed to have the characteristics of military weapons. It's one of their selling points. For example, Bushmaster M4-type carbines are advertised as having a "distinctive military barrel profile." The company says its products are used "by the military of more than 50 countries worldwide." But we also know that other weapons, such as many hunting rifles, meet the definition of semi-automatic. So we wondered whether it’s accurate to say that all semi-automatics were really designed for military use. We contacted the City Council’s majority leader, Seth Yurdin,to see what evidence he had. He wrote back in an e-mail that, "Semi-automatic weapons as a class were designed for the battlefield. Why? Semi-automatic weapons are efficient at killing as many people as quickly as possible." After listing several different types of weapons used in mass shootings, Yurdin said, "Yes, there may be particular semi-automatic weapons that have not been designed to win military bids, but the point is that semi-automatic weapons are designed to be efficient killing machines." We tried unsuccessfully to contact several manufacturers about the histories of their products, but they did not respond. But four experts with whom we did speak said the statement in the City Council resolution is wrong because many semi-automatic weapons -- from the very first to those in use today -- were not designed for war. William Fowler, distinguished professor of history at Northeastern University, in Boston, said semi-automatic weapons "are not necessarily military. Shotguns, for example, can be gas operated," utilizing gas from the discharge of one round to push the next round into the chamber, ready for the trigger to be pulled again. Going back to the beginning, the first design of a semi-automatic rifle was unveiled in 1885. American gunsmith John Moses Browning crafted the first semi-automatic shotgun in 1902. By 1910, Winchester, Remington and others were making semi-automatic sporting rifles. When they were first manufactured, "a lot of time the semis were intended for use by the general public," said Frank Hanner, director of the National Infantry Museum in Fort Benning, Ga. "These were pocket pistols and different things, what we would consider to be a Saturday night special today. A lot of these were intended for protection on the street." "The semi-automatic system was NOT specifically developed for the military," said Richard Colton, a historian at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts, who cited the semi-automatic pistols that came out in the 1890s, many of them made in Germany, that were supposed to be for personal use. David Stieghan, U.S. Army Infantry branch historian at Ft. Benning, said, "Semi-automatic weapons such as shotguns and .22 caliber hunting rifles had already been in existence for 40 years" before the U.S. military became the first to adopt them. "The initial push was to manufacture them for hunting, and home defense and self-defense, because very few in the military cared about them until after World War I," he said. Why didn't the military embrace them earlier? "They were difficult to machine and manufacture in a way that was inexpensive, and they were not amenable to use in the trenches of World War I," said Stieghan. "With all the mud, dirt, water and everything else, they were just not reliable enough." And what about weapons for sale today? Stieghan said the vast majority of semi-automatic firearms available to the public were never designed for -- nor offered for sale to -- the military. "There are all sorts of semi-automatic weapons that are unacceptable [to the military] because they're not rugged enough and they don't have the long-range and accuracy that the military would require," he said. "They are designed specifically for consumers." Our ruling The Providence City Council, in a resolution approved earlier this month, asserted: "Semi-automatic weapons, whether pistol or rifle, were designed for use by the military on the battlefield." The military and gun experts we consulted told us that history tells a very different story. The military did not embrace the weapons until decades after they were developed. Even today, there are many semi-automatic weapons available to consumers that were not designed for battlefield use. Why bother with such distinctions? The contentious debate over gun control is consuming the nation. We believe it’s imperative to get the facts right. We rate the "statement of fact" in the council's resolution False.

pomt-01101	Western Europeans "can fly in the United States without even having a visa."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/11/michael-mccaul/can-europeans-fly-united-states-without-visa/	The slayings in France have raised awareness that terrorist threats can spring up on European soil. And if terrorists can emerge there among people holding European passports, they could come here. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, highlighted that risk during an interview on CBS News’ Face the Nation on Sunday. McCaul worried about jihadists who, like one of the killers in France, trained with terrorists in Yemen and returned to France. McCaul said tracking them is pivotal. "Western Europe, again, is more lenient in their travel restrictions," McCaul said. "And we have a visa waiver-free system where they can fly in the United States without even having a visa. We need to look at all sorts of things like that." We decided to take a closer look at McCaul’s claim that Europeans can fly to America without a visa. A quick peek at the State Department website shows that McCaul has it right. Tourists from 28 European nations do not need a visa for visits that last no longer than three months. However, they do need to complete an online application, and in some cases, U.S. officials will deny them entry. The application covers the basics of name, address, passport number, employment status and so forth. The Department of Homeland Security recently added a couple of questions to that application precisely because it would help authorities spot travelers who bear a closer look. People now need to report if they have a second passport for another country or have ever traveled under another name. Experts we reached suggested these details do less to uncover suspicious individuals themselves and are more aimed at avoiding false positives in the system, which wastes precious resources. If McCaul is correct about the visa waiver for Europeans, then the next question is, how big a gap does this represent in border security? Assessing the risk from Europe A report from the Henry Jackson Society, a London-based group that favors a strong military to support liberal democracies, examined the number of al-Qaida-related incidents in the United States that had a European connection. It found that since 2003, there has been only one case, that of the so-called "underwear bomber" in 2009. The authors looked at whether perpetrators in the United States had any terrorist training. "Since 2005, individuals charged were less likely to have terrorist training or combat experience; less likely to be linked to al-Qaida or another Designated Terrorist Organisation; and, subsequently, less likely of carrying out an attack that could lead to mass casualties," the authors wrote. They concluded that the European and American counterterrorism strategy had been effective in reducing the threat of an al-Qaida-related attack in the United States, although the Boston Marathon bombing showed that the risk was ongoing. That report came out in 2013. The security experts we reached generally echoed its findings, but they also noted that the number of Europeans who have gone to the Middle East in pursuit of jihad has climbed sharply. "The jihadists now have a lot of people with western passports," said Brian Jenkins, a RAND Corporation advisor and a former member of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. "It is a potential vulnerability." But Jenkins also described the current methods that might catch the would-be terrorist. A number of security filters Jenkins walked through the example of a French citizen who went to Yemen. "The minute they went to Yemen, the intelligence services there are cooperative," Jenkins said. "We’d likely spot them on the way in and on the way out. Also, the European intelligence agencies would have a chance of picking them up, and that info would be shared with us." Jenkins spoke of the lists the United States maintains, beyond the no-fly list of suspicious individuals. He said there are other databases. For many years, American security agencies have used airline data known as the Passenger Name Record. It provides information on how and where a reservation was made and how it was paid for. The PNR data is assessed before someone boards a plane and while they are en route. "I wouldn’t say that there is racial or ethnic profiling here, but we have pretty good profiles of tourists and what they look like," Jenkins said. "If there are anomalies, that person gets looked at." Should the person land in the United States, Jenkins said the track record of domestic counterterrorism has been pretty good. A Saudi citizen was caught in Dallas when he tried to link up with radical Islamic sympathizers. In Jenkins’ view, the greater risk for Americans comes from people who already live here. "When we look at the terror attacks in the United States since 9-11, the overwhelming number are homegrown," Jenkins said. William Braniff is executive director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. Braniff said there are two ways to assess how effective the current strategy has been. "At best, it does prevent known terrorists from entering the country," Braniff said. "At worst, it may serve as a deterrent. Attacking in Europe may be perceived as less risky but of similar reward than risking the flight to the United States." Braniff cautioned, however, that the proliferation of databases and security filters comes with its own drawbacks. "When you get to 50,000 names, countless transliterations, and then bury them among the millions of names of air travelers coming to or from the U.S., implementation can become unwieldy," Braniff said. Both Braniff and Jenkins noted that efforts to tighten entry rules for Europeans would have to be balanced against the strong economic benefits of tourism and business that the current system allows. Our ruling McCaul said that Western Europeans can fly to America without a visa. That is accurate. However, while a visa is not required, European travelers must fill out an application. This is the start of a digital record that allows officials to sift through a variety of databases that can flag suspicious people. To date, the experts we contacted and the research we read spoke to a set of strategies that have so far been effective at reducing the risk of European terrorists entering the country. We rate the claim True.	None	Michael McCaul	None	None	None	2015-01-11T11:57:45	2015-01-11	['United_States']
pomt-08641	Says he created more than 500 American jobs.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/17/bill-flores/bill-flores-says-he-created-more-500-us-jobs/	In a bid to unseat nine-term U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, Republican Bill Flores touts his prowess in creating private-sector jobs. In a TV ad that started airing Aug. 26, the narrator says: Bill Flores. "He's a businessman, not a politician. Bill helped build successful energy companies and created over 500 American jobs. Now Bill Flores is running for Congress." Flores chimes in: "Washington is out of control and it's time for Texans to stand up and stop them." Edwards fired back in an ad that started airing a few days later. In it, the narrator says Flores helped run a company that laid off over 3,000 workers, a statement we rated False earlier this week. Now we're looking at whether Flores indeed created more than 500 U.S. jobs, as his ad says. As evidence, Flores provided us with a spreadsheet he created detailing changes in the workforce over the years at the five companies he helped steer as chief financial officer. Accounting for some job losses at the companies, Flores said he created 1,431 jobs from 1980 through 2009. First, we wondered why his ad doesn't boast about creating more than 1,400 jobs. Flores told us that he picked an estimate that was "bulletproof accurate." More than 500 jobs "gets the point across," he said. Keyes Offshore, September 1980 - March 1990 Flores told us that according to his notes, he created 356 jobs at Keyes before it was sold to Marine Drilling in 1990, where Flores was appointed CFO. We weren't able to independently confirm Keyes' payroll after searching news archives and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with which companies must file financial information. Marine Drilling, March 1990 - August 1997 Flores said Marine Drilling had a net loss of 582 jobs during his tenure, which he attributed to a downturn in oil and gas prices in 1991 and 1992. "Marine Drilling was forced to execute significant financial and operational restructuring in order to survive," a note on his spreadsheet says. Flores said Marine Drilling had 1,495 employees when he started there in 1990. The SEC only has company filings available starting in 1994, so we weren't able to confirm that. By February 1994, the company had about 700 employees, and by March 1997, it had 800, according to its SEC filings. By March 1998, the company employed 942 people. Flores left Marine Drilling halfway between those two headcounts; he estimates it had 913 employees at that time. Western Atlas, August 1997 - August 1998 This period proves key to Flores' overall claim because, by his count, Western Atlas gained 1,607 employees while he worked for the company. As of December 1996 — before Flores came on board — the company had approximately 14,000 full-time employees, including 8,900 in oil field services and 5,000 in industrial automated services, according to the company's SEC filing. Flores was in charge of the company's oil field services division, which became an independent company under the Western Atlas name in October 1997, he said. By December 1997, the company employed 10,600 people — an increase of about 1,700. The employee counts in the SEC filings don't jibe precisely with Flores' tenure because they were taken eight months after he joined and also eight months after he later left the company. Flores said his estimate of the company's job growth — about 100 jobs less than the SEC suggests — is supposed to account for that. Flores told us he accounted for about 105 Western Atlas jobs that were lost as a result of its merger with Baker Hughes Inc. Gryphon Exploration Company, November 2001 - August 2005 Flores said he created five jobs here, boosting the payroll to 29 employees before the company was acquired by Australian-based Woodside Petroleum. We couldn't find an SEC filing for Gryphon. Meantime, Caran Crooker, the company's former controller, said she couldn't remember precisely how many jobs were added during Flores' tenure but said that five sounded about right. She said the company at least hired a couple people in the finance department, a receptionist, and two engineers. Phoenix Exploration Company, November 2005 - December 2009 Flores, who helped found Phoenix Exploration, told us he had created 45 jobs by the time he left in 2009. Two news reports back him up. In August 2006, a few months after Phoenix opened for business, the company paid $340 million for all offshore Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana assets owned by Houston-based Cabot Oil and Gas Corp., according to a March 2007 article in the Houston Business Journal. "Even though I had put together a great team, we only had 12 people on the payroll at the time, so it kept me awake at night," the Journal quotes Flores saying. By March 2007, the headcount totaled 44, including management like Flores, according to the Journal. In May 2009, six months before Flores departed, the Houston Chronicle ranked it number 61 of its top 100 private companies, noting Phoenix employed 48 people. Crooker, now a controller at Phoenix, said there are 45 employees on the books. We wondered how much personal credit Flores can rightly claim for the job growth at Phoenix and the other companies. Miguel Quinones, a management professor at the Southern Methodist University Cox School of Business, said: "To say he personally created (jobs) would be a stretch. It'd be like him taking credit for the price of oil or gas going up. What creates jobs is demand for products and services. Unless he opened up a new product line, or somehow opened up a new market ... you can't claim (credit for creating all jobs)." When we asked Flores why he, as the CFO, deserves the credit, he said his ad "says the companies that Bill Flores helped create, it doesn't say Bill Flores anywhere takes personal credit for it." When we pointed out that the narrator flat out says Flores created the 500-plus jobs, Flores said: "That's not the way it was intended to be read. It was intended to be read that these companies created over 500 American jobs." Indeed, a message on his campaign website says Flores "helped create" more than 500 jobs. And in April, his campaign debuted a TV ad saying "his energy companies created 500 American jobs." Flores told us: "What we've tried to always say is, 'I was a leader at a company that helped create jobs.'" Where does this trail wind up? Our research is by no means perfect, since the payroll numbers we found didn't precisely line up with the months Flores started and stopped working at each company. As far as we can tell, significantly more than 500 jobs were added to the payrolls at growing companies where Flores worked as a CFO. But as he acknowledged to us, the statement's wording overstates that achievement — leaving viewers to conclude he personally created the jobs. We rate his statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10245	Sarah Palin "has had 12 years of elected office experience."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/31/john-mccain/ten-years-in-municipal-government-two-as-governor/	The day after John McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate for the presidential campaign, McCain defended his pick from questions about her experience. Chris Wallace, who interviewed McCain on Aug. 30, 2008, for Fox News Sunday , asked McCain several questions about why he selected Palin. Here's one exchange: Wallace: "You have criticized Obama as being, quote, 'dangerously unprepared to be president.' In the sense of national security and foreign policy specifically, isn't Sarah Palin even more dangerously unprepared?" McCain: "Oh, no. Look, she has got the right judgment. She has got the right judgment. She doesn't think, like Senator Obama does, that Iran is a minor irritant. ( That's a claim we previously ruled False. ) She knows that the surge worked and succeeded, and she supported that. ... "So she has had 12 years of elected office experience, including traveling to Kuwait (as governor to visit the state's National Guard), including being involved in these issues. And look, I'm so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive. She has run a huge economy up there in the state of Alaska. Twenty percent of our energy comes from the state of Alaska, and energy is obviously one of the key issues for our nation's security." Here, we'll examine McCain's claim that Palin has 12 years of elected office experience. Palin first took elected office in 1992, when she was elected to the city council of Wasilla, a town of 5,469, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, near the city of Anchorage. She served on the council until she made her first run for mayor in 1996, ousting a longtime incumbent. (The vote was 617 to 413, according to press reports from the time.) She won a second three-year term as mayor, serving until 2002. Counting her time as mayor and on the council, Palin spent 10 years of elected office in Wasilla's municipal government. In 2002, Palin ran for lieutenant governor and lost. She did not run for elected offfice again until 2006, when she won the race for Alaska's governor, ousting incumbent Frank Murkowski in the primary and then beating Democrat Tony Knowles in the election, 114,697 votes to 97,238. She took office on Dec. 4, 2006. Palin was about three month's short of two years in the governor's office when McCain made his remarks, but we'll round up because it would be 12 years total elected experience if the ticket wins and takes office in January 2009.

pomt-09623	Says Bill White is for gay marriage.	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-bill-white-supports-ga/	The Republican Party of Texas debuted an online attack ad Dec. 2, 2009, casting Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill White, the former Houston mayor, as too liberal for Texas tastes. The GOP's spot muffles the audio from a White advertisement while blaring the Platters' oldie "The Great Pretender" and suggesting White isn't as moderate as he claims. And the ad includes a stab that might wound White's appeal to many Texans: "Favor gay marriage? Bill White's for it." We weren't aware of White's pro-gay-marriage stance. As evidence, the Republican Party pointed to White's vote against a ban on gay marriage that was proposed as a constitutional amendment in 2005. The ban passed statewide with 76 percent of the vote, two years after Lawrence v. Texas, a landmark case that decriminalized sodomy in Texas. White's campaign countered that White has since said that his 2005 vote wasn't a vote for gay marriage. His campaign spokeswoman Katy Bacon said White wasn't available for comment and pointed us to the only public statement White has made about the Republicans' ad, reported in a Dec. 12 article in the Dallas Voice. In an e-mail to the publication, which touts itself as a media source for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community, White said his position is the same as that of Barack Obama, who endorses civil unions but does not support same-sex marriage. Obama supports unions that would give same-sex partners legal rights and privileges equal to those of married couples on a state-by-state basis, including the right to assist a partner during an emergency, equal health insurance, employment benefits and property rights. Unlike marriage, civil unions aren't recognized in all states. For instance, even if you had joined in a civil union with your partner in Vermont, you wouldn't be able to visit that person in the ICU after a head-on collision in Texas — a state that doesn't honor civil unions. "Contrary to generally held assumptions, civil unions do not provide the same protections as does a marriage in terms of legal and financial rights, benefits and protections," said Yolanda Padilla, a professor of social work and women's studies at the University of Texas at Austin. "These are not minor differences, but indisputably place gay couples in a very vulnerable position." White, who received the Political Equality Award in 2009 for his commitment to the Houston community from gay rights organization the Human Rights Campaign, said as mayor it was his job to work for everyone. For the same reason, he has said he refrained from taking sides in the gay marriage debate. "As mayor, I avoid commenting on state and federal laws and policies I do not influence. I intend to vote 'no' on the proposed state constitutional amendment to protest its use as a wedge issue," White told Houston's GLBT Political Caucus Political Action Committee, according to a 2005 Houston Chronicle article that the Republican Party's video ad cited as evidence of his support for gay marriage. Now that he's running for governor, White told the Dallas Voice that he intends "to represent all Texans, and I expected to be attacked for this." But that isn't the same as championing same-sex marriage. We find the Republican Party's claim False.	None	Republican Party of Texas	None	None	None	2010-01-12T15:28:03	2009-12-02	['None']

pomt-01239	"Congress Approves Bill Offering Free Cars To Welfare Recipients."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/17/americannewscom/social-media-post-says-barack-obama-backed-bill-wi/	Does the "welfare queen" now have a new car and gas card to go along with her trusty Obama phone? A recent claim circulating on the Internet says she does. A reader recently sent us a November American News article that says welfare recipients will be eligible for a free vehicle and receive a monthly $100 gas card beginning Jan. 15 under new legislation proposed by President Barack Obama. The article said: "Recently, the White House announced a plan to offer free vehicles to welfare recipients. According to reports, the bill passed in a narrow vote. The program was initiated by President Barack Obama, and in many way mirrors what has become known as ‘The Obama Phone’, or the program through which welfare recipients can get free cell phone service. "John Earnest announced the program launch, stating ‘The free automobile program gives low-income Americans the opportunity to take ownership of a vehicle at no cost, and will also include a monthly gas card for $100.’ "Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that this passing will be the downfall of President Obama. " ‘This absurd plan that the democrats have conjured up is beyond belief. I have no idea how or why congress passed this,’ McConnell stated." The story earned more than 80,000 Facebook likes by Nov. 17, but here’s the deal: It's not accurate. There was no such bill proposed by the Obama administration, and Congress did not pass any such measure. The White House spokesman is Josh Earnest, not John Earnest. (The premise is also kind of amusing -- Congress hasn’t been in the habit of passing Obama initiatives for some time now, whether by a "narrow" margin or not.) Rather, the claim originated at an acknowledged fake-news site. First, let’s dispense with the old claim about "Obama phones." This claim is, at best, greatly exaggerated. We’ve checked various versions and found that their accuracy rated from Mostly False to False to Pants on Fire. As for the idea that the federal government has established a welfare program involving no-cost gas cards and cars for low-income Americans -- well, this is pure fiction. The story was originally posted on Empire News in August. Empire News offers a disclaimer on its About page: "Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental." We have debunked other Empire News claims, such as one in a story headlined, "Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt" (this one got a Pants on Fire) and another that said a judge in Austin, Texas, sentenced a 34-year-old man to death row after committing his third offense for marijuana possession. Some of the site’s other posts have headlines like "New Hollywood Trend Has Celebrities Getting Baby Pig Semen Injections To Look Younger" and "Kanye West Insists On Nobel Prize, Claims He ‘Brings Peace’ Everywhere He Goes." The fact checkers at Snopes.com busted the claim earlier this fall. The article then made its way to American News, a site that received a "Pants on Fire!" last week for a claim that "death panels" under the Affordable Care Act had recently executed their first patient. American News offers a mixture of ads and has no information about the site or who runs it. But it includes many fake, yet often nominally believable, articles ripped from other sources that attract clicks from social media users and, presumably, Web revenue for American News. Footnote: Although Obama has not proposed a federal program that offers welfare recipients a car and monthly gas cards for free, his 2012 opponent -- former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican -- actually implemented one. The Massachusetts program that gave low-income Massachusetts residents vehicles and paid for various related expenses, such as insurance and AAA membership, according to a 2012 ABC News article.

pomt-07615	Says a "rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees" were added by Texas school districts over the last decade.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-there-was-extraordinary-growth-non/	Hinting that Texas school districts should adjust budgets without laying off loads of teachers, Gov. RIck Perry told Capitol reporters March 9 that non-classroom school employees are burgeoning. "Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a rather extraordinary amount of non-classroom employees added to (Texas public) school rolls," Perry said. "So are the administrators and the school boards going to make a decision to reduce those, or are they going to make a decision to reduce the number of teachers in the classroom? I certainly know where I would point." Responding to a request for more information that day, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said in an e-mail that from 1998-99 to 2008-09, the number of Texas public school teachers rose 27.1 percent from 256,276 to 325,809 while the number of administrators increased 35.6 percent from 18,531 to 25,130. Diving in, we broadened the back-up comparison bandied by Perry's office to encompass a full decade. In 1998-99, according to TEA, teachers comprised 51 percent of the state’s 506,604 full-time employees and administrative staff made up 3.4 percent. Other non-classroom workers, including support and auxiliary staff, accounted for the rest. In 2009-10, teachers amounted to 50 percent and administrative staff accounted for nearly 4 percent of the state’s 661,286 full-tiime school district posts. So, teachers were slightly down as a share of school district workforces and administrators were up. But how "extraordinary" (in Perry’s words) was that increase? Frazier said the figures fueling Perry’s statement trace to a December recommendation by State Comptroller Susan Combs that the state "study patterns in school district administrative staffing." From 1998-99 to 2008-09, Combs says, the ratio of Texas school teachers to administrators declined from nearly 14-to-1 to 13-to-1--meaning 1,571 administrative positions would have to be cut to achieve the previous ratio. Administrators are defined in the recommendation as superintendents at all levels (assistant, associate and deputy), chief administrative officers, chief executive officers and/or presidents, tax assessors and/or collectors, athletic directors, business managers, directors of personnel and/or human resources, instructional officers, principals, assistant principals, registrars and teacher supervisers. Tom Currah, an assistant director at the comptroller’s office, told us in an interview that Combs focused on positions the education agency defines as administrative--not counting, for instance, counselors, librarians, janitors and similar support and auxiliary staff. "We were looking at management types," Currah said. Next, we used the TEA’s counts to take a crack at school districts’ staff changes over the decade. Some perspective: Student enrollment increased from more than 3.9 milllion in 1998-99 to more than 4.8 million in 2009-10, up 22 percent. For 2009-10, the state counted 333,090 teachers, up 28 percent from 1998-99, and 25,525 administrative posts, up 48 percent. Districts’ employees over all totaled 661,286, an increase of 31 percent. Staffing was down from 1998-99 in only one of nine administrative categories, tax assessor-collectors. Among other categories, the biggest percentage increases resided in district instructional program directors or executive directors (up 55 percent); assistant principals (up 53 percent); and directors of personnel/human resources (up 51 percent). The biggest increase in raw numbers, from 3,167 to 9,129, was for assistant principals. We noticed that another school employee category, support staff, increased by a larger margin than administrative staff--by 60 percent to 59,571 positions as of 2009-10. Two other categories, paraprofessionals and auxiliary staff, increased less than 30 percent each. Among support staff positions, "other campus professional personnel" increased nearly 300 percent, totaling 5,635 in 2009-10, and other non-instructional district personnel nearly doubled to 13,568. TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us examples of other campus professionals, who serve on one or more campuses, include community liaisons, informational technology staff and instructional officers. Examples of non-instructional personnel include administrative department heads, associates or assistants and professional-level staff in areas including food service, research/evaluation, transportation, purchasing and security. Next, we looked at the overall change in all non-classroom employees, who increased 33 percent to 328,194 from 1998-99 to 2009-10. One way of summing this up is to say the districts’ overall hiring rate of non-classroom workers ran 18 percent ahead of the hiring rate for teachers. How come? Lynn Moak, a former TEA administrator and Austin lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, suggested in an interview that some of the faster-paced increase in support staff traces to positions funded by federal, not state, aid. Broadly, he said, the increase reflects districts hiring people to guide teachers and students toward fulfilling toughened accountability standards. "You didn’t do that by adding more teachers" necessarily, Moak said. "You did that by making the teachers we had better." A March 4 online post by his firm, Moak, Casey & Associates, says that most of these non-teaching, non-administrative staffers "are providing services to students" and "are not easily expendable, particularly if current service levels are to be maintained and compliance with federal and state requirements is to be met." "If you’re trying to maintain student performance while you’re trying to go through these financially tight times, you’re going to see a lot of different patterns depending on how the district is organized and how the district is doing," Moak said. "If the district is needing a lot of help from these other (non-classroom) staff, the district may choose to keep these other staff rather than keep teachers." Upshot: Over the decade, the increase in non-classroom employees -- especially in support and administrative staff -- outpaced growth in student enrollment and teachers. But whether this addition of non-classroom staff qualifies as "extraordinary" is open to debate. We rate Perry’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-14959	Says Hillary Clinton "couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking and speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/22/martin-omalley/omalley-hillary-clinton-doesnt-want-reinstate-glas/	In a recent appearance on Comedy Central’s Daily Show, Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley doubled down on prior attacks on Hillary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street. While O’Malley charged Clinton with flip-flopping on a variety of issues close to progressives’ hearts, he said she hasn’t cut ties to Wall Street, which is based in New York, a state she used to represent in the Senate. O’Malley said Clinton doesn’t have the "independence" to protect Main Street from the excesses of big banks. "There were many things that she changed positions right before the debate… whether it was the Trans-Pacific Partnership or whether it was Keystone," O’Malley said on Oct. 19. "But she couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking from the speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall, because she can’t." We decided to take a closer look at O’Malley’s claim that Clinton "couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking and speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall." First, a refresher on the Glass-Steagall Act: It was passed in the wake of the Great Depression to keep commercial banking and investment banking separate, as a way of protecting the broader economy from the downside of speculation. As we noted in a previous fact-check, the law was whittled down over the years, until President Bill Clinton fully repealed it in 1999. Since the most recent financial crisis hit, reining in big banks and other financial institutions has been a rallying cry for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But is it true that Clinton doesn’t echo that cry? For starters, Clinton’s formal Wall Street reform plan doesn’t include reinstating Glass-Steagall or reintroducing its provisions. Based on her recent comments, as cited by both the O’Malley and Clinton camps, that’s because she thinks reinstatement of Glass-Steagall is a red herring. Here are a few examples: • July 23 at a campaign event in South Carolina: When asked why her economic policy doesn’t include reinstating Glass-Steagall, Clinton responded, "This is a much more complicated issue than to point at any one piece of legislation and say if we just pass that, everything would be fine. Our first goal has to be to implement fully and effectively Dodd-Frank," referring to the landmark act signed by President Barack Obama that created a consumer protection agency and imposed regulations on financial institutions. • Sept. 29 in an interview with actress and writer Lena Dunham: "Some people say all we have to do is break up the banks. Well, the problem with that is, the banks did their fair share of trouble, but a lot of the problems were not from these traditional banks. They were from what’s called the shadow banking world. ...So I think we’ve got to be more comprehensive." • Oct. 6 at the first Democratic primary debate: "Well, my plan is more comprehensive (than reinstating Glass-Steagall). And frankly, it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail." • Oct. 8 in a column for Bloomberg: "One serious approach being advocated is to pass an updated Glass-Steagall Act, separating commercial and investment banking, to reduce the size of the banks and the risk of a taxpayer bailout. I certainly share the goal of never having to bail out the big banks again, but I prefer the path of tackling the most dangerous risks in a different way." • Oct. 16 at a town hall in Keene, N.H.: "I fully respect my colleagues who have said let's reinstate Glass-Steagall. And if I thought that alone would prevent the potential next crisis, I'd raise my hand and join, but that's not my assessment. ...Glass-Steagall wouldn't do anything about it, if it were reinstated tomorrow." In short, Clinton has tip-toed around the issue. She’s expressed skepticism that reimposing Glass-Steagall, or something close to it, would solve the problems stemming from financial regulation. However, she argues that attacking the problem differently — for example, by imposing a "risk fee" on the financial institutions with assets over $50 billion, regulations on the "shadow banking" sector (i.e. hedge funds) and guidelines for prosecuting financial wrongdoing — would actually be a more effective response. Our ruling O’Malley said that Clinton "couldn't bring herself to say we need to separate commercial banking and speculative banking, namely reinstating Glass-Steagall." Clinton’s Wall Street reform plan does not say it would reimpose Glass-Steagall, and she’s repeatedly downplayed the idea that it should be revived. However, Clinton argues that her alternative course would be more comprehensive and effective than simply reimposing the old law. O’Malley’s claim is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Martin O'Malley	None	None	None	2015-10-22T13:52:07	2015-10-19	['None']

pomt-06087	Says he’s proposed "the largest employer contribution to the Virginia Retirement System in history."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jan/06/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-hes-proposed-record-contrib/	Gov. Bob McDonnell has proposed spending an additional $2.2 billion on state employee and teacher pensions during a two-year budget period that will begin July 1. The governor, in presenting his biennial budget plan to the General Assembly’s money committees on Dec. 19, said his pension proposal, if approved, would be "the largest employer contribution to the Virginia Retirement System in history." We wondered whether the total $2.21 billion infusion over two budget years would truly be historic. Since taking office in 2010, McDonnell has made a number of proposals to reform the Virginia Retirement System, which is an estimated $19.9 billion short of the assets needed to pay its projected pension liabilities over the next 85 years. But the governor also added to VRS’s woes early in his term by convincing the legislature to divert $620 million in scheduled pension contributions to balance the state’s general fund, which pays for education, public safety and health programs. Under McDonnell’s new proposal, Virginia would pay roughly $600 million for state employee pensions during the 2013-14 budget years. Another $1.6 billion would be contributed to teacher retirement funds, with local governments picking up $1 billion of the sum and the state government paying $600 million. Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s director of communications, told us the governor’s claim that the $2.21 billion total contributions would be historic was based on VRS data. The VRS figures show the largest employer contribution to date came in the 2007-08 biennial budget when total state and local contributions were $1.72 billion. That’s lower than McDonnell’s proposal. The retirement system started in 1942, but VRS doesn’t have records of employer contributions before 1973. Jeanne Chenault, a VRS spokeswoman, said the number of teachers and state employees before 1973 would have been lower, so it’s unlikely that contribution amounts would have exceeded 1973 levels. The VRS data shows annual contribution amounts without adjusting for inflation. So we did that work ourselves to see McDonnell’s claim could survive another test. It did. Even when adjusting for inflation, the 2007-08 contributions were still the high-water mark for employer contributions to the pension system, coming in at just more than $1.8 billion in current dollars. McDonnell’s proposal eclipses that. Our Ruling: The governor said his proposed $2.21 billion employer contribution for state worker and teacher pensions would be the largest in VRS history. For as far back as the data goes, the governor’s statement is correct even when adjusting for inflation. We rate the claim True.

pomt-10190	On whether the government should bail out insurance giant AIG.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/19/john-mccain/mccain-neither-endorsed-nor-condemned-the-bailout/	For many, the scope and complexity of this week’s financial market meltdown was punched home when the Federal Reserve on Sept. 16 launched an $85-billion bailout of insurance giant American International Group. The intervention came just two weeks after the Treasury took over the government-chartered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and was driven by the fact AIG provided insurance to myriad investors who bought securities tied to the mortgage market. Had the firm failed and been unable to pay claims on the investors’ losses, it would have unleashed a calamitous ripple effect through global financial markets. All of which didn’t exactly mollify fiscal conservatives who’ve long been leery of any government intervention in private business. The move puzzled Republicans in Congress, because a few days earlier the Bush administration had refused to bail out the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy. Moreover, the Fed and the Treasury Department had previously rebuffed AIG’s appeal for a $40 billion bridge loan to avert a downgrade of its credit due to investment losses. On the campaign trail, John McCain stuck firm to his anti-interventionist principles before the bailout was announced. Appearing on NBC’s Today show, McCain said AIG should be left on its own. “We cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else,” he said. The GOP presidential candidate echoed those remarks on CNBC’s Squawk Box the same day, when he responded to a question about whether, if he were in the Fed’s position, he would let the firm fail. “I think you have to,” McCain replied, adding he knew efforts were afoot to raise enough capital to keep AIG in business. But the day after the bailout was announced, McCain sounded more resigned than resolute, stating that the government had been “forced” into taking action. “Today, the government was forced to commit $85-billion to stop the collapse of AIG,” McCain said in a Sept. 17 statement. “These actions stem from failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street that has crippled one of the most important companies in America. …The focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies, retirement plans and other accounts with AIG. We must not bail out the management and speculators who created this mess. They had months of warnings following the Bear Stearns debacle, and they failed to act. We should never again allow the United States to be in this position. We need strong and effective regulation, a return to job-creating growth and a restoration of ethics and the social contract between businesses and America." That certainly doesn't sound like a reversal to us. It's true that McCain could have issued a statement denouncing the bailout as the wrong decision, so it's fair to conclude that by saying the government was "forced to commit $85-billion to stop the collapse of AIG" he's agreeing that it needed to be done. But this is far from an endorsement of the idea and reads more like a grudging acknowledgment. In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sept. 18, McCain was a bit more clear: "When AIG was bailed out, I didn't like it, but I understood it needed to be done to protect hard working Americans with insurance policies and annuities." Obama seized on McCain’s statement as evidence of a flip-flop. Speaking in Espanola, N.M., on Sept. 18, Obama said, “On Tuesday, he said the government should stand by and allow one of the nation’s largest insurers to collapse, putting the well-being of millions of Americans at risk. But by Wednesday, he changed his mind.” Obama’s depiction strikes us as over the top. Based on his remarks, McCain seemed willing to swallow some pragmatic trade-offs, given the remarkable circumstances in the markets. And McCain in his statement added that the intervention should not apply to “the management and speculators who created this mess.” Yet it’s debatable whether the government really was forced to take action. It could have allowed another giant corporate bankruptcy that would have accelerated a repricing of credit that’s hitting corporations and individuals alike. Moreover, the government’s action sets a precedent for more costly government bailouts, particularly if some large regional banks or the giant thrift Washington Mutual get sucked down by the crisis. In truth, the decision, for the moment, is being widely viewed as economically prudent and politically wise. Because McCain stopped short of endorsing the bailout even as he declined to criticize it, we rule this one a Half Flip.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-19T00:00:00	2008-09-17	['None']

pomt-12590	"I've won awards on environmental protection."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/06/donald-trump/trumps-environmental-awards-closer-look/	At a town hall with CEOs, President Donald Trump said his administration will be able to get rid of 90 to 95 percent of regulations "and still have the same kind of protection." "We want safety and we want environmental protection," Trump said April 4. "I've won awards on environmental protection. I'm a big believer, believe it or not. But we want that kind of protection. We want clean air and we want clean water, but we shouldn’t have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing." Many readers asked us to look into Trump’s statement about his environmental awards. It’s something he’s said before. At a 2015 campaign rally in Iowa, even as Trump scoffed at environmental regulations -- as in "a snail, or turtle or snake or something" that blocked projects -- he said his environmental bona fides were sound. "I’m a big believer in clean air and clean water," he said Dec. 11, 2015. "I have gotten so many awards for the environment." While Trump might have talked about "many awards" in Iowa, here, we’re simply looking for at least two. The White House pointed to the two it knows about. A New Jersey golf course In 2007, one of Trump’s golf courses got an award. The Metropolitan Golf Association gave its first annual environmental award to the Bedminster New Jersey Trump National Golf Course. How much credit did Trump get? Some. The man who accepted the award on behalf of the golf course, Greg Nicoll, got his moment in the sun, too. The association’s announcement said Nicoll "has been an environmental leader among Met Area clubs. Through the leadership of Donald J. Trump, Nicoll has implemented an environmental strategy that has resulted in the preservation of a dedicated 45 acre grassland bird habitat on the property, as well as intensive erosion control and stream stabilization management plan." So it wasn’t a personal prize for Trump, but the golfing club certainly gave him a thumbs up. Trump did get personal recognition in the second award on the White House’s list. (Hat tip to the Washington Post Fact-checker.) Forest land in New York It seems 2007 was a good year for Trump and the environment. That year, the Friends of Westchester County Parks gave Trump its inaugural Green Space Award for donating over 400 acres to the state park system. The group’s treasurer, Chris Frawley, said, "It is with heartfelt gratitude that we honor Mr. Trump for his vision and commitment to preservation of open space." Interestingly, there’s a golf connection here, too, and a backstory of Trump’s experience with environmental permitting. Trump had bought land in Yorktown, about 35 miles north of Manhattan, with plans to turn forest and meadows into a 155-acre golf course. He spent four years trying to win approval, but hit delays due mainly to wetlands on the property and its proximity to a drinking water reservoir. Golf courses use a bevy of chemicals to maintain the turf essential to the game. Jim Tierney, an assistant state attorney general overseeing New York City's watershed, told the New York Times that Trump’s golf course in Yorktown would have been within a mile or so of the New Croton Reservoir, an unfiltered drinking water source for 900,000 city and county residents. ''Once something gets into the drinking water, it doesn't get filtered out,'' Tierney told the newspaper. ''It comes out of the faucet.'' In 2002, Trump pulled the plug on the project. In a letter announcing his decision, as reported by the New York Post, Trump told the Yorktown supervisor, "You have done a terrible disservice to your constituents who have sadly lost out on a tremendous opportunity." The town said it was still working to resolve issues with Trump when he withdrew his plans. Trump saw it differently. ''I think the approval process in Westchester is even more difficult than the approval process in Manhattan,'' Trump told the New York Times. ''But in a perverse way, they've done me a favor because the land has gotten more valuable.'' Trump’s letter said he could make more money selling the land to home builders than developing it for golf. Ultimately, after a few years, he decided to donate the land. The state created the Donald J. Trump State Park, and Trump got his award. There’s a coda to that: In 2010, budget cuts led the state to say it would no longer maintain the park lands. Trump said "If they’re going to close it, I’ll take the land back," according to news reports. He didn’t take further action. It's worth noting that these two awards were not from major environmental groups such as the Sierra Club or the Environmental Defense Fund. They were from local groups for specific projects. Our ruling Trump said that he has won awards for environmental protection. The White House pointed to two that include his name. One thanked him personally for donating over 400 acres of undeveloped land to the New York State Park System. The other recognized the environmental stewardship of a Trump golf course in New Jersey operated by a well known manager, and cited Trump’s leadership in general terms. So Trump can firmly claim one personal award and one where his role and the accorded honor are more diffuse. By definition, two is plural, but the personal recognition of Trump is thin for the second one. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13320	Says Hillary Clinton "went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/06/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-overstates-clintons-record-cutting-russi/	Whereas Donald Trump has undisclosed business dealings with Russia, Hillary Clinton got the country to reduce its nuclear weapons, said Clinton’s running mate Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. At the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate in Farmville, Va., Kaine argued Clinton is more equipped than Trump to deal with Russia. "She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile," he said. New START, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, is an agreement between Russia and the United States designed to limit both countries’ deployed strategic nuclear weapons. The original START treaty was in force from 1994 until it expired in 2009; New START was signed in April 2010 and went into effect in February 2011. Clinton has similarly touted the New START agreement, saying it cuts Russia’s nuclear arms. We rated her claim Half True because it overstated the treaty’s impact. Kaine’s claim that the treaty was supposed "to reduce Russia’s nuclear stockpile" falls into the same hole, just a bit deeper. The treaty, in fact, doesn’t require Russia to cut its nuclear stockpile at all because it only limits deployed weapons. "Russia is not expected to rapidly or dramatically reduce its nuclear weapons holdings," said Lisa Koch, a professor and nuclear proliferation expert at Claremont McKenna College. "New START could be characterized as a modest, rather than a sweeping, arms control treaty." What’s in the treaty? As secretary of state, Clinton was involved in New START's negotiation and passage. Replacing the prior START treaty was a priority of Clinton's in the beginning of her tenure in 2009. She served as co-commissioner of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission with Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, and she personally met with Russian leaders in Moscow to discuss New START during the negotiation phase. She also was involved in persuading senators to support the treaty. New START has three primary limitations on vehicles capable of launching nuclear weapons and the nuclear warheads themselves. By February 2018, Russia and the United States each have to meet these restrictions: 700 deployed ballistic missiles and heavy bombers, which include intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons; 800 total deployed and non-deployed launchers, such as intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers, and nuclear-capable heavy bombers; 1,550 total deployed nuclear warheads on these missiles and bombers. It’s accurate that these limits are more restrictive than prior treaties. For example, START I limited deployed nuclear warheads to 6,000, and the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty limited them to 1,700-2,200. But it’s questionable whether it has, in practice, reduced Russia’s nuclear arsenal for two main reasons: First, Russia was actually below New START limits in two out of the three categories right when treaty implementation began in February 2011. The State Department publishes where both countries stand on these requirements twice a year, starting with an initial exchange of data when New START took force in February 2011. At that time, Russia had 865 deployed and non-deployed launchers for strategic missiles and heavy bombers, meaning it would have to reduce that fleet by 65 to meet the limit of 800 by February 2018. However, Russia had 521 deployed missiles and heavy bombers out of 700 allowed, and 1,537 deployed nuclear warheads out of 1,550 allowed. So Russia could actually increase its deployed missiles and heavy bombers, as well as its deployed nuclear warheads, beyond that initial February 2011 count and still be within treaty limits. Before New START passed, it was clear Russia intended to modernize its nuclear arsenal in a big way, said Steven Pifer, director of the Brookings Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative. Now, their modernization efforts have to fit within the New START limits, and it’s unclear if they would have grown beyond those limits absent the treaty. "I would say that New START does reduce and limit Russian strategic arms, but I would not overly hype the depth of the reduction," said Pifer, a Clinton supporter who testified before Congress in favor of New START. Second, New START only limits a portion of the nuclear arsenals. New START mainly counts strategic, deployed weapons. But it doesn’t limit nonstrategic weapons, nor weapons that have been stockpiled or retired. The treaty "does not require either government to destroy non-deployed warheads," Koch said. "Both governments can still stockpile warheads beyond the agreed-upon limit of 1,550 without violating the treaty." Excluding the thousands of warheads that have been retired and are awaiting dismantlement, Russia currently has about 4,500 nuclear warheads, including stockpiles and 1,735 deployed warheads, according to Federation for American Scientists estimates. Russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline since the 1990s. That decline has nearly stagnated during President Barack Obama’s presidency, hovering at around 4,500 since 2012, according to Federation for American Scientists data. Throughout Obama’s tenure — and Clinton’s term as secretary of state — Russia has shrunk its total nuclear arsenal far less than it did under the past three presidents. And it would be difficult to attribute any reduction in Russia’s nuclear stockpiles to New START, given that the treaty only limits deployed weapons. "The end of the Cold War, the financial crisis in the 1990s and the START I treaty had a much greater effect on shaping Russia's current and planned nuclear posture than the New START treaty," said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, which supports arms control. It’s worth noting that some experts no longer consider stockpiles a serious threat to security. Under New START’s deployed weapons restrictions, the effectiveness of a large stockpile is limited, especially because Russia only produces about 10 missiles per year, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Thus the treaty might make it so that Russia does not feel the need to stockpile as many weapons. Our ruling Kaine said Clinton "went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile." New START cuts the number of strategic weapons that the United States and Russia can have deployed at any time, and Clinton played a key role in treaty negotiations. However, it does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons. The treaty hasn’t cut Russia’s nuclear arms yet. But if it does in the future, after the treaty is fully implemented in 2018, it seems that any reductions would be minimal rather than sweeping. And Russia, for the most part, was actually meeting the treaty’s limits when implementation began.

pomt-08822	Republicans are now "taking credit" for provisions of the health care bill "that they had tried to derail."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/democrats-op-ed-accuses-republicans-taking-credit-/	Whoa, talk about a change in tune. Are Republicans now trying to take credit for parts of the health care bill? Are the Yankees rooting for the Red Sox? Are dogs and cats getting along? In an Aug. 12, 2010, op-ed for Politico headlined "GOP touts preventive care it opposed," Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Rosa DeLauro , D-Conn., touted the benefits of preventive and wellness care. As survivors of breast and ovarian cancer, respectively, they said that preventive care saved their lives. But if Republicans have their way, the Democrats said, they would roll back a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires no co-pay for preventive care — including cancer screenings, health checkups, flu shots, mammograms and immunizations. That's pretty standard fare from Democratic supporters of the health care bill. But here's the part of the op-ed that caught our attention: "Even Republicans who voted against the health care reform law and went out of their way to prevent its passage have now lauded these reforms. Recently, on the Senate floor, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) actually took credit for the preventive care provision. 'One of the things we did in the health care legislation,' Kyl said, 'was to provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care.'" And, they wrote, "This is not the first time Republicans have taken credit for health care provisions that they had tried to derail. After the act passed, and every Republican attempt to gut the bill had failed, House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) took credit for provisions that banned the practice of rescissions — dropping people’s health coverage when they get sick — and allowed young adults to continue being covered by their parents’ plans until age 26. "To paraphrase President John F. Kennedy, success has a thousand fathers, while defeat is an orphan. So we understand why Republicans now like to laud health care reform — particularly when one considers that, after a decade of congressional control with eight years holding the White House as well, they had failed to do anything about the issue." That Republicans are now lauding the health care bill was news to us. So we decided to check out the two examples cited in the op-ed. Kyl's comments about preventive care came from the Senate floor on July 12, 2010. The topic was the White House's controversial recess appointment of Dr. Donald M. Berwick as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Here's what Kyl said: "Dr. Berwick expressed his disapproval for costly cutting-edge medical technologies and has said prevention services such as 'annual physicals, screening tests, and other measures' are 'over-demanded.' One of the things we did in the health care legislation was provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care, for screening, to try to help people avoid illnesses on the theory that it would be a lot cheaper if we didn’t do a lot of treatment that was unnecessary. If you could identify in advance that an individual had a need for some treatment, maybe you could catch the disease, say, the cancer, early and not have the expensive treatment, the end-of-life kind of care that is frequently very expensive." Kyl's new use of the royal "we" didn't quite mesh with his vocal opposition to the bill. In a health care debate last year -- that ended up a minor hit on YouTube -- Kyl argued against mandating blanket coverages. "I don't need maternity care, and so requiring that to be in my insurance policy is something that I don't need and will make the policy more expensive," Kyl said. So were Kyl's recent comments from the Senate floor an endorsement of the health care bill's preventive care provisions, and was he now taking credit for it? "Sen. Kyl did not, in fact, 'take credit for' anything in his remark," said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Kyl. "'We' was a factual reference to Congress, and did not contain a partisan context, as some now assert presumably for political reasons." Still, Democrats note that Kyl's tone appears to have changed, saying "we" instead of the more typical reference to the bill as "the Democrat health care bill." "The way he's talking about it, he's talking about it like it's a good thing," said Brian Cook, press secretary for Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. Whether that amounts to taking credit for the idea is getting into a bit of semantics. Certainly Republicans -- and Kyl in particular -- have forcefully opposed the health care bill, and repeatedly spoken of it in terms that liken it to a disaster. And so we can understand Democrats' frustration when a strong opponent of the bill cites a provision of of the bill that "we did" -- especially in light of his earlier comments against requiring insurers to carry preventive services -- like maternity care -- that not everyone would use. But we think it's a bit of a stretch to suggest that Kyl was "taking credit" for that provision. The "taking credit" moniker better fits the comments regarding Boehner. In an April 30, 2010, interview with Boehner on National Public Radio, a reporter said, "As you know, Democrats are already pointing to things that are already changing in America because of this (health care) bill. They will point to the fact that college seniors who would have been kicked off their parents' insurance when they graduated will get to stay on. Insurance companies are now saying they are going to end the practice of rescissions, or at least modify it..." Boehner interjected, "Both of those ideas, by the way, came from Republicans and are part of the comments and ideas that we ought to have in the law." Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, noted that both provisions -- abolishing rescissions and encouraging extended coverage of young adults on their parents’ insurance through age 25 -- were included in the Republican alternative health care plan proposed by Boehner last November. But the ideas were in the Democrats' health plan long before that. And if they were Republican ideas, asked Cook, the Democratic spokesman for the Ways and Means committee, then why was it never a part of the Republicans' legislative agenda when they held the majority? We weren't able to pinpoint who originated the ideas, but we can say these were two ideas with rare bipartisan support -- as they were both in the Democratic and Republican health care proposals. It's certainly true that Republicans aggressively fought the health care bill, and are now aggressively seeking to overturn it. But it is misleading to suggest Republicans tried to derail the health care bill based on these two provisions. So are Wasserman Schultz and DeLauro correct that Republicans are now "taking credit" for provisions of the health care bill "that they had tried to derail"? In the case of Kyl comments, we think it's a stretch to say he took credit for the preventive care provisions in the health care bill. But Boehner did credit Republicans for provisions to abolish rescissions and allow young adults to continue being covered by their parents’ plans until age 26. Yet those specific provisions were not the target of the GOP opposition, which focused on larger issues of cost and the growth of government. And so we find the claims in the op-ed Half True.

pomt-09769	AARP is "the largest reseller of insurance in the country" and "has a vested interest in seeing that the market for reselling supplemental insurance expands."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/29/ginny-brown-waite/aarp-insurance-health-reform-conflict/	AARP, the nonprofit advocacy group for seniors, has often said it does not endorse a particular plan for health care reform. But the group has been a high-profile supporter of overall reform and hosted a town hall event with President Barack Obama in July. That advocacy has bothered some Republicans. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite of Florida sent AARP a blistering letter after the group wrote her, questioning her statements about the health care reform bill under consideration in the U.S. House of Representatives. "Every day I hear from constituents who are concerned that AARP no longer represents their values," Browne-Waite wrote. "They are surprised to learn that AARP is the largest reseller of insurance in the country and as such has a vested interest in seeing that the market for reselling supplemental insurance expands." "AARP unfortunately has become a mouthpiece for this president at the expense of what is best for America's seniors," she added. The two letters are long and contain many details about the House health care bill. You can read AARP's letter here and Brown-Waite's response here . (AARP's letter cited PolitiFact.com as a source on employer mandates. See our full item here .) We wanted to check Brown-Waite's statement that "AARP is the largest reseller of insurance in the country and as such has a vested interest in seeing that the market for reselling supplemental insurance expands." Other critics have made similar charges, alleging more directly that AARP is supporting health care reform to bring in more money. We'll start with an explanation of AARP's involvement in the insurance business. AARP lends its name to insurance companies to sell policies to AARP members. The insurance companies then pay AARP a fee for the policies they sell with the AARP name. AARP calls these payments royalties. Medicare, the government-run health plan for seniors, requires people to pay a percentage of their health care costs, and there is no limit on this cost-sharing. For seniors with many health issues or catastrophic illness, this can be very costly. So seniors can buy "Medigap" policies from private insurers that help cover those costs, and this is the supplemental insurance that Brown-Waite mentioned. So AARP is not a reseller of insurance as Brown-Waite claims. It licenses its name to companies that sell the policies. Still, we wanted to know if we could quantify whether it's the biggest royalty collecter from insurance companies. Unfortunately, we were not able to quantify this. We checked with several insurance authorities, including the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC). None of them kept data on branded plans as such, and none of the experts or private tracking organizations we asked had data on that point, either. When we asked Brown-Waite's office about why she said AARP was the biggest reseller of insurance, the staff said she drew that conclusion because AARP calls itself the largest membership organization for people age 50 and over in the United States. But in our view, that doesn't necessarily mean Brown-Waite is correct. On our own, we found that AARP's partner in selling Medigap insurance is the private insurer UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co., a division of UnitedHealth Group. UnitedHealth is the No. 1 seller of Medigap coverage, with nearly 30 percent of the market, according to Mark Farrah Associates, a health insurance analytics company that analyzes data filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. So how would health reform goose Medigap sales? Brown-Waite's argument centers around Medicare Advantage, a program in which the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. Some Medicare Advantage plans offer extra benefits, so their patients don't need Medigap insurance. AARP has been critical of Medicare Advantage, because the program was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened, and Medicare Advantage actually costs the government more. AARP has argued that people on Medicare are effectively subsidizing Medicare Advantage, and that should stop. We should point out here that AARP gets royalties from Medigap plans and from Medicare Advantage plans. It partners with UnitedHealth on both plans. UnitedHealth is also the No. 1 seller of Medicare Advantage, with 16 percent of the market, followed closely by Humana with 14 percent of the market, according to Mark Farrah Associates. We also found, through the public records that AARP is required to file as a nonprofit, that AARP derives significant income from its royalties. In 2008, it earned $652.7 million from royalities. Not all of this is from Medigap and Medicare Advantage, because AARP also offers life insurance, car insurance, dental insurance, credit cards and other services. All those royalties account for 57 percent of its total revenues. (The total is an eye-popping $1.14 billion.) Brown-Waite asked AARP to disclose how much money it makes off the Medigap policies and other health insurance products; her office told us it has not received a reply. AARP said in its annual report that 65 percent of its royalties are from health-related products, but it did not provide a detailed breakdown. AARP objects vigorously to Republican claims that AARP is motivated by money in the positions it takes on health care reform. Many of its younger members, aged 50 to 64, don't qualify for Medicare and have a difficult time finding insurance if they lose coverage, the group said. The royalty money goes to fund its advocacy work, and the attacks on it for its royalties are politically motivated, it said. AARP executive vice president Nancy LeaMond said in a statement, "Similar to 'death panels' and other scare tactics, this latest effort is a misguided attempt to talk about anything other than the health care reform this country needs. ... The only benefit AARP is looking for in health reform is relief for the millions of Americans who are crushed by soaring prescription drug prices, relief for the millions of Americans who are told they can't get coverage because they’re too old or too sick, and relief for the millions of Americans who need Medicare strengthened. Period." It's difficult to assess how AARP would fare under the many versions of health care reform being considered in Congress. If the Medicare Advantage plan was reduced, it's not clear to us if AARP would benefit or not. Keep in mind, it gets royalties off Medicare supplemental insurance and Medicare Advantage, so its mix of policy types might change but it's hard to say if that would affect its overall royalties. Another argument in AARP's favor is that AARP has marketed health insurance to its members since its inception, even predating Medicare's creation in 1965. (We found several confirmations of this in the history books we reviewed on the history of Medicare.) Dr. Ethel Percy Andrus founded AARP in 1958, and the AARP site says that even back then, part of her intent was to help seniors buy insurance. Andrus started the organization to help retired school teachers find health insurance, according to AARP's history. "Dr. Andrus approached dozens of insurance companies until she found one willing to take the risk of insuring older persons," the site said. "She then developed other benefits and programs, including a discount mail order pharmacy service. Over the years (the National Retired Teachers Association) heard from thousands of others who wanted to know how they could obtain insurance and other NRTA benefits without being retired teachers. After 10 years, Dr. Andrus realized the time had come to create a new organization open to all Americans." Still, AARP's royalties have grown in recent years. Last year, the news organization Bloomberg reported a lengthy story about AARP's insurance royalties, including anecdotal complaints that some seniors were able to find cheaper policies. AARP disputed some of the article's details, as well as the notion that it was motivated by royalty payments. But Marilyn Moon, a noted Medicare expert and the former director of the AARP’s Public Policy Institute, said the organization is becoming too reliant on royalty payments. "There's an inherent conflict of interest," Moon told Bloomberg. "A lot of people there are trying to do good, but they're ending up becoming very dependent on sources of income." We talked to Moon last week and she said she still considered the organization's growing royalty payments to be problematic, and a downside of its organizational growth. "It's very hard for the tail not to wag the dog," she said. Getting back to the statement we're rating, Brown-Waite said, "AARP is the largest reseller of insurance in the country and as such has a vested interest in seeing that the market for reselling supplemental insurance expands." It is not a reseller, a word that suggests a greater financial involvement than AARP has. But AARP does attach its name to policies that private insurers sell and receive royalty payments. Is it the largest licensee? It might be — it certainly makes millions — but there is little data to confirm or refute that it is the largest. Does it have an interest? Yes, although we can't conclusively say health reform will lead to more money for AARP. So we rate her statement Half True.

pomt-10290	Says Obama replaced the American flag on the tail of his plane with his campaign logo.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/15/chain-email/airline-logo-replaced-with-campaign-logo/	A common theme in the many chain e-mails attacking Barack Obama is an allegation that the senator is not patriotic. One e-mail falsely claimed Obama refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance. Another spread a bogus quote from a satirical article that said Obama wanted to replace the Star-Spangled Banner with an old Coca-Cola theme song. (Many people didn't get the joke and forwarded the e-mail to friends.) Now comes another attack on Obama's patriotism that says his campaign replaced an American flag on the tail of the senator's charter plane with the Obama logo. The e-mail is correct that the tail was changed, but it's important to understand the details: the Obama campaign was painting over a corporate logo that happened to feature an American flag, not eliminating a stand-alone flag. The e-mail, which was sent to us by several dozen PolitiFact readers who wanted to know if it was accurate, has the subject line "What a Disgrace!!!!!" or "Fwd: Disgrace!" It then quotes from The Patriot Room, a conservative blog: "Obama The Patriot — Removes American Flag From His Plane — Barack Obama recently finished a $500,000 total overhaul of his 757. And as part of the new design, he decided to remove the American flag from the tail. What American running for President of the United States would remove the symbol of his country? And worse, he replaced the flag with a symbol of himself." Some versions of the e-mail include an additional comment that does not come from the Patriot Room posting: "Obama is such a despicable human being. ... Please forward this if you're not ashamed of our country and our flag & if (you) think this is a disgrace." We have noticed a growing number of the chain e-mails contain that direction, which acts like a reproductive mechanism to ensure the message keeps multiplying. The e-mail is correct that the Obama campaign in July 2008 directed its charter company, North American Airlines, to repaint the plane that shuttles the candidate, his aides and the press corps. (We're not examining the allegation that it cost $500,000 for the changes.) Steve Forsyth, a spokesman for North American, told us that his airline routinely repaints its planes for long-term clients. "It's done all the time," Forsyth said. North American, which has five Boeing 757s and five Boeing 767s, has long had the American flag in its logo. The flag logo can be seen on the airline's Web site and in these photos of its planes. In July, the campaign had its plane painted with the Obama logo and slogan. Presidential campaigns often do this because their planes serve as backdrops for photos and video coverage when the candidates arrive or depart from an airport. The campaigns want their own logos in the pictures — not the charter company's. Obama's plane has his slogan "CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN" and his Web address on the side of the plane. On the tail, North American's flag logo has been replaced by the campaign's sunrise logo. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, acknowledged the tail had been changed but added that there is still a flag on Obama's plane, "it's just closer to the center of the plane." He was referring to a flag on the fuselage beside the plane's registration number. Vietor noted that there is no flag on the tail of the McCain campaign plane. (But there is a wavy flag on the side of the McCain plane beside the motto "Reform/Prosperity/Peace.") If flag size on charter planes is important to you as a voter, it's worth noting that the Obama and McCain flags are dwarfed by the stars and stripes on Bob Dole's '96 campaign plane ( big flag on tail), Bush-Cheney '00 ( bigger flag on tail) and Kerry-Edwards '04 ( wavy flag on fuselage). But, back to the matter at hand. Yes, the e-mail is right that the Obama campaign replaced the American flag with its own logo, but the flag it covered was a corporate logo, not a stand-alone flag. So we'll take this down a notch to Mostly True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-08-15T00:00:00	2008-08-12	['United_States']

pomt-08339	Rick Boucher "helped write" the cap-and-trade bill	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/28/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-rick-boucher-helped-write-cap/	The cap-and-trade bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is dominating the race for the 9th Congressional District seat out in the heart of coal country. Republican challenger Morgan Griffith is pounding Democratic incumbent Rick Boucher for voting in favor of cap-and-trade. Griffith claims the legislation will kill jobs in the district, already beset with high unemployment. A recent Griffith TV ad features a repeated clip of President Barack Obama professing, "I love Rick Boucher." The narrator says: "Love the Obama Washington agenda? Rick Boucher does. Obama’s cap-and-trade plan kills our jobs and raises electricity costs. Boucher helped write it." Cap-and-trade has stalled in the U.S. Senate. But PolitiFact Virginia wanted to examine what role Boucher had, if any, in drafting the legislation. What exactly is cap-and-trade? Under the bill, the government would set a limit on how much carbon companies, such as electric utilities or manufacturers, can emit. The government would then issue permits for emissions to companies and allow them to buy and sell the permits with each other. Supporters say the policy would create a free-market system that will reduce emissions. Opponents argue that that it will kill jobs that rely on coal and other traditional fuel sources. Griffith bases his claim that Boucher helped write the bill to on a story on news website SWVA Today in which Boucher defended his vote for cap-and-trade and acknowledged having a part in amending the bill. Asked to clarify his role, Boucher explained that the alternative to cap-and-trade was to leave regulation to the Environmental Protection Agency, which he said would be devastating for companies that rely on coal and their employees. "That would be the worst possible outcome for the coal industry, coal jobs, for electric utilities that burn coal and electric consumers," Boucher told PolitiFact Virginia. As a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Boucher said he amended the legislation at the request of the coal and electric power industries in an effort to minimize the impact on coal jobs. Boucher’s changes included emissions credits that ensured that power plants could continue to use coal so long as they find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "It’s certainly accurate to say that I was deeply involved in the process, but the ad is extraordinarily misleading because it suggests that I was doing this because it was something that the President of the Speaker of the House wanted," Boucher said. "In fact, I took them on to get the deal that I got for coal." Boucher’s intentions were defended by Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, who said the congressman went to bat for coal. "The truth of the matter is that when that bill was originally introduced, there wasn’t one single dime in there in support of the coal industry," he said. "What Rick Boucher did was to get involved in the negotiations and put $180 billion into it for coal." Smith added: "Without him getting involved, the handwriting would be on the wall for the coal industry at this point." Melissa McHenry with American Electric Power said that the company was supportive of those changes that Boucher had made to cap-and-trade. "It supports continued use of coal," she said. "The alternative is EPA regulation and he recognized that that would have a significant impact to the detriment of the coal industry." Let’s look back at the details. Did Boucher help write cap-and-trade? Absolutely. But he did so to add protections for the coal industry and the jobs it provides in his district. The ad implies that Boucher contributed to a job-killing bill, but his motive was to actually protect those jobs. So while the statement is accurate that he helped write it, the ad leaves out important details. We find the claim Half True.

pomt-08803	"Since the president became the president, we have lost 3.3 million jobs in the private sector. But you know who's done OK and who's not complaining today? The public sector. We've gained 590,000 public sector jobs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/18/steve-latourette/rep-steve-latourette-says-stimulus-has-done-little/	To hear some members of Congress talk, the government’s gone on a hiring binge – at taxpayer expense -- while private-sector hiring is in the dumps. That’s not only lopsided, they say, but it wasn’t the way the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus bill, was supposed to work. U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette appears to hold this sentiment. Addressing a gathering of the Portage County Tea Party on July 6, the Bainbridge Township Republican noted how other nations are adopting austerity budgets to deal with their economic problems. Yet, LaTourette said, President Barack Obama seems to think that saving government money is a crazy idea, and told world leaders as much during the Group of 20 summit in Canada in late June. Obama "chastised them and he said, ‘You guys are nuts,’ " LaTourette said, according to a complete online video of LaTourette’s speech to the Tea Party group. Characterizing Obama’s statements further, LaTourette said the U.S. president told the globe’s economic leaders, "We need to spend more money. We need to stimulate the economy with government spending.’ "And so as a result," LaTourette told his Portage County audience, "since the president became the president, we have lost 3.3 million jobs in the private sector. But you know who's done OK and who's not complaining today? The public sector. We've gained 590,000 public sector jobs." Is LaTourette correct? We at PolitiFact thought we should check it out. We’ll deal with the numbers momentarily. As far as his characterization of Obama’s sentiments, some license for political hyperbole is in order. Obama doesn’t appear to have called fiscal austerity a nutty idea, and he actually agreed with the global leaders’ goal of halving their budget deficits by 2013. But Obama also said just before the summit that nations must "be flexible" in how they cut spending. Withdrawing stimulus measures too quickly, he said, could trigger "renewed economic hardship and recession," according to news service reports. And he argued strongly against "any early slowing of stimulus spending by governments," according to a Voice of America report from the summit, "saying that it might bring about a second recession." Transcripts of Obama’s closing news conference on June 29 in Toronto are consistent with that report. But what about LaTourette’s numbers on hiring? His numbers are right, but only after omitting a key qualifier. In January 2009, there were 110,961,000 private-sector jobs in this country, according to a database of employment statistics maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. By the end of May 2010, that number had dropped to 107,635,000. That means a private-sector job loss of 3.3 million between January 2009 and May 2010, as LaTourette said. As for public sector jobs, LaTourette was counting federal workers and not the state and local workforces, which have actually contracted. In January 2009, there were 2,803,000 federal employees. By May, there were 3,396,000 federal workers. That’s a gain of 593,000, putting LaTourette on the money. But here’s the problem. BLS makes clear, the White House makes clear, and every major news report makes clear when these numbers are released each month that the stimulus had little to do with the growth of the federal workforce. Most of it -- 559,000 new jobs from January 2009 through May – came entirely from the temporary buildup of census workers. And many of those jobs have already disappeared. For example, the government brought on 411,000 temporary U.S. Census Bureau workers in May 2010. But one month later, 225,000 temporary census workers completed their work and were let go. One month made that big a difference. Exclude all the census workers hired from January 2009 through May 2010 and total federal hiring comes to only 34,000, not the 590,000 figure that LaTourette cited. You could contend, as LaTourette’s office did when we contacted it initially, that BLS counts all these jobs in its online databases without separating or distinguishing the Census hires from the rest of the federal workers. That’s true. But BLS makes those distinctions elsewhere -- in its monthly releases of job numbers, and in a fact sheet on census hiring -- and distributes them widely to economists, policymakers, journalists and whatever segment of the public that might be interested. The distinction for the census is crucial here because it was LaTourette who said that "as a result" of stimulating the economy, the public sector gained 590,000 jobs. The government gained the jobs, but the stimulus had little to do with it. The hiring was planned before Obama became president, as were the rapid-fire census terminations occurring now . By saying there was a cause and effect, LaTourette went off the mark, but he was accurate with his private-sector number, so we rate his claim Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-10019	"Last week the Blue Chip Economic Indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters. Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/17/christina-romer/yes-take-prediction-grain-salt/	Wasn't this supposed to be the next Great Depression? So we were surprised to hear the chair of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, Christina Romer, claim that experts are saying the economy will start to recover later this year. We suspected her claim, at the very least, lacked a bit of context. Which it does. She made it on the March 15 Meet the Press , after host David Gregory played a recent tape of her saying "most people are predicting" positive growth in the economy "some time in the second half of the year." Romer, whom Obama recruited from the University of California-Berkeley, stood by that. "I should say my prediction is very much what most private forecasters are saying," she said. "We know that this last week the Blue Chip Economic Indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters. Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter." Blue Chip Economic Indicators is a monthly newsletter by specialty publisher Wolters Kluwer Law & Business. It claims to survey "America's leading business economists" and compiles their economic forecasts. It serves a blue-chip audience: A one-year subscription costs $875. The consensus, or average prediction of the panelists, was that the economy as measured by the gross domestic product would grow 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter. That was not quite enough information to gauge the accuracy of Romer’s claim, so we asked editor Randell Moore for more detail. He said 50 economists were surveyed, with 30 predicting positive growth in the third quarter of 2009 and 45 predicting positive growth in the fourth quarter. That does indeed support Romer’s claim, since 45 out of 50 constitutes "almost all" the forecasters. Some context is in order, though. The 19-page report was hardly rosy. In fact, it was more pessimistic than the previous month's issue. The issue's summary was titled, "The Longest, Deepest Recession Since World War II" and it said, "The economy still is expected to emerge from recession by the end of this year but consensus forecasts of economic growth in 2010 slipped lower once again this month." The forecasters predicted that for 2009 as a whole, the economy is expected to shrink 2.6 percent, the largest annual contraction since the Great Depression. That was worse than the prior month’s prediction of 1.9 percent. There were some glimmers of hope in there, but they came amid glum news, as in this sentence: "They say it’s always darkest before the dawn. Well, this week bordered on a full-scale blackout." Also, we should add a general note of caution about the reliability of the newsletter. The economists surveyed work for companies such as JPMorgan Chase, General Motors Corp., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Fannie Mae, all of which have decidedly less-than-sterling track records of late. As a New York Times writer noted in January , "these professional forecasters are typically employed by investment banks, trade associations and big corporations. They base their forecasts on computer models that tend to see the American economy as basically sound, even in the worst of times." The New York Times article added, "They did not see a recession until late summer. One reason they were blindsided: Their computer models do not easily account for emotional factors like the shock from the credit crisis and falling housing prices that have so hindered borrowing and spending." Very few economists predicted the current economic crisis. One who did, New York University professor and noted pessimist Nouriel Roubini (who is not a Blue Chip panelist), said on March 9 that he saw "no hope for the recession ending in 2009 and (it) will more than likely last into 2010." But Romer is entitled to highlight optimistic forecasts. And it's true that almost all the panelists surveyed in Blue Chip Economic Indicators predicted a rebound by the fourth quarter of 2009. We find Romer's claim to be True.	None	Christina Romer	None	None	None	2009-03-17T18:36:04	2009-03-15	['None']
pomt-09373	"The New England Journal of Medicine released a survey the week that President Obama signed Obamacare stating that over 30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession if the government took over health care."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/29/michele-bachmann/bachmann-claims-new-england-journal-medicine-surve/	On CBS's Face the Nation on March 28, 2010, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said she will now work to repeal the health care reform bill recently signed by President Barack Obama. "That's what I believe the American people want us to do," Bachmann said. "Again the New England Journal of Medicine released a survey the week that President Obama signed Obamacare stating that over 30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession if the government took over health care. That's very serious going forward." First things first, the survey Bachmann is referring to was not a survey by the NEJM, nor was it published in the highly respected, peer-reviewed medical journal. It was a survey conducted by the Medicus Firm, a physicians recruiting service, and initially reported in January 2010. The firm wrote an article about the survey results, which was first published on the firm's Web site. The article was later reprinted in Recruiting Physicians Today, an advertising newsletter put out on the NEJM's Career Center Web site. The Medicus Firm neither paid to have the article published, nor was it paid for the article. It was never published in the actual New England Journal of Medicine. But it's easy to see how someone might have been confused. Although the small print explains that the survey was done by the Medicus Firm, the article prominently states at the top, "From the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine" and carries the NEJM seal. In mid March, people at the NEJM began to see Twitter messages citing the survey, and calling it an NEJM survey. Jennifer Zeis, a spokeswoman for the New England Journal of Medicine, said NEJM sent out several Tweets explaining that it was not an NEJM survey. And on March 17, 2010, they put up a disclaimer on the NEJM Career Center Web site: "Recruiting Physicians Today is a free advertiser newsletter published by the Worldwide Advertising Sales and Marketing Department in the publishing division of the Massachusetts Medical Society. Each issue of the newsletter features research and content produced by physician recruiting firms and other independent groups involved in physician employment. "On December 17, 2009 The Medicus Firm, a national physician search firm based in Dallas and Atlanta, published the results of a survey they conducted with 1,000 physicians regarding their attitudes toward health reform. "The opinions expressed in the article linked to above represent those of The Medicus Firm only. That article does not represent the opinions of the New England Journal of Medicine or the Massachusetts Medical Society." Said Zeis: "It seems that along the way, people thought this was NEJM content and it wasn't. It had nothing to do with the NEJM editorial side at all." Dave Dziok, a spokesman for Bachmann, said any confusion is the fault of the New England Journal of Medicine, not Bachmann. "I know they’re doing what they can to distance themselves from the survey done by Medicus, but the fact of the matter is the New England Journal of Medicine has leant both its name and crest to the newsletter in which it was published," Dziok said. "Nowhere in their newsletter do they make the disclaimer that what’s contained within it has nothing to do with the New England Journal of Medicine," he said. "In fact, quite the contrary seeing as how their name is all over it. The NEJM may not have conducted the research itself as they’re stating now after the fact, but it’s certainly misleading on their end to have their name all over a publication like the one that was released with the results and then distance themselves from everything contained within it afterwards. They can’t have it both ways." We note that the NEJM disclaimer went up on the Web site 10 days before Bachmann made her statement on Face the Nation. And the same day the disclaimer was posted, the left-leaning Media Matters Web site explained the error, after it was reported on Fox News. Okay, so the survey was not conducted by or published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But Medicus spokeswoman Andrea Santiago said that while it was not a scientific survey, the results should not be dismissed either. The firm randomly e-mailed surveys to 2,250 physicians from their database of tens of thousands, and stopped sending them out when they had reached 1,195 responses. And contrary to the allegations of some critics, it is not a database entirely made up of doctors looking for work, Santiago said. It's a continuously updated database that originated eight years ago, she said, and includes lists of physicians purchased by the firm. The relevant question here was, "How do you think the passage of health reform WITHOUT a public option would affect your professional/practice plans, if at all?" A majority of physicians, 70 percent, responded, "no change"; while 22 percent said they "would try to retire early"; 8 percent said they "would try to leave medical practice even if not near retirement age"; and 1 percent said they would go back into practicing medicine. "We feel like it was in line with what we were hearing from physicians on the phone," Santiago said. Many doctors already feel like they are being pushed out of business by declining reimbursement rates and rising malpractice insurance premiums, she said, and "the health care reform bill exacerbates the issue." And it comes at a crucial time, she said, when the legislation will create a demand for many more doctors. However, she said, the results of the survey have been "over-sensationalized" by some as a warning that 30 percent of doctors will be leaving the profession immediately. "Obviously that's not going to happen," she said, noting that the survey didn't ask point-blank if physicians were going to leave, but rather if they would "try" to leave. "But I do think it's going to impact the workforce in a significant way. We thought the results were thought-provoking." We haven't found a reliable, independent poll of physicians asking how many would leave the profession if the health care bill passed that we could compare to the Medicus survey. The findings are consistent with a survey conducted by Investor's Business Daily back in September 2009, but we looked at that survey in October after it was cited by Glenn Beck, and concluded the results were suspect due to a number of possible influences on results. We note that the New England Journal of Medicine's Health Reform Center did publish the results of a physician survey conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the Medicus poll did, but it did find that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, which is in sharp contrast to the findings of the Medicus survey. In our previous story, we noted several factors with that survey that gave us pause about that study, such as the fact that the poll received financial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which favors health care reform, that the authors belong to a physicians organization that supports a public option, and that they donated to the Obama campaign. Still, according to an NEJM spokeswoman, the survey underwent a rigorous editorial review process that included review by staff and associate editors. In other words, it got the NEJM stamp of approval, whereas the Medicus survey did not. In conclusion, surveys performed by or published in the New England Journal of Medicine carry the weight of the journal's reputation and rigorous editorial review. Citing them as the source of a survey, as Bachmann did, lends credibility. But it was not an NEJM survey. Nor was it published in the NEJM. It was published in a free advertising newsletter geared toward the physician recruitment industry. It was conducted by a physician recruiting service that has a horse in this race. And it was not a scientific survey. We can understand how Bachmann and others may have been confused about the source of the survey. The labeling of the article as "From the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine" is easy to misconstrue. An NEJM spokesman said they are reviewing their policies to make sure this kind of confusion doesn't happen again. But on top of getting the source wrong, we think Bachmann sensationalizes the Medicus results, saying that "30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession" if the health care bill passed. The survey language was that they would "try to leave" or "try to retire early" if it passed. There's a difference. Altogether, we rate her claim False.

pomt-00242	Says that Minnesota Democratic congressional candidate Dean Phillips doesn’t offer health insurance for his employees.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/08/national-republican-congressional-committee/attack-ad-falsely-claims-dean-phillips-doesnt-prov/	As the midterm elections draw closer, a warzone of attack ads are airing in Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District. The seat, held by Republican Erik Paulsen and challenged by Democrat Dean Phillips, has been widely considered a toss up. Now, a particularly incendiary claim has made its way into a TV ad created by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The ad, which aired on Sept. 15, criticizes Phillips for not offering health insurance to his coffee shop’s employees. Phillips has made health care a focus of his campaign. The same claim is mentioned in a Congressional Leadership Fund ad, which aired only three days after the NRCC ad. Here is the text of the NRCC ad in full, before we break it down: "Dean Phillips isn’t telling you the whole truth." (Clip of Phillips speaking) "We do offer health care to full-time employees." "FACT CHECK. When a reporter asked if he offered health insurance, Phillips admitted ‘No, we don’t.’ Dean Phillips is the 1 percent, but won’t provide health care to all his employees. Dean Phillips: Another rich politician who can’t tell the truth." So does Phillips offer health insurance to his employees? He does, but not to all of them. But the ad distorts the facts and takes Phillips out of context. Let’s dive in. Phillips and his coffee company, Penny's Phillips opened Penny’s Coffee in downtown Minneapolis in 2016. The second location opened in August 2017 and a third is on the way. The NRCC ad is accurate in that Phillips doesn’t offer health insurance to all his employees, but it leaves out some important details. First, Penny’s Coffee, like many companies, does not provide health insurance to part-time employees. It does, however, pay workers $15 per hour plus tips, Phillips’ campaign said. The company now has full-time workers, and all of them get access to company-provided health care. When Phillips started the coffee shop, his campaign says he initially only had part-time workers. But once the company grew, his campaign says, a handful of employees were converted to full time, and Penny’s began to offer a health care plan in which it pays 50 percent of the premium. What the ad cites The NRCC bases Phillips’ comments in a June 2017 Forbes Magazine article in which he declared health care "a moral right." He was asked this question in the article: "Does the coffee shop you’ve started offer health insurance?" His full answer: "No, we don't. We are contemplating a pretty significant expansion, which would necessitate a reinvestigation of that, but right now, we're just a single coffee shop with a handful of employees, and that's something we'll assess moving forward. But the ACA afforded opportunities to employees like ours to actually go out and obtain health insurance." The NRCC ad cuts him off after "No, we don’t," removing the additional context. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee says that Phillips doesn’t provide health insurance to his coffee shop employees even after he has said that health insurance should be a "moral right." We found that he doesn’t provide coverage for his part-time employees, but does so for his full-time employees. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Naturally, the woman then donned her bulletproof vest, busted out her personal AK-47 assault rifle and saved the officers by firing off 160 rounds at the gang members. That didn’t happen. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article originally appeared online in 2015 on World News Daily Report, a website with a disclaimer page saying, "All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle." Since then, numerous fake news websites have copy-pasted the story, presenting it as a true act of heroism. In addition to the text being fabricated, the photo caption of the officers who were supposedly saved misidentifies the officers in the photo. That picture originates from a 2010 blog about Melrose Village — a different neighborhood than the one where the incident supposedly took place.

pomt-09764	After Fahrenheit 9/11 came out, "Bush's approval rating never was better, it only got worse."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/michael-moore-movie-bush-approval-rating/	Michael Moore talked about his new movie, Capitalism: A Love Story , at a Washington news conference a few days before the movie's nationwide release. A reporter asked him why his movies didn't have more of an impact, citing Roger and Me as not doing much to change the auto industry and Sicko as not changing public opinion about health care. Moore disputed the premise of the question, saying Roger and Me postponed layoffs in his hometown of Flint, Mich., and that Sicko spurred advocacy for health care reform. He then said that his film Fahrenheit 9/11 kicked off criticism of President George W. Bush during his second term. "It's funny how that movie gets judged as, 'Well, Bush got re-elected.' That movie comes out four or five months before the election, and somehow a movie was going to change the election. I'll tell you what it did do. "At that point, people were afraid to speak out about the war, and about Bush. He had a high approval rating. Someone had to fire the first salvo. And that's what I did, and I took a lot of abuse for it." Moore said that many liberals had supported the Iraq war and were afraid to criticize it, but that changed after his movie came out. "From Fahrenheit on, Bush's approval rating never was better, it only got worse," Moore said. "Within a couple of years, after more and more millions of Americans saw the truth in that film, he could never recover." We wanted to check Moore's statement about Bush poll numbers to see if they declined like Moore said they did. To do this, we turned to the Gallup Poll, which has tracked presidential approval ratings since 1940s. Fahrenheit 9/11 came out at the end of June 2004, when Bush's approval rating was at 48 percent. But his approval rating climbed through the rest of the summer and hit 53 percent around Election Day in early November. After the election, Bush's approval peaked at 57 percent during the first week of February 2005. A year after Fahrenheit , Bush's approval rating was about the same as when the movie came out, hovering around 47 percent. Bush's approval ratings started to noticeably decline about a year after his election, sliding into the low 40s and high 30s in the fall of 2005 and staying in that range for most of 2006 and 2007. Bush's ratings hit their all-time low in October 2008, during the financial crisis, when he had an approval rating of 25 percent. So Moore was incorrect when he said that "Bush's approval rating never was better, it only got worse" after the movie came out. The ratings actually increased and were pretty much the same a year after Fahrenheit . On the other hand, Moore qualifies his statement by suggesting that it took years for the film to have an impact, and indeed, Bush's ratings did decline overall for much of his second term. So we rate Moore's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08436	"Pam Bondi told a group of lobbyists she’ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/18/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-claims-pam-bondi-told-lobbyists-special/	In the final month of this long election season, state attorney general candidate Dan Gelber starts his first general election TV ad entitled "Epidemic" by stating the obvious: "Public corruption -- it’s an epidemic in Florida." Given the recent string of public corruption arrests throughout the state -- from school board members gone awry in Broward County to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement probe into Republican Party of Florida spending -- there’s hardly an argument there. But, as the 30-second commercial continues, Gelber makes the following claim against his Republican challenger: "Pam Bondi told a group of lobbyists she’ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general. That’s why they’re funding her campaign." He then goes on to tout his experience saying: "I’m Dan Gelber, as a federal prosecutor I helped put away corporate criminals, corrupt politicians and violent gangs. As attorney general I’ll prosecute corruption and public fraud in a way my opponent never will. While she protects insiders, I’ll take them on and protect what matters most." The statement that Bondi "told a group of lobbyists she’ll side with corporate special interests as attorney general" certainly sounded like quite a discussion, if it indeed took place. So we decided to take a closer look. When we asked Gelber’s campaign to lay out the case, spokesman Christian Ulvert responded with the following arguments. First, the campaign argues that Bondi’s comments at a fundraiser, where she sided with members of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Florida (AIF) on the issue of union-backed card checks, establishes the fact that she a) spoke to lobbyists and b) expressed her support of and "passed the litmus test" on an issue important to the corporate community. Second, Gelber’s campaign contends that Bondi has aligned herself as being more supportive of business interests by using public appearances before groups like AIF to liken Gelber to former New York governor and attorney general Eliot Spitzer. While Spitzer was forced to resign from his governor’s post following a sex scandal, as AG he aggressively went after insurance and financial firms, earning the name "the sheriff of Wall Street." Gelber's argument, then, is that Bondi told business groups that she endorses a position they’ve taken and took aim at her opponent by saying he would act tough on business interests. Let’s weigh those points. Card check On Aug. 19, 2010, Bondi attended a fundraiser held in her honor at the home of Florida Chamber of Commerce President Steve Halverson. The event, which raised $50,000 for her campaign was also co-hosted by Ericka Alba, head of Associated Industries of Florida, a group that lobbies before the state Legislature on business interests. During the event, Bondi clarified her position on the union-backed issue of "card check," which is opposed by big business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Bondi said she opposed card check -- an element of the Employee Free Choice Act, proposed federal legislation that would allow unions to organize in a workplace if 50 percent of employees sign a card in public. Currently, unions can attempt to organize only under federally supervised secret-ballot elections. Still, it's been more than a year since the Employee Free Choice Act was introduced into Congress on March 10, 2009, by its key co-sponsor, the late Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, and it has yet to come before the Senate for a full vote. Opponents of the so-called card check, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argue that by making the vote public, unions could strong-arm employees into checking "yes" for unionization. "If there is any question in your mind, I am adamantly opposed to check card," Bondi told the group, as found on this Palm Beach Post video of the event. "Everyone in this room has known from day one that I am adamantly opposed to check card. So I misspoke and I just want to make any clarification there that I need to." Bondi was attempting to clarify her position following a radio interview, given on Aug. 19, 2010, on WDBO-AM 580 in Central Florida, where she seemed to tell host Tico Perez the opposite: "With the unions, I’m totally against the secret ballot... The votes have to be public. We have to have transparency to make sure everything is on the up and up. We have to protect our businesses in this economy more than ever." Afterward, Halverson chimed in and further vouched for Bondi’s position to those in the room. "Obviously, card check is virtually a litmus test," Halverson said. "I can absolutely assure you that what Pam said -- that she’s been opposed to card check from the very beginning. If anybody heard that or heard comments from her desperate opponent to the contrary, rest assured that isn’t the case." Gelber has said in the past that he supports the Employee Free Choice Act, such as this March 2009 appearance before the Florida AFL-CIO labor union. Regardless of how the Employee Free Choice Act plays out on the federal level, it may have little bearing on Florida because it is a "right to work state" -- meaning someone hired for a job where the workers have unionized cannot be required to join a union or pay union dues. Dan Gelber = Eliot Spitzer? Gelber’s campaign also argues that by trying to paint Gelber as a Spitzer-type AG, distancing herself from that model, Bondi is signaling to business lobbying groups like AIF that she would not be as aggressive in pursuing litigation against businesses. "The obvious and unmistakable context of her argument is that Dan Gelber would take them on and she wouldn’t," Ulvert wrote in his e-mail. "Unlike Mr. Gelber, I understand the difference between using the attorney general’s office to responsibly protect consumers vs. attacking businesses as an activist AG in the mold of Eliot Spitzer," Bondi told the St. Petersburg Times in an Aug. 28, 2010, article. The article goes on to note: "Bondi does call herself ‘extremely pro-business.’ She said Friday that’s not incompatible with protecting consumers, but voters will decide that." She used the Gelber and Spitzer comparison at a meet-and-greet event with the Florida Chamber of Commerce on Aug. 19, 2010, at their Tallahassee office. "The more I hear about Dan Gelber, the more I learn, the last thing we need is an Eliot Spitzer-type attorney general," Bondi said at the Aug. 19, 2010, according to the St. Petersburg Times. Gelber’s campaign also points to a questionnaire filled out by Bondi, Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottcamp and Holly Benson, when the three were competing in the August Republican primary. All three were asked by the Republican Club of Northwest St. John’s County: "Can the AG’s office sue to recover damages against negligent companies whose actions lead to similar disasters as the BP oil spill?" While Benson and Kottcamp both wrote "Yes" as their first response, Bondi’s response was more roundabout. "Proactive and voluntary action by the business or industry to responsibly correct errors and compensate victims without the state intervening is in the best interest of Florida’s consumers," Bondi replied. "I would encourage the exploration of every possible option." Still she adds: "However, if legal action becomes necessary because a crime against the state or citizens was committed, or a business did not live up to the corrective actions necessary to appropriately compensate or correct wrongs against our state and citizens, I would aggressively seek to resolve those issues in a court of law." Bondi responds Bondi’s campaign has already issued a letter to several Florida TV stations airing Gelber’s ad, asking that they stop running the ad and calling it "misleading" and "deceptive." "He didn't express his opinion about Pam or her policies, but instead, chose to attribute to Pam a specific statement (‘I'll side with corporate special interests as Attorney General’) allegedly made to a specific audience (‘told a group of lobbyists’) with absolutely no proof," said Bondi campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley. Our ruling So back to the question. Did Bondi "tell a group of lobbyists that she’ll side with corporate special interests?" She describes herself as pro-business, and she did tell a group of lobbyists, business owners and fundraisers from AIF and the Florida Chamber of Commerce that she sided with their stance against public unionization votes. But that’s only one issue. In fact, Gelber is also on the record on that issue, with the opposite stance. We don't think that means he'll always side with unions, and we think it's too great a leap to generalize that Bondi will always side with business interests. Therefore we rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06383	Says Mitt Romney’s housing policy is, "Don’t try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/01/democratic-national-committee/ad-claims-mitt-romneys-housing-policy-let-foreclos/	An ad from the Democratic National Committee recently attacked Mitt Romney for his position on foreclosures. The ad is aimed at voters in Arizona, a state that has high foreclosure rates -- and a state that Democrats hope will be up for grabs in the next presidential election. The ad singles out Romney even though he hasn’t yet secured the Republican nomination to run against President Obama in 2012. "Almost half of Arizona homeowners -- underwater. Foreclosures -- everywhere. And what’s Mitt Romney’s plan?" the ad says. Then it shows video of Romney saying, "Don’t try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom." The ad plays the video again, concluding, "Mitt Romney’s message to Arizona: You’re on your own." We’ve seen enough of these types of ads to know that selective editing can give a different impression of a candidate’s actual position. So we decided to check it out. We soon discovered the video is from an interview Romney gave to the Las Vegas Review-Journal’s editorial board. The newspaper posted video of his comments online, noting that they were in answer to the question, "How will you help with the housing and foreclosure problems in the U.S.?" Here’s a transcript of Romney’s extended answer from the video: "As to what to do for the housing industry specifically, and are there things you can do to encourage housing? One is, don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom. Allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up, and let it turn around and come back up. The Obama administration has slow walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang. Number two, the credit (that) was given to first time homebuyers was insufficient and inadequate to turn around the housing market. I think it was an ineffective idea. It was a little bit like the cash-for-clunkers program, throwing government money at something which was not market oriented, did not staunch the decline in home values anymore than it encouraged the auto industry to take off. I think the idea of helping people refinance homes to stay in them is one that's worth further consideration. But I'm not signing on until I find out who's going to pay and who’s going to get bailed out, and that's not something which we know all the answers to." These remarks seem to be Romney’s most detailed statement of policy on foreclosures and housing. We reviewed his economic plan, "Believe in America: Mitt Romney’s plan for Jobs and Economic Growth," but it has only passing mentions of the housing sector. Instead, his economic plan emphasizes low tax rates, reduced regulations for business, initiatives for the energy sector and measures that would reduce the influence of organized labor. We were interested to note that Romney indicated he was open to the idea of helping homeowners refinance. What is refinancing? In general, if homeowners are able to refinance, that means they get lower monthly mortgage payments because they get a lower interest rate on the money borrowed to pay for their homes. Right now, some homeowners are underwater, which means they owe more than their homes are worth. In normal times, that means they can’t refinance. Romney’s comments indicate he might be open to some government action to encourage refinancing. On this point, it’s worth noting that one of Romney’s advisers is R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School. Hubbard wrote the foreword to Romney’s economic plan and leads his economic policy team. Outside of the campaign, Hubbard has long promoted a plan to encourage streamlined refinancing for underwater homeowners. Romney’s comments indicate he may be open to such a plan. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama announced new rules to encourage refinancing on Oct. 24, 2011. It’s worth noting that his administration’s programs for housing help have not fared well in the past; we rated his promise to help homeowners as Promise Broken since the program fell far short of its goals. We’ll be monitoring the new program to see if it improves on that performance. Our ruling The DNC’s ad says that Mitt Romney’s housing policy is, "Don’t try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom." That is part of his policy, but they edited out his remarks that say the housing market should then turn around and come back up as investors buy properties and rent them out. Romney also said he was open to ideas for encouraging refinancing. Romney does seem to favor letting foreclosures run their course, but he also suggests that doing so will enable investors to buy low-priced homes and revive the market.

John McCain’s death, false information spread claiming that former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio had been appointed to replace McCain in the U.S. Senate. McCain, who had brain cancer, died Aug. 25. McCain represented Arizona in the U.S. Senate from 1987 until his death at age 81. An Aug. 26 headline on the site trumpbetrayed.us claimed, "BREAKING: Sheriff Joe Arpaio will take over McCain’s seat in the Senate." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As a result of McCain’s death, Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is now tasked with appointing someone to replace McCain in the U.S. Senate. But he has not done so yet. Ducey’s office said that "out of respect for the life and legacy" of McCain and his family, the governor will not name an appointment until after McCain is laid to rest. McCain’s burial is set for Sept. 2 at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Md. Under Arizona law, Ducey is to appoint someone of the same party — a Republican — and that person will serve at least until the 2020 general election. Whoever is elected in 2020 will finish the rest of McCain’s six-year-term that expires in January 2023, after the 2022 general election. Arpaio is seeking to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate, and will be on the Republican primary ballot Aug. 28. But that’s because he’s competing in the race to replace Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring at the end of his term January 2019. The story on trumpbetrayed.us includes a line that may help tip readers off that this story is false. It says, "The good news for the GOP is that Governor Jaleel White, a Republican like Bobby Jindal, has decided to appoint a man who will vote with Donald Trump." Jaleel White is the actor who played Steve Urkel in the sitcom Family Matters. The false story ropes in Hillary Clinton, claiming she "filed in court to initiate a special election, with her facing Arpaio in a one-on-one showdown" and said there’d be an update "on this story that now involves the Clintons, meaning that inevitably — someone is going to die." The website’s banner in large letters identifies as "America’s Last Line of Defense" and in smaller letter warns it’s "information you probably shouldn’t trust." (Check out PunditFact’s report on other fake news written under this banner.) At the bottom of the page for the McCain story, the site says its content is satire. Even though the site claims its writings are satire, many Facebook users appear to believe the story was true.

pomt-01126	Exposure to the electromagnetic fields from power lines "has been associated with childhood leukemia and other diseases."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jan/02/patrick-lynch/former-ri-atty-gen-patrick-lynch-says-power-lines-/	sFormer Rhode Island Attorney General Patrick Lynch wants the power lines stretching along the waterfront from East Providence to Providence to be relocated underground, a plan that has been shelved because the projected costs have skyrocketed from $19 million in 2007 to at least $34 million now. In a Nov. 24 commentary in The Providence Journal, Lynch said there were several reasons for burying the lines and predicted that it would boost economic development and encourage tourism. But he also said burial would, "improve public health and safety by eliminating exposure of nearby residential development projects to electro-magnetic fields, which has been associated with childhood leukemia and other diseases." We were interested in whether there are any links between exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and disease, particularly childhood leukemia? We contacted Lynch's office to ask for his evidence. Meanwhile, we started looking for some ourselves. But first, a point of information. Electromagnetic fields are everywhere. Turn on a toaster and you'll be exposed to EMFs. And burying the lines will only partially shield residents from this particular source. "The fields are always there. If you send current over a wire it generates electromagnetic fields," said Tao Wei, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Rhode Island. Burying power lines might reduce the field somewhat but "there's no way to eliminate it all." Whether such fields cause disease, particularly childhood leukemia -- is more complicated. In our emails and in cell phone conversations with Lynch, he repeatedly argued that he never claimed that there was a link between EMFs and childhood leukemia (or other diseases). He only said that the two are "associated." What's the difference? Just because two things are "associated" -- occurring at the same time -- doesn't mean that one thing causes another. For example, wearing lipstick is associated with breast cancer because women wear lipstick and have much higher rates of breast cancer than men, who don’t. But lipstick doesn't cause breast cancer. Lynch didn't make that distinction between association and causation. So we believe the average reader would come away thinking that he was suggesting that EMFs cause disease. Otherwise, why raise the issue? Thus, we will judge his statement on that basis. It turns out that even the reported association between power lines and health problems is debatable, according to the reports we examined. While some studies have suggested that leukemia might lurk as a risk, other evidence argues against such a link, which is why a few groups have made statements hedging their bets, keeping the door open just in case new evidence comes along. And when it comes to the "other diseases" that Lynch refers to, the consensus is that there is no convincing evidence that EMFs pose such a danger. Some history Many people came to believe such fields are hazardous thanks to a 1979 study in Denver, which never actually measured electromagnetic fields, and a three-part series in The New Yorker by journalist Paul Brodeur that sparked a wave of fear about electric blankets, video display terminals and power lines. That prompted decades of research that has failed to prove anything conclusive. There has been reason to doubt the risk for a long time. One of the larger studies was done by the National Cancer Institute and published in 1997 in the New England Journal of Medicine. It found no evidence of a higher risk of leukemia among the children who had received the highest exposure of EMF. Researchers tend to focus on leukemia because it is a type of cancer that is particularly sensitive to radiation. Dr. Edward Campion, a Journal editor, noted that, "In recent years, several commissions and expert panels have concluded that there is no convincing evidence that high-voltage power lines are a health hazard or a cause of cancer. And the weight of the better epidemiologic studies . . . now supports the same conclusion." Ultimately, the reaction to the concerns developed into a strategy known as "prudent avoidance," where efforts are made to avoid strong electromagnetic fields just in case they might pose a health hazard. With our use of electronic devices mushrooming, one might have expected a sharp increase in health problems if the fields were dangerous. That hasn't been seen. (Meanwhile, fears have shifted to the higher-frequency electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless Internet and cell phones and, once again, despite all the studies, there's been no definitive evidence of danger.) Newer research The closest any health authority has come to saying the fields are dangerous came in 2002 when the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer characterized them as "possibly" causing cancer. But the agency said the evidence that extremely low frequency magnetic fields of the power line variety cause childhood leukemia was limited, and evidence linking the fields to any other type of cancer was inadequate. The group declined to classify EMFs as a "probable" carcinogen. In the intervening years, the link -- if there is one -- has remained tenuous. A large 2005 study uncovered a slightly higher risk of leukemia for children living near overhead power lines, but the researchers said the findings appeared to be a fluke because the risk was seen in places where the magnetic field produced by the power line was lower than background levels. One theory is that the risk is linked to a family's income and poorer people tend to live near large power lines. A Danish study published in 2014 came up with similar conclusions. It logged leukemia cases, but none within 200 meters -- about 656 feet -- from power lines. If the power lines were causing cancer, you would expect the cases to be closest to the lines. In 2013, a study of 2,779 cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed in France from 2002 to 2007 found that a child had to live within 55 yards of power lines to have a risk, but only if those lines were classified as very high voltage power lines. Beyond 55 yards posed no risk. Neither did living near other types of power lines. A study published in 2014 also failed to show a consistent link to childhood leukemia. In places where researchers think they have seen cancer, it may be due to chance. In some instances, the risk was seen in areas adjacent to power lines where EMF levels were no higher than what you would get from Earth's magnetic field. Animal studies have shown no consistent risk, which is another reason scientists are skeptical of a link. Lynch's evidence Lynch, who has been interested in the EMF issue for years, sent us several documents, some from more than a decade ago, including a National Grid brochure and a New York Times story from July in which one expert, who has long been concerned about EMFs and wants to keep WiFi out of schools because he fears it might be risky, thinks the evidence supporting a hazard has only grown stronger. And he pointed us to a September 2012 report by Michael Kundi, who heads the Institute of Environmental Health at the Medical University of Vienna, in Austria, and argues that, based on the research, power lines pose a much greater risk of leukemia than previously assumed and the evidence is so strong that it doesn't matter that animal studies have shown no problem. He is part of a group of researchers who believe cellphones, wireless laptops, WiFi transmitters, cell towers, power lines and electronic baby monitors probably pose a long list of health hazards that include various cancers, sperm damage, autism and Alzheimer's disease. They also want WiFi removed from schools. That would support Lynch's contention that "other diseases" might be involved. Broader consensus Yet what do major science and medical organizations say? The American Cancer Society lists "Exposure to electromagnetic fields (such as living near power lines)" as an "uncertain, unproven, or controversial" risk factor for childhood leukemia. Studies of electric fields have not shown any risk. The only hint of a leukemia problem has been for magnetic fields and only in children exposed to the highest fields. The National Cancer Institute's website concludes, "there is little evidence that exposure to ELF-EMF from power lines causes leukemia, brain tumors, or any other cancers in children." Among adults, the evidence continues to show no danger, or has produced inconsistent results. Cancer Research UK, a United Kingdom group similar to the Cancer Society, reports that even if a link were confirmed, "the impact would be small -- only around one percent of childhood leukemias." And WHO, which cautiously classified the fields as "possibly" carcinogenic a dozen years ago, currently says "the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults." Lynch also referred us to a very recent analysis from the nonprofit Institution of Engineering and Technology. He focused on the wording suggesting that there might be a leukemia risk above a certain exposure level. But we noted that the report concludes that despite decades of research, "the existence of harmful health effects" from such power lines "remains unsubstantiated." Lynch said that the institution's analysis was a case where you "hide the conclusion in the middle and turn back 'unswervingly' to [power] industry messaging at the end." Our ruling Lynch said exposure to the electromagnetic fields from power lines "has been associated with childhood leukemia and other diseases." Lynch, when questioned, says he's saying there is just an association, and he's not asserting that EMFs cause cancer and other diseases. We believe the average reader would come away believing that Lynch was saying there is a direct link and a real danger, which would be a striking assertion. When it comes to health effects, the grain of truth in Lynch's statement is that there have been some studies suggesting a link. But he's ignoring the fact that other studies and experts have concluded that there is little or no effect, and major health organizations have not found the evidence to be convincing despite decades of efforts to demonstrate a danger.

pomt-05275	Says "one in four women and one in seven men have been victims of domestic violence in their lifetime."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/25/suzanne-bonamici/are-one-four-women-and-one-seven-men-victims-domes/	We live in a violent, dangerous world. Most people accept that information as real, though abstract. But when Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., spoke from the House floor May 16 during debate on whether to renew the Violence Against Women Act, she drove the point home. "One in four women and one in seven men have been victims of domestic violence in their lifetime," she said. That’s not the least bit abstract. In a nation of 311 million people it’s also very large. But is it true? We asked Bonamici’s office for her documentation. Spokeswoman Leah Nelson said the statement was based on information from a Congressional Research Service analysis of the Violence Against Women Act. CRS is the nonpartisan research arm of Congress that provides detailed and rigorous analysis of issues and legislation for members of Congress. Nelson provided a copy of the May 2012 report. To find the answer you have to first understand what the term means. Research by the Justice Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and even the Department of Defense define domestic violence in a precise and similar way. It includes sexual violence, stalking, and "intimate partner violence." According to a landmark 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- whose numbers are also used by the CRS -- sexual violence includes rape and sexual coercion, which is another way of describing a person "pressured in a non-physical way." In addition to what most people consider sexual violence involving physical acts, the CDC report said, there can also be "non-contact unwanted sexual experience" such as people exposing themselves and "making a victim … look at or participate in sexual photos or movies," among other acts. CDC researchers considered a wide array of actions to fall within the definition of domestic violence. Stalking was included, as was psychological aggression and control of reproductive or sexual health. The CRS’ definition is similarly broad. With that background, it’s time to turn to Bonamici’s attention-grabbing claim - one-in-four women and one-in-seven men are victims of severe domestic abuse during their lifetime. Her comment focuses on a subset of the larger - and most damaging - behavior defined as domestic abuse. You don’t have to look long. On page 2 of the CDC report’s executive summary is this sentence: "About 1 in 4 women (24.3%) and 1 in 7 men (13.8%) have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner (e.g., hit with a fist or something hard, beaten, slammed against something) at some point in their lifetime." The numbers are repeated on page 43 of the 124-page report. Sprinkled throughout the report are detailed analyses of each segment of the claim. While the broader study includes behavior that many people would not normally associate with domestic abuse, Bonamici’s statistics refer directly to "severe physical violence," acts that include rape and assault and violent behavior that easily falls within the common understanding of domestic abuse. We rate this claim True.	None	Suzanne Bonamici	None	None	None	2012-05-25T14:28:41	2012-05-16	['None']
pomt-04966	Says President Barack Obama "doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/25/chain-email/obama-doubled-national-debt-one-year-chain-e-mail-/	No apologies, just a ridiculous attack on President Barack Obama for doubling the national debt in one year. With that opening, a chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey kicks off a series of statements about the Democratic president’s record. "SOME OF YOU MAY APPRECIATE THIS AND SOME OF YOU MAY NOT. I DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR SENDING THIS, BECAUSE ITS THE TRUTH," the chain e-mail states. "If any other of our presidents had doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year, would you have approved?" Near the end of the chain e-mail, the message adds: "Every statement and action in this email is factual and directly attributable to Barrack Hussein Obama. Every bumble is a matter of record and completely verifiable." PolitiFact New Jersey already debunked a chain e-mail claim that Obama added more to the national debt in his first term than his 43 predecessors combined -- but doubling the debt in one year? That brings this claim to a new extreme and, as federal data proves, it’s completely bogus. The national debt has increased significantly during Obama’s tenure, but it never doubled in one year. The debt hasn’t even doubled over the roughly three and a half years since the president took office. The chain e-mail includes various other statements about Obama’s time in the White House, from his use of a teleprompter to the gift he gave to the Queen of England. Check out this story from FactCheck.org about all of the claims made in the e-mail. Now, let’s explain how the national debt has increased under Obama. There are two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt. The debt held by the public refers to money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare. On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, debt held by the public was about $6.3 trillion and total debt stood at roughly $10.6 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. A year later, debt held by the public was about $7.8 trillion and total debt was about $12.3 trillion. Those figures represent over-the-year increases of about 24 percent and 16 percent in the respective categories. Both forms of debt continued to increase in the two subsequent years, but at a declining pace. Between Jan. 20, 2010 and Jan. 20, 2011, debt held by the public grew by about 20.5 percent and total debt increased by roughly 14 percent. From Jan. 20, 2011 to Jan. 20, 2012, debt held by the public went up by around 11.3 percent, while total debt increased by about 8.4 percent. When PolitiFact New Jersey received the chain e-mail on July 10, debt held by the public stood at about $11 trillion and total debt was about $15.9 trillion. Compared to Obama’s inauguration, that’s an increase of roughly 75.6 percent and 49.5 percent, respectively. So, starting with the inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Over the course of roughly three and a half years, both forms of debt have risen sharply, but still haven’t doubled. The factors behind debt increases over the last decade include legislation approved by Obama, such as the stimulus bill signed in February 2009 and tax cuts enacted in December 2010, according to a study released in April 2011 by the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative. But other contributing factors were initiated under President George W. Bush, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the analysis shows. Experts also have told us the weak economy has contributed to the higher debt. Our ruling A chain e-mail circulating in New Jersey claims Obama "doubled the national debt, which had taken more than two centuries to accumulate, in one year." There’s no doubt that the national debt has increased significantly since Obama took office, but it’s outrageous to claim it doubled in one year. Starting with his inauguration, the largest over-the-year increase in either form of national debt was about 24 percent. Even after roughly three and-a-half years into his presidency, both forms of debt still have not doubled. We’re just left with three words to describe this claim: Pants on Fire!

pomt-12400	"This year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double" under Obamacare.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/25/james-lankford/did-obamacare-premiums-double-most-states-year-no/	The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the House-passed Republican health care bill would leave 23 million more Americans without insurance by 2026. Republicans counter that the situation with the Affordable Care Act is dire. "Obamacare is collapsing. We must do something," Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said in a Facebook post May 24. "This year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double, including states that expanded Medicaid. Three states – Alaska, Alabama, and our own Oklahoma – are seeing premiums triple." A PolitiFact reader thought that sounded high, so they asked us to take a look. What we found is that Lankford inartfully described the results of a study, which by itself has significant limitations. Checking the time span Lankford uses problematic wording when he says that "this year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double." We suspect that a reasonable person would interpret those words to mean that premiums doubled from one year to the next -- an undeniably worrisome prospect, if true. But that’s not correct, according to a report released May 23 by the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services. This report appears to be the one Lankford is referring to because with one crucial exception, the numbers in his post fit with those in the report. The Health and Human Services study did find that in 25 of the 39 states studied, rates doubled (or more) over the period analyzed. But the period analyzed wasn’t the past year. In reality, the report compares premiums in 2013 -- a year before the Affordable Care Act took full effect -- to premiums in 2017. That’s a span of four years. We should also note that the HHS comparison looked at individually purchased policies, not employer-sponsored plans. Lankford did not note that distinction. Methodological concerns But there are bigger concerns than the time frame -- namely, that the 2013 figure and the 2017 figure aren’t an apples-to-apples comparison. And what’s different about the numbers tend to make the premium increases look larger, and the Affordable Care Act look worse. • The 2017 figure ignores all subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Comparing premium levels in 2013 and 2017 ignores that most policyholders in 2017 were able to obtain subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Factoring that into the HHS study would have dropped the out-of-pocket cost for 2017. The difference can be substantial. Cynthia Cox, associate director for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation, pointed to federal data showing that in Oklahoma -- Lankford’s home state -- the average plan on the marketplace cost $620 before subsidies and $79 after subsidies. In any case, the after-subsidy figure is what really matters for the consumer, not the published rate they never have to pay. • The comparison doesn't take into account that, due to the Affordable Care Act, plans in 2017 covered more than plans in 2013 did. One explanation for why premiums rose between 2013 and 2017 is that the Affordable Care Act required all plans to cover certain basic services that were not mandatory previously. But comparing it the way the Health and Human Services study does doesn’t indicate that the purchaser was getting added benefits for their added outlays. For instance, "prescription drugs were often excluded from nongroup coverage pre-2013, or offered in only a very limited way," said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "People wanting drug coverage were considered high risk. Since drugs are covered under (Affordable Care Act) plans, and since prescription drug costs are the fastest growing component of health costs in recent years, this difference in coverage makes the comparison increasingly inappropriate." • The comparison ignores the impact of the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions. It’s easier to keep down premiums if insurers are allowed to exclude the most expensive potential patients, as was the case in 2013 but not 2017. "Pre-(Affordable Care Act) premiums were low because people with pre-existing conditions were denied coverage or charged deterrent rates, and insurer rating practices also made it more difficult for sick people to renew and maintain their coverage," Cox said. And, we should add, the low premiums from 2013 wouldn’t have helped someone with pre-existing conditions at all. • The universe of plans studied changed between 2013 and 2017. To understand this particular difference, we should first explain that individual insurance is one of the major categories of insurance -- the one in which people buy policies on their own, as opposed to getting it provided through their job or from the government (as is the case with Medicaid or Medicare). Today, some people in the individual insurance market buy their insurance on the healthcare.gov marketplaces that were set up under the Affordable Care Act. Some, however, still buy their individual plans outside of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. It’s not a trivial percentage: One estimate published in the journal Health Affairs found that 40 percent of individual-market plans were sold off the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. These plans were not considered in the Health and Human Services study. In addition, the Health and Human Services study only looked at Affordable Care Act marketplaces run by the federal government, not those run by the states on their own. This matters, Cox said, because states that run their own exchanges have seen lower-than-average premium growth, in part because the customer base for their marketplaces have tended to be healthier. So, if the study had looked at state-run marketplaces, not just the federal marketplaces, the premium figure for 2017 might have been lower. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed with the critiques listed here and said that the Affordable Care Act is "not in a death spiral or collapsing." Still, she added that problems with the marketplaces should not be overlooked. "The markets are clearly still in churn. Insurance companies are still exiting and substantial premium increases being reported," she said. Lankford’s communications director, D.J. Jordan, told PolitiFact that while "the understanding of the phrase ‘this year’ is a nuanced technicality, the general message of the senator's social media post is accurate." He said the Health and Human Services study documents a significant rise in premiums. "These increases are burdensome to thousands of Oklahomans who have contacted our office, and that shouldn't be downplayed. Also, just because subsidies are available to some Americans doesn't mean that premium increases aren't problematic for many families," Jordan said. Our ruling Lankford said, "This year, a majority of states are seeing premiums and costs double" under Obamacare. A recent Health and Human Services study found that individual-market premiums in many states had doubled -- but over four years, not "this year." But the comparison itself is flawed. It doesn’t reflect several significant issues that would paint a different picture, including federal subsidies that lower the out-of-pocket cost, coverage requirements that provide better benefits for the insured, and the possibility that people with pre-existing conditions could buy a plan at all.

pomt-03454	Says New York has ‘bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp.’	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jun/19/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-new-york-has-bureaucrats-telling-y/	Before Gov. Rick Perry took off for New York in hopes of luring businesses to Texas, he previewed his pitch in a radio ad. In the spot, Perry said, "The new New York sounds a lot like the old New York: Higher taxes. Stifling regulations. Bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp." We learned of the ad, posted online June 12, 2013, by Texas’ state economic development corporation, from a June 12, 2013, Dallas Morning News news blog entry, which said it had a "slight inaccuracy," because convenience stores "always were exempt" from a New York ban on big sugary drinks struck down earlier in 2013. Are New York government officials getting between 7-Eleven customers and their self-serve plastic cups? Big Gulp, of course, is a trademark registered to Dallas-based 7-Eleven Inc. convenience stores, alongside Super Big Gulp, Slurp & Gulp, Super Slurpee, Big Brew and many others. Its size has varied from time to time; these days, 7-Eleven spokeswoman Margaret Chabris told us by email, Big Gulp denotes a 32-ounce fountain drink. For comparison, an ordinary soft drink can holds 12 ounces. Perry vetoed a measure June 14, 2013, that would have barred the sale of sugary drinks during class hours at most Texas public schools, saying current policy was adequate and the bill would limit "innocuous" beverages such as 2 percent milk. Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle told us by email that the governor’s wording was a play on "Big Gulp Ban," a nickname for the anti-obesity proposal that New York’s mayor launched in 2012 to stop some sales of large sugary drinks, similar in spirit to the city’s 2008 ban on certain fats at restaurants. A May 30, 2012, New York Times news story said Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s proposal took aim at "any cup or bottle of sweetened drink larger than 16 fluid ounces" sold in food service establishments regulated by the city’s health department, unless the beverage contained "fewer than 25 calories per 8-ounce serving." Diet sodas, fruit juice, dairy drinks and alcoholic beverages were not covered, the story said. Under the measure, the Times wrote, fast-food and other restaurants, movie theaters, street carts and sports arenas "would be required to hand out cup sizes of 16 ounces or less" -- but not grocery stores or convenience stores such as 7-Eleven. Bloomberg spokeswoman Samantha Levine and 7-Eleven’s Chabris said the same, telling us via email that 7-Eleven would not be affected because it is regulated by the state, not the city. A May 31, 2012, CBS news story described the plan as Bloomberg’s latest tactic against sugary drinks, saying he "previously supported a soda tax that was ultimately shot down by state lawmakers and, in 2010, proposed to ban people from using food stamps to buy sugary drinks, sodas and teas," an effort stopped by the USDA. Those earlier efforts could have affected convenience stores, but it appears the 16-ounce portion cap would not have. The city’s statement of purpose for the 16-ounce limit, published in the City Record on June 19, 2012, said, "To address the obesity epidemic among the city’s residents, the Department proposes that the Board of Health amend Article 81 (of the city health code). The proposed changes would establish maximum sizes for beverages offered and sold in FSEs." An FSE, or food service establishment, is defined in Section 14 of the city’s health department regulations as "a place where food is prepared and intended for individual portion service and includes the site at which the individual portions are provided, whether consumption occurs on or off the premises." The regulations specify that "retail food stores," private homes and certain other establishments are exempt. A June 6, 2012, Times news story headlined "At 7-Eleven, the Big Gulps Elude a Ban by the City," said the Big Gulp would be "an important exception" to the ban. Then again, the overall ban fell through March 11, 2013 -- blocked the day before it was to take effect by what the Times called a "surprise" ruling from a state Supreme Court judge. The city appealed the decision, according to a June 11, 2013, Times news story. Confusion over which businesses would be affected was a factor in the ruling, which said, "This court finds that the regulation herein is laden with exceptions based on economic and political concerns" and mentioned city health officials’ assertion that markets and stores "including the 7-11 market chains and their famous, or infamous, Big Gulp containers" would be exempted. The city health department backs up the Big Gulp exception in a "Fact vs. Fiction" document on its website, saying that because certain "retailers, like convenience stores and grocery stores, are not regulated by the health department, they are not covered by the rule." Bloomberg hasn’t given up on other ways to limit sugary drinks. He and other mayors wrote to Congress on June 18, 2013, with a new request to limit the use of food stamps for buying sugar-sweetened beverages. Our ruling Perry said New York has "bureaucrats telling you whether you can even drink a Big Gulp." City officials are trying to tell New Yorkers they can’t buy large sizes of sugary drinks at some establishments -- but they haven’t succeeded. Notably, the ban Perry referred to would exempt convenience stores. We rate Perry’s statement as Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2013-06-19T15:50:50	2013-06-12	['7-Eleven']
pomt-14783	"Each vegan spares more than 100 animals every year."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/dec/06/heather-moore/vegan-leaves-real-meat-claim-untouched/	The November column by the PETA Foundation’s Heather Moore was just in time to save you from holiday traditions like roasted ham or cooking your turkey with a little bacon for that extra flavor. Citing the World Health Organization’s latest pronouncements on the links between cancer and red meat, Moore’s op-ed piece encouraged "the meat-eating public" to give up all animal-based foods and embrace the vegan lifestyle. She was nearly finished with her attack on eating pigs and cows when she made this point: "each vegan spares more than 100 animals every year." So a non-vegan eats at least 100 animals a year? We searched through the PolitiFact archives and found PolitiFact Georgia had fact checked a similar claim in 2011 after the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had made Bill Clinton its "Man of the Year." On that occasion, PETA claimed a plant-based diet "spared the lives of nearly 200 animals per year." PolitiFact Georgia rated that claim Half True and now PETA, in its Nov. 17 column in The Providence Journal, referred to the same statistic by saying "more than 100." PETA’s data hasn’t changed — only the way the data is characterized. After all, "nearly 200" is indeed "more than 100." Moore, in an email, pointed us to virtually the same data and analysis that PolitiFact Georgia reviewed in 2011. But now, that information, which is available on the Internet, includes a note about the 2011 PolitiFact ruling that faulted PETA for not saying that small sea creatures such as shellfish made up an overwhelming majority of the nearly 200 "animals." The calculation cited by PETA and Moore starts with the total number of animals raised in the United States or imported for American consumption, based on statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and other sources, Then all the cows, pigs, fish, and fowl, shellfish, lobsters and other crustaceans are divided by the people in the country who eat them. The product of that calculation is the animal death toll for which PETA blames the average American meat eater. Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, told PolitiFact Georgia that, although misleading, he found the statement technically accurate. Our ruling Perhaps the most misleading thing about Moore’s column is that from the opening sentences onward she writes about pigs and cows and the health risks of meat eating. She doesn’t touch on fish or fowl (or crustaceans) in her argument. She concludes: "Researchers have found that people who eat plant-based meals are between 25 and 50 percent less likely to get cancer, and each vegan spares more than 100 animals every year. "Bacon isn't worth dying for — not for people and certainly not for pigs. With so many tasty vegan foods to enjoy, kicking the meat habit is entirely possible. And it could save your life." There is no way a reader would know that the 100 animals she refers to are mostly animals that live underwater as opposed to the barnyard animals that she and the World Health Organization warned us not to eat. This is the point PolitiFact Georgia made four years ago as noted by her source. And although Moore referred to "more than 100" rather than saying "nearly 200," she still fails to provide the context that’s necessary to understand how the number is calculated. For that reason, the Half True in 2011 becomes a Mostly False in 2015.	None	Heather Moore	None	None	None	2015-12-06T00:00:00	2015-11-17	['None']

pomt-07618	Says Oregon is "near the top or at the top of the list" when it comes to capital gains tax	true	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/21/tobias-read/tobias-read-says-oregon-has-one-highest-capital-ga/	Capital gains taxes have quickly become a hot topic at the state Capitol. Of course, there’s been a buzz surrounding them ever since the gubernatorial campaign in 2010 when now-Gov. John Kitzhaber and his Republican opponent sparred over just how much to adjust the state’s rate. Now, the jockeying has been left to lawmakers who have crafted at least three bills amending the tax to various degrees. At a recent hearing on the bills, Rep. Tobias Read, who favors something of a moderate approach, noted that having a capital gains tax that can, at the highest bracket, reach 11 percent is a barrier for some. "Having a rate that puts us near the top or at the top of the list makes it more difficult for us as a state to get to the rest of the discussion about the other great things that are in Oregon," he said. This is something we’d heard before -- that Oregon’s rate was one of, if not the, highest in the nation. But when he said it, it occurred to us, we’d never actually checked to see if that were the case. So we set off to correct that oversight. To start, we contacted Chris Allanach, a senior economist with the House Revenue Committee (the committee where Tobias made his remarks). Allanach said that to the best of his knowledge, Read was onto something -- not only is it among the highest rates, he said, but "as far as I can tell, it is (the highest)." (He did caution that this was set to change pretty soon here. When voters approved Measures 66 and 67, they voted to decrease the top income tax rate from 11 percent to 9.9 percent. That means, as of Jan. 1, 2012, the maximum capital gains tax rate will also be 9.9 percent.) Allanach cited his source as the Federation of Tax Administrators. We went to that site and looked up a comparative table of state income tax brackets. Indeed, it showed that as of Jan. 1, 2011, Oregon was tied with Hawaii for the highest rate at the upper bracket -- 11 percent. Generally speaking, a state’s capital gains tax rate is only as high as its highest income tax rate. In fact, states often keep it lower than that as an incentive of sorts, Allanach said. That seemed reasonable, but we wanted to make sure that there wasn’t a state out there that might have an unconventional tax rate. So, we dialed up Ronald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, and asked if he knew of any states that went higher with their capital gains than they do with their income tax. It turns out one does: Massachusetts. Massachusetts makes a distinction between short term (those held for less than a year) and long term corporate gains. For the former, the state charges a rate of 12 percent. Where does all that leave us? Well, Read was right -- we’re among the highest in the nation. If you don’t count Massachusetts’ system, we tie for the No. 1 spot. Even when 2012 rolls around and the rate drops to 9.9 percent, Oregon will still rank as one of the highest -- second only to Hawaii (and, in some cases, Massachusetts). We rate this claim True.

pomt-08951	GOP candidate for governor Nathan Deal "is a former Clinton Democrat."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/23/karen-handel/gop-candidate-governor-karen-handel-calls-opponent/	Republican candidate for governor Karen Handel emerged this week from the smoke of the primary election battle guns blazing. The morning after winning a spot in the Republican runoff, the former Georgia secretary of state appeared on WSB-TV and called her opponent, former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal of Gainesville, a name: "a former Clinton Democrat." Former Democrat? Yes. But was Deal a big supporter of Clinton? Handel rose in the polls as a possible front-runner only weeks before Tuesday's primary, where she captured 33 percent of the vote. Deal trailed her by 10 points. The two will face off Aug. 10 to see which Republican will go head to head in November against the Democratic nominee, former Gov. Roy Barnes. Handel went on the attack just hours after her primary win, during a live, four-minute interview Wednesday morning. She was responding to a claim by Deal that he's the only "true conservative." She laughed. "You know, I’m not going to be lectured by Nathan Deal, who is a former Clinton Democrat. I will stack up my conservative credentials against his any day of the week," Handel told the WSB-TV anchor. When Fox 5 asked her the same question, she renewed the charge. First, a little history about Democrats in Georgia. Deal served in the state Senate starting in 1981 as a conservative Democrat. Democrats dominated Southern politics at the time, and Georgia was no exception. Conservative Democrats were common. With the start of the 1990s, conservative Democrats increasingly switched to the GOP. Deal followed. Deal was a Democrat during his first congressional win in 1992, the year of Bill Clinton's first presidential victory. Deal won again as a Democrat in 1994. But in April 1995, after the GOP took control of the U.S. House and Senate during the Republican takeover, Deal switched parties and became a Republican. He has stuck with the GOP ever since. Deal resigned from the U.S. House on March 21 to focus on his gubernatorial bid. The Handel campaign gave four reasons why it thinks Deal deserves the "former Clinton Democrat" label. First is that he was elected to Congress as a Democrat when Clinton was at the top of the ticket. This is correct. Handel's camp also brought up three pieces of legislation from 1993: two on the budget and a third on gays in the military. The first had to do with a 1993 budget vote. Handel's team claims Deal's "yes" vote was for a tax increase. Deal's people said that vote was on a procedural issue, and Deal voted against Clinton’s tax hike during the vote that really mattered. The second was Clinton's economic stimulus package. He supported a Republican amendment to the bill "that would have forced Congress to offset any new spending with revenue increases or spending cuts," according to a news account. When it failed, Deal voted for the package. The third was a bill that opposed Clinton's efforts to lift the ban on gays in the military. It would have amended a U.S. Department of Defense appropriations bill to require the military to ask people entering the armed forces whether they were homosexual or bisexual. Deal voted against it. When Deal served in Congress as a Democrat, he was by no means in lock step with Clinton -- even on the president's major initiatives. Deal voted for legislation that called ending the ban on gays in the military an "unacceptable risk." Clinton settled for instituting the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which remains in place. Deal voted against Clinton's successful push for a family-leave bill guaranteeing millions of workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to deal with family emergencies. "The purpose of the bill is noble, but I don't think it's the kind of thing the federal government should force on employers," he said at the time. When Clinton proposed $10 billion in budget cuts in 1993, Deal said they were "not really enough." He was described in an October 1993 account in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as "a key member" of a bipartisan group that pushed him to cut more. Overall, Deal's voting record showed that Deal -- once he switched to the GOP -- was more of a Bush Republican than he was a Clinton Democrat while he was in Clinton's party. In 1993, Deal voted in support of Clinton-backed bills 59 percent of the time, according to an analysis of voting patterns by Congressional Quarterly. In 1994, his support stood at 64 percent. Deal's support for the president plummeted to 23 percent when he became a Republican. It hovered in the midteens during Clinton's final three years, then shot up to 93 percent when Bush took office in 2001. In 1998, Deal voted to impeach Clinton. GovTrack.us, a group that tracks Congress, rates Deal as a "rank and file Republican," based on his record of bill sponsorship. In addition, political experts we interviewed were uncomfortable with describing Deal as a "former Clinton Democrat." Charles Bullock, an expert on Southern politics with the University of Georgia, said he "probably wouldn't" use that term to describe Deal. Conservative Democrats generally came down to the right of a lot of Clinton's first-term agenda, especially on gays in the military. Although Handel's campaign listed Deal's votes accurately, its take on his record while he was a Democrat ignores critical facts. Deal broke with Clinton to side with Republicans on a variety of legislation, including bills that were important parts of the president's agenda. Furthermore, when Deal became a Republican, the bipartisanship evident during his career as a Democrat all but vanished. He voted enthusiastically against the president, including during Clinton's impeachment. Deal was no pal to Clinton. We rate Handel's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09794	Obama used to be a lawyer for ACORN.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/17/karl-rove/rove-claims-obama-used-to-be-lawyer-for-acorn/	It has not been a good week for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, better known by its acronym ACORN. By now, you probably have seen or at least heard of the hidden-camera videos shot by a man and woman who went into several ACORN offices pretending to be a pimp and prostitute. In several cities, ACORN employees offered them advice about how to skirt housing and tax laws. ACORN notes that we haven't seen all of the uncut versions of all of the videos, but suffice to say it doesn't look very good. ACORN admitted as much when chief executive Bertha Lewis referred to the conduct as "the indefensible action of a handful of our employees." ACORN has canned or suspended some of the employees, and ordered mandatory training for employees and an independent review. Meanwhile, a number of Republican lawmakers — who have long been critical of the voter registration practices of this left-leaning group — have called for a federal investigation and to cut off all federal funding to the group. While ACORN has taken a public beating, some conservatives renewed accusations of close past ties between President Barack Obama and ACORN. "Is it time for him (Obama) to weigh in on this group (ACORN), with which he does have some considerable ties, or at least he did?" Fox News' Megyn Kelly asked Republican strategist Karl Rove on Sept. 16, 2009. "Yeah, he used to be a lawyer for them," Rove replied. "Look, it is a problem for him," Rove said. "This is a key element of his campaign. They played a huge role in voter registration efforts last year." Obama has not commented on the ACORN situation this week. But the same day Kelly raised the question on Fox, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs condemned the comments made by ACORN employees on some of the videos. "Obviously the conduct that you see on those tapes is completely unacceptable," Gibbs said in a daily press briefing on Sept. 16. "I think everyone would agree with that." But what about Obama's ties to ACORN? Was Rove correct that Obama used to be a lawyer for ACORN? We first looked at this during the presidential race when the Sen. John McCain campaign made a similar claim about Obama. And here's the skinny: Obama graduated from law school in 1991, worked on the book that would become his memoir Dreams From My Father , and directed a voter registration drive in 1992. After that, Obama went to work for a civil rights law firm then named Davis, Miner, Barnhill and Galland. (It is now known only as Miner, Barnhill and Galland.) The firm's specialty is civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development work. Obama and two other attorneys represented ACORN in a 1995 federal civil lawsuit against the state of Illinois — Gov. James Edgar and other state officials were the named defendants — to demand that it enforce a new federal law known as "motor voter," which allowed people to register to vote when they got their drivers' licenses. There were five other named plaintiffs in the case, but ACORN was the lead plaintiff. Among the groups that sided with ACORN in the matter: the U.S. Department of Justice and the League of Women Voters. The courts concluded that Illinois had to enforce the law, and the case generated several federal court orders through 1995 and 1996. During the final presidential debate on Oct. 15, 2008, Republican opponent McCain said the country deserved to know "the full extent of Sen. Obama's relationship with ACORN." Said Obama: "ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names. "It had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs." But as evidence of deeper ties, some have pointed to that voter registration drive we mentioned earlier, one that Obama directed in 1992 for Project Vote, a nonprofit focused on voter rights and education. Back in 1992, Project Vote and ACORN were separate organizations with common goals: getting people to vote, especially low-income, minority and young voters. But in 1994, Project Vote went through a reorganization and the two organizations began to partner with each other on voter registration. But even in 1992, the groups were close. In a 2004 article in Social Policy , Toni Foulkes, a Chicago ACORN leader, said that under Obama's leadership, Project VOTE in 1992 delivered 50,000 newly registered Illinois voters that helped Carol Moseley Braun win a Senate seat. Of those 50,000 votes, Foulkes wrote, "ACORN delivered about 5,000 of them." "Since then," Foulkes wrote, "we have invited Obama to our leadership training sessions to run the session on power every year." The Obama campaign Web site fightthesmears.com states that ACORN never hired Obama as a trainer, organizer or any type of employee. When Obama met with ACORN leaders in November 2007, he reminded them of his affinity for ACORN and his time as a Project Vote organizer. Sen. Obama said, "I come out of a grass roots organizing background. That's what I did for three and half years before I went to law school. That's the reason I moved to Chicago was to organize. So this is something that I know personally, the work you do, the importance of it. I've been fighting alongside ACORN on issues you care about my entire career. Even before I was an elected official, when I ran the Project Vote voter registration drive in Illinois, ACORN was smack dab in the middle of it, and we appreciate your work." ACORN's political action committee endorsed Obama for president. We note that Obama said he worked "alongside" ACORN, but not for ACORN. And ACORN itself says Obama didn't work for them during that time. We provide all of this information so that you can decide how deep the president's ties are with the embattled ACORN. As for Rove's claim that Obama used to be a lawyer for ACORN, yes, Obama once took on a case for ACORN. But Obama was never a staff attorney for ACORN. He did not do ongoing work for the organization. He handled o ne case along with two other attorneys. ACORN was one of several plaintiffs. And the U.S. Department of Justice sided with ACORN in the case. We think Rove's comment suggests a deeper legal relationship between Obama and ACORN than actually existed. And so we rule Rove's statement Half True.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2009-09-17T10:07:45	2009-09-16	['None']

pomt-11546	"Rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/feb/12/jeanne-ives/campaign-ad-falsely-claims-rauner-made-taxpayers-f/	Until recently, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton was little known beyond the capitol dome. But last fall, she catapulted herself into the spotlight by launching an insurgent primary challenge against incumbent Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner over what she characterized as his failure to stand up for conservative values. Chief among Rauner’s offenses, Ives has said, was his decision to sign legislation that repealed restrictions limiting state employee and Medicaid health plans’ coverage of abortions. Soon after announcing her campaign, she called the issue "the straw that broke the camel’s back." So it was no surprise on Wednesday that Ives’ campaign released a radio ad again highlighting the measure alongside other pieces of legislation related to hot-button social issues. "Rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy," Ives says in the ad. "I voted against it — and so did every other Republican legislator." The radio spot followed a recent TV commercial in which a series of actors mockingly thank Rauner for signing legislation advancing issues that rankle many social conservatives, from immigration to transgender rights. The television ad highlighted the abortion measure, too, with an actress in a pink pussyhat staring into the camera and thanking Rauner for "making all Illinois families pay for my abortions." The TV spot drew widespread condemnation from Republicans and Democrats alike, who decried it as bigoted and called for Ives to take it down. But the censure wasn’t universal, with conservative donor and Illinois businessman Richard Uihlein ponying up $2 million more for her campaign two days later. Uihlein gave more than $2.6 million to Rauner’s campaign in 2014. Ives has publicly stated her ads were aired to raise the profile of her campaign, even kicking off the new radio spot by saying, "now that I have your attention." Attention grab or not, however, her radio ad makes an incendiary claim about the issue that in many ways forms the cornerstone of her campaign. Illinois law prohibits abortions in the later months of a pregnancy except in very rare cases. So we wondered, how can it be possible that Rauner expanded taxpayer-funded abortion access in all nine months of pregnancy by signing the bill? On the books A woman in Illinois can opt to legally terminate a pregnancy up until the point that her fetus would likely be able to survive outside the womb, according to state statute. Viability is determined by a woman’s physician and can vary from pregnancy to pregnancy, but usually occurs around 24 weeks of gestation, far off from the full nine months Ives cites. Federal law allows states to restrict abortions after viability, but states may not prohibit the procedure even then if a doctor determines a woman’s life or health is at risk. The law Rauner signed expands abortion access by providing coverage to any Medicaid recipient and state worker who opts for the procedure before viability. But a review of state statute shows it does nothing to supercede existing law concerning what constitutes a legal abortion. Democratic state Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, of Chicago, who sponsored the bill, confirmed in an emailed statement that it did not "in any way alter the Illinois Abortion Law or any other legal limits to the practice of abortion in Illinois." So we reached out to Ives’ campaign for an explanation of the candidate’s claim. Spokeswoman Kathleen Murphy acknowledged abortions were already legal after viability when a mother’s life or health is in danger. She also agreed that endangerment of the mother’s life at any point, along with cases of rape or incest in the earlier months of a pregnancy, were already covered by state and Medicaid plans. But she claimed that cases where a doctor had determined a mother’s health was at risk didn’t qualify for state coverage prior to the new law. "The law already allows for abortion up to nine months with a doctor's note," she said. "Now taxpayers will be funding that." In fact, Illinois has been required to cover under Medicaid and state plans abortions necessary to protect a mother’s health since 1994 when a Cook County judge struck down a previous law limiting public funding to instances where her life was at risk. That case, along with one from the year prior that expanded state coverage to include rape and incest prior to viability, was brought by the ACLU of Illinois to extend coverage beyond life endangerment. "You can’t pay for all other medical care necessary to preserve someone’s health but then leave abortion out," said Lorie Chaiten, director of ACLU Illinois’ Women’s and Reproductive Rights Project, in explaining that verdict. By the numbers Ives’ statement belies another key fact: abortions occurring late in pregnancy are extremely rare. Nationally, only 1.3 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. And figures from the Illinois Department of Public Health show that rate is even lower here. In 2016, half of one percent of all abortions, state-covered or otherwise, took place at or after that point. "It just doesn’t happen that abortions take place that late in pregnancy unless there is some kind of extreme emergency," said Elizabeth Nash, a Guttmacher policy analyst. But extreme emergencies are not what Ives’ radio ad suggests. Nor are they what her campaign described when her spokeswoman elaborated in an email. "What Rauner did is extend Medicaid coverage — taxpayer-funding — for all 9-months, abortion-on-demand," Murphy wrote. With such statements, the Ives campaign leaves the impression that the update to Illinois law now has women scurrying to the doctor near the end of a pregnancy for elective abortions on the taxpayer’s dime. Our ruling Ives said, "Rauner made you pay for abortions in all nine months of pregnancy." Ives would have been on solid ground had she confined herself to criticizing Rauner for expanding Medicaid and state employee health plans to include coverage for elective abortions in the earlier months of pregnancy, just as many private insurance plans do. Instead, she took it further, suggesting his action opened up a new requirement for the state to pay for all abortions occurring in pregnancies closer to term as well. The state has been required for more than two decades to pay for an abortion whenever a doctor determines that a woman on Medicaid or state insurance needs the procedure to save her life or preserve her health, along with cases involving rape or incest. The new law Rauner signed did nothing to alter the legality of abortions in Illinois. Nor was it responsible for extending state coverage to include the few abortions permitted after the point when a fetus is considered able to survive outside the womb. Such instances were already included, rendering Ives’ claim that it was Rauner who cleared the way for the state to cover abortions in every single month of pregnancy inaccurate. We rate her statement False. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check incorrectly stated that federal law requires states to permit abortions after viability in cases of rape or incest and that Illinois provided coverage for these later procedures. Illinois law only permits post-viability abortions in cases where a doctor determines a mother’s life or health is at risk. As stated in this fact-check, the bill Rauner signed did not alter state law concerning the legality of abortions in any way, nor did it expand coverage for late abortions.

pomt-15093	Says he will pursue change in federal law to protect employees from "extortion from a union" because "the Supreme Court has ruled that federal prohibitions outlawing extortion usually do not apply to unions."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/17/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-high-court-has-said-federal-laws/	With his standing in presidential preference polls down, Gov. Scott Walker went to Las Vegas on Sept. 14, 2015 to unveil a sweeping labor reform plan. The Wisconsin Republican proposed eliminating the National Labor Relations Board, creating a national right-to-work law and preventing federal workers from collectively bargaining. His plan also calls for changing federal law, saying it does not protect employees from "threats, violence and extortion from a union." "As it stands," Walker claims in the plan, "the Supreme Court has ruled that federal prohibitions outlawing extortion usually do not apply to unions. I will ensure that employee rights are protected." So -- in the context of workers being extorted by a union -- has the nation’s highest court ruled that federal prohibitions against extortion usually don’t apply? It’s a relatively technical claim, given that extortion or other acts of violence against a person can be prosecuted under state law, whether they involve a union or not. Supreme Court case To back Walker’s claim, his campaign cited a controversial U.S. Supreme Court opinion in the 1973 case of United States v. Enmons et al. Here are the facts of the case, according to the opinion: Employees of the Gulf States Utilities Co. in Louisiana were on strike. Three officials of labor unions, including Travis Paul Enmons, were charged with committing acts of violence in an effort to get the company to agree to a contract with higher wages and other benefits. The charges included allegations of firing high-powered rifles at three company transformers and blowing up a transformer substation owned by the company. So, in this case, union leaders were accused of committing extortion against an employer, not against workers. That’s important, given that Walker’s claim involves protecting employees from extortion by unions. The criminal charges against the union officials were thrown out. A federal district court ruled that if the pay raises "sought by violent acts are wages to be paid for unneeded or unwanted services, or for no services at all," then the violence would constitute extortion under the Hobbs Act, a federal law that prohibits extortion that obstructs commerce. In other words, acts of extortion to gain, for example, personal favors wouldn’t be protected by the federal law. But the court determined that because the use of force was to obtain legitimate union objectives -- a better contract -- it did not violate the Hobbs Act, even though it could be prosecuted as a crime in state court. In a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision to dismiss the charges. So, Walker is citing a Supreme Court case that says extortion by a union, if done in order to obtain a legitimate labor objective, does not violate a particular federal law. But that case had to do with an employer being extorted by a union, and Walker’s claim is about changing federal law to protect workers from what he terms as union extortion. Moreover, Walker’s claim leaves the impression that employees have no federal protections if they are extorted by their union. Analysis Walker’s campaign also cited to us a more recent case, a 2014 criminal trial in Buffalo in which the Enmons ruling played a role. But that case also involved union extortion against an employer, as seven former labor leaders were charged with using death threats, assaults and vandalism to force construction companies into hiring union workers. Trevor Burrus, a research fellow at the Center for Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., told us the end result of the Supreme Court ruling in the Enmons case "is that if a union or union member performs acts of violence and vandalism to achieve legitimate collective-bargaining objectives, such as higher wages, then it is not a violation of the Hobbs Act." He said he believes the ruling would apply to acts of union extortion against workers, but that he could not find appellate opinions that have ruled that way. Law professor Marion Crain of the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis took a different view, telling us the Enmons case "has nothing to do with union abuse of power vis a vis workers. The case simply doesn’t stand for that proposition." Crain also pointed out that the federal Landrum-Griffin Act, adopted in 1959, has provisions to protect employees from unfair practices by unions. Several experts experts, including Burrus and Cornell University law professor Angela Cornell also noted the protections. Federal law "prohibits unions from coercing or restraining employees in the exercise of their right to engage in, or refrain from, union and concerted activity. This would include violence or extortion," said University of Richmond law professor Ann Hodges. In other words, despite the high court’s ruling in the case Walker cites, there are other federal protections for workers. Our rating Walker said he will pursue change in federal law to protect employees from "extortion from a union" because "the Supreme Court has ruled that federal prohibitions outlawing extortion usually do not apply to unions." The high court did rule that union extortion in pursuit of legitimate labor ends, such as a better contract, does not violate a particular federal law that prohibits extortion that obstructs commerce. But that case did not involve union extortion against workers. Moreover, state as well as other federal laws protect workers against abuses by a union. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-11898	"Opioid crisis (is) the worst in ObamaCare expansion states!"	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/oct/23/matt-gaetz/no-evidence-prove-medicaid-expansion-fueling-opioi/	As Florida’s lawmakers grapple with the opioid crisis, one U.S. representative says there’s a correlation between states that expanded Medicaid through Obamacare and states affected the worst by the epidemic. Republican U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz shared this factoid on Twitter on Oct. 17: "Opioid crisis the worst in ObamaCare expansion states!" Gaetz’s claim quoted a Tucker Carlson tweet that questioned if "big pharma" is responsible for Congress’ inaction toward the opioid crisis. Information supplied by Gaetz’s office rests on the notion that patients in states that expanded Medicaid through Obamacare have more access to legal prescriptions that fuel the opioid epidemic. Experts said the theory ignores critical facts and does not take into account the other factors that have led to an increase in opioid deaths. "It is important to avoid confusing association with causation," said David A. Fiellin, a professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. "Just because one event (Medicaid expansion) occurred during a period of increasing opioid deaths, many from illicit sources doesn't mean that it caused the increase in deaths." Researchers have poked holes in this argument before Thirty-two states plus D.C. currently have adopted Medicaid benefits to all adults. The expansion for most states went into effect in January 2014. The timeframe matters because the most recent data is from 2015, meaning there’s not a lot of data to work with. In 2015, the five states with the highest rates of death due to drug overdose were West Virginia, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio and Rhode Island, according to the Centers for Disease Control. All of those states expanded Medicaid. But there’s little evidence Medicaid expansion is the reason why. Many researchers, for instance, have noted that the overdose death rates were higher to begin with in those states. Richard Frank, a professor of Health Economics in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School sent PolitiFact Florida a research memo he co-wrote on the issue. Data he compiled from the CDC showed that the states that expanded Medicaid were experiencing higher levels of deaths due to opioids than non-expansion since 2010. (Chart courtesy of Richard Frank) "The opioid epidemic had already hit those states hardest before the ACA even passed and well before the expansions were implemented," the memo said. Vanderbilt University economist Andrew Goodman-Bacon and Harvard’s Emma Sandoe posit that other factors, including the opioid epidemic itself, led states to adopt the ACA Medicaid expansion in their look on the issue. "A state with rapidly rising opioid deaths may have decided to expand Medicaid in order to provide drug treatment to more residents," the pair wrote. Frank and his colleague also found another problem with the Medicaid theory. The memo said since 2013, nearly all the increases in opioid overdoses in the United States is due to heroin and synthetic heroin substitutes. In other words, it treats all drug overdoses the same. The data Gaetz cited from the CDC includes prescription and illicit drugs. Medicaid coverage does not provide access to illicit drugs. Data from the CDC shows that since about 2010 the number of deaths from commonly prescribed opiates has not fluctuated one way or another. In contrast, opioid deaths from heroin and other opioids, such as Fentanyl, have increased dramatically in that same time period. "A significant portion of the increase in deaths was due to deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, which includes Fentanyl," the CDC says. Gaetz’s team also cited CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that said: "opioid prescribing rates among Medicaid enrollees are at least twofold higher than rates for persons with private insurance." But the data they cited was last updated in 2009, so Gaetz’s evidence was before the Affordable Care Act was even passed. This argument is common among individuals who believe Medicaid makes drug abuse worse, but it’s not accurate, according to the Goodman-Bacon and Sandone analysis. "Medicaid patients, especially those who qualify through a disability and many who do not, are more likely to have chronic conditions and comorbidities that require pain relief," the duo wrote. Lastly, it’s worth noting that Medicaid expansion helps pay for opioid addiction treatment, said Brendan Saloner of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Medicaid expansion covers costs treatments like detoxification, outpatient treatment, and treatment for masked health conditions. Our ruling Gaetz said the "opioid crisis (is) the worst in ObamaCare expansion states." Gaetz is isolating on one year’s worth of data that, by itself, is flawed. The CDC data at the heart of this claim includes drug overdoses from illicit drugs that are not prescription opioids. And by ignoring a larger window, Gaetz misses the fact that the Medicaid expansion states he’s talking about had an opioid problem before the health care legislation took effect. Experts were universal in saying that the evidence that Medicaid expansion is somehow fueling the opioid crisis doesn’t exist. In some ways, it’s not much different than saying that the opioid crisis is worst in states in the eastern time zone. You wouldn’t blame a clock. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05736	"In 2011, there were more than 28,000 new Tennessee jobs created and over $4 billion in capital investment. Our Jobs4TN plan is working."	half-true	/tennessee/statements/2012/mar/04/bill-haslam/gov-haslam-links-his-jobs-plan-states-improved-eco/	Gov. Bill Haslam delivered his second State of the State address last month and he was clearly pleased. After campaigning for governor in 2009-10 on the need for new jobs, he was able to report after one year in office that job creation is on the rise: "In 2011, there were more than 28,000 new Tennessee jobs created and over $4 billion in capital investment. Our Jobs4TN plan is working." Jobs4TN is the governor’s economic development plan, unveiled in outline form last April. And 28,000 is a lot of new jobs in a state that had a higher unemployment rate than the national average all of last year. So we checked it out. For factual claims like this one, PolitiFact treats the claim in two parts: 1) Are the numbers right? 2) Is the job gain caused by the official or their policies? If Haslam had stopped at his first point – 28,000 new jobs – he’d be on fairly firm ground. In fact, he could have cited a more impressive statistic: the number of employed Tennesseans jumped by 57,550 from January 2011 through December 2011, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. While those numbers don’t distinguish between a brand "new" job and jobs that were lost to the recession but are now returning, the important thing is that the number of people with jobs in Tennessee is up, from 2,782,167 in January 2011 to 2,839,717 in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Though the governor didn’t say "I created" or even "we created" those jobs, the mere mention of them in a political speech implies some level of credit taking. And the next sentence he uttered took it even further: "Our Jobs4TN plan is working." On the jobs claim, Haslam spokesman David Smith referred us to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development’s (ECD) 2011 annual report that samples nine of the larger job announcements during the year, such as Quaprotek’s Aug. 17 announcement that it would create 126 jobs over five years in Ripley, Tenn. ECD generated a more complete document that details most of 28,535 jobs that it says shows "an aggregation of jobs created as a direct result of ECD recruitment and expansion projects," job creation supported and reported by regional economic development agencies, and jobs created by selected industries reported to ECD in a year-end survey. But the ECD-generated number includes jobs announced in 2011 that actually will not be filled by newly hired employees until sometimes years late. For example, the list includes the 2,350 jobs at General Motors’ Spring Hill, Tenn., plant even though GM’s own Nov. 21, 2011, press release announcing the plant’s re-opening has a smaller number. The GM press release says it will add "594 hourly jobs and 91 salaried positions," in the second half of 2012, and that "timing was not announced (for) an additional 1,090 hourly and 106 salaried positions" to be added sometime later. ECD also says only 18,175 of the 28,535 are jobs created as a direct result of ECD recruitment and expansion projects. The rest include "job creation supported and reported" by regional economic development agencies and jobs reported to ECD through a year-end survey of select industries. So, the "28,000 new jobs" figure the governor cited from ECD is questionable, but it’s mitigated – in our view – by the numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that 57,550 more Tennesseans were working at the end of the year than at the start. Now for the "Our Jobs4TN plan is working" component. We find it's a stretch to credit the job gains to it because the plan is just taking effect. Jobs4TN is the "economic development strategy" for Haslam’s administration to help private businesses create new jobs that the governor and his ECD Commissioner Bill Hagerty unveiled with great fanfare on April 20, 2011. But most of Jobs4TN was not put into place at all until late 2011. The nine "regional strategic plans" outlining how ECD’s field staff "will lead new economic development efforts in their regions" were announced Dec. 16, for instance. Athough the governor and Hagerty announced on May 5 the creation of "INCITE," a $50 million "innovation support" fund as a component of Jobs4TN, the guidelines for the fund were not issued until Dec. 28 and the supporting documents and applications were not released until about three weeks ago. And although ECD announced a competitive grant program to create nine regional "business accelerators" across Tennessee, the grant recipients were not announced until Nov. 3 and there is no word on when they’ll be operating. Finally, the governor and Hagerty released a "Regulatory Reform Report" on Jan. 6 of this year. Another key element of the governor’s jobs strategy, although not technically part of Jobs4TN, is the new law limiting civil liability lawsuits -- the "Civil Justice Reform Act of 2011" that he pushed through the legislature last year to create a more business-friendly environment. It did not go into effect until Oct. 1. Smith, Haslam’s press secretary, said the governor was not trying to claim credit for the jobs. "When there’s an economic development project, it’s a team effort by the state, the company and local communities that take months to come about. We thought the State of the State address was an opportunity to announce the jobs number that ECD was releasing that same day. There was a full stop between it and the governor’s statement that Jobs4TN is working. There are multiple entities that play a role in Jobs4TN and we think it is working and was working." But we think anyone who heard or read the governor's speech would indeed come to the conclusion that by saying "Our Jobs4TN plan is working," he was taking credit for the job gains. We asked two university economists to assess the governor’s statement and specifically whether he deserves credit for 28,000 new jobs created last year. Dr. David H. Ciscel, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Memphis, said labor data he tracked through 2011 shows 31,200 more jobs in Tennessee at the end of the year than at the beginning. His email response: "So both establishment and survey data show a positive story for Tennessee. Can Governor Haslam claim credit? That is a tough question. He is, of course, just puffing. He has little or no power to increase the number of jobs with or without his Job4Tn program. But we usually allow politicians to accept the blame or the honor for what happens when they are in office." Dr. Malcolm Getz, associate professor of economics at Vanderbilt University, was even more blunt. He gave a brief point-by-point analysis of Jobs4TN and concluded: "None of the initiatives in the governor's Jobs4TN program have yet had time to influence the growth of employment over what it would have been in the absence of the change in policies. Employment is growing nationally and in Tennessee as we regroup after the massive fraud in the financial system. The governor's program may prove beneficial in time but it does not address the causes of the recession -- that's primarily a matter of Federal policy -- and it shouldn't seek credit for the rebound." Our ruling The governor said the state has added 28,000 news jobs thanks to his jobs plan. We find he's right about the gains -- he actually understated the number -- but that it's a big stretch to even imply Jobs4TN should get credit for the increase. Much of that plan took effect late in the year and economists told us the job growth is largely a function of the slow but steady nationwide economic recovery. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Bill Haslam	None	None	None	2012-03-04T06:33:46	2012-01-30	['Tennessee']

pomt-13093	Says that at a campaign rally President Barack Obama "spent so much time screaming at a protester, and frankly it was a disgrace."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/06/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-obama-screamed-prot/	Donald Trump attacked President Barack Obama for yelling at a pro-Trump protester during the president’s rally for Hillary Clinton on Friday in Fayetteville, N.C. "You have to go back and look and study and see what happened," Trump said at a rally in Hershey, Pa., later that evening. "They never moved the camera and (Obama) spent so much time screaming at a protester, and frankly it was a disgrace." We decided to take Trump’s advice and "look and study" what happened. It turns out Trump’s depiction of the situation is flat-out wrong. Obama actually defended the protester's freedom of speech. What actually happened While Obama was campaigning for Clinton, rally-goers began to shout and boo at a Trump supporter in the crowd. Obama tried to calm the situation, repeatedly yelling at the crowd to "hold up," "listen," and "sit down and be quiet for a second." When the noise settled a bit, Obama defended the protester's right to speak out. "You’ve got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate, " Obama said. "He’s not doing nothing. You don’t have to worry about him." Then, Obama explained to the Clinton supporters why they should respect this man. "This is what I mean about folks not being focused," Obama said. "First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech. Second of all, it looks like maybe he might have served in our military and we ought to respect that. Third of all, he was elderly and we got to respect our elders. And fourth of all, don't boo. Vote. Don’t boo. Vote." Obama doesn’t yell at the protester. In fact, most of his defense is directed at the Clinton supporters. Our friends at Deadspin did a great job showing Obama’s comments opposite of Trump's. "I want you to pay attention because if we lose focus we could have problems," Obama continued. "It’s part of what’s happened here during this election season. We just get stirred up for all kinds of reasons that are unnecessary." We reached out to the Trump campaign but did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said that at a campaign rally President Barack Obama "spent so much time screaming at a protester, and frankly it was a disgrace." Trump got this all wrong. Obama defended the protester's right to speak out, and didn’t scream at him. In fact, Obama’s remarks were directed at Clinton supporters, not the protester.

pomt-01619	Al Sharpton went to Ferguson, Mo., and is "declaring as a matter of fact that ... Michael Brown didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/28/megyn-kelly/megyn-kelly-al-sharpton-declared-michael-brown-did/	Fox News has a major bone to pick with its left-leaning rival, MSNBC, and that bone is Al Sharpton. Bill O’Reilly, Howard Kurtz and Megyn Kelly are just some of the Fox hosts calling out Sharpton for, they say, crossing ethical lines and tarnishing MSNBC’s coverage of Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson, Mo. At issue: Sharpton’s dual roles as host of MSNBC’s Politics Nation and advocate for Brown’s family in events that followed his fatal shooting by police officer Darren Wilson, including giving the eulogy at Brown’s Aug. 25 funeral. Even worse to the Fox News gang is how much President Barack Obama’s administration is leaning on Sharpton as "a de facto contact and conduit" on race issues, according to a Politico Magazine profile. Appearing on The O’Reilly Factor on the same night as Brown’s funeral, Kelly criticized Sharpton for getting ahead of the facts in his fiery speeches to emotional crowds. It was the same segment in which she and O’Reilly debated the concept of "white privilege," with Kelly presenting several economic, social and educational statistics to show how blacks are disadvantaged in this country. "What they don't need in this case, or in any case, is people like Al Sharpton going in there and declaring as a matter of fact that the, that Michael Brown didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer," Kelly said. O’Reilly said, "Absolutely, that just alienates everybody." "If you have somebody come in and prejudge -- someone you trust and rely upon -- come and tell you the facts are one way, you believe him," Kelly said of Sharpton. "That's why he is abusing his power." We wanted to know if Sharpton flat-out said Brown "didn’t use any deadly force" before he was killed. What happened The official story of what happened before Brown was shot at least six times is not entirely known -- a factor driving the unrest against law enforcement. A grand jury is weighing evidence in the case and will decide whether to indict Wilson, and the St. Louis County Police Department and FBI are investigating the shooting. CNN and Vox have compiled guides to varying accounts from witnesses and law enforcement about what happened. Before noon, there was an alleged strong-arm robbery involving Brown and friend Dorian Johnson at a convenience store. Shortly after, Wilson stopped the men for walking in the middle of a street, without knowing they were suspects in the robbery, Ferguson’s police chief has said. Some witnesses and Brown’s advocates say Brown had been shot and was turning around to face Wilson with his hands raised when Wilson fired at him again, hitting his head. Wilson told police that Brown assaulted him, pushed him inside of his patrol car, and tried to grab his handgun, and the town’s police chief said Wilson sought medical care for his swollen face after the altercation. We won’t go into more detail in this fact-check about the various accounts, but we thought it was important to highlight how the narratives conflict. We may never know what really happened, said David Klinger, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of Missouri-St Louis. "For anybody who hasn’t seen the investigative case file to say that he categorically is confident that it was not possible that Mr. Brown posed a threat to Officer Wilson’s life, he is simply wrong," Klinger said. What Sharpton said About a week before Brown’s funeral, Sharpton addressed Ferguson residents at a unity rally. Sharpton says he was invited to town by Brown’s grandfather. Sharpton decried the release of security footage from the convenience store as a post-mortem smear of Brown’s character that did nothing to illuminate what happened before he died. "But the issue is not whether he shoplifted. The issue is not what he did before," Sharpton said Aug. 17. "The issue is how a young man with no deadly threat, no life-extenuating circumstances, was shot multiple times. That’s the issue, and that’s the issue America has got to deal with." Kelly highlighted this part of his speech in her Aug. 19 edition of The Kelly File and alluded to it on O’Reilly’s show Aug. 25. Sharpton’s defense: I’m not ‘Walter Cronkite’ Sharpton defended himself in an interview with PunditFact. He does not deny that he said essentially what Kelly described. But he said his audience knows his point of view and that he was giving his opinion that Brown posed "no deadly threat" because he was unarmed. No one disputes that Brown did not have a gun. "People don’t think that I’m Walter Cronkite reporting the news," he said. "That’s my opinion, just like they’re giving their opinion on white privilege." He shifted his rhetoric a bit when asked about Kelly’s specific qualm, saying he believes there is no "apparent" evidence that Brown posed a deadly threat. Sharpton also said, if anything, O’Reilly and other Fox News hosts are just as guilty of expressing their viewpoints. "If (O’Reilly) can write books and all of them over there can write books on their opinions, how can you tell me don’t go to a rally on my opinion?" Sharpton said. "We’re all advocates. I use my feet to advocate, they use the pen to advocate." Kelly could not be reached through a Fox spokeswoman or Twitter. Our ruling In criticizing Sharpton, Kelly said, Sharpton went to Ferguson, Mo., and is "declaring as a matter of fact that ... Michael Brown didn't use any deadly force or posed no deadly threat to the officer." That’s not exactly what Sharpton said, but it’s pretty close. The only possible caveat is Sharpton says he was speaking as a matter of opinion based on what he had so far, more than a matter of fact. That’s in the eye of the beholder. Kelly’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.	None	Megyn Kelly	None	None	None	2014-08-28T17:29:59	2014-08-25	['Missouri', 'Al_Sharpton', 'Michael_D._Brown']
pomt-07507	Austin’s Pease Elementary "is a school that was created as part of the Texas Constitution."	false	/texas/statements/2011/apr/10/meria-carstarphen/austins-school-superintendent-says-pease-elementar/	Speaking about a proposed Austin school facilities master plan, the district’s superintendent told Austin’s KUT-FM April 1 that she doesn’t expect school closures until 2012-13, if then, and only after consideration of community concerns. Meria Carstarphen also all but ruled out a task force’s erstwhile suggestion that Pease Elementary in downtown Austin be closed to help ensure that facilities districtwide are sufficiently filled with students. In its final recommendations, the task force did not specify which schools might best be shuttered. Carstarphen told KUT reporter Nathan Bernier that Pease "is a school that was created as part of the Texas Constitution." According to audio of the 30-minute interview posted online, Carstarphen also recapped her reaction to the possibility of Pease being closed: "I’m one of the people who was like, really, Pease? It’s in the constitution. How do we do that?" "I can’t understand how that option got on the table," she said. Pease Elementary, on Rio Grande Street near West 12th Street, dates to the 19th century. Its website says it was founded in 1876 and later named after Elisha M. Pease, who last served as governor until late September 1869. Pease is the district’s only all-transfer school, accoding to the website, meaning students may attend regardless of where they live in the district. Does the school really owe its existence to the state constitution? We searched for references in the constitution and spotted no mention of any single grade school in the document’s education article, which states it’s the Legislature’s duty to "establish and make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public free schools." Another provision permits lawmakers to create school districts but doesn’t single out particular schools. We also found no Pease clauses in earlier versions of the constitution. Next, we asked for back-up information from the district and called the Pease school, which put us in touch with Brenda Gunn, who has children attending the school. Gunn said in an e-mail that she brought a facsimile of the Texas Declaration of Independence to a March meeting involving Carstarphen and Pease parents, and she pointed out to Carstarphen that "education is listed as one of the grievances against the Mexican government. "I remarked to her that 175 years ago education was worth a revolution … that in 1838, (the) president of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B. Lamar, gave his first speech as president and education featured prominently in the speech. Several months later, after Austin was selected as the new capital... Lamar ordered that the new capital be surveyed and prepared for the government's arrival. In this 1839 survey of Austin, two city blocks were set aside for education. Pease is on one of those city blocks." Carstarphen, Gunn’s e-mail says, "was very energized by this information, and though she switched her documents in her recent interview, her comment about Pease being in the constitution really gets to this central point: Pease is a direct manifestation of what the Texas founders wanted for Texas schoolchildren." Gunn also passed along a Feb 23 letter from Light Cummins, an Austin College professor who’s also the Texas state historian. "It would be impossible to find a more historic school than Pease, which traces its origins back to the year 1839," Cummins writes, describing the 1839 survey designating the plot "as the site for a public school for the children of the new town." The Austin Graded School opened in 1876, the letter says. "Pease Elementary School thus traces its beginnings back to the very establishment of public education in Texas," the letter continues. "It has survived almost a century and a half as a touchstone of public education in Texas." Andy Welch, the district’s spokesman, said in an April 5 interview that Carstarphen’s comments to KUT stemmed from her meeting with the Pease parents and their reminder of the school’s roots. Welch pointed out too that a 1971 law dedicates the land where the school sits to the Austin district "so long as said property is used" by the district for educational purposes. If not, the law states, the property reverts to the state. "Of course, (Pease) is not in the constitution," Welch said. Texans "put important things like hide inspectors in the constitution," a reference to the document’s sprawl of arcane detail. He agreed that the implication of Carstarphen’s claim -- that the district can’t close Pease without a change to the constitution -- is not correct. The district followed up that day with statements on Pease’s history, also attaching a timeline stating the original school on the site burned down and was rebuilt in 1896; it was named after Pease in 1902. Also, Carstarphen placed her own statement online, in a post headlined: "Pease Elementary's Origins Tied to the Origins of the State of Texas." "The Pease community and I are in agreement that, while Pease is not literally and specifically mentioned in the 1876 Constitution, its origins are tied directly" to the state’s origins, her post says. She says the larger point is preservation of the "historic jewel." The 1876 Constitution, Carstarphen’s post says, was "very clear about the use of public lands to establish a system of free public schools. The original Pease school, several blocks from the Capitol, embodied the intention of those constitutional framers." Our analysis: The superintendent clearly hopes to preserve an historically unique school. Still, her statement to KUT was False.

pomt-02984	"Property taxes have increased 20 percent under four years of Chris Christie."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/oct/20/milly-silva/milly-silva-claims-property-taxes-have-climbed-20-/	Chris Christie can cite numerous accomplishments during his time as New Jersey’s governor, but it’s one achievement in particular that has caught Milly Silva’s attention. Silva, the lieutenant governor candidate on the Democratic slate challenging Christie in the Nov. 5 election, cited the Republican governor’s ‘achievement’ on Oct. 7 while speaking at an American Legion in Little Ferry. "Property taxes have increased 20 percent under four years of Chris Christie," Silva said. That’s some hike, and while Silva is correct that property taxes have gone up under Christie, it’s not quite as much as she claims. To begin, let’s review how action in Trenton can impact property tax bills. Although a governor is not directly responsible for increasing a community’s property taxes, what he does to a state budget can impact what property owners pay. In Christie’s case, he has cut aid in numerous areas to help balance the state budget. As the governor has noted on numerous occasions, he came into office in 2010 and had to deal quickly with a multibillion-dollar deficit. The gap was the result of factors from steep drops in state revenue during the recession (December 2007 to June 2009) to spending by previous administrations, experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey. To deal with the deficit, Christie cut education funding and numerous other line items in the budget, skipped a pension contribution and overhauled tax relief programs -- such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. Some New Jersey lawmakers -- including Assemblyman John McKeon, an Essex County Democrat -- have said the reduction in rebates led to a 20 percent increase in property taxes. Officials with the state Department of Community Affairs have rejected the idea that property taxes have climbed 20 percent. In the case of the EITC, for example, taxpayers now get a credit directly on their tax bill instead of the old practice, when the state sent rebate checks to taxpayers. Still, the original purpose of that check was for tax relief. Earlier this year the online news site NJ Spotlight released a study showing that the net property tax increase during Christie’s first three years in office was approximately 18.5 percent. The net increase is the actual cost of property taxes for the average New Jerseyan after rebates are deducted. Citing data from the state Department of Community Affairs, NJ Spotlight noted that net property taxes in New Jersey rose from $6,244 in 2009 to $7,405 in 2012. Other organizations have cited similar figures. But a DCA spokeswoman told us that property taxes have not climbed 20 percent under Christie. She also pointed to the results of a cap the governor implemented in July 2010 that limits property tax growth to 2 percent annually, unless local voters approve exceeding the cap. "Actually, average increases were less in the last three years than in the thirty years prior averaging approximately 2% each year and nothing close to 20%," spokeswoman Tammori Petty said in an e-mail. "Some communities even saw tax decreases depending on local leadership. These record low increases are far less than 20% real increase that did exist in previous administrations." An Associated Press report last month reviewed DCA figures, tax levies and tax relief programs, finding that the actual property tax burden during Christie’s first three years in office increased 13 percent -- not 20 percent. The AP said it used records from 2006 to 2012 on statewide property tax levies and all the state's property tax relief programs to calculate the average net property tax bill. It also noted that some of the numbers used in the calculations came from 2012 estimates provided by the state Treasury Department rather than final numbers. David Turner, spokesman for Buono’s campaign, cited the NJ Spotlight report as well as a Star-Ledger editorial that agreed with the study’s figures. "It is undeniable that when property owners look at their bills they have seen a 20 percent increase under Governor Christie," Turner said in an e-mail. "His talk is cheap but tax policies are expensive for working and middle class families." Kevin Roberts, spokesman for Christie’s gubernatorial campaign, said Silva should instead review the fiscal actions of her running mate, noting that state Sen. Barbara Buono has voted for 154 tax and fee increases. The Truth-O-Meter in May rated that claim True. Our ruling Silva said, "Property taxes have increased 20 percent under four years of Chris Christie." The state DCA points to Christie’s property tax cap as reining in taxes during his tenure, without mentioning the impact of tax relief programs that have been reduced greatly in the past few years. But reduced or eliminated tax rebates means taxpayers generally have to pony up more money to pay their tax burdens. But a number of organizations have pointed to previous DCA figures showing a net property tax increase of nearly 20 percent. An Associated Press report said the actual increase for the first three years of Christie’s gubernatorial tenure has been 13 percent, considering a variety of factors -- including estimates, rather than final numbers, for 2012. Given the disparity between NJ Spotlight’s and the AP’s figures, and factoring in past Truth-O-Meter fact-checks on this topic, it’s clear the increase isn’t as high as 20 percent, but it doesn’t appear to be as low as 13 percent. Silva is right that property taxes have increased under Christie, but it’s not as much as she said. As a result, we rate her claim Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07343	"The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents – more than twice as many as there were in 2004."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/10/barack-obama/obama-says-border-patrol-has-doubled-number-agents/	In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama boasted about an unprecedented number of border security agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, but he said critics probably still won't be satisfied. "Under Secretary Napolitano’s leadership, we have strengthened border security beyond what many believed was possible," Obama said in his May 10, 2011, speech. "They wanted more agents on the border. Well, we now have more boots on the ground on the southwest border than at any time in our history. The Border Patrol has 20,000 agents –- more than twice as many as there were in 2004, a buildup that began under President Bush and that we have continued." Obama said that commitment is beyond what was requested by some Republicans "who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement." "I suspect there will be those who will try to move the goal posts one more time," Obama said. "They’ll say we need to triple the border patrol. Or quadruple the border patrol." Obama has touted this statistic about border patrol agents in his immigration speeches before. In July 2010, we fact-checked the president's claim that "Today, we have more boots on the ground near the southwest border than at any time in our history." (the same phrase he used in El Paso). And last month, our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia checked Obama's claim in a TV interview that "We have now more Border Patrol officers … than we’ve had at any time in our history." We rated both of those claims Mostly True, noting that while border patrol manpower is at an all-time modern high, President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 1916 to quell a surprise attack in the New Mexico town of Columbus by Pancho Villa, a military venture otherwise known as the Mexican Expedition of 1916. Here, we decided to focus on Obama's claim that "the Border Patrol has 20,000 agents -- more than twice as many as there were in 2004." There were 20,745 border patrol agents as of April 9, 2011; 17,659 of them stationed along the southwest border with Mexico, according to data provided by Steven Cribby, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. That's up from 17,499 border patrol agents at the end of September 2008, four months before Obama took office (an 18 percent increase). Singling out just the border patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, the number has increased from 15,422 to 17,659 (a 14 percent increase). According to a March 3, 2010, analysis of border security by the Congressional Research Service, "Border Patrol agent manpower assigned to the southwest border has been increasing steadily since the early 1990s. In 1992, there were 3,555 agents assigned to the southern border, by 2000 that number had increased by 141 percent to 8,580. Since 2000, the number of agents assigned to the southern border has continued to increase, more than doubling once more to 20,119 agents at the end of FY2009. The rapid and steady increase of Border Patrol agents assigned to the southern border reflects the ongoing interest in Congress in stemming the tide of illegal immigration." The report notes that Obama's proposed 2011 budget requested a reduction of 181 Border Patrol agents. But the administration's proposed 2012 budget calls for increasing the the number of border patrol agents to 21,370. Jack Martin, special projects director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, said Obama's statistic is true but that much of the credit for starting the trend toward more border security goes to Obama's predecessor. "There has been a steady buildup of BP officers for several years given impetus by the 9/11 attacks," Martin said. "The increase has by necessity been gradual because it is limited by the capacity of the BP training facility." In March 2011, the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report, "Border Security: DHS Progress and Challenges in Securing the U.S. Southwest and Northern Borders," in conjunction with testimony from GAO Director Richard Stana. The report confirmed that personnel and other resources to stop illegal crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border have increased dramatically in recent years. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was created, reorganizing several federal agencies under a single roof. That year, the agency had 10,500 agents to patrol land borders. That number now stands at nearly 21,000. In other words, manpower has roughly doubled since 2004, as Obama said in his speech in El Paso. Again, that trend began under President Bush, whom Obama credited, but it continued under Obama. We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-12719	"It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following (10) bills have been introduced" in the House.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/07/social-media/social-media-post-pending-gop-bills-largely-accura/	If you inhabit the more liberal corners of social media, you may have seen a list of 10 Republican bills in your feed -- a reminder of the substantive changes that could result from unified GOP control of Washington. Here’s the text of a common version that’s circulating: OK - It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following bills HAVE been introduced: 1. HR 861 Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency 2. HR 610 Vouchers for Public Education 3. HR 899 Terminate the Department of Education 4. HJR 69 Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife 5. HR 370 Repeal Affordable Care Act 6. HR 354 Defund Planned Parenthood 7. HR 785 National Right to Work (this one ends unions) 8. HR 83 Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill 9. HR 147 Criminalizing Abortion ("Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act") 10. HR 808 Sanctions against Iran Please copy/paste and share widely. Call your House Representative and ask them to not only vote "NO"...but to speak up for our rights, health & safety, and our beautiful country. How accurate is the post? All 10 bills cited do exist, and most (though not all) have been accurately described. But a majority of the bills mentioned haven’t advanced very far or attracted more than a few co-sponsors, so many are relative longshots for actually becoming law. How accurate are the descriptions? Most of the bills listed are described by their official title, or by a truncated version of the official title. So those strike us as being accurate. But for a few bills, the description is overly broad or misleading. One of those -- H.J.R. 69 -- is described as "Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife." That’s on the right track, but whoever reads this wouldn’t know that it’s specific to certain types of federal land in Alaska. The measure is an effort to overturn a federal rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal executive branch regulations under certain circumstances. The measure in question would overrule an Obama administration rule governing non-subsistence taking of wildlife on National Wildlife Refuge land in Alaska. As it happens, this is the only one of the 10 measures that has passed the House already. It passed by a mostly party-line, 225-193 margin on Feb. 16, 2017. It is now awaiting action in the Senate. Another bill with a somewhat exaggerated description is H.R. 785, which is listed as "National Right to Work (this one ends unions)." Right-to-work laws say workers can’t be forced to join a union. They do this by making it harder to form a union, and it’s true that on average, states that have right-to-work laws have significantly lower unionization rates than states that don’t. But it’s an exaggeration to say that it "ends" unions. In fact six of the states that have right to work laws have between 10 and 16 percent of their workforces unionized -- Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, and West Virginia. And the remainder of right-to-work states do have unions -- they’re just less common than in the states that don’t have a right-to-work law. The third and last of the exaggerated descriptions refers to H.R. 147, which is listed as "Criminalizing Abortion (‘Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act’)." This bill would criminalize one particular kind of abortion -- one sought "based on the sex, gender, color or race of the child, or the race of a parent." That’s not to say it’s not controversial -- it is. Referring to last year’s version of the bill, then-Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., called the measure "an affront to all minority women, especially Latinas and immigrant women, who already face disproportionate barriers to access health care and health education." But contrary to the most obvious reading of the social media post, this bill would not criminalize abortion across the board. How much support do these bills have? A few are likely to go far. For the rest, probably not. Let’s start with the bills where eventual passage seems quite plausible. As we noted, the Alaska wildlife measure has already passed the House and must now be taken up by the Senate. Two other bills listed are unlikely to move in the version listed, but the ideas contained within them are likely to be taken up by the GOP leadership on a high-priority basis. One is H.R. 370, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act. H.R. 370 itself doesn’t have a single co-sponsor, but repealing Obama’s health care law is a high priority for House Republicans. An actual repeal-and-replace bill was released on March 6, and that is the likelier vehicle to be considered by the chamber. The other measure that’s likely to advance, but not in the version listed in the post, is H.R. 354, which would stop federal funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood. Federal funding for abortions is already banned, but opponents of abortion say that federal funding should be stopped for non-abortion services provided by clinics that offer abortions. The draft of the Obamacare repeal bill unveiled on March 6 would stop funding for such organizations. Of the other seven bills, none has advanced beyond introduction, and all but one have a minimal number of co-sponsors, all of them Republicans. Here’s the rundown, as of March 7, 2017: • H.R. 861 -- "Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency" -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 610 -- "Vouchers for Public Education" -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 899 -- "Terminate the Department of Education" -- one sponsor, eight co-sponsors. • H.R. 785 -- "National Right to Work (this one ends unions) -- one sponsor, 15 co-sponsors. • H.R. 83 -- "Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill" -- one sponsor, nine co-sponsors. • H.R. 147 -- "Criminalizing Abortion (‘Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act’)" -- one sponsor, 59 co-sponsors. • H.R. 808 -- "Sanctions against Iran" -- one sponsor, four co-sponsors. So just one of these bills have attracted co-sponsorship of more than 15 out of the 435 House members. The one that did, on prenatal sex selection, has been introduced for several congresses running and has only moved beyond introduction once. That was in 2012, when the House leadership put it up under so-called suspension of the rules. That means that a bill is fast-tracked to a vote, but to pass, it needs to win two-thirds support. The bill failed to meet the two-thirds threshold; on a mostly party-line vote, it secured 246 votes in favor and 168 votes against. For the rest, it’s conceivable that these can pass, especially in an environment -- as we have now -- with unified Republican control. Many of these bills address issues that President Donald Trump has advocated. That said, the House has only a limited amount of time, and co-sponsorship and committee consideration are key indications of what ranks high on the leadership’s agenda. On these metrics, the remaining seven bills fall short of being considered top-tier priorities. Rather, these bills may have more of an impact in keeping the GOP base happy. John Feehery, a former aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said most of the bills on the list seem "like click-bait for fundraising to me. I find it it hard (to believe) that they go anywhere." Feehery is now president of the bipartisan lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie Associates. Our ruling The social media post listed 10 bills that it said have been introduced in the House by Republicans. All 10 bills in the post have in fact been introduced. Seven were described accurately, while three had somewhat exaggerated descriptions. Meanwhile, one of the 10 bills has passed, and two seem to be on a fast track, while the other seven are more accurately considered longshots. So the post is largely correct, but it includes some exaggerated language, and it fails to distinguish between top-tier agenda items and priorities further back in the pack. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06097	Says Rep. Jim Renacci was "trying to leave town for the holidays without extending your payroll tax cut."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/05/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-jim-renacci-was-trying-avoid-voting-payr/	Defeating a Democratic incumbent, as GOP Rep. Jim Renacci did in 2010, is a sure-fire way to become a regular target of the Democratic party’s congressional campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Throughout December 2011, the group made Renacci part of its "Drive for 25" campaign to target Republicans it deems politically vulnerable with robocalls, news releases, and online ads. It accused Renacci, of Wadsworth, Ohio, of personally thwarting budget cut negotiations by a so-called super committee that he was not a member of and pushing for tax cuts for the wealthy instead of the middle class. The group launched a robocall campaign against Renacci on Dec. 9, telling voters that Renacci "is trying to leave town for the holidays without extending your payroll tax cut." They accused Republicans of trying to "force a $1,000 payroll tax increase on 160 million middle class Americans, while fighting for billionaires and Big Oil." They then offered to connect callers to Renacci’s office, to tell the congressman "that it is unacceptable to leave Washington for the holidays and raise your taxes." As Renacci prepared to vote on a Dec. 13 GOP plan that combined the payroll tax cut extension with other GOP priorities, including accelerated review of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, Democrats hammered him with yet another news release accusing him of trying to skip off on vacation "rather than protect 5.8 million middle income Ohio families from a $1,000 payroll tax increase." Renacci backed the GOP package, which most Democrats opposed because they disliked other parts of the bill. For example, fellow Ohioan Rep. Marcia Fudge said she objected to provisions it contained that would reduce the length of time people could collect unemployment benefits and permit states to require drug testing for beneficiaries. Before the vote, President Barack Obama said he would not accept a measure that tied the payroll tax reductions to "a whole bunch of extraneous issues," and leaders of the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate said it would die there after passing the House. Renacci said he was pleased that the bill contained his idea to allow states to redirect unemployment benefits to employers for use in hiring unemployed workers. Renacci wanted to make sure that any payroll tax cut extension in the bill would be paid for by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget, said his spokesman, Shawn Ryan. Ryan called it "absurd" for the DCCC to claim that Renacci was eager to leave town without taking care of the payroll tax issue. He noted that a Nov. 21 news release from Renacci called on all members of Congress to stay in Washington through the holidays "until a plan to control our massive yearly deficits is finalized." So we asked the DCCC how it could allege that Renacci was trying to leave town without voting on the payroll tax issue when he supported a measure that would make the desired cuts to pay for it. The DCCC responded that Renacci has not backed "clean votes" on extending the payroll tax, and only backed legislation that he knew had no chance for passage. Fair enough, but that’s a lot different from the claim that he was trying to leave town without voting on the issue at all. The Democrats have a point about the slim prospects for passage of the GOP payroll tax bill that Renacci backed. Senate President Harry Reid said the bill would be dead on arrival, and the legislation, in fact, went no where in the Senate. Ultimately, Renacci and other members of the House backed a Senate compromise that extended the payroll tax reduction for two months. With newly drawn congressional districts in Ohio, Renacci faces an election challenge from Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat whose district was carved up on the new map. PolitiFact Ohio is sure that this salvo is just the beginning, with many claims to come from both sides. But as for this one, Renacci indicated he was open to extending the payroll tax cut and did vote for a bill that contained the extension. And the DCCC asserted no grounds of support for the claim that that Renacci wanted to leave Washington without voting. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the DCCC’s claim False.

pomt-14921	"If you're born poor, you're more likely to stay poor than any time in American history."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/oct/30/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-american-dream-jeopardy-more-ever/	The idea that you can leverage your effort and skill to reach a higher rung of economic standing – regardless of your parents’ wealth – is woven into the fabric of the United States. It's the backbone of the American Dream. But it may no longer be the American reality, according to Jeb Bush. He said for people born into poverty, the dream is facing an unprecedented threat. "We have intergenerational poverty for the first time in America. If you're born poor, you're more likely to stay poor than any time in American history," he said at a town hall event in Concord, N.H., on Oct. 14. The Republican candidate for president and former Florida governor was responding to a question from a black high school student about "the culture of poverty." The 17-year-old pointed at income disparities between white families and black and Latino families and wondered how Bush would explain the phenomenon. Bush agreed that there's a culture of poverty – although it has "nothing to do with race," he said – and posited that the way to lift people up is to "give them power to make choices for themselves, rather than trap them in a situation of interdependency." People who are born poor tend to stay poor, he said, "because we have systems on top of them that put lids on their aspirations." We decided to explore the second part of Bush’s claim: that people who are born poor are more likely to stay poor than ever before. We’re not examining the first half – that the country is experiencing intergenerational poverty for the first time – since the experts we spoke with rejected that idea out of hand. Mobility versus inequality It’s important to make a distinction about different terms that are used to evaluate wealth and poverty. If you consider mobility and inequality in terms of a ladder, mobility can be seen as moving from one rung to the next, while inequality is more like the distance between rungs. As we’ve previously checked, inequality is as bad as it has been in a long time: The distance between the top rung and second-to-top rung is growing. What we’re talking about here, though, is mobility. Inequality may have an effect on mobility – we’ll come back to that later – but for now, we’re considering a person’s odds at advancing to a higher rung. In a perfectly mobile society, your status at birth would have no correlation with your status at adulthood. Ten children born into the bottom 20 percent would find themselves evenly distributed by maturity: On a five-rung ladder, two would remain on the bottom rung, two would advance to the second, and so on, including two who made it to the top. That’s not how the United States works. A 2012 article in the New York Times examined five recent studies that showed America is less mobile than comparable nations. One project, led by Markus Jantti, an economist at a Swedish university, "found that 42 percent of American men raised in the bottom fifth of incomes stay there as adults. That shows a level of persistent disadvantage much higher than in Denmark (25 percent) and Britain (30 percent) — a country famous for its class constraints." Just 8 percent of American men at the bottom rose to the top fifth, it said. Meanwhile, about 62 percent of American men and women raised in the top fifth of incomes remain in the top two-fifths, according to research by the Economic Mobility Project of the Pew Charitable Trusts. So it may be easier to obtain the American Dream, so to speak, in Europe than it is here – that’s another question we’ve previously checked – but what’s the trend within the United States? Studying trends Until recently, there’s hasn’t been much data specific to intergenerational poverty, which is typically studied as the relationship between fathers’ earnings and those of their sons. In the 1980s, work by Gary S. Becker, a Nobel laureate in economics, found only a mild relationship. When better data became available in the ‘90s, Gary Solon, another prominent economist, found the relationship to be about twice as strong as previously thought. These days, the Times wrote, the correlation is supposed to be even stronger: "Most researchers now estimate the ‘elasticity’ of father-son earnings at 0.5, which means that for every 1 percent increase in a father’s income, his sons’ income can be expected to increase by about 0.5 percent." That was written before leading contemporary economist Raj Chetty, a professor at Stanford University, completed a study of intergenerational mobility for the National Bureau of Economic Research in January 2014. Using administrative earnings records, Chetty found when he compared groups born in 1971 versus those born in 1993, mobility remained "extremely stable." "We find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s. However, because inequality has risen, the consequences of the ‘birth lottery’ – the parents to whom a child is born – are larger today than in the past," he wrote. In other words, mobility doesn’t seem to be getting worse, but Americans hoping to live the rags-to-riches story may have had worse odds in recent decades than they thought. Meanwhile, inequality is getting worse, which means those who start at the bottom have a longer way to go to get to the top – or even to the middle class. Analyzing the claim Bush said: "If you’re born poor, you’re more likely to stay poor than any time in American history." Douglas Besharov, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and director of its Welfare Reform Academy, said that’s an overstatement. The consensus among economists on the left and right, he said, is that mobility is lower than it has been in the recent past, but not the country’s 239-year history. Given the 2008 economic crisis, Besharov said, we’re now on the other side of a 100-year period when "we had a pretty spectacular experience with economic mobility." During a time of prosperity, it was easy for everyone to move up – and for the country as a whole to move up in relation to the rest of the world. "America was growing, the economy was growing, America was the richest country in the world, blah blah blah, you know the story," Besharov said, adding that now, we’re in recovery but still have a lot of unemployment. For someone to move from the bottom to the top, he said, someone else from the top has to fall. "We’ve had such a great run in our economy for the last 50 years, the ones who had it in them to get a better job have gotten a better job. We’ve sort of run out of people who can move up in the world without a lot of help," he said. As evidence for Bush’s claim, spokesman Jesse Hunt pointed to a paper written by Katharine Bradbury, a senior economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. It didn’t directly study intergenerational mobility, but rather family income mobility between 1969 and 2006. In other words, instead of comparing fathers’ earnings to their sons’, it looked at changes in individual families’ income positions over time. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and a number of mobility measures, the study concluded that over nearly 50 years, families’ income mobility got worse, and their later-year incomes depended more on their starting place. In seeking to develop policy advice from the data, the paper comments: "It appears that increasingly redistributive U.S. tax and transfer policies may have enhanced family income mobility from the 1970s into the 1980s, but then had decreasing impact as tax rates were reduced after 1981 (and intermittently thereafter)." So there’s some evidence that mobility has waned recently. But Bush cited "American history," which is a big span of time, with many examples of bleak economic mobility, including times of slavery, and after the Civil War, sharecropping. The boy who asked the question of Bush at the town hall, Ebbie Banks, a junior at St. Paul’s School in Concord, said six generations ago, his family members were born into slavery in Georgia. Our ruling Bush said: "If you're born poor, you're more likely to stay poor than any time in American history." Bush’s statement would have been more accurate if he hadn’t taken on such a long period of history. That said, the degree of income mobility has been stagnant for several decades with no signs of improving, which supports Bush’s general point. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-03065	"In states where the federal government helps run these (health care) marketplaces, the average American will have more than 50 different plans to choose from, with different levels of coverage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/01/barack-obama/obama-says-new-health-law-offers-more-than-50-choi/	A central goal of Obamacare is to promote competition among insurance companies. This produced the online health insurance exchanges, now called marketplaces. In theory, these marketplaces will make it easier for people to shop for the best deal, just as they would buy home appliances or anything else sold on the Web. During a speech in Maryland, President Barack Obama touted the success the marketplaces had achieved in providing individuals with options. "In states where the federal government helps run these marketplaces, the average American will have more than 50 different plans to choose from, with different levels of coverage," Obama told the crowd. We thought it would be worthwhile to take a closer look at that. Would the average person actually see 50 different offerings? To what extent does talking about averages mask wide variations? We contacted the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services, and they pointed us to a report by the Department of Health and Human Services. That assessment stated, "Individuals will have an average of 53 qualified health plan choices in states where HHS will fully or partially run the Marketplace." To be clear, this was not a claim that if you went to a state website you would find 53 insurance companies competing for your business. There might be four or seven or some other number of companies participating in the marketplace but each of them offers multiple insurance plans. Some plans would cost less per month but put more risk on the buyer with higher deductibles, and others would cost more but be more generous if you become ill. The government’s analysis included 36 states. There are 11 other states and the District of Columbia that run their marketplaces entirely on their own. The 36 states in the government study all rely on Washington completely or partially to operate their programs. The HHS math The report included a table with the states and the number of plans offered in each one. At the bottom of the column is a cell labeled "Average, 36 states" and the number for that cell is 53. An HHS spokesperson told us that figure reflected the number of uninsured people in each state. So a state with a larger number of uninsured would have a bigger impact on the calculation than a state with fewer uninsured people. So the president's claim is in line with the HHS findings. Averages mask big differences Averages don’t lie, but they don’t tell the full truth either. A person going to Arizona’s online exchange would find 106 plans; someone in Florida would see 102. But if you try to buy in Alabama, your choices are limited to seven plans. In New Hampshire and West Virginia, you can pick from 12. The variation doesn’t end there. Within each state, there are insurance regions. In some larger states, some regions are flush with plans and others less so. In Pennsylvania, residents of Beaver County, northwest of Pittsburgh, have 41 choices; their fellow Keystone staters in Union County in the center of the state have 119 options. In Texas, the spread is from 25 plans in some places to 71 in others. In Virginia, the low is 27 and the high is 68. The number of plans in a particular place depends on the decisions of private health insurance companies. Insurers contract with hospitals and other care providers. Hospitals tend to serve their local area. Generally speaking, insurance companies are active in places where they have contracts with local providers. If it doesn’t make business sense for them to serve a community, they don’t offer plans in that region. There are exceptions but as a rule, urban areas tend to have more competition than rural ones. This pattern existed before the Affordable Care Act, and it continues under it. There’s a third level of variation, according to Sabrina Corlette, senior research fellow at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. "If you only have one insurance company offering 50 different plans in an exchange, that might offer choice, but it ain't competition," Corlette said. We didn’t find that exact scenario in any state, but we did see that in Missouri, just two companies are in the exchange. (Depending on the region, they offer between 12 and 23 plans.) In contrast, in Ohio, the average across the state’s regions is five, and one region has eight firms in the marketplace. The number of insurance companies matters because it seems to be tied to competition. The HHS report found that "states with the lowest average premium tend to have a higher average number of issuers offering qualified health plans." Corlette said Obamacare seems to have drawn new companies into the market. The law helped fund the creation of nonprofit health insurance co-ops, and Corlette counted 23 co-ops nationwide. Plus, she said companies that historically participated in the Medicaid program were moving into the commercial market to take advantage of the premium subsidies in Obamacare. "I do concur with the general statement that exchanges are generating more competition," Corelette said. "At least in some states." Our ruling Obama said the average American will have more than 50 plans to choose from. A Department of Health and Human Services analysis of the number of plans offered in each state, weighted by population, backs up Obama's figure. But talking about the average number of plans masks significant variation among states and within regions of many states. The average obscures that some people may have far fewer plans to choose from. In some places, just two insurance companies are in the market which undercuts competition even further. We rate the claim Half True. Editor’s note: We received a response from the HHS on Oct. 2, 2013, after we initially published our item. The agency clarified that it arrived at its figure of 53 plans by weighting the calculation to account for the number of uninsured in each state, and our report now includes their comments. The rating is unchanged at Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-10-01T15:03:56	2013-09-26	['United_States']
pomt-08435	"Under Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, Ohio is 44th in the country in terms of getting money actually into worker retraining."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/18/rob-portman/rob-portman-uses-old-stats-rap-lee-fisher-job-trai/	Apples and oranges? Apples and papayas? We’re running a little short on fruit here, though a guava sounds about right when considering a claim that U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman made during a debate with Lee Fisher on Oct. 4. About 10 minutes into the debate in Toledo, the questions turned to foreign trade. Joe Hallett of the Columbus Dispatch, one of the panelists, asked Portman about the government’s responsibility to workers who have lost their jobs due to trade. Portman, a Republican who served as President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador, talked briefly about needing to "level that playing field" and expand exports. Then he added: "I agree with what Joe Hallett just said. Sometimes trade has a disruptive effect and we need to be sure that we are minimizing that. But when it happens, we need to be sure that the government steps in and provides workers the retraining that they need. This is why I'm not just a strong supporter of the current trade adjustment assistance of helping workers, but I'm for revamping and reforming the system. Under Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, Ohio is 44th in the country in terms of getting money actually into worker retraining. Over $3 billion a year comes into Ohio from the federal government. That money is not well spent." That figure -- 44th in the country -- had never been cited this way, meeting PolitiFact’s standard precisely: It made us say, "Really?" So we asked about it, got the study that Portman drew his figure from, and talked with experts. And this is where the apples, oranges, guavas and fresh berries turned into a mixed fruit salad. Portman’s campaign says the figure came from an April 2010 report titled, "Help Wanted: A lead state workforce official." It was put out by Community Research Partners, a nonprofit Columbus organization whose donors include the city of Columbus, Franklin County, the United Way of Central Ohio and the Joyce Foundation. It’s worth noting that the 35-page report was not about the retraining needs of workers after companies shift operations overseas. Rather, it was about the much broader universe of workforce development in Ohio and the desire to create a workforce with 21st century skills. Ohio’s "complex and decentralized workforce system" presents challenges to that goal, the report said. The system was designed to give tremendous authority to local agencies and state one-stop career centers, who in theory best understand their communities’ needs. But Ohio needs a strong central leader to tie together the components of job training and articulate the crucial mission, the paper’s authors concluded. They said Ohio needs a cabinet-level, highly respected, credible jobs czar. Many subjects came up in support of this proposal, including the way the state uses Workforce Investment Act, or WIA, funds. Congress approved the WIA in 1998 as a primary federal funding mechanism for worker training. Portman’s statistic came from a paragraph in the report that cited WIA. It said: "In program year 2006-2007 (the most recent period for comparative data), Ohio reported that 16.4 percent of unemployed WIA adult program exiters received an Individual Training Account, ranking Ohio 44th nationally." Individual training accounts are like vouchers that can be used for training or classes for high-demand jobs. They are just one of many ways the state provides help for the jobless, but an important way. But if Ohio ranked 44th in getting out the training account money in 2006-2007, it seems only fair to ask how the state ranks now. No one knows. There has been no subsequent comparison. That was among the reasons that representatives of Community Research Partners and the Ohio Department of Job and Family services quibbled with Portman’s statistic when we called to ask them. One could also quibble about the sum of money Portman mentioned -- $3 billion annually "from the federal government" -- because that’s the total of all money available to Ohio for job training, and it includes state money for universities and community colleges, according to Roberta Garber, executive director of Community Research Partners. Finally, Portman was asked about trade but included figures covering a much broader subject, although it is unlikely that anyone other than a job-training wonk even noticed. Was he mixing apples with oranges? While at first blush it appeared so, we are convinced after reviewing his campaign materials that he has been interested in that much broader subject -- all job training, including the Workforce Investment Act -- for some time. But what of his answer’s central criticism of his opponent Fisher, and the blame he placed on Fisher for the state’s ranking? The figure cames from a 12-month period that started in July 2006. Fisher had not even been elected then. And since the program year ended in June 2007, Fisher was in office for just half the year whose bad performance was cited. The state subsequently made changes in job training, and by 2009, 24.2 percent of unemployed adults in Ohio’s WIA programs had individual training accounts by the time they left, according to ODJFS spokesman Ben Johnson, who added that the training represents only one of many tools available under WIA. If you counted all training for all WIA customers and not just that covered by individual accounts, the figure rose to 48 percent in the 2009 program year, Johnson said.. This is not intended to be an evaluation of how far the state has come or whether Ohio needs a cabinet-level jobs leader. It is merely an assessment of Portman’s claim: "Under Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, Ohio is 44th in the country in terms of getting money actually into worker retraining. It’s an old statistic, covering only part of Fisher’s first year as lieutenant governor. The statistic covers only part of the worker training universe. The organization that first used the figure clearly noted the age of the ranking and did not blame the then-incoming administration in Columbus. In fact, the group was not singling out any individual for blame. In using the figure to blast Fisher, then, you could say that Portman mixed apples and kumquats. That’s why we rate Portman’s claim False. Comment on this item.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2010-10-18T11:00:01	2010-10-04	['Ohio', 'Lee_Fisher']

pomt-15281	"All (Maryland) crabs are born in Virginia."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/jul/27/terry-mcauliffe/terry-mcauliffe-says-all-maryland-crabs-are-born-v/	Maryland crabs, Maryland crab cakes, Maryland crab soup...Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe says it’s all a sham. "You know, Maryland talks about its crabs," McAuliffe said with a chuckle during a July 21 radio interview. "If anyone from Maryland is listening, I want to make this perfectly clear: All the crabs are born here in Virginia and they end up, because of the current, being taken (to Maryland). So really, they should be Virginia crabs." No such thing as a Maryland-born crab? Let’s crack this claim open. McAuliffe’s office referred us to the website of the Chesapeake Bay Program, an environmental protection partnership between the federal government and five states, including Maryland and Virginia. We learned that blue crabs mate in the middle of the bay from May to October. This happens when the female molts and the male cradles her, injects sperm, and holds on until she’s developed a new, hardened shell. After their affair, the male takes off looking for new paramours and the female migrates to the saltier waters of the lower Chesapeake Bay. McAuliffe’s office also sent us a map showing that the areas of high salinity are in Virginia near where the mouth of bay opens into the Atlantic. All this information seemed to confirm the governor’s statement, but did not specifically state that all bay crabs are born in Virginia. Nor did it answer a more delicate question: Even if the crabs are born in Virginia, could it be argued that the moment of conception for many actually occurred in Maryland? We turned to Romuald Lipcius, a professor at Virginia Institute of Marine Science. He told us that the females, a half year or so after they’ve mated and settled in the saltiest waters, develop sponges that carry as many 2 million eggs. The eggs, when ejected, pass through a sperm packet left by the male, become fertilized and emerge as larvae. In other words, the moment of conception and birth -- which Lipcius says are interchangeable terms in crab world -- almost always occur in Virginia. "The bottom line is that the governor is essentially correct," he said. We sensed some hesitancy. "In drought, the salinity can get very high in Maryland and it’s possible for females to give birth there," Lipcius explained. Tom Miller, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Chesapeake Biological lab, said McAuliffe is basically right. "There’s no such thing as a Maryland-born crab in the Chesapeake Bay," he told us. "Blue crabs require salinity of 26 parts per 1,000 to survive. You don’t find that on the Maryland side." Miller said there are Maryland-born crabs, however. A comparatively small number are born outside the bay, in coastal waters around Ocean City, Md. "But when people think of crabs, they think of the Chesapeake," he added. Here are a few other facts about crabs: •After their birth in the lower Chesapeake, the larvae drift into the even saltier Atlantic for a few weeks, then return to the bay and flow with currents to grassy waters. That’s how many end up in Maryland. •Females mate once in their lives and settle permanently in the salty waters. They still produce eggs, however, and the packet left by males contains enough sperm to fertilize eight sponges of eggs. Think about it: One sexual encounter could lead to 16 million larvae. But few survive into adulthood. •They taste great with beer. Our ruling McAuliffe said, "All (Maryland) crabs are born in Virginia." He’s right when we’re talking about Chesapeake Bay crabs. There are, however, a small number of crabs that are born outside of the Chesapeake in Maryland coastal waters. So we rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-09081	"Every day, oil continues to pour into the Gulf of Mexico. ... Even with disaster on our coast..., Richard Burr voted to let big oil off the hook."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/25/americans-united-change/liberal-groups-ad-hypes-oil-spill-link-senate-vote/	In June 2010, Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group, began airing television advertisements critical of several Republican senators who had taken campaign donations from the oil industry and voted in ways favored by the industry. Here's the full text of the narration of the ad targeting Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. (The other ads are identical except that the names and campaign donation totals are personalized to the targeted senator). "Every day, oil continues to pour into the Gulf of Mexico, and oil money pours through the halls of Congress," the narrator says. "And $426,000 of it flows right into the pocket of our senator. What's worse than taking big bucks from big oil? Wiping out protections that hold polluters accountable. Yep. Even with disaster on our coast and Iran using oil money against us, Richard Burr voted to let big oil off the hook. Sen. Burr, next time, look out for America's clean energy future, not big oil profits." This narration is accompanied by a string of visuals, including footage of oil gushing out of the damaged BP well head, oily water washing on a beach, an oil-covered bird, an oil burn in the Gulf of Mexico, a hand-lettered "Beach Closed" sign, and an aerial view of vessels working on the recovery from the oil spill. Given the focus in both the narration and the visuals on the oil spill, we think that reasonable people watching the ad would assume that the vote it references -- "to let big oil off the hook" -- would have something to do with the spill itself, such as a vote to limit BP's liability for paying damages. But that's not the case. The vote cited in an on-screen footnote was on a procedural motion to take up a joint resolution sponsored by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. This measure would disapprove a rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency that classified greenhouse gases as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. That classification would allow the EPA to act to curb emissions by big polluters that could be causing global warming. The resolution was the latest salvo in a fight between industry and environmentalists over curbing emissions. The EPA effort, blocked during the Bush administration, was revived after Barack Obama became president. The vote was seen as a key preliminary vote in advance of possible Senate consideration of a "cap-and-trade" emissions bill -- a major bone of contention between the parties. Major oil companies could be at a competitive disadvantage if EPA acts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, since burning oil and other fossil fuels produces a lot of carbon dioxide. It's worth noting that the resolution failed by a 47-53 vote, so the Senate never actually did wipe out what the group terms "protections that hold polluters accountable." But there's little question that the vote was an important one. "If ever there was a vote to find out whose side you are on, this is it," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. But was it related to the oil spill? Not really. And to us, that makes it an example of an ad that isn't wrong, but is misleading. The ad says nothing about the specific topic of the vote at issue -- be it greenhouse gases, emissions, or global warming -- but it does mention the oil spill several times in the narration. And almost all of the imagery highlights the spill. To us, the ad's strong implication is that the vote had something to do with law or policy relating directly to the spill. Americans United for Change stands by its ad. "Just as Big Oil lobbied against more stringent [Minerals Management Service] regulations, they lobbied for lax carbon regulations," said Jeremy Funk, the group's communications director. "We’re not claiming that the Murkowski resolution has anything to do with spill other than the fact that it’s emblematic of how Big Oil looks after their bottom line instead of what’s best for the American people. ... We’re talking about a pattern of behavior here." We agree it's fair game for Americans United for Change to link campaign contributions from the oil industry to votes that support industry positions, and it's within acceptable political discourse for the group to say that Burr and his fellow Republican senators "voted to let big oil off the hook" by their vote on the Murkowski resolution. But we think the ad overplays its hand on the oil spill to such a degree that it risks misleading viewers about the nature of the vote being criticized. We rate the ad Half True.

pomt-13020	Even "though men comprise 49% of the population, they hold 80% of the lawmaking power in the Legislature (144 of 181 seats)."	true	/texas/statements/2016/dec/06/annies-list/annies-list-men-hold-80-percent-lawmaking-power-te/	Annie’s List, a group that tries to elect progressive, pro-choice women in Texas, sees a lacking in your Texas Legislature: "Although Texas is one of America’s largest and most diverse states, and even though men comprise 49% of the population, they hold 80% of the lawmaking power in the Legislature (144 of 181 seats)." Note: When all seats are filled, the state Legislature has 181 members, including 31 senators and 150 Texas House members. Edith Wilmans of Dallas, elected to the House in 1922 before losing re-election two years later, was the state’s first female legislator. In 1926, Margie Neal of Carthage proved the first woman elected to the Texas Senate, where she served until 1933. But women did not hold more than a few legislative seats until the 1980s. The Legislative Reference Library’s listing of women members shows that the 70th regular session, in 1987, included 21 female House members and four women in the Senate. From then, the number of female House members escalated -- reaching a record 38 members in 2009 and dipping after that -- while the number of female senators stayed in the low single digits until the 2007 session began with five female senators; that body has had a record eight females since 2015. So, is male dominance just as Annie’s List declared in a November 2016 press release? Let’s first consider the group’s contention about the minority status of men in the state’s population. We turned to the Texas Demographic Center at the University of Texas at San Antonio, which says in its latest available estimate that the state’s total 2014 population of 26.9 million people broke out to 13.4 million men (48 percent) and 13.5 million women (51 percent).These estimates, which are posted on the center’s website, are the product of baseline projections from the 2010 Census population of each county. Second, we checked the Legislature’s makeup. Given the somewhat fluid nature of its membership -- some lawmakers retire, others are defeated -- we looked first at its composition on Jan. 13, 2015, the first day of the 2015 regular session. Membership by Gender of 84th Legislature, Jan. 13, 2015 Gender House Senate Total Male 120 23 143 Female 28 8 36 Total 148* 31 179 SOURCE: Membership Statistics for the 84th Legislature, Legislative Reference Library, undated (accessed Dec. 2, 2016) *Two House seats were vacant at the time: HD 13 (Brenham) and HD 123 (San Antonio) The 2015 counts bear out the Annie's List contention: About 80 percent of Texas lawmakers were men, 20 percent were women. The mix is narrowly poised to change in early 2017 due to the results of the 2016 elections, with the House netting one additional woman and the Senate continuing with eight women, according to a library list of members-elect posted online after the November 2016 elections. The 2017 Legislature, whose members will be sworn in on Jan. 10, 2017, the first day of the 140-day regular session, will include 23 first-time members, the list shows. Men account for 65 percent of the first-termers, women about 35 percent: Expected Membership by Gender of Newly Elected Texas Legislators, Jan. 10, 2017 Gender House Senate Total Male 15 0 15 Female 7 1 8 Total 22 1 23 SOURCE: Members-elect for the 85th Legislature, Legislative Reference Library, undated, (accessed Dec. 2, 2016) Merging the new members and the returning ones gave us the final gender breakdown for the 85th Texas Legislature. In total, about 80 percent will be men and 20 percent will be women -- no change from the previous session. Members by Gender of the 85th Legislature, Jan. 10, 2017 Gender House Senate Total Male 121 23 144 Female 29 8 37 Total 150 31 181 SOURCE: Members-elect for the 85th Legislature, Legislative Reference Library, undated (accessed Dec. 2, 2016) Our ruling Annie’s List said that "though men comprise 49% of the population, they hold 80% of the lawmaking power in the Legislature (144 of 181 seats)." In 2014, 51 percent of the state’s residents were female, 48 percent were male. Of late, men account for 80 percent of Texas legislators, women comprise 20 percent. After members are sworn in for the 2017 regular session, there also will be an 80-20 split. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-01904	"Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/02/ruth-bader-ginsburg/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dissent-says-women-pay-68-perc/	The Supreme Court recently decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby -- a landmark decision in which a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation could decline, on religious grounds, to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. The decision was a victory for supporters of religious freedom and a defeat for backers of expanded reproductive health care. The unveiling of the decision on June 30, 2014, produced widespread commentary and debate over its merits. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s stinging dissent attracted wide attention from those who opposed the majority opinion. We noticed the following claim in Ginsburg’s dissent: "Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men." We thought it would be interesting to see how that statistic was calculated. But when we looked into it, we were in for a surprise: The 68 percent figure was a lot older than we’d expected. Where the statistic came from In her dissent, Ginsburg cited the statistic as being from a "statement of Sen. Feinstein," which appears to refer to a Senate floor speech by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. During the debate on President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in December 2009, Feinstein said, "The fact is, women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional costs. Women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men. Most people don't know that, but it is actually true." The 68 percent statistic has been cited repeatedly in the judicial debate over the contraceptive mandate in the health care law. In the Hobby Lobby case alone, it was cited in briefs by the Obama administration, as well as in an amicus, or friend-of-the-court, brief by 91 Democratic members of Congress and a separate amicus brief by the National Women’s Law Center. We found a flurry of references to the statistic in court cases, bills, and reports in 2014, 2013, 2012, 2009, 2003, 2002, 1999 and 1998. After a lot of digging, PolitiFact was able to trace the 68 percent figure back to a publication released by the Women’s Research & Education Institute titled, "Women's Health Care Costs and Experiences." That study was published in 1994 -- and if 1994 was the publication year, it’s reasonable to assume that the data in question are even older than that. (We couldn’t find the full report online, and inquiries to the group and to the original author were not answered.) Is there newer data? Could Ginsburg -- or anyone else who cited the 68 percent statistic in recent years -- have used more up-to-date data? Yes. PolitiFact asked officials at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality -- a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -- to walk us through the data in the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, which is the source several independent experts had suggested we use to test Ginsburg’s statistic. It turns out that for 2011, women between 18 and 44 had out-of-pocket expenses that averaged 69 percent higher than men of the same age range. That’s virtually indistinguishable from what Ginsburg said. Still, it’s worth noting that alternative data comes up with somewhat lower estimates. Data from a different HHS source -- National Health Expenditure Accounts -- found that in 2010, women between 19 and 44 had 52 percent greater out-of-pocket spending than men of the same age range. And an annual study by the Health Care Cost Institute, which is based on information supplied by private health insurance companies, found an even smaller gender gap. In 2012, women's out-of-pocket expenses were 36 percent higher than men's. However, this figure is for all women through age 65, rather than just childbearing age, so it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. The experts we checked with didn’t doubt that women of childbearing age tend to pay more out of their pocket for health care. "Women under 65 use a lot more health services than do men, especially preventive care, screenings and well-care, all of which is covered less by insurance than hospital expenditures," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Still, there are indications that the gap is narrowing between men and women, perhaps because the insurance market has changed substantially over the past 20-plus years, with cost-sharing becoming much more significant than it was in 1994. The annual Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust study found a rising percentage of workers with employer-provided health coverage facing an annual deductible of $1,000 or more. The share of people in that category rose from 10 percent in 2006 to 38 percent in 2013 -- a far shorter time horizon than 20 years. Meanwhile, data from HHS’ national accounts series shows that out-of-pocket spending for men grew faster than it did for women between 2002 and 2010 -- a 3.9 percent growth rate for men, compared with 3.3 percent for women, Tanner said. The significance of an old statistic We can’t be 100 percent sure that by citing Feinstein, Ginsburg was simply relying on a very old statistic without further checking. However, given the long history of the identical number being used, we suspect the statistic was repeated, in most or all cases, without being checked against more recent data. Ginsburg did not respond to an inquiry for this story sent through the Supreme Court’s public information office; justices rarely if ever comment to the media. In any case, we found repeated mentions of this statistic by advocates, lawmakers and government officials without citing the original 1994 source, leaving the incorrect impression that the number was current. Our ruling Ginsburg wrote that "women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men." Some estimates cited by a litany of politicians and advocates are based on 20-year-old data. But more recent data shows that women do still pay more out of pocket for health care than men do, with one estimate very close -- 69 percent -- and other estimates in the 40 percent to 50 percent range. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Ruth Bader Ginsburg	None	None	None	2014-07-02T12:21:26	2014-06-30	['None']

pomt-13041	There was "serious voter fraud" in New Hampshire.	pants on fire!	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/nov/28/donald-trump/trump-claims-serious-voter-fraud-new-hampshire/	Two weeks after winning the 2016 election, President-elect Donald Trump is back on the voter fraud attack -- claiming millions of people voted illegally, thereby robbing him of the popular vote. On Sunday night, Trump unleashed a barrage of tweets claiming - without evidence - that he would have won the nation’s popular vote "if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally." By the latest tally, Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton won the country’s popular vote by more than 2 million votes, but lost the Electoral College contest that decides the election. Trump followed up with a second tweet alleging "serious voter fraud" in Virginia, California and New Hampshire, three states that voted for Clinton on Nov. 8. While our friends at PolitiFact national have examined whether millions of people voted illegally, here in New Hampshire we wanted to look into whether "serious voter fraud" existed in the state. Voter fraud in N.H.? To get right to the point, top election officials in the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s Office, New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office and U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Hampshire all said they have received no complaints of voter fraud in the most recent election. On Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller cited a national study done by the Pew Research Center showing that approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no one from Trump’s office has offered any evidence of "serious voter fraud" in New Hampshire. While New Hampshire is not without election day fraud, it has not happened on a widespread scale. In New Hampshire, the attorney general’s office has prosecuted two criminal fraud cases, one civil fraud case and investigated other complaints since 2012, Assistant Attorney General Brian Buonamano said. Buonamano told the Associated Press he has no evidence to back up Trump’s claims. Buonamano said his office is looking into fewer than five complaints that involve possible voter fraud since 2012 and none so far this election. (He didn’t provide an exact number.) About 729,000 people voted on Nov. 8 in New Hampshire, according to the Secretary of State’s office. Historically, instances of voter fraud-- even allegations -- have been scant in New Hampshire, according to Secretary of State Bill Gardner, the state’s top election officer. "I have no basis to say it’s rampant, and there are ways we can deal with it," Gardner said earlier this month. State law requires voters to show a valid ID at the polls. If they don’t have one, their picture is taken and they have to sign an affidavit swearing they are who they say they are. After the election is over, the Secretary of State’s office will send out confirmation letters to those people to check their identities. "If you’re someone who shouldn’t be voting, you’re probably not going to want your picture taken," Gardner said in an interview Monday. "We’ve done a lot to protect the integrity of the election process." Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Zuckerman said his office received no complaints of voter fraud in the most recent election. Zuckerman has served as the district elections officer in New Hampshire for the last 10 years. "Local election officials, from what I can see, take their responsibility very seriously and undertake to run as transparent and trouble free elections as they can," Zuckerman said. "We haven’t seen those incidents occur." Eyes on the polls Because of speculation of voter fraud leading up to the election, both Republicans and Democrats employed volunteer poll watchers to monitor the voting process. One of those watchers was Chip Fagan, a Willis, Mass. resident who volunteered to observe the polls in the town of Bow for the New Hampshire Republican Party on election day. "Everything here is pretty well organized," Fagan said on Nov. 8. "They’ve got backup systems for backup systems. They’re really well organized, from the traffic direction to the set up. We want to make sure everyone has the chance to vote." Nashua City Clerk Tricia Piecuch said she noticed nothing out of the ordinary on Election Day in the state’s second largest city, located on the border with Massachusetts. Though the lines were long, she said, things ran smoothly. "We did not receive any reports of any issues," Piecuch said. "The hype with this election is you always are prepared for the worst and hope for the best. We were prepared." Piecuch said she had learned the news of Trump’s tweet on a thread with other local election officials in New Hampshire, who were talking about the president-elect’s latest allegation. "They would like to see the proof," Piecuch said. New Hampshire receives so few election complaints that the Attorney General’s Office currently has one part-time attorney dedicated to them. But that doesn’t mean they’re all dealt with swiftly. The office recently asked for more money to fund an additional employee to help investigate a backlog of about 50 election-law complaint investigations that are still open. Some date back to 2012. Trump’s claim is similar to one made by Governor-elect Chris Sununu in the final weeks of the November election. He claimed New Hampshire Democrats were rigging elections by busing in Massachusetts residents to vote on election day. New Hampshire’s election officials said just three voter fraud cases have been prosecuted in the last four years, and Sununu could offer no evidence of Democrats busing out-of-state voters in on Election Day. Politifact NH rated that claim Pants on Fire. Our rating Trump claimed "serious voter fraud" existed in New Hampshire and two other states on election day, Nov. 8. Those in charge of overseeing New Hampshire’s elections and investigating election complaints said any instances of voter fraud in the state have historically been extremely rare. The most recent election was no exception, with no complaints of voter fraud filed in an election in which more than 728,000 ballots were cast. It’s a reckless claim with zero evidence. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-28T17:25:05	2016-11-27	['None']
pomt-10984	Says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion that a president "may decline to enforce a statute . . . when the president deems the statute unconstitutional" is "contrary to 200 years of Supreme Court precedent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/16/bernie-sanders/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-president-power/	After President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court, Democrats highlighted bits of his paper trail on the D.C. Court of Appeals to galvanize opposition. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called out Kavanaugh’s generous interpretation of the powers granted to the president by the Constitution. "Brett Kavanaugh, contrary to 200 years of Supreme Court precedent, believes a president ‘may decline to enforce a statute … when the president deems the statute unconstitutional,’ " Sanders wrote in a Facebook post. Sanders has a point about what Kavanaugh thinks about the president’s enforcement of statutes, but he’s very wrong when he suggests Kavanaugh’s opinion is at odds with 200 years of Supreme Court precedent. What Kanavaugh said Sanders’ team pointed us to what Kavanaugh wrote in an opinion on Seven-Sky vs. Holder, a 2011 D.C. circuit case that challenged the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act. In his dissent, Kavanaugh wrote: "Under the Constitution, the president may decline to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the president deems the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional." Kavanaugh’s remark was a footnote explaining why the court shouldn’t have been considering the case, given that the president might not even enforce the individual mandate. He was citing Justice Antonin Scalia, who made a similar argument in a 2011 concurring opinion. What the Supreme Court has ruled The implication of Kavanaugh’s opinion was that a president could supersede the court’s authority on a question of unconstitutionality. "Kavanaugh makes a strong version of the claim, and it’s probably a minority position among professors, but it’s never been definitively settled by the Supreme Court," said Kermit Roosevelt, constitutional law professor at Penn Law School. Experts generally agree that a president is not bound by a lower court’s decision when deciding a law is unconstitutional but diverge on whether the Supreme Court has the final say. However, the Supreme Court has never dealt with this exact question, according to Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard University. Sanders cited Marbury vs. Madison, one of the most famous Supreme Court cases in history, as evidence that the court, not the president, has the final say. The case states that "it is emphatically the province and the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is." But according to Saikrishna Prakash, professor at University of Virginia School of Law, the decision is "about whether the court can second-guess Congress. (It can.) It doesn’t say it’s only the duty of the court to decide constitutional questions." Instead, each branch has a duty to stay faithful to the Constitution, even if it clashes with another branch’s view. "I will say that there are lots of people who believe the Supreme Court has a special role in constitutional interpretation, and that’s a general view," Prakash said. "There are people like myself who think the court doesn’t have a special role." Presidents have done it in the past The idea that a president may not enforce the law sounds odd, but the legal experts we talked to said it was common. "As a practical matter, there is little doubt that the president sets law enforcement priorities, and that some laws will be vigorously enforced and others will not," said Sarah Duggin, a professor at the Columbus School of Law. "It is also true that at various times in our history, presidents have declined to enforce laws they deemed unconstitutional." The practice of declining to enforce a law because they find it unconstitutional dates back to the Founding Fathers, and has been done by at least the past six administrations, Prakash said. When President Thomas Jefferson came into office, he refused to enforce the Sedition Act passed by President John Adams on the basis that it was unconstitutional and pardoned those serving sentences. The issue did not go to court. In signing the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, President George W. Bush declined to enforce on constitutional grounds a provision mandating that passports display Israel as the place of birth for those born in Jerusalem. When the issue went to the Supreme Court, the court sided with the president. When signing the National Defense Authorization Act for 2016, Obama wrote that in the event restrictions on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees violated the Constitution, his administration would implement the law in a "manner that avoids the constitutional conflict." Our ruling Sanders said Kavanaugh’s belief that a president "may decline to enforce a statute . . . when the president deems the statute unconstitutional" is "contrary to 200 years of Supreme Court precedent." In practical terms, presidents have indeed declined to enforce statutes they deemed unconstitutional. The question has never come before the court, however. Marbury vs. Madison held that the Supreme Court could declare statutes unconstitutional, but did not deny that presidents could also enforce constitutional principles. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-12572	"Evangelical leader says those who oppose Trump could be ‘punished’ with gay child."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/11/blog-posting/evangelical-leader-kenneth-copeland-did-not-threat/	A fake news story claimed evangelical leader Kenneth Copeland said Christians who don’t support President Donald Trump could face punishment from a vengeful God, who would potentially give the unfaithful a homosexual child. An April 7, 2017, post on AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com carried the headline, "Evangelical leader says those who oppose Trump could be ‘punished’ with gay child." The story was flagged by Facebook users who suspected it may be fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to cut down on fake news in users’ feeds. The post said Copeland, the head of Texas-based Kenneth Copeland Ministries, understood that Trump was not perfect, but leaders are chosen by God and must be followed in accordance with God’s will. What would happen if Christians don’t obey? "If Christians don’t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God," the story quoted Copeland as saying. "Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child." Of course, Copeland didn’t say this, because the story is fake. Copeland did support Trump prior to the election, and served as one of the billionaire’s faith advisers during the presidential campaign. He also told followers in October 2016 that there would be consequences for skipping a vote for Trump. "You’re going to be guilty of murder," he said on a TV program. "You’re going to be guilty of an abomination of God. You’re going to be guilty of every baby that’s aborted from this election forward." AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com didn’t indicate its post was fake, but the site is known to carry bogus stories. We tried to contact the website through their contact form, but did not get a reply. It appears that the site took the story (rearranging it a bit) from a parody site called BizStandardNews.com. The original post was dated Aug. 10, 2016, before Trump became president, and didn’t refer to him as the chief executive. The Business Standard News, complete with a "BS" logo, noted that it made up its stories. "The Business Standard News is a satirical site designed to parody the 24-hour news cycle," the site said on its "About" link. "The stories are outlandish, but reality is so strange nowadays they could be true." That BizStandardNews.com story also included references to evangelical Trump supporter David Barton, the founder of the group WallBuilders. Barton did say on on Aug. 10 that Christians would "answer to God" if they didn’t exercise their God-given responsibility to vote, supporting Trump. References to Barton were edited out of the version appropriated by AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com. But again, Copeland didn’t say God would punish Trump opponents by affecting the sexual orientation of their offspring. The quote was made up by a parody site and reused by AlternativeMediaSyndicate.com. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-08135	"There are polls showing right now that the American people for the most part think it's a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-american-public-believes-its-bad/	In a Dec. 7, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama began the effort to sell a deal he struck with the Republican congressional leadership to extend the tax cuts initially passed under George W. Bush. Under the agreement, the tax cuts will be extended for two years for all income brackets, rather than just for families below $250,000 and individuals below $200,000 in taxable income, as Obama had vowed during the campaign and as many congressional Democrats have preferred. In exchange for a temporary extension of the cuts for wealthier Americans -- which Republicans wanted -- the GOP agreed to extend federal unemployment benefits and tax cuts passed under Obama that were also set to expire at the end of the year. As expected, Obama faced tough questions from the assembled reporters about his decision to give in to the GOP demand to extend tax cuts for all Americans. The first question, from Associated Press reporter Ben Feller, was: "You've been telling the American people all along that you oppose extending the tax cuts for the wealthier Americans. You said that again today. But what you never said was that you opposed the tax cuts, but you'd be willing to go ahead and extend them for a couple of years if the politics of the moment demand it. So what I'm wondering is, when you take a stand like you had, why should the American people believe that you're going to stick with it? Why should the American people believe that you're not going to flip-flop?" Obama said, in part, that "if there was not collateral damage -- if this was just a matter of my politics or being able to persuade the American people to my side -- then I would just stick to my guns, because the fact of the matter is the American people already agree with me. There are polls showing right now that the American people for the most part think it's a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy. "But the issue is not me persuading the American people -- they're already there. The issue is how do I persuade the Republicans in the Senate who are currently blocking that position. I have not been able to budge them, and I don't think there's any suggestion anybody in this room thinks realistically that we can budge them right now." We were intrigued by Obama's argument that the American people were with him in their preferences on tax policy, since a few days earlier we had fact-checked a statement by incoming House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, that was in some ways the mirror image of what Obama argued. Boehner, in comments to reporters on Dec. 1, said that "the American people spoke pretty loudly. They said stop all the looming tax hikes...." We gauged the accuracy of Boehner's claim by looking at four public opinion polls taken since the election that asked questions about what should be done with the Bush tax cuts. We concluded that the polls showed that while many Americans opposed an across-the-board expiration of the Bush tax cuts, it was not accurate for Boehner to say that the public spoke "pretty loudly" that Congress should "stop all the looming tax hikes." In fact, we found that a plurality of the "American people" actually supported what amounts to a tax hike for the wealthiest Americans. So we rated Boehner's comment False. We'll add one new poll to the mix of those we used in the Boehner item. Here's the full data: CBS News, Nov. 29-Dec. 1, 2010 The tax cuts should... Continue for all: 26 percent Continue for households below $250,000: 53 percent Expire for all: 14 percent USA Today/Gallup poll, Nov. 19-21, 2010 What do you think Congress should do about the income tax cuts passed under George W. Bush that are set to expire at the end of this year? Keep the tax cuts for all Americans regardless of income: 40 percent Keep the tax cuts, but set new limits on how much of wealthy Americans' income is eligible for the lower rates: 44 percent Allow the tax cuts to expire: 13 percent A follow-up question clarified where Americans would draw that income line, using some widely discussed income thresholds. Keep tax cuts for all: 40 percent Keep tax cuts up to $1 million income: 5 percent Keep tax cuts up to $500,000 income: 12 percent Keep tax cuts up to $250,000 income: 26 percent Let tax cuts expire: 13 percent Associated Press-CNBC poll, Nov. 18-22, 2010 The tax cuts that were passed in 2001 will expire this year if they are not continued. Which of the following best describes what you think Congress should do about the tax cuts? Continue the tax cuts for everyone: 34 percent Allow the tax cuts for people earning more than $250,000 to expire, but continue them for other people: 50 percent Allow the tax cuts to expire for everyone: 14 percent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Nov. 11-15, 2010 Congress will soon decide whether to keep in place the existing tax cuts enacted during President Bush’s time in office, or allow them to expire. Which one of the following options would be your preference for what they should do? Keep in place the tax cuts for everyone permanently: 23 percent Keep in place all the tax cuts for everyone for another year to three years: 23 percent Eliminate the tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 per year, but keep them for those earning less than that: 39 percent Eliminate all the tax cuts permanently: 10 percent Quinnipiac poll, Nov. 8-15, 2010 How should Congress vote on the Bush-era tax cuts: continue them for all, continue them only for families who earn less than $250,000 a year, or let them expire for all? Continue for all: 35 percent Continue for those below $250,000: 43 percent Expire for all: 14 percent How about if this was the choice on tax cuts; continue them for all, continue them only for families who earn less than $500,000 a year, or let them expire for all? Continue for all: 33 percent Continue for those below $500,000: 40 percent Expire for all: 18 percent So do those results support Obama’s claim? He said that the polls show that people "for the most part think it’s a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy." The polls largely support Obama’s claim because they show that only a minority of people -- 23 to 40 percent -- favor extending the tax cuts to every income level. There’s modest support for Obama’s point from poll respondents who wanted to see the tax cuts continue for those below a certain threshold but expire for those above that threshold. And those respondents ranged from 39 percent to 53 percent in the five polls. So overall, the poll numbers support Obama’s general point, but they don’t fully justify his claim that "the American people for the most part think it’s a bad idea." Actually, in most of the polls just a plurality says that. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-12-07T17:04:58	2010-12-07	['United_States']
pomt-07153	"The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office has said that Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/14/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-obamacare-will-kill-800000-j/	Michele Bachmann announced that she filed paperwork to run for the presidency at a debate in New Hampshire on Tuesday. She also used the stage to continue her long-standing attacks on President Barack Obama's health care law. "As president of the United States, I will not rest until I repeal Obamacare. It's a promise. Take it to the bank, cash the check. I'll make sure that that happens," Bachmann said. "The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office has said that Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs. What could the president be thinking by passing a bill like this, knowing full well it will kill 800,000 jobs?" We got many requests from our readers to check that 800,000 number. It's something we've looked at before. The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analyses to members of Congress on how legislation will impact the federal budget and the economy as a whole. In August 2010, it published a new outlook that considered the jobs impact of the new health care law. The CBO has determined that the law will reduce "the amount of labor used in the economy," but Bachmann's comments leave out many important qualifiers. We'll begin with the negative effects the health care law could have on employment. The health care law will cost some employers money, particularly large ones. Employers aren't required to offer insurance, but if they don't and their workers make low wages and qualify for new tax credits to buy insurance, then the employers will have to pay a fine. (This part of the legislation does not go into effect until 2014.) But even so, the CBO says that fines imposed on large employers will affect low-wage workers the most. Still, the CBO also says the effect will be somewhat limited. "To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced," the CBO said in its report. "It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives." Still, that's not where the 800,000 jobs number comes from. It primarily comes from workers who choose not to work because they no longer have to work at jobs just for the health insurance. Here's how the CBO puts it: "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount—roughly half a percent—primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law." Basically, the CBO is saying here that some people right now are working mostly to keep their health insurance. Once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The CBO describes this as a "small segment" of the population, about half a percent of the labor force. The CBO doesn't use the 800,000 jobs number in its report; critics of the law have extrapolated that number by calculating what half a percent of the workforce equals. But CBO director Douglas Elmendorf confirmed that number in testimony before Congress back in February. But Elmendorf also explained that number was an extrapolation, and that the number might not be precise. "That means that if the reduction in the labor used was workers working the average number of hours in the economy and earning the average wage, that there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers. "In fact, as we mentioned in the -- in our announcements last summer, the legislation also creates incentives that might affect the number of hours people work, might affect the tendency to work with lower and higher income people. We haven't tried to quantify those things. But the impact is that these 800,000 (jobs) might not be exactly the number ..." The CBO report also noted that the health care law could actually help economic productivity. "To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced," the CBO said in its report. "It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives." Bachmann said the health care law "will kill 800,000 jobs." We find that's an exaggeration of what CBO said. There could be the equivalent of 800,000 fewer workers thanks to the federal health care law, according to the CBO, but not because employers wouldn't hire them. It's primarily because workers wouldn't have to work because the new law expands health care coverage. That means people working most for health insurance would either reduce their hours or leave the job market altogether. There could also be more economic productivity because of the health care law. Bachmann's statement leaves out so many qualifiers that it becomes misleading. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03848	"Raising taxes on investment income has actually lowered the revenue received from the tax, while cutting capital gains tax rates has increased revenue."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/14/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renacci-says-raising-capital-gains-tax-has/	U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci says that any problem of government debt is "not caused by a lack of revenue, it is our out of control federal spending." In a commentary he wrote for newspapers including the Wooster Daily Record, the 16th District Republican wrote: "If you want further proof that raising taxes does not always produce the desired effect, look no further than the capital gains tax. ... history shows that raising taxes on investment income has actually lowered the revenue received from the tax, while cutting capital gains tax rates has increased revenue." He continued: "Prior to the fiscal cliff deal, the last time capital gains taxes were raised was in 1987, and in the three years that followed, revenues from the tax declined an average of 12 percent. In contrast, when the rates were cut in 1981, 1997 and 2003, revenues on investment income increased from 15 percent to 25 percent in the three years period following the cuts." Renacci cited three sources in support of his statement that raising the tax rate on capital gains lowers tax receipts while cutting taxes raises money. One, a commentary in Investor's Business Daily, cited the same years and figures he used, in more detail. The second, a commentary in the Wall Street Journal, asserts that, since 1978, "the same pattern has repeated itself: raising the capital-gains rate reduces revenues, and lowering it leads to revenue increases." The third, a commentary from the Cato Institute in Investor's Business Daily, argues for "moving toward a zero-tax regime for capital gains," and says the revenue loss from a tax cut or the gain from an increase would be small. PolitiFact Ohio looked at capital gains rates and receipts, as tracked by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, and thought the history of increases and decreases was less clear-cut. We also could see that factors beyond tax rates influence tax receipts. First, we should note that a capital gain is an increase in the value of assets such as stock or real estate. It becomes a form of income when it is realized -- when, in other words, the asset is sold at a profit. Not all gains are subject to the tax. Most assets owned by households are not subject to the tax, and a gain from the sale of an owner-occupied home is typically not taxed. About 90 percent of capital gains accruals go to households in the richest 20 percent of households, according to the Congressional Research Service, and 70 percent go to the richest 5 percent. Because capital gains are taxed only when an asset is sold, taxpayers have considerable control over when they pay their capital gains tax. The tax rate did go up in 1987, as Renacci says, because of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But it is too simple and selective to say that revenues declined for the three years afterward. The 1986 act was written so that the increase in the capital gains rate, from a maximum rate of 20 percent to a maximum of 28 percent, had an effective date of Jan. 1, 1987. That opened a window of opportunity for taxpayers to realize gains at the lower rate. Those realizations, and the resulting tax revenues, were expected to increase in 1986, and they did. Tax revenues actually doubled the level of 1985, to an all-time high. Realizations and revenues were expected to decline afterward, and they did. But tax receipts on capital gains in 1987, and the three years that followed, still were higher than they had been in 1985, before the rate increase. The revenues were, in fact, the highest in history to that point except for the one-year window of 1986. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in a report on capital gains taxes and federal revenues, found the relationship between rates and revenues "can be hard to detect and easy to confuse with other phenomena" because of other influences on realizations. "For example," the CBO said, "a number of observers have attributed the rapid rise in realizations in the late 1990s to the 1997 cut in capital gains tax rates. But the 45 percent increase in realizations in 1996 -- before the cut -- exceeded the 40 percent and 25 percent increases in 1997 and 1998 that followed it. Careful studies have failed to agree on how responsive gains realizations are to changes in tax rates, with estimates of that responsiveness varying widely." Analysis from the business-oriented Committee for Economic Development noted that tax revenues increased after the 1997 tax cut -- coinciding with the high-tech stock market boom -- but fell precipitously with the 2001 recession. "Revenues increased again after the 2003 tax cut, as the economy eventually recovered from the recession," it went on, "but plunged again with the financial crisis of 2008." "From a political fact point of view," tax expert Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us, "it's a matter of interpretation." The relationship between capital gains taxes and revenues has been studied extensively by economists, he said, and most studies find that higher rates reduce realizations of gains -- but that does not mean they cut revenues. It’s a matter of simple math, Toder said: If revenue is going to go down when capital gains rates go up, the percentage drop in realizations must exceed the percentage increase in the tax rate. There is little evidence that happens, he said, especially at today’s maximum 15 percent rate, which is lower than at any time since the Depression. (When he worked at CBO in 1988, Toder co-authored a paper that estimated that government revenues are maximized at a rate of between 25.6 percent and 32.3 percent.) The CBO's 2002 study found that a cut in the capital gains rate will tend to spike tax revenues, but only temporarily. Rate cuts "may not be enough to produce additional receipts over a long period," it concluded, but "may do so over a few years." Similarly, the Congressional Research Service found in 2010 that "changes in the tax rate or anticipated changes have coincided with large increases in capital gains realizations, but realizations quickly fell back to previous levels. "While the effect of changes in the capital gains tax rate continue to be debated and researched," the CRS concluded, "the bulk of the evidence suggests that reducing the capital gains tax rate reduces tax revenues." What can we conclude? Renacci is correct that revenues do tend to increase following a cut in the rate -- but the spike is temporary, not a long-term phenomenon. Higher rates generally reduce realizations of capital gains -- but that does not necessarily mean they cut revenues. So the record is murkier on the other half of Renacci's statement, the corollary that raising rates decreases revenue. The one broad and widely applicable rate increase of the past 60 years, effective in 1987, led to a one-year spike in revenue followed by three years of revenues that were actually higher than those before the rate hike. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Jim Renacci	None	None	None	2013-03-14T14:03:39	2013-02-15	['None']

Here, we’ll take a look at whether the first lady was correct that the White House "was built by slaves." The White House Historical Association -- a private preservation and educational group for the presidential residence complex -- has a web page devoted to the question, "Did slaves build the White House?" It reads in part: "Construction on the president's house began in 1792 in Washington, D.C., a new capital situated in a sparsely settled region far from a major population center. The decision to place the capital on land ceded by two slave states -- Virginia and Maryland -- ultimately influenced the acquisition of laborers to construct its public buildings. "The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American(s) — enslaved and free — to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings." A stonemason, Collen Williamson, "trained enslaved people on the spot at the government's quarry at Aquia, Va.," the group wrote. "Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the president's house. The slaves joined a workforce that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations." These payroll records show that the government did not own slaves, but that it did hire them. Slave carpenters Ben, Daniel, and Peter were noted as being owned by James Hoban. (National Archives and Records Administration/White House Historical Association) Journalist Jesse J. Holland also discussed the role of slaves in building the White House in his 2016 book, The Invisibles: The Untold Story of African American Slaves in the White House. "With the invention of steam shovels still several years away, these slaves dug for the clay on site with hand shovels, working day and night to get the raw material to the skilled brick makers and at the same time, opening up ground on the site for the space that would become the White House’s foundation and cellar," Holland wrote. The identity of these slaves and where they came from has been lost, he wrote. Obama’s statement is "true," Holland told PolitiFact. Our rating Obama said the White House "was built by slaves." Strictly speaking, the White House was not exclusively built by slaves; it was built by a combination of slaves, free blacks and whites. But slaves were significantly involved in the construction of the White House, so we have no quarrel with the way Obama worded her claim. We rate it True.

pomt-14109	Says former state Sen. Kelli Ward "wanted to ban our intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2016/may/11/arizona-grassroots-action-pac/pac-claims-former-arizona-senator-wanted-ban-intel/	Several attack ads have surfaced in the three-way race for U.S. Sen. John McCain’s seat ahead of the Aug. 30 primary. McCain is skipping out on July’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland to campaign against his main opposition, Democratic U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff and former Republican State Sen. Kelli Ward of Lake Havasu City, who stepped down in December 2015 to focus on running against McCain. The Arizona Grassroots Action Political Action Committee, which supports McCain, challenged Ward’s weakness on national security in an April 20 attack ad. "She wanted to ban our intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona, leaving Arizonans vulnerable to attack from terrorists," claims the PAC. The PAC has spent $211,547 against Ward and $45,050 supporting McCain as of May 10, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Last month, we fact-checked the same PAC’s online attack ad against Kirkpatrick, claiming she votes with fellow Democrats "nearly 90 percent of the time." We rated it Mostly True. The latest attack ad about Ward’s record on national security is more misleading. Ward and the NSA Matt Kenney, Arizona Grassroots Action PAC Executive Director, referred us to several news articles on SB 1156, which Ward sponsored in the state Legislature in 2014. The bill eventually died in the Senate. According to the bill’s text, the law would have prohibited state and local law enforcement from assisting federal agencies that collect data without warrants, such as the National Security Agency. It also would have barred local governments from providing "material support," such as water and electricity, to these agencies, assuming they had an in-state facility. Finally, the bill would have also blocked public universities, such as Arizona State University, from serving as "NSA research facilities." A December 2013 U.S. News and World Report article quotes Ward as saying that "the NSA isn’t welcome in Arizona unless it follows the Constitution." Ward believed the NSA violated the Fourth Amendment with "unconstitutional snooping." We did not hear back from her campaign. Arizona State University law professor Paul Bender said the ad’s claim exaggerates what the bill sought to do. "I don't think that it is accurate to say that, if the bill passed, that would ban U.S. intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona," Bender said. "It would just require them to get warrants in order to get electronic information from Arizona state or local governments." Technically, Ward’s bill could have applied to any federal agency that engaged in warrantless surveillance, not just the NSA. The legislation, drafted by the Tenth Amendment Center, popped up in 12 states, but the bill only became a law in California. "It wasn’t intended to stop intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona," said Mike Maharrey, a spokesman for the Tenth Amendment Center. Our ruling The ad claimed Ward "wanted to ban our intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona." Ward did seek to limit the power of the NSA by preventing assistance from state and local law enforcement without a warrant. However, experts said calling it an outright "ban" on operations is beyond what the bill proposed. The legislation was meant to discourage federal agencies from collecting information without a warrant. We rate the ad’s claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e0152c92-7c02-4b73-8396-0d6a40f4c330	None	Arizona Grassroots Action PAC	None	None	None	2016-05-11T12:00:00	2016-04-20	['Arizona']
pomt-06186	In New York City, "an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/12/newt-gingrich/newt-ginrgich-says-new-york-city-starting-janitor-/	During a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011, in Iowa, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., made a striking claim about how overpaid New York City school janitors are (or, perhaps, how underpaid teachers are). The remark came in the context of Gingrich’s suggestion that poor students should be given the opportunity to fill duties currently handled by school janitors, calling it a way to instill a work eithic while also saving money. "As to schools, I think every person up here worked at a young age," Gingrich said. "What I suggested was kids ought to be able to work part time in school, particularly in the poorest neighborhoods, both because they could use the money. If you take one half of the New York janitors who unionized and paid more than the teachers -- an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher. You take half those janitors you could give -- you give lots of poor kids a work experience in the cafeteria, in the school library, in the front office and a lot of different things." We received a flurry of requests from readers that we fact-check the claim that in New York City, "an entry level janitor gets paid twice as much as an entry level teacher." We suspect that Gingrich’s claim originated with an April 18, 2011, report by the local NBC News affiliate titled, "School Custodians Earn More Than Bronx Teachers." Here’s an excerpt: "Teachers in at least one Bronx school earn less money than the building custodian, a stat that has surprised students and parents. "Although it is commonly assumed teachers' wages top the salaries of custodians, an NBC New York analysis of public payrolls shows many custodians make more money than even the highest paid city teachers. "According to the union contract governing New York City Custodian Engineers, the men and women responsible for keeping school buildings clean and operating can make up to $114,000 a year in base pay. The highest paid teacher, with a masters degree and decades of tenure, can hope to make just over $100,000 in base pay. … "The pay-scale differences are even more pronounced for rookie teachers and custodians. First-year New York City school teachers without graduate degrees, make about $45,000 a year. The minimum pay for a first-year custodial engineer is almost $80,000 a year." The NBC story was correct about the starting salary for teachers in the New York City Department of Education, at least those with only a bachelor’s degree and no prior teaching experience. Such teachers start at $45,530. Teachers who have a master’s degree but no teaching experience start at $51,425. But what about the people Gingrich called "janitors"? This is where he runs into trouble. The NBC piece referred to a "first-year custodial engineer." That’s a much more senior position, requiring specific skills and experience. Here’s how the official exam describes "what the job involves" at "assignment level 1," the lower of two levels: "Under general supervision (custodial engineers) supervise and are responsible for the physical operation, maintenance, repair, custodial upkeep and care of a public school building and its immediate grounds; supervise, plan and are responsible for the work of the custodial and maintenance staff; heat building by means of low pressure boilers; maintain HVAC equipment; make minor repairs to steam plant, heating equipment, electrical equipment, plumbing, structure, glazing and furniture; supervise cleaning of the building and grounds; maintain the building and grounds in a safe, secure and sanitary condition; conduct inspections of building to determine needed repairs; consult with and advise officials on problems of operation, maintenance and repairs; set up custodial work schedules to ensure maximum efficiency and minimum interference with classroom activities; requisition and account for custodial and maintenance materials, tools and supplies; maintain records and prepare required reports of plant operations; within assigned budget, hire appropriate personnel and train or arrange for their training, prepare payrolls and personnel forms, pay wages and provide Worker’s Compensation Insurance for hired personnel; are responsible for interior maintenance painting of school building; perform related work." Somehow, we don’t think a middle-schooler or high-schooler is qualified to "make minor repairs to steam plant, heating equipment, electrical equipment, plumbing, structure," or "requisition and account for custodial and maintenance materials, tools and supplies," or "hire appropriate personnel and train or arrange for their training, prepare payrolls and personnel forms, pay wages and provide Worker’s Compensation Insurance." Custodial engineers are actually supervisory positions. In fact, you can’t even apply for this job unless you have a "four-year high school diploma or its educational equivalent and one year of full-time paid satisfactory experience in operating boilers." For all these responsibilities, what do you get paid? In 2004, when the exam announcement we found was released, the rate was $41,500. Today, it’s $55,625, according to Robert J. Troeller, president and business manager of Local 891 of the International Union of Operating Engineers in Brooklyn, N.Y. The latter amount is higher than teachers with either a bachelor’s degree or a master’s agree -- but it’s not double, as Gingrich said. And more importantly, we don’t think a starting custodial engineer would be what Gingrich calls an "entry level janitor." We asked Troeller for the beginning wages for lower-level custodial positions in schools according to collective bargaining agreements. In descending order of skills required, they are: Engineer (responsible for boilers that require special training): $23.38 per hour, equivalent to $48,630 for a full year. Fireman (runs the boilers): $20.68 per hour, or $43,014 for a full year. Handyman: $17.68 per hour, or $36,774 for a full year. Cleaner: $15.77 per hour, or $32,801 for a full year. (First- and second-year employees are paid below the standard rate; in year three, it goes up to the standard rate of $18.13 an hour.) We agree with Troeller that "cleaner" best fits the description of "entry level janitor" as used by Gingrich. And for that, even the least credentialed starting teacher earns about 1.4 times as much as a starting cleaner, and a starting teacher with a graduate degree earns 1.6 times as much. (We’re assuming here that new cleaners work a 40-hour week and a 52-week year, which is not necessarily the case, Troeller said.) Our ruling Gingrich could have argued that the contracts for unionized New York City custodial engineers max out at a higher level than that for teachers; that much is true. Instead, he twisted the statistic beyond recognition. Starting custodial engineers do earn more than starting teachers, but not "twice" the amount. Meanwhile, a custodial engineer is a credentialed supervisory position, not an "entry level janitor." When you compare apples to apples -- an entry-level unionized "cleaner" to an entry-level unionized teacher -- the teacher earns 1.4 to 1.6 times more. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04541	Says Illinois Democrat David Gill "would end Medicare."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-illinois-candidate-david-gill-would-end-/	Attacks that say a candidate would "end Medicare" have typically come from Democrats. But this one comes from the Republicans. The National Republican Congressional Committee is airing an ad attacking David Gill, the Democratic nominee in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District, an open seat that includes portions of Springfield, Decatur and Champaign. Gill is running against Republican Rodney Davis, a former congressional aide and state party executive director. Here’s the transcript of the ad: Narrator: Politician David Gill supports keeping the new health care law, gutting Medicare. But Gill wanted to go further: forcing each American into government-run health care. And to pay for it, Gill supported a new income tax. Gill (from file video): It would be a 2 percent tax. We could do away with your Medicare tax, because Medicare would no longer exist. Narrator: David Gill: His plan would end Medicare. Gill (from file video): Medicare would no longer exist. Is it true that Gill's plan "would end Medicare"? The NRCC pointed us to a 2004 editorial in the Pantagraph, a newspaper in Bloomington, Ill. "Gill supports, in concept, a national plan put forth by Physicians for National Health Care," the editorial said. "It would require a 2 percent individual income tax and a 7 percent business payroll tax to provide health care to everyone at a cost of about $1.7 trillion a year. Gill emphasized that he is not married to the exact percentages. It would replace the need for Medicare, employer/employee health insurance premiums and the private health insurance industry." The NRCC also provided the full video excerpt, from a candidate debate on public television. In the video, Gill speaks favorably of the Physicians for National Health Care plan, though he added, as the editorial noted, that he’s "not married to … particular numbers" in the plan. NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill said that "Americans would be forced into government-run healthcare, and taxes would be raised to pay for it all." So what is Physicians for National Health Care, and what was their plan? The group bills itself as "the only national physician organization in the United States dedicated exclusively to implementing a single-payer national health program." A single-payer system is one in which the government pays for everyone’s health care, rather than insurance companies. In the debate over health care legislation in 2009, single-payer plans held some appeal among liberal Democrats, but President Barack Obama -- much to the chagrin of many in his own party -- decided to go for a less-aggressive approach that retained a significant role for private insurance companies. The proposal Gill was referring to was published on Aug. 30, 2003, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and it remains on the physician group’s website. Here’s an excerpt, with some key points in bold: "We envision a national health insurance program that builds upon the strengths of the current Medicare system. Coverage would be extended to all age groups, and expanded to include prescription medications and long term care. Payment mechanisms would be structured to improve efficiency and assure prompt reimbursement, while reducing bureaucracy and cost shifting. Health planning would be enhanced to improve the availability of resources and minimize wasteful duplication. Finally, investor-owned facilities would be phased out." So let’s put this in perspective. The NRCC isn’t merely criticizing Gill’s "plan" -- one he praised with some limitations eight years ago, a time well before passage of President Barack Obama’s health care bill, which was intended to solve some of the health care policy challenges Gill perceived in 2004. Instead, the NRCC is also saying it’s Gill’s intention to "end Medicare." But that’s true only in an Alice in Wonderland sense. The Physicians for National Health Care plan would "end" Medicare only because it would aim to put everyone -- not just senior citizens -- in a system designed to run, yes, just like Medicare. Our ruling The NRCC ad claims, "David Gill: His plan would end Medicare." But we find that's a ridiculous claim that ignores the sweeping nature of what he supported. He actually supported an expansion of a government-run plan so that everyone would have Medicare-like coverage -- including seniors. The NRCC ad completely distorts the plan in an attempt to scare seniors. Pants on Fire!	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2012-09-28T17:30:59	2012-09-10	['None']

pomt-06736	"Rooting for the Red Sox is like rooting for the drug companies."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/29/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-likens-rooting-red-sox-rooting-d/	Politics and policy were the scheduled topics when Ohio's Sen. Sherrod Brown appeared on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program Aug. 4, 2011. In a startling example of ambush television, however, the segment opened with a report about the Boston Red Sox beating the Cleveland Indians the night before -- much to the delight of host Joe Scarborough and political analyst Mike Barnicle, who once wrote in the Boston Globe, "Baseball isn’t a life-and-death matter, but the Red Sox are." "Did you know that?" Scarborough gloated about the victory. "And did you know it's twice in a row?" "I should have been on 'Morning Joe' Tuesday morning after Cleveland won Monday night," Brown said. "If you would have invited me then ..." "We didn't," Scarborough cut in. "Actually, we never report on any of the Red Sox games when they lose. But fortunately it doesn't happen much these days." Brown, unfazed, made a pitch for the Tribe: "They're a young team that's going to be good in the years ahead, and I will gloat a couple of years from now ... as you gloat today, Mr. Barnicle." Then he threw a hard curve. "Rooting for the Red Sox is like rooting for the drug companies," Brown said. "I mean it's like they have so much money, they buy championships against the working-class, middle-America Cleveland Indians. It's just the way you are." That brushed back Scarborough and Barnicle. PolitiFact Ohio, scoring at home, raised its Chief Wahoo mug of morning Joe in salute. But when a self-proclaimed member of Red Sox Nation wrote to say the senator "needs to check his facts," we were stirred to action. We asked if Brown’s analogy could be right. Is rooting for the Red Sox really like rooting for the drug companies? It’s a claim difficult to quantify, but we’re talking baseball bragging rights here, not more mundane topics like reforming Social Security or extending jobless benefits. A generation or so ago, the Red Sox bore almost striking resemblance to the Indians of today. They were a good and interesting team that teased and tantalized its fans, only to end up breaking their hearts. "No team is worshipped with such a perverse sense of fatality," sports columnist Thomas Boswell wrote in 1982. He said it was "an almost inexorable baseball law" that "a Red Sox ship with a single leak will always find a way to sink." Boston played in the only single-game play-offs ever held in the American League and lost them both -- to Cleveland in 1948 and to the New York Yankees in 1978. They played in memorable World Series in 1946, 1967, 1975 and 1986, but suffered an 86-year championship drought, from 1918 to 2004. The drought usually was blamed on the Curse of the Bambino, or simply The Curse, which followed the sale of Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1920. The Yankees were their arch-rivals, winners of 40 American League pennants since 1921, a well-heeled juggernaut that always seemed ready to deny Boston, Cleveland and everyone else a championship ring. "Rooting for the Yankees," went the famous line that inspired Brown's, "is like rooting for U.S. Steel" -- or for General Motors or Standard Oil or the Roman Empire. In more recent versions, it was like rooting for OPEC or Microsoft, or for the house at a casino, or for Brad Pitt to get the girl. The original line was credited to a variety of sources including sportswriter Red Smith, comedian Joe E. Lewis, one-time Tribe owner Bill Veeck and publisher Bennett Cerf. Jim Murray, the legendary sports columnist for the Los Angeles Times, staked a claim to saying it first, citing a piece he wrote for Life magazine in 1950 titled "I Hate the Yankees." "For my money," he wrote, "the Yankees were and are super-champions for the same reasons General Motors or U.S. Steel or Standard Oil are super-businesses. They have more fans paying more money than any other club in the history of the game... The Yankees traditionally dominate baseball by sheer economic might." Noting that someone had written a song about "the poor old Yankees" suffering a rash of injuries that year, Murray wrote: "I would as soon feel sorry for Standard Oil because it was getting slightly the worst of it in a marketing fight with an independent gas station in East Podunk." Revisiting the subject almost 50 years later, as the 1998 season opened, Murray wrote, "The Yankees were built with dollar bills. So were last year's champions, the Florida Marlins" -- the team that beat the Indians in seven games. Murray said he didn't think it was necessary to study rosters, scour scouting reports or do "any of the usual things we do at this time of year to divine a champion. All we have to do is look at a balance sheet." For example, he said, "The Boston Red Sox are off and running at 18-7. Think it's because Mo Vaughn took off a few pounds? Naw. It's because the Red Sox put on a few. They went from a $38.7-million payroll to a $51.6-million one." That was 1998. This year, the Yankees opened the season with the biggest payroll in baseball, almost $203 million. An off-season spending spree pushed Philadelphia to $173 million and second place -- just past Boston, whose payroll of almost $162 million ranks No. 3 (Cleveland was 26th in the major leagues at $49 million.). A big payroll doesn't guarantee a championship, though the Red Sox -- a good team that got better -- have won two since getting the boost of deep-pocketed new ownership in 2002. A big payroll does permit the pursuit of free agents to improve rosters. It makes possible the cultivation and retention of home-grown players. Their well-balanced roster shows that the Red Sox have been able to do both. "The point is not that if you have more money than someone else you automatically win more games," journalist and bestselling author Malcolm Gladwell, who has made a specialty of testing conventional wisdom and accepted premises against research, said in an interview with ESPN.com. "The point is that if you have more money than someone else you're playing a different game than they are. Wal-mart is not competing against mom-and-pop corner stores. They're in a different business. And it isn't fun, at the end of the day, to watch a mom-and-pop compete against Wal-mart. It's painful and pointless. "To root for the Yankees or the Red Sox," he said, "is the functional equivalent of rooting for Microsoft or General Electric." Brown did not name any company in his analogy. In mentioning the drug companies, however, he referred to the industry that ranked fourth-largest in revenues on IndustryWeek's IW U.S. 500 for 2011. In terms of profitability, the pharmaceutical industry was third in the Fortune 500 ranking of return on revenues for 2009, the most recent we found. And the drug companies have served as a foil for Brown for more than a decade. As a congressman, he gave senior citizens free bus rides to Canada to buy prescription drugs at a fraction of their cost in the United States. He pushed to include prescription drugs in Medicare benefits, to allow the prompt reimportation of cheaper drugs made in the U.S. but sent abroad, and to speed low-cost generic drugs to pharmacy shelves. So what’s the count? The template for Brown's statement was the old line about rooting for the Yankees, a quip that was apt enough to last more than half a century. Its likely originator, Jim Murray, later said his point was that the Yankees "were not an athletic hegemony but an economic one." Citing examples to prove that point, Murray linked spending to the success of the Red Sox. Brown's point was much the same. While the intangibles of baseball make proving it difficult, if not impossible, it is true that the on-field success of the Red Sox has tracked their off-field prosperity. And it is true that the team's salary ranking -- No. 3 -- gives it about the same relative position in baseball that drug companies occupy in industry. Brown checked his facts, but not his swing. And while Red Sox fans may protest, we call them as we see them. The Truth-O-Meter waves Brown home with a True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2011-08-29T06:00:00	2011-08-04	['None']

pomt-10423	John McCain "is one of the few senators of either party who oppose this bill (to expand education aid for veterans) because he thinks it's too generous."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/19/barack-obama/mccains-opposed-but-hes-not-alone/	Seizing on an intensifying congressional debate over veterans benefits, Sen. Barack Obama is accusing Sen. John McCain of shortchanging individuals who volunteered to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan by resisting an effort to expand educational aid for ex-service members. At issue is a proposal to give veterans educational benefits equal to the highest tuition rates of a public college or university in their state, as well as a monthly housing stipend determined by geographical area. Originally the subject of a standalone bill by Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., the plan has been bundled by Democratic leaders into an emergency war spending bill for fiscal 2008 and 2009 that now is under consideration in the House. The proposal resonated with lawmakers eager to demonstrate continued support for active duty troops and veterans, but posed a quandary for fiscal conservatives concerned about ever higher costs as more individuals leave active duty. McCain, echoing Bush administration objections, says the proposed benefit is so generous that it could actually encourage service members to leave the military as soon as they qualify, thereby undercutting recruitment and retention efforts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, provided some ammunition for this line of argument in an analysis for Senate Budget Committee Republicans released on May 8, estimating the plan would increase direct spending by $51.8-billion through 2018. Obama, however, maintains it's important to provide robust levels of aid to returning service members at a time when rising tuition is pricing thousands of Americans out of a college education. And he's depicting McCain as a stubborn holdout, willing to turn his back on veterans to uphold his fiscally conservative principles. "I have great respect for John McCain's service to this country … but he's one of the few senators of either party who oppose this bill because he thinks it's too generous," Obama said in a May 12 speech in Charleston, W.Va. As we write this, negotiations continue on Capitol Hill to find a version of the bill that will be palatable to all sides. But we don't need to follow the ups and downs of the legislative efforts to effectively judge the accuracy of Obama's remarks on the original bill. Obama says McCain is "one of the few" senators who considered that original legislation to be too generous. In doing so, Obama neglects to mention that McCain is one of 21 Republicans who, with independent Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, lined up behind an alternative proposal by Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., that would expand the government's Montgomery G.I. Bill program by increasing a monthly education stipend to $1,500 from the current $1,100 maximum. The stipend for individuals who complete at least 12 years of service would rise to $2,000. Graham's plan offered other benefits, as well, though it did not guarantee money for a full college education. The Graham plan was defeated, but 42 senators voted for it. That, on top of the fact that 21 other senators were early proponents of the cheaper alternatives puts McCain in the company of more than "a few."

pomt-03486	"One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not" 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/11/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-hhs-secretary-kathleen-sebelius/	Many Americans were transfixed recently by the story of Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl with cystic fibrosis whose family won a court battle to improve her chances of getting a lung transplant. Under the existing transplant rule, Murnaghan was too young to qualify for a place on the waiting list for adult lungs. So the girl’s family asked Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, to waive the rule. On May 31, 2013, Sebelius did order a policy review of the age requirements, but that option could take months -- likely longer than the girl could afford to wait. Sebelius declined to waive the rule in a way that would quickly aid her. Sebelius explained her reasoning to a House committee, saying "there are about 40 very seriously ill Pennsylvanians over the age of 12 also waiting for a lung transplant, and three other children in the Philadelphia (area) at the same acuity rate as Sarah waiting for a lung transplant. The decisions of the … transplant committee -- which is not bureaucrats; it's transplant surgeons and health care providers who design the protocol -- are based on their best medical judgment of the most appropriate way to decide allocation in an impossibly difficult situation." But Sebelius found herself overruled on June 5, 2013, when U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson ordered her to temporarily waive the rule, allowing Murnaghan to join the adult list. At the House committee hearing, two Republican lawmakers -- Reps. Tom Price of Georgia and Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania-- grilled Sebelius about her role in the Murnaghan case. Soon after, conservative commentators, including Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, took up the 10-year-old’s cause and used it to criticize the Obama administration. Sebelius had already been under attack from conservatives for her role in implementing President Barack Obama’s health care law. In discussing the Murnaghan case, Limbaugh drew a parallel with Sarah Palin's famous "death panels" claim, which suggested that the government could determine who lives and dies. (We awarded it our 2009 Lie of the Year.) On his June 6 show, Limbaugh told listeners, "Until the judge moved in, Kathleen Sebelius was the death panel. One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not (Murnaghan lived or died), and she said, ‘Some people live. Some people die.’ … All the while, the regime is denying, of course, that there were death panels and that Obamacare was not going to be doing this, and everybody knew that it was." We wondered whether Limbaugh was correct when he said that Sebelius was the sole decision maker. Where Limbaugh has a point Limbaugh is correct that Sebelius did have the power to overrule the age requirements of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network -- the entity that oversees transplants in the United States. According to the current organ-transplant rules, which were adopted under President Bill Clinton, the network’s board of directors is responsible for developing "policies for the equitable allocation" of organs. However, the rules allow an appeals process to the HHS secretary. The secretary can either reject the complaint, direct the network to "revise the policies or practices" or "take such other action as the secretary determines appropriate." It’s worth noting that the HHS secretary has not traditionally taken a hands-on role overseeing day-to-day transplant policy. And historically, a decision to change the rules based on one or two patients’ cases would be unusual, said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School. Still, Tait Sye, an HHS spokesman, did not dispute that Sebelius had a role in the process. He said that Sebelius’ decision not to issue a waiver -- at least until told by the judge to do so -- stemmed from her belief that medical experts, not a government official, should take priority. "The interest of patients on the transplant list will not be well served by having an individual reach in and unilaterally change an organ allocation policy," Sye said. Given the specifics of the Murnaghan case, we think it’s reasonable to say that Sebelius, in her role as a source of appeal for the transplantation network, had a role in determining the likelihood of the girl being placed on a transplant list. How Limbaugh ignored others involved in the decision The problem with Limbaugh’s claim is that he uses the term "one person," boiling down what amounts to a life-or-death question to Sebelius alone. That’s not accurate. For starters, if Sebelius had given her blessing immediately to the transplant-list switch, it wouldn’t have determined Murnaghan’s life or death. Switching Murnaghan to the adult list would likely improve her chance of survival, but whether she actually survives depends on the availability of organs, whether they match with Murnaghan’s blood type, who else ranks ahead of her on the list, how well her own health holds up while awaiting surgery, and how successful the transplant surgery is. More importantly, the system for deciding who gets organ transplants includes several layers of responsibility. The guidelines were put together in an exhaustive rulemaking process, with wide public input. On an ongoing basis, the medical experts on the network’s board interpret and enforce these rules. Then, Sebelius serves as a court of appeal. Finally, a federal judge has the power to overrule her appeal, as one did in this case. So there are many people who collectively enforce and interpret the rules. "The national organ-allocation network is developed around a consensus of medical expertise and is meant to apply to all transplant candidates ... not to apply uniquely to one individual," said Joel Newman, a spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the organ-sharing network under contract to the Department of Health and Human Services. Newman added that the rules "are designed to provide as many individuals as possible an equitable opportunity to receive a transplant." Several bioethicists we contacted said that despite the obvious sympathy people have for patients like Murnaghan, Sebelius had sound reasons to act as she did. "I don't think it would be proper to change the rules for one person rather than alter the entirety of the criteria for who gets priority," Cohen said. Arthur Caplan, a New York University bioethicist, agreed. "The system of rules is built on decisions by medical and transplant experts in the area, in this case lungs," he said. "No one person can or should have all authority over rationing organs. Appeals to the government or the courts need to be weighed carefully, because by intervening, the authority and legitimacy of an evidence-based, neutral system is put into doubt, and that is not a good thing for society or those waiting for transplants." Jonathan Moreno, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that a switch in Murnaghan’s status is not risk-free. "Her medical condition, size and other factors compromise her chances, and a failure here means two dead -- Sarah, and the patient who didn't get the organ," Moreno said. Our ruling Limbaugh said that "one person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not" 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die, essentially serving as a one-woman "death panel." It’s true that Sebelius played an appeals role in the transplant-policy process. However, she was not the only person or entity that did -- existing rules, medical experts and a federal judge also played a role in Murnaghan’s case. In addition, Sebelius didn’t have the power to grant or revoke life; many factors, including the availability and suitability of organs, will ultimately determine her likelihood of survival. On balance, we rate Limbaugh’s claim Mostly False. UPDATE: On June 12, 2013, Murnaghan underwent lung transplant surgery.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2013-06-11T15:48:53	2013-06-06	['None']

pomt-03120	According to an article in the Economist magazine, Americans are "guaranteed" to live above the poverty line if they graduate from high school, keep their first job for over a year and get and stay married.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/sep/18/barry-smitherman/smitherman-partially-captures-virtual-guarantee-es/	Take a few steps, Barry Smitherman said, and you won’t live in poverty. Smitherman, seeking the 2014 Republican nomination for Texas attorney general, put his point this way in prepared remarks for an Aug. 26, 2013, appearance before the Texas Alliance for Life: "Several years ago, the Economist magazine published a piece which said that you only have to do three things to guarantee that you will live above the poverty line—graduate from high school, keep your first job for over 1 year, get married and stay married." To our request for elaboration, Smitherman, who chairs the Texas Railroad Commission, didn’t come up with the magazine story. But his campaign consultant, Allen Blakemore, told us by email that Smitherman was referring to a 2003 report, "Work and Marriage; The Way to End Poverty and Welfare," by Isabel V. Sawhill and Ron Haskins, senior fellows at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Sawhill, a former aide to Democratic President Bill Clinton, and Haskins, who assisted Republican President George W. Bush, are co-directors of the institution’s Center on Children and Families. The pair’s September 2003 paper spelled out differences between poor and "nonpoor" Americans--specifically that low-income people either do not work or work too few hours to move their families out of poverty and are more likely to be unmarried, lack a high school diploma and have more than two children. Based on data gathered by the U.S Census Bureau and "simple modeling," the paper said, "we can simulate what would happen to the poverty rate under different assumptions about work, marriage, education and family size among the poor. One can think of these as a series of tests to see which changes in behavior have the biggest effects in reducing the incidence of poverty." And, according to the paper: lf all non-elderly and non-disabled family heads worked at least full-time, nationally people living in poverty would drop by more than 5 percentage points, from 13 to 7.5 percent. Or if the same proportion of children lived in female-headed families in 2001 as in 1970—"before divorce and out-of-wedlock childbearing dramatically increased the proportion of children living with a single parent"— the poverty rate among families with children decreases by 3.5 percentage points, to 9.5 percent. Or if every family head has at least a high school education and earns at least as much as high school graduates normally receive, the poverty rate among families with children goes down by nearly two percentage points, to 11.1 percent. Or if families had no more than two children, enjoying the same income with fewer mouths to feed, the poverty rate among families with children shrinks by 1.7 percentage points, to 11.3 percent. Finally, the paper said, if each condition were assumed sequentially--such that heads of households kept full-time hours, were married, graduated high school and had no more than two children--the poverty rate would ultimately be 3.7 percent. "Thus, the poverty rate among families with children could be lowered by 71 percent," the paper said. That’s dramatic, but it’s no "guarantee," which is what Smitherman said. By telephone, Brookings spokeswoman D.J. Nordquist told us Haskins and Sawhill made a statement like the one noted by Smitherman in their 2009 book, "Creating an Opportunity Society," whose theme is that completing high school, working full time and marrying before having children--each part described by the authors as a widely endorsed social norm--would ensure almost every American a middle-class income. All told, the authors wrote, Americans "who finish high school, work full time and marry before having children are virtually guaranteed a place in the middle class. Only about 2 percent of this group ends up in poverty," they wrote. "Conversely, about three-fourths of those who have done none of these three things are poor in any given year." In another part of the book, the authors said that working full-time is the most powerful factor; in 2007, only 3.5 percent of families with at least one full-time worker were poor, they said. But the authors also noted that in 2007, the national unemployment rate was running at a low 4.6 percent. They wrote, then, that their analysis was "primarily relevant to the kinds of opportunities that exist in a full-employment economy, not to the kind of economy we entered in 2008," a reference to the national recession. So, the virtual guarantee holds only if the economy is roaring? By email, Sawhill called this caveat important. "The poverty rate has risen from 12.5 to 15 percent as a result of the recession," Sawhill said. "Put differently, it's a lot harder to find full-time work now so it's a lot harder to stay out of poverty." By phone, she said the virtual "guarantee" doesn’t apply when times are tough. Still, Sawhill said, Smitherman’s statement fit the "spirit of what we argued," while having some inaccuracies. The three key factors, she said, were graduating from high school, "working full-time for a year (not in your first job, but during the year the census data were collected), and being at least 21 and married before you had children." Finally, with help from the Economist, we found mention of Sawhill and Haskins in an April 15, 2010, article in the magazine on social mobility. The article quoted them as saying that family background is not unsurmountable. "In particular, earning a degree and marrying before having children can help someone climb to a higher rung," the magazine said. More recently, Jon Fasman of the Economist wrote in an Aug. 24, 2013, article that Haskins and Sawhill "have found that people who finish high school, work full time and wait to have children until they are married and 21 or older have a 72% chance of joining the middle class and just a 2% chance of being poor. The numbers are reversed for those who violate all three rules." Our ruling Smitherman said that according to an article in the Economist, Americans are "guaranteed" to live above the poverty line if they graduate from high school, keep their first job for over a year and get and stay married. We did not pinpoint what Smitherman saw in the Economist. Setting that aside, Sawhill and Haskins wrote in 2009 that Americans "who finish high school, work full time and marry before having children are virtually guaranteed a place in the middle class." The pair did not refer to the import of keeping a first job for any time. Significantly, too, the authors stressed the economy would need to be strong for their hypothetical to fully work; that is, no roaring economy, no guarantee.

pomt-10126	On the economic troubles of 2008, "really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/13/john-mccain/fannie-and-freddie-contributed-to-wider-problem/	The country's economic woes created a somber backdrop for the presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., on Oct. 7, 2008. John McCain explained his view of the roots of the crisis, pinning part of the blame on the Democratic Party. "One of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac," McCain said. "I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back." In this item, we'll look at whether Fannie and Freddie were "the match that lit this fire." (For the Democrats role in encouraging that, please see our ruling here. ) First, what are Fannie and Freddie? Set up decades ago by the federal government to underwrite mortgages and promote home ownership, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) have become major players in the domestic mortgage market. They do not make loans to homeowners directly, but they purchase mortgages, bundle them into securities, and sell some of them on the open market. Together, Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed about $5-trillion in mortgages, about half of the U.S. market. By the summer of 2008, however, the effects of a deflating housing bubble - especially foreclosures and mortgage deliquencies - were affecting Fannie and Freddie, and the agencies didn't have enough money to meet their financial obligations. The U.S. government took them over on Sept. 7, 2008. Getting back to McCain's statement, he suggests that Fannie and Freddie made too many risky loans, and that caused today's crisis. Most economists agree that Fannie and Freddie played a role, but they disagree as to whether they were leading the way or just following the pack. Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McCain's characterization of Fannie and Freddie as a catalyst is a good one. "As buyers of this paper on such a heavy scale, they helped to make a market in these instruments in a way that encouraged the growth of originations," Calomiris said. "Of course, there were other players in this story, too ? loose monetary policy, bad investment decisions by other buyers, and a host of regulatory errors." Other economists disagree. "The idea that this crisis is fundamentally about Fannie and Freddie is absurd," said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "They didn't act well in this crisis," Baker said. "They contributed to it. But the primary problem was a housing bubble." Fannie and Freddie jumped into subprime market to follow the private issuers of mortgage-backed securities. "They were followers, not leaders," Baker said. We can see both sides of this argument. Their sheer size supports the argument that they played an outsized role in the problems that led to our financial crisis. But they weren't the first ones to leap into subprime. And there were a number of other factors that contributed to the crisis as well. For example, mortgage-backed securities that appeared to be virtually risk-free on paper, premised as they were on ever-rising home prices, became a huge problem when the housing bubble burst. And, once-obscure derivatives — the credit default swap, a private contract that pays off in case of a defaulted loan — were specifically exempted from government regulation. Today, nobody knows the true value of these investments, given foreclosures and mortgage defaults, and that is what's causing the credit crunch — a general reluctance to lend money. Lax regulation also played a significant role in the crisis. Some regulatory agencies had regulation powers that they never utilized or didn't utilize well. The Federal Reserve has the power to tighten lending standards, for instance, or raise interest rates. But officials there discouraged new rules and advised Congress repeatedly not to regulate derivatives. McCain oversimplifies things and perhaps puts too much emphasis on Fannie and Freddie in order to assign political blame. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-10429	"If West Virginia had voted for our Democratic nominee in 2000 and 2004, we wouldn't have had to put up with George Bush for the last 7 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/15/hillary-clinton/2000-yes-but-not-2004/	Setting the table for her resounding victory in West Virginia's primary, Sen. Hillary Clinton pumped up the state's role in the presidential election at a campaign stop in Logan. "If West Virginia had voted for our Democratic nominee in 2000 and 2004, we wouldn't have had to put up with George Bush for the last 7 years," she said May 12, 2008, as reported by MSNBC.com's "First Read" blog. "I am going to work as hard as I can between now and the time the polls close tomorrow, because I want to earn your support." Really? Five electoral college votes from a state of nearly 2-million people could have prevented the George W. Bush administration? Here we thought it was 537 popular votes in Florida. Turns out, Clinton is half right. In the bitterly contested election of 2000, Bush won the state of West Virginia with 336,475 votes to Vice President Al Gore's 295,497. That earned Bush 5 electoral college votes. Now, Bush won the electoral college — and the presidency — 271-266. Funny how that's a 5-vote difference. If you subtract 5 electoral college votes from Bush's total, and add 5 electoral college votes to Gore's total, indeed the result is flipped, 271-266, in Gore's favor. And the world embraces the climate change crisis years earlier. (Of course, many would argue a more significant factor was Florida's 27 electoral votes — in dispute until Dec. 12, 2000, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bush, saying it was too late for another recount.) The 2004 election is another matter completely. On the simple question of the math, Clinton is wrong. Bush defeated Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, 286-251 in the electoral college. West Virginia's 5 votes wouldn't have put a dent in Bush's 35-vote margin. But there's something incongruous about Clinton extending her argument to include the 2004 election. If Gore had won in 2000, then Bush almost certainly wouldn't have been running against Kerry in 2004 and who knows what the electoral map would have looked like in a Gore re-election race. Clinton is right that Bush wouldn't be president if West Virginia had gone for Gore in 2000. That alone would have prevented 7 years of a Bush administration. By raising the 2004 election, though, Clinton ruins her perfectly accurate argument. Suggesting that West Virginia voters had the same chance to defeat Bush in 2004 that they had in 2000 is just wrong, which is how we end up at Half True.

pomt-08910	Dave Aronberg's career legal experience is "less than two years as Asst. AG/private attorney."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/28/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-continues-junior-lawyer-attack-against-/	Time for another installment of Dan & Dave. No, not the decathletes featured in all those Reebok ads prior to the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics. We're talking about the two Democratic state senators running for attorney general, Dan Gelber and Dave Aronberg. In this story, Aronberg is accusing Gelber of distorting his legal experience. Gelber, Aronberg says, is distributing a flier that sums up Aronberg's legal experience this way: "Less than two years as Asst. AG/private attorney." "It's one thing to talk about your own experience," Aronberg told PolitiFact Florida. "It's another thing to lie about your opponent's experience." Chapter 1: Dave's work history Aronberg graduated from Harvard Law School in 1996 and went to work for the law firm Steel, Hector and Davis, first in its Miami office, then in West Palm Beach. Aronberg says he worked on corporate litigation at the firm. After a little over three years, in November 1999, Aronberg began a stint as an assistant attorney general under Bob Butterworth. According to records at the attorney general's office, Aronberg worked in Children's Legal Services until Aug. 17, 2000, when he was selected to be a White House Fellow. He then spent a year working at the White House as a paid assistant in the Treasury Department. Aronberg told PolitiFact Florida he helped craft the country's anti-money laundering strategy. After the White House, Aronberg returned to the attorney general's office, this time in the economic crimes division. According to AG records, Aronberg was employed as an assistant attorney general from Sept. 14, 2001, until Jan. 2, 2003, when he was sworn as a state senator. Aronberg did take a leave of absence from July 29, 2002, through Nov. 7, 2002, AG records show. Aronberg said the leave was to campaign for the state Senate. In May 2003, Aronberg took a job with Greenspoon Marder in its West Palm Beach law office, where he works today. By our math, that's three years at Steel, Hector and Davis, about two years in two stints at the attorney general's office, and then seven years at Greenspoon Marder -- 12 years of legal experience all together. Chapter 2: Dan's explanation When we asked the Gelber campaign for an explanation, they said they weren't questioning our math at all. Look at how it was worded, they said. Exactly how it was worded. Ok. Here's the exact style and format of the claim as it appears on the flier: Less than two years as Asst. AG /private attorney "It's two separate things," said Gelber campaign manager Christian Ulvert. "Line one, and line two." (You can see the flier for yourself by clicking here.) Ulvert then worked up a detailed explanation of the fact that Aronberg has served less than two years as an assistant attorney general. We'll spare you the details and just say that the attorney general records we got say that Aronberg spent 21 and a half months on the job as an assistant AG. Chapter 3: Common sense test But of course that's not the point. What is, is how you interpret the line in Gelber's flier: "Less than two years as Asst. AG/private attorney." Without an explanation, we asked four veteran St. Petersburg Times reporters to look at the flier and interpret the line about Aronberg. Each reached the same conclusion: That Gelber is saying Aronberg has been an attorney for less than two years. That's how we read it, too. We should note that Gelber previously has questioned Aronberg's experience. "He is a junior lawyer at his best moment," Gelber told the St. Petersburg Times' editorial board on July 16, 2010. Chapter 4: Dan and Dave, the conclusion Dave Aronberg has been a practicing lawyer for about 12 years. Any suggestion that he's been a lawyer less time is untrue. Is Gelber making that claim in his flier? Not technically. Gelber says his flier notes that Aronberg's been an assistant attorney general for less than two years (true) and also a private attorney (true). But we find the wording and format pretty misleading. A less-deceptive way to say it, for instance, would be to reverse the lines: "private attorney/less than two years as Asst AG." Or how about: "Less than two years as assistant attorney general," period. Despite that clever use of a second line and a slash, we think the typical reader will be misled. We rate Gelber's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09514	"So far, the Recovery Act is responsible for the jobs of about 2 million Americans who would otherwise be unemployed. ... [And] the Recovery Act is on track to save or create another 1.5 million jobs in 2010."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/17/barack-obama/obama-says-stimulus-responsible-millions-jobs-save/	When the anniversary of the signing of the economic stimulus bill arrived on Feb. 17, 2010, it was accompanied by a blizzard of statements, speeches and interviews in which Republicans attacked the law and Democrats defended it. Given the widespread public belief that job creation under President Barack Obama has been unacceptably low, some of the most heated debate over the stimulus plan has focused on how well the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as it is formally known, has promoted job creation. President Barack Obama, joined by other leading Democrats, boiled down the plan's jobs-related achievements in a Feb. 17 address from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington. "So far," he said, "the Recovery Act is responsible for the jobs of about 2 million Americans who would otherwise be unemployed. These aren't just our numbers; these are the estimates of independent, nonpartisan economists across the spectrum. ... [And] the Recovery Act is on track to save or create another 1.5 million jobs in 2010." This is quite a different picture from the one painted by Republicans, who have focused on the stubbornly high (and until recently, consistently rising) unemployment rate. So we thought we'd check the accuracy of Obama's comments on the stimulus and jobs. As anyone with a passing familiarity with economics might expect, economists are far from unified on their estimates of how big an effect the stimulus has had on jobs. First let's explain how economists have been estimating the impact of the stimulus on jobs. Essentially, they have been comparing two numbers: the actual employment statistics from the federal government, and an estimate of what those employment numbers would have looked like had there been no stimulus. We'll get into more detail about how this is done below. But for now, the important thing to note is that the gap between these two figures represents the number of jobs that economists believe were created or saved by the stimulus. In a report released on Jan. 13, 2010, the president's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 1.77 million jobs and 2.07 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009. Separately, the council's report cited four independent analyses of the same question. These estimates were by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' nonpartisan number-crunching arm, as well by three private-sector economic-analysis firms. Here's what those groups found: • CBO: Between 800,000 jobs (low estimate) and 2.4 million jobs (high estimate) saved or created. • IHS/Global Insight: 1.25 million jobs saved or created. • Macroeconomic Advisers: 1.06 million jobs saved or created. • Moody's economy.com: 1.59 million jobs saved or created. In the report, Obama's economic advisers argue that their estimates "are consistent with a broad consensus of numerous professional forecasters. The fact that such a range of public and private forecasters broadly agree with our assessment should increase confidence that the act is having a substantial stimulative effect." But focusing on the 2 million figure, as Obama does, is a somewhat generous view of the data. For the president to be right about 2 million jobs having been created or saved would mean using the highest end of the administration's own range, or the highest end of the CBO's range. Indeed, leaving the Obama advisers' analysis out of it and looking only at the independent estimates produces an average of 1.38 million jobs created or saved -- about 30 percent lower than the president's 2 million-job benchmark. The numbers creep closer to what Obama and other Democrats are suggesting if you fast-forward the employment estimates by one quarter, to the first quarter of 2010. Using updated estimates provided to PolitiFact, IHS/Global Insight estimates that 1.7 million jobs will be created or saved by the first quarter of 2010. And Moody's economy.com estimated that 1.9 million jobs will be created or saved by that quarter. (These figures are cumulative, meaning that a total of 1.7 million or 1.9 million jobs will have been created or saved since the stimulus bill took effect, rather than that many jobs being created or saved in the first quarter of 2010 alone.) So, depending on which time frame you use, Obama's 2 million number is either on the high end of the scale, or just about right. Now let's look at Obama's second statistic -- that the stimulus "is on track to save or create another 1.5 million jobs in 2010." By saying that, Obama was repeating a CEA claim from its Jan. 13, 2010, report. To see if the administration is right, let's look at the independent analyses. Both IHS/Global Insight and Moody's economy.com provided us with forward-looking projections for jobs created and saved. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2010, IHS/Global Insight estimates that the gap between employment with and without the stimulus will be 2.45 million jobs, while Moody's economy.com finds the gap to be 2.5 million jobs. If you subtract from these figures the jobs that had already been created or saved through the fourth quarter of 2009, you'd end up with 1.2 million jobs newly created or saved in 2010 under the IHS/Global Insight model, or a little under 1 million additional jobs saved in 2010 under Moody's economy.com model. So again in this case, the president is somewhat generous in his estimates, at least for the data provided by these two private-sector analyses. Economists say there's room for honest disagreement over the size of the multipliers they use and the impact that the stimulus will have on the larger economy. "There's a lot of uncertainty around these estimates, because the numbers aren't precise," Faucher said. Some of the key assumptions, he said, involve how much of the extra income from bonus Social Security payments, extended unemployment benefits, higher food stamps, and tax cuts are spent by consumers, and how infrastructure spending translates into jobs and income. Some scholars, including many conservatives, believe that the multiplier effect from the stimulus is small or nonexistent. "Every dollar Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy," writes economist Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "No new purchasing power is created; it is merely transferred from one part of the economy to another. ... Removing water from one end of a swimming pool and pouring it in the other end will not raise the overall water level -- no matter how large the bucket. Similarly, borrowing money from one part of the economy and redistributing to another part of the economy will not create new growth -- no matter how big the stimulus bill." But Gus Faucher, the director of macroeconomics with Moody's economy.com, said he disagrees "very strongly" with Riedl, arguing that in a weak economy, the government isn't displacing other economic activity but is instead creating new economic activity. With the notable exception of conservatives, the independent economists who have produced studies agree that the stimulus has saved or created upwards of 1 million jobs, and that the bill will likely create another million or so jobs in 2010. These numbers are based on a "counterfactual" study that is an estimate subject to some professional disagreement. And within this broad range of expert opinion, Obama chose a number on the high side. The numbers could easily be less than what he suggests. So we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-10977	"In 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls — oh, just before the election, it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/17/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-cites-misleading-obama-quote-coverage/	Moments before airing his interview with President Donald Trump in Helsinki, Fox News host Sean Hannity slammed former President Barack Obama for his pre-election rhetoric on Russia. But Hannity’s remarks were misleading, and the words he attributed to Obama were taken out of context. "We all know that Russian election meddling is not new at all," Hannity said in his opening monologue on July 16. "And despite this, in 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls — oh, just before the election — it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with." Hannity pointed to Obama’s remarks at a press conference on Oct. 18, 2016, a day after a stump speech in which Trump announced what he believed was evidence in support of his repeated claims about voter fraud in the 2016 election. Hannity quoted Obama as saying: "There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections. There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time." Hannity later read an altered version of the same quote as part of a question for Trump about Russia’s election meddling. Hannity repeated the claim a third time while interviewing guests. What Hannity did not mention, however, was that Obama’s remarks actually came in response to a reporter’s question about voter fraud and Trump’s claims that the election could be rigged. Obama was not making reference to Russian interference. (For more on Russia’s election meddling, read our on-the-record timeline of events.) "Donald Trump is telling his supporters that the election is rigged and asking them to monitor certain areas on election day," NPR’s Ayesha Rascoe said. "How concerned are you about the potential for violence? And what about after election day — are you worried the results of the election may be distrusted?" A more complete version of Obama’s response can be read below, with the portions referenced by Hannity in bold: "I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It's unprecedented. It happens to be based on no facts. Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology — conservative or liberal — who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found … "If you start whining before the game is even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose you start blaming somebody else, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job. Because there are a lot of times when things don’t go our way, or my way. That’s okay. You fight through it, you work through it. You try to accomplish your goals. "But the larger point that I want to emphasize here is that there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections, in part because they’re so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved. There’s no evidence that that has happened in the past, or that there are instances in which that will happen this time. And so I’d advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes." Hannity is not the first person to pluck out this quote. Trump, who appeared to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denial of Russian election interference during a press conference before Hannity’s interview, did the same in tweets on Feb. 20, 2018. "(Obama) thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to ‘rock the boat,’" Trump wrote. "When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Several news and fact-checking websites pointed out that Trump took Obama’s words out of context. The Obama administration did receive some criticism for its quiet response to Russian interference, which the administration learned of in the months leading up to the election. But as we have noted in previous fact-checks, it is an exaggeration to say Obama did nothing. By the Oct. 28, 2016, press conference, Obama had personally confronted Putin about it at the G20 Summit in China. Intelligence agencies under Obama’s administration had also accused Russia of being responsible for hacking and leaking emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, issuing a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence. So Obama did show concern — and he was responding to Trump’s early claims of a rigged election based on voter fraud when he made the comment Hannity singled out. From Hannity’s side, a Fox News spokesperson pointed to reports from the Washington Post and Reuters that former President Barack Obama was informed of Russian meddling as early as the summer of 2016, months before he stated that "there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections." Our ruling Hannity said, "In 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls — oh, just before the election — it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with." The quote Hannity used was out of context when presented as the basis of a misleading argument about Obama’s response to Russian meddling. Obama was actually responding to Trump’s claims about voter fraud potentially changing the outcome of the election. We rate Hannity’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-10806	"If we manufactured 5-million of these 2.5-meg windmills across the country, we could electrify the entire nation — the entire nation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/02/mike-gravel/yes-in-theory-but-not-in-practice/	Gravel said at a debate that 5-million windmills could produce enough energy, electrical and otherwise, to serve the whole country. In theory, he's right. The energy experts we interviewed did not dispute that 5-million 2.5-megawatt windmills, operating under normal conditions, would produce energy equal to and surpassing total U.S. energy consumption of about 9-billion megawatt hours per year. So, it's true, but not at all realistic. "Technically it could be that big, but it wouldn't be economically feasible," said Ryan Wiser, a staff scientist with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Wind is described as an intermittent energy source because the wind doesn't always blow. So power production from windmills varies. It's not cost-efficient or practical to store the quantities of wind power you would need to power the entire country consistently, Wiser said. Researchers are debating the potential of supplying 20 percent of U.S. electrical consumption via wind turbines, the term for electricity-producing windmills. Hitting 20 percent is considered controversial and ambitious. Wiser said scientific studies are still in draft form, but they look promising. Currently, the United States gets between 0.8 and 1 percent of its electricity from wind power. President Bush has spoken approvingly of wind energy, because of its minimal impact on the environment. The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2007 that the U.S. wind industry, which has lagged behind its counterpart in Europe, is now ramping up. Demand is strong for the high-tech parts used to build wind turbines, so much so that shortages are preventing new projects from starting. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11632	Under "his own legislation," Donald Trump's "own family would not have been allowed into the country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/19/randy-bryce/would-trump-bill-have-kept-his-grandfather-and-mel/	In his bid to win the southern Wisconsin U.S. House seat held by GOP Speaker Paul Ryan, Democrat Randy Bryce is also running against President Donald Trump. The iron worker and union leader, who has raised more than $1 million, criticized Trump at a Jan. 10, 2018 campaign event in Racine, saying: His own legislation, what he wants to do as far as (unintelligible) immigrants, his own family would not have been allowed into the country, based on what he's doing. In other words, if legislation backed by Trump had been in place years ago, would his own family have been barred from entering the United States? As we’ll see, Bryce points to two family members -- Trump’s paternal grandfather and his current wife -- and pending legislation that would create a point system for qualifying to immigrate to the United States. What we found is that odds would have been against -- perhaps heavily against -- both Friedrich Trump and Melania Trump, but that Bryce’s declaration goes too far. There are a number of unknowns, particularly with Melania, which means there isn’t evidence to prove she would not have been allowed to immigrate. Pending immigration legislation The Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act was introduced in August 2017 and endorsed by Trump and is pending in the U.S. Senate. It is aimed at reducing legal immigration levels by half over a decade. The bill, as reported by PolitiFact National, would shift legal immigration into the United States from a system favoring family reunification to one based on skills and merit. People applying to immigrate would have to achieve at least 30 points under a system that would award points based primarily on age (younger is better), education (especially science and technology advanced degrees), ability to speak English, an offer of a high-paying job having been made and bringing along more than $1 million to invest. The New York Times offered a test you can take online and it quoted an economist who estimated that only 2 percent of Americans would get the 30 points needed just to be considered for immigration. The test Here’s another quick version of the test, offered by TIME, followed by our analysis of how Friedrich and Melania Trump might have scored had the RAISE legislation been in place when they came to the United States. How old are you? Under 18 cannot apply 18-21 6 points 22-25 8 points 26-30 10 points 31-35 8 points 36-40 6 points 41-45 4 points 46-50 2 points Over 50 0 points What's your highest level of education?

No 0 points Yes, with foreign currency worth less than $1.35 million for a new commercial enterprise 0 points Yes, with foreign currency worth between $1.35 million and $1.8 million for a new commercial enterprise 6 points Yes, with foreign currency worth at least $1.8 million for a new commercial enterprise 12 points Grandfather Friedrich Trump Friedrich Trump immigrated from Germany to the United States in 1885 at age 16. Under RAISE, he could not have applied for immigration until he turned 18. A Washington Post analysis cited to us by Bryce’s campaign noted Friedrich Trump’s lack of English-speaking and lack of high-level job skills, and concluded that had the RAISE Act been in place, Trump "would likely not have gained entry to the United States." Washington University law professor emeritus Stephen Legomsky, an immigration law specialist, went further. He told us that "even under the most favorable assumptions, it’s extremely unlikely" that Friedrich Trump would have amassed the minimum of 30 points just to be considered for immigration. Syracuse University political science professor Elizabeth Cohen, whose specialties include immigration, called Friedrich’s chances "highly unlikely." Gwenda Blair, a Columbia University journalism adjunct faculty member and author of The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President, helped us understand why Friedrich would have had such an uphill battle. She told us that before Friedrich immigrated, he had little, if any English-speaking skills; almost certainly had not finished high school; having trained as a barber’s apprentice, almost certainly would not have had a high-paying job awaiting him in New York; and, coming from a low-income family, almost certainly would not have had a large sum of money to invest. As for the first lady, the case is not overly favorable, but also not clear cut. Wife Melania Trump Bryce’s campaign pointed us to a San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News article. It declared that if RAISE were in place when Melania Trump arrived with a temporary visa "she wouldn’t stand a chance of being able to stay." According to the Mercury News: Melania, a native of Slovenia, first came to the United States, at age 26, on a tourist visa in August 1996. A few months later, she obtained an H-1B visa for skilled workers. There’s some question about whether she did some modeling work before getting her H-1B visa as well as how she obtained a green card in 2001. She married Trump in 2006 and became a U.S. citizen. "At best, Melania could probably score about 21 points, so there would be no visa for her," the article said. She did have more going for her than Friedrich did. English: Melania currently speaks English with a heavy accent, but it’s one of five languages she’s reportedly fluent in. There’s no way to know, at the time she came to the United States, whether her English-speaking skills would have earned her zero points, 12, or some number in between. Education: Melania briefly studied architecture and design at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. But, according to Vanity Fair, she dropped out after winning runner-up in a beauty contest. So, for a high school diploma or the equivalent, that’s one point. Job awaiting: At age 18, in Milan, Italy, Melania signed on with a modeling agency that said it sponsored the visa that brought her to New York in 1996. In New York in 1996, Melania would have needed a starting salary of at least $53,100 to earn any points, according to Cohen. Means: Another unknown is whether Melania could have brought along a large sum of money, even if that seems unlikely. Melania’s father managed a chain of car and motorcycle dealerships, and her mother was either a fashion designer or a garment factory worker, according to the New York Post. She would have earned points if she could have come over with the current equivalent of more than $1.35 million. Legomsky, the Washington University law professor, pointed out that even if Melania amassed 30 points, which he said was unlikely, it would be difficult for her to be chosen for immigration given that more applicants would have much higher scores. But he said he could not say for certain. Syracuse’s Cohen said Melania "probably would have come close" to hitting 30 points, and potentially could have exceeded 30, depending on her English proficiency and the salary of her first job. The White House responded to our request seeking information about Bryce’s claim, but did not provide any information. Our rating Bryce says that under Donald Trump’s "own legislation," Trump's "own family would not have been allowed into the country." It seems unlikely, perhaps highly unlikely, that either Trump’s grandfather or his wife would have earned enough points under the legislation to be eligible for immigration. But, particularly with Melania Trump, it can’t be known for certain. For a statement that is partially accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Half True.

pomt-06266	"We have the second highest corporate tax rate among our trading partners."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/28/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-has-second-highest-corpora/	Tax reform was an issue addressed by the Joint Select Deficit Reduction Committee, aka the supercommittee, in its failed quest to reduce the federal budget deficit. Partisans on both sides of the political aisle have complained for years about the way we are taxed. Republicans and some Democrats claim business taxes are too high and stifle growth. They argue that instead of handing over a share of profits to the government, companies could use the money to expand and hire more workers. Others argue the money is more likely to be passed on to shareholders. It’s a big debate among states. Those with higher corporate tax rates often complain they can’t fairly compete for investment with states that have lower rates. And when multi-national companies decide where they want to build a factory or invest their capital, one of the things they consider is a country’s tax rate. That’s the context for a recent statement by U.S. Sen. (and supercommittee member) Rob Portman of Ohio, who broached the subject of tax reform during a hearing Nov. 1. "We have the second highest corporate tax rate among our trading partners," Portman said. "Japan’s is slightly higher, and they are intending to take theirs down." Portman contends that corporate taxes need to be lowered to make the U.S. more attractive to investment, but that corporate deductions also should be reduced so as not to add to the deficit. Resulting growth would broaden the tax base and actually raise revenues. He also thinks multi-national corporations should be allowed to repatriate future profits to the United States without having to pay additional taxes on them here. Because corporate taxes are such a hot-button issue, PolitiFact Ohio decided to review Portman’s statement. Portman’s office said the senator based his comments on a report published in September by the Washington-based Tax Foundation called "U.S. Corporations Suffer High Effective Tax Rates by International Standards." The first sentence in the report speaks directly to Portman’s claim. "The United States currently lays claim to the second-highest statutory corporate income tax rate in the developed world. At 39.2 percent, the rate is only 0.35 percentage points behind OECD-leading Japan." OECD stands for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and includes 34 countries. China, India and Brazil are not members but cooperate with OECD. The 39.2 percent figure is correct when you combine the statutory federal rate of 35 percent with the average statutory rate among states. But the statutory rate is only part of the equation. The statutory rate is what the tax code declares corporations must pay, but it’s much different from what corporations actually pay. That is called the effective tax rate, and it takes into account all the loopholes and preferences available to companies, such as depreciation of assets and deductions for things like research and development. Those can significantly lower taxable income and in some cases eliminate a corporation’s tax burden altogether. We felt it was important to examine Portman’s statement in view of the effective tax rate as well. And there the story is different — not much different according to the Tax Foundation, but a great deal so if you pose the question to the conservative Tax Foundation’s more-liberal think-tank rivals. The Tax Foundation report lists 13 recent studies that compare effective tax rates across countries. The United States ranks second in three of those studies, third in two of them, fourth in two, fifth in three, sixth in one, eighth in one and 23rd in one. But when you look at only those studies involving OECD countries, the United States never falls out of the top five. "Taken as a whole these studies indicate that the average effective tax rate for U.S. corporations — like the statutory rate — is one of the highest in the world," the Tax Foundation report states. "By every available measure, the U.S. imposes a very high tax burden on its corporate sector, in comparison to other nations, even after credits and deductions." Will McBride, an economist with the Tax Foundation, equates the statutory rate with the sticker price of a car, and the effective rate with the actual sales price once the haggling is over. Both rates are important, he said, because they affect behavior. But we’re not letting that be the last word. The left-leaning, Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy produced a report this month that sampled 280 of the Fortune 500 companies in the United States and found that they paid an average U.S. corporate tax of 18.5 percent. Of those 280 companies, 78 paid no federal taxes in at least one of the past three years. One of the authors of that report, Rebecca Wilkins, senior counsel for federal tax policy at the Center for Tax Justice, argues that the Tax Foundation studies are misleading because they include both deferred and foreign taxes in their calculations. Not to complicate things further, but Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury official under the first President George Bush and now a New York Times blogger, argues that the broadest measure of a country’s corporate tax burden is to calculate corporate taxes as a share of gross domestic product. In that case, the United States is among the lowest in the OECD, he said, which begs the question; how can a country have such a high tax rate, but such a low tax burden? The answer: loopholes and deductions. Furthermore, a more precise debate would factor in the taxing of corporate dividends to shareholders, which is done at a comparatively lower rate in the United States than in most other countries, he said. Bartlett, who recently wrote a book on tax reform called "The Benefit and The Burden," thinks the whole exercise is somewhat irrelevant because cutting taxes won’t necessarily lead to more investment, especially in today’s stagnant economy when nobody is interested in expanding. The upshot is that there are a lot of ways to slice the corporate tax apple, and the conclusion that can be drawn depends a lot on the question that is being asked. So where does all this leave Portman’s claim? The claim is irrefutable when looking at the statutory rate but arguable when considering effective rates. So Portman’s statement is accurate, but requires some clarification, which on the Truth-O-Meter means a rating of Mostly True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2011-11-28T06:00:00	2011-11-11	['None']
pomt-08380	"Matt Patten kicked off his dirty campaign with thousands in dirty cash from guess who? (Frank) Russo and (Jimmy) Dimora."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/25/ohio-house-republican-organizational-committee/house-republicans-target-state-rep-matt-patten-try/	There is no bigger symbol of corruption in the public mind in Northeast Ohio than indicted Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora. The now infamous picture of Dimora being led out from his house in handcuffs by FBI agents is being used in a number of races against local Democrats, including Rep. Matt Patten. The Strongsville Democrat is locked in a tight Ohio House re-election battle against Republican Mike Dovilla. A TV ad by the Ohio House Republican Organizational Committee attacks Patten as well as another House Democratic candidate — Kelli Perk — suggesting they are part of the corruption in Cuyahoga County. It opens by flashing the Dimora picture. In Patten’s case, the link to Dimora as well as former Cuyahoga County Auditor Frank Russo was the "thousands in dirty cash" from the pair that the Democrat received during a January 24, 2008, event, according to the ad. (For the record, Dimora has proclaimed his innocence while Russo has pleaded guilty to 21 corruption-related crimes.) But were the pair really giving "thousands" to Patten, a relatively unknown first-time candidate for office back in January 2008? We decided to check for ourselves. After combing through Patten’s campaign finance filings, we found a pair of contributions from the disgraced duo on that night totaling $500. The two $250 contributions were from the Friends of Frank Russo and the Dimora Boosters Committee and were reported as being received Jan. 24, 2008. Additionally, the Dimora Boosters Club gave Patten $200 and the Friends of Frank Russo gave him $100 in July 2008. That’s a grand total of $800—and only $500 on the night spotlighted by the attack ad. (By the way, Dimora gave to eight other Democratic statehouse candidates back in 2008 while Russo gave to two.) House Republicans argue that the "thousands in dirty cash" is reached if you add other contributions to Patten from persons charged in the public corruption scandal such as former Sheriff Gerald McFaul ($100), Daniel Gallagher ($100) and Ferris Kleem ($250) as well as others just mentioned in the corruption indictments. Lumped in that group are public officials implicated in the corruption scandal but not named or charged. House Republicans also note that Russo and Dimora were two of the main sponsors of the event in January 2008 in arguing that Patten was close to the pair. For his part, Patten acknowledges that Dimora and Russo were sponsors of the fundraiser but says that neither man actually attended the event. He says he used their names as well as County Commissioner Tim Hagan and others to attract other politicos into coming to the fundraiser. He says he has given the money from Russo and Dimora to charity. As for the charge, the cash was "dirty", it should be noted that this fundraiser took place in Jan. 2008 — roughly six months before Dimora’s office was raided by the FBI and 32 months before he was indicted in federal court. Russo was similarly in the clear in January 2008 as far as anyone knew. It’s hard to see how the money was "dirty"-- at least back in January 2008. To sum up, it looks like House Republicans got caught with their hand in the cookie jar on this one. Their ad claims that Patten took "thousands in dirty money" from Dimora and Russo at a January 2008 fundraiser. Campaign finance records show it was just $500 that night. An additional $300 was given by the duo about six months later, but even counting that cash the ad’s claim is still way off. Republicans argue that the "thousands" threshold comes when you count others connected to the corruption scandal, but, frankly, we aren’t buying it. The ad states very explicitly "Russo and Dimora" were the ones giving the "thousands" to Patten. We rate the Ohio House Republican Organizational Committee’s claim to be False. Comment on this item.

pomt-10951	"Richard Cordray wants to raise your taxes by reversing President Trump's tax reform."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/jul/24/mike-dewine/ohio-mike-dewine-misleads-video-says-richard-cordr/	Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine says his Democratic opponent for governor Richard Cordray supports a tax hike. "Richard Cordray wants to raise your taxes by reversing President Trump's tax reform," says an online video on the DeWine campaign website Can’t Trust Cordray. "Cordray wants to revoke your middle class $2,000 tax cut." Here’s what DeWine is on point about: Cordray adamantly opposed the federal tax bill signed by President Donald Trump in December. Initially, that bill cuts taxes for all income groups. Here’s what DeWine omits: That tax bill did not cut everyone’s taxes, particularly in future years. And Cordray, who as governor would have no power to raise federal taxes, hasn’t said he wants to raise taxes. Cordray’s statements about federal taxes The video states that Cordray wants to reverse Trump’s tax reform, but the first thing to know is that if he won the race, a governor can’t control federal tax policy. And the video doesn’t tell the full story about that $2,000 tax cut. The tax bill doesn’t cut everyone’s taxes, especially for people in future years. At its start the tax bill does come close to providing tax relief for all income groups, and for most members within each group. The median household of a family of four gets about a $2,000 tax cut on average. That said, the benefits of the tax bill would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers. Over time these broad-based tax cuts dissipate. By 2027, every income group below $75,000 sees a tax increase. Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027. That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average. The DeWine campaign cited several statements by Cordray in which he criticized the federal tax bill as a benefit to the rich. In a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in December, Cordray said that the legislation helped corporations. "There’s slabs for them, there’s crumbs for people like the middle-class people in our society," he said. "I think it is wrong." In a Dec. 20 tweet, Cordray called the bill a "shortsighted abomination." In February, Cordray tweeted that the tax bill brings "more trickle-down economics that doesn’t trickle down." Cordray has echoed a talking point by Democrats that cherrypicks the impact of the tax bill. The tax bill gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent by 2027 due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. We didn’t find any statements by Cordray weighing in on any specific proposal to replace the tax bill. We asked Cordray’s spokeswoman what he wants to see happen with federal tax policy and if he wants to raise or lower taxes for any particular group. "Rich wants to see a federal tax plan in place that doesn’t hurt middle class families," his campaign spokeswoman Lacey Rose said. If Congress later changes the federal tax law, it could raise taxes on some people -- but it could also lower taxes on others. And even if such a bill were to gain traction, as a governor Cordray would have no say. Cordray’s statements on state taxes DeWine’s video focuses on federal taxes, but we will briefly note Cordray’s position on state taxes because that is something in the power of a governor. We found that Cordray has been critical of state tax cuts and has called for certain tax incentives for businesses, but has been vague on the details. The clearest example we found in which he opposed tax increases was a May article by the Dayton Daily News which paraphrased Cordray saying he didn’t see a need for tax increases. Cordray said he wanted to prioritize state spending, including less for failing charter schools and more for local government to deal with the opioid crisis. He has criticized state tax cuts because that has trickled down to local governments facing choices about whether to raise their own taxes. At a gathering of union leaders and local government workers in April, Cordray slammed Republicans’ "mania" for cutting taxes. He vowed that as governor, "if the legislature continues down its current path of tax and budget cuts, there will be vetoes." Our ruling DeWine said that "Richard Cordray wants to raise your taxes by reversing President Trump's tax reform." While Cordray has repeatedly bashed the federal tax bill, DeWine ignores that the bill didn’t cut everyone’s taxes, particularly in future years, and that repealing the bill, which could include a replacement, could end up cutting taxes for some families. While Cordray has made it clear that he criticizes the bill for helping the rich, he hasn’t laid out any specific suggestion for changing the federal tax law. Perhaps more importantly, if Cordray wins the governorship, he would not have a vote on federal tax policy. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-04797	"I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/22/tammy-baldwin/wisconsin-rep-tammy-baldwin-dem-us-senate-candidat/	As the primary election for an open Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat approached, most TV ads were aired by Tommy Thompson and the three candidates he defeated for the Republican nomination. But U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison, who won the Democratic nomination without opposition, didn’t sit out completely. Eyeing the fall campaign, Baldwin released an ad July 30, 2012 that, she said, highlights her efforts to strengthen Wisconsin manufacturing. "Coast Guard cutters: built in America, but powered by engines manufactured overseas, even though you can’t buy a better engine than the ones made right here in Wisconsin," Baldwin declared. "That’s why I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies." As she spoke, a message on the screen said: "Tammy Baldwin sponsored BUY American bill." We don’t recall any major political battles over Coast Guard engines during Baldwin’s nearly 14 years in Congress. But by saying "I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy" Wisconsin-made engines, Baldwin suggests she was successful in her fight and that such a requirement is in place. Moreover, the "sponsored a buy American bill" message suggests the fight she led affected more than just Wisconsin manufacturers. Let’s see what happened. Baldwin’s engine amendments We didn’t find any news stories in the Nexis database about any congressional battles over Coast Guard engines, but Baldwin did introduce amendments on the matter three different times. Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited those amendments as evidence to back her claim. June 2003: The amendment would have prohibited buying new Coast Guard cutters unless their engines were made in the United States "by a domestically operated entity." Kraus said that would have ruled out engines provided by Detroit Diesel, which was owned by German-based Daimler-Chrysler, "leaving only one possible source for diesel engines: Wisconsin-based Fairbanks Morse." Fairbanks Morse Engine is in Beloit, in Baldwin’s district. So, Baldwin’s first amendment focused on getting more business for one Wisconsin company, not American manufacturers generally. No vote was taken on Baldwin’s amendment, a Library of Congress record shows. It was ruled out of order because it proposed "to change existing law and constituted legislation in an appropriations bill." November 2003: Baldwin introduced a slightly different amendment. It would have required that engines purchased for the Coast Guard’s new fleet of ships be made in America, according to a transcript of House proceedings. Kraus pointed out that this amendment didn’t prohibit engines being made in the U.S. by a foreign-operated company. . (Interestingly, we found that Baldwin introduced this amendment with U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R.-Wis., the running mate of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Ryan argued that many defense contracts had made-in-America requirements, which he said help national security by ensuring that needed goods are available in the U.S.) The amendment was rejected on a voice vote. June 2011: Baldwin’s third amendment used language similar to the first. And like the first amendment, it was ruled out of order and didn’t come up for a vote. We asked Kraus about the message on the screen in the ad -- which said Baldwin sponsored a "BUY American bill" -- since that sounded like it might be a separate legislation, not merely an amendment. There have been various bills requiring the purchase of American-made goods over the years. But Kraus said the message on the screen was merely another reference to the three amendments that Baldwin introduced. Our rating Baldwin said: "I led the fight to require the Coast Guard to buy their engines from us, not foreign companies." Although there isn’t evidence of much of a fight, her statement contains an element of truth in that she introduced three amendments aimed at benefiting a Wisconsin manufacturer. But the ad is misleading in suggesting that her fight was successful, when none of the measures she introduced became law. What’s more, it suggests it was part of a broader "Buy American" push, not measures aimed at helping a company in her district. We rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-06106	Says he has "been able to attract independents and Democrats to win" elections in Pennsylvania.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/03/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-hes-won-votes-democrats-indepen/	One of the attributes Rick Santorum often cites on the campaign trail is that he won repeatedly in Pennsylvania -- a state that has voted Democratic for president in every election since 1992. Santorum -- a former two-term Republican senator from Pennsylvania -- has made this argument to counter the contention that his strong social conservatism makes him less electable in a general election than former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. During a Dec. 29, 2011, interview on NBC’s Today, Savannah Guthrie asked Santorum, "Should Republicans … today be concerned about this issue of electability should you be the nominee against Barack Obama?" Here’s Santorum’s full response: "Absolutely they should be concerned about the electability. I'm the only one in this race that has a track record of winning elections in tough states. I had a million more registered Democrats than Republicans. And in two statewide elections, you know, running against very strong candidates, I was able to win the state of Pennsylvania, something a Republican hasn't done for president since 1988. "And so if you look at everybody else in the field, no one has ever run as a conservative and been able to attract independents and Democrats to win. I have. And I think that's one of the reasons the people in Iowa are looking us. They say, ‘Wow, this guy's defeated, you know, straight up two Democratic incumbents to win his House seat and -- and Senate seat in very tough districts and in a very tough state.’" There’s a lot to look at here. Let’s go race by race. House elections In 1990, Santorum, a 32-year-old lawyer, challenged seven-term Democratic incumbent Doug Walgren. "Santorum knocked on 25,000 doors, amassed an army of volunteers including many right-to-lifers, attacked Walgren for voting for a pay raise seven times and for living in the Washington suburbs," according to the Almanac of American Politics. Despite being outspent, $717,000 to $251,000, Santorum won, 51 percent to 49 percent. This district leaned Democratic, but after the 1990 Census, redistricting made it even more so. Yet Santorum won his 1992 re-election bid easily, defeating a Democratic state senator, 61 to 38 percent. It’s worth noting that in this district -- and much of western Pennsylvania -- there are lots of voters who register as Democrats but who are substantially more conservative than the party label would suggest. Many are ethnic and blue-collar Democrats who are socially conservative, particularly on abortion. So as a Catholic politician staunchly opposed to abortion, Santorum was well positioned to win support from voters who were traditionally Democratic but whose leanings on social issues more closely mirrored those of the GOP. "Those voters may be Democrats, but they are conservative, anti-communist (this still mattered in the 1980s and early 1990s), Catholic, pro-life, pro-gun, pro-manufacturing, and not-so pro-environment. Santorum fit perfectly," said David Patti, who heads the Pennsylvania Business Council and who worked in the Ronald Reagan campaign in Pittsburgh in 1984 So Santorum’s claim needs a bit of an asterisk. Still, he has a point. Under the district lines first used in 1992, Democratic candidates for president won easily -- Bill Clinton won, 52 to 39 percent, in 1996, and Al Gore won, 57 to 41 percent, in 2000. Clearly, then, lots of voters in the district were comfortable voting for Santorum, Clinton and Gore. 1994 Senate race In 1994, Santorum challenged liberal Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford, who had been elected in a 1991 special election. In 1991, Wofford -- running against a popular former Republican governor, Richard Thornburgh -- had won 61 percent of the vote in metropolitan Pittsburgh. But against Santorum, who hailed from the area, Wofford won metro Pittsburgh by only a 50 to 47 percent margin. This significant underperformance suggests that Santorum remained popular in his home region, which includes many Democrats. (Statewide, Santorum won narrowly, 49 to 47 percent.) Here, too, it’s worth noting an asterisk: 1994 was the year of a Republican congressional landslide. This may not have greatly helped Santorum’s standing among Democrats, but his anti-incumbent status probably boosted his appeal among independents. The best way to measure Santorum’s appeal for Democrats and independents in 1994 is through exit polls, in which pollsters gather data from voters exiting polling places on Election Day. However, when we contacted the main archive for exit polls -- the University of Connecticut’s Roper Center -- they told us that the statewide data was not in an easily usable form for 1994. 2000 Senate race Of Santorum’s three Senate races, 2000 is the only one conducted in what might be called a "neutral" political environment -- neither the Republican rout of 1994, nor the Democratic tsunami of 2006. In 2000, by contrast, the presidential race ended in a virtual tie. For this reason, it may be the best test of Santorum’s argument that he’s "been able to attract independents and Democrats." In 2000, Santorum’s strong conservatism initially made him look vulnerable for voters in a swing state. But in the general election, he faced Rep. Ron Klink, who had emerged from a multi-candidate Democratic primary with little money and not much of a statewide profile. Klink, like many western Pennsylvania Democrats, was anti-abortion and pro-gun, lessening his appeal for many fellow Democrats and making it hard for him to replenish his treasury. Ultimately, Santorum outspent Klink 3-to-1 and won a second term, 52 to 46 percent. Fortunately, the Roper Center does have a breakdown of the 2000 Pennsylvania exit poll. It shows that self-identified Democratic voters split their votes in the Senate race as follows: 80 percent for Klink, 18 percent for Santorum. Among self-identified independents, the breakdown was 55 percent for Santorum, 41 percent for Klink. So Santorum’s record of Democratic support in his home district and regionally largely didn’t carry over to the statewide Senate race of 2000. He lost Democrats statewide by a 4-to-1 margin. However, he has a point that he was able to win independent votes. Against Klink, he won a clear majority of independents in 2000. 2006 Senate race In 2006, Democrats were buoyed by voter fatigue with President George W. Bush. Santorum faced a strong candidate -- Robert Casey, a former Pennsylvania auditor general and state treasurer who was the son of a popular former governor. In fact, the incumbent was considered an underdog for most, if not all, of the campaign. In a year when the Democrats took over the House and Senate, Santorum was trounced, as Casey won, 59 to 41 percent. The exit polls found that Democrats backed Casey over Santorum, 93 percent to 7 percent. Even independents abandoned Santorum, backing Casey by a 72 to 28 percent margin. So whatever juice Santorum had among either group of voters essentially vanished in the Democratic wave election of 2006. Our ruling We come to a mixed verdict on Santorum’s claim that he has "been able to attract independents and Democrats to win" elections in Pennsylvania. Santorum can point to solid evidence that he won over Democrats and independents in his two House races and in his wave-aided 1994 Senate election. However, since many of the conservative Democrats, including those in his home district, have either left the Democratic Party or voted increasingly for Republicans over the last quarter century, it’s not clear how relevant this fact is in bolstering the case that Santorum can win votes from disaffected Obama Democrats in 2012. Meanwhile, Santorum lost badly statewide among Democrats in 2000 and 2006, and while he won independents in 2000, he lost them by a large margin in the Democratic wave of 2006. If anything, the general trend is that Santorum has done less well among Democrats and independents over time, and as he’s run for bigger political offices. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-01-03T17:51:09	2011-12-29	['Pennsylvania', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13587	"I am the only candidate who ran in either the Democratic or the Republican primary who said from the very beginning (that) I will not raise taxes on the middle class."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/17/hillary-clinton/clinton-repeats-wrong-claim-no-other-2016-candidat/	One of Hillary Clinton’s key campaign promises is that she won’t raise taxes on the middle class. In an Aug. 17 speech in Cleveland, the Democratic presidential nominee said, "I am the only candidate who ran in either the Democratic or the Republican primary who said from the very beginning (that) I will not raise taxes on the middle class." Clinton began making that promise last fall, saying she would not raise taxes on those earning less than $250,000 a year. Analysts have said her proposed tax plan would have minimal impact on middle-income Americans. However, Clinton is not the only candidate to make such a promise. In fact, we rated a similar claim by Clinton Pants on Fire in July. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Four Pinocchios, its lowest rating. We found that 13 of the 17 GOP candidates made promises last year that were far more encompassing than Clinton’s. They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone — including the middle class. Donald Trump was not one of these; more on this in a bit. Twelve of the GOP candidates signed no-tax pledges with Americans for Tax Reform, a fiscally conservative group founded by Grover Norquist. They promised to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses" and "any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." The 12 signers were Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Jim Gilmore,George Pataki and Rick Perry. A 13th GOP candidate, Mike Huckabee, signed a personal oath to oppose all tax increases. Two other Republican candidates had signed an Americans for Tax Reform’s no-tax pledge before last year: Lindsey Graham and Scott Walker. So contrary to Clinton’s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges — not just on the middle class but everyone. Who resisted? • Trump, the GOP nominee, who said last year he didn’t want to sign the Americans for Tax Reform pledge because he "may want to switch taxes around." • Jeb Bush, who said he objects to written pledges. We searched debate transcripts and a variety of websites for any specific promises by Trump or Bush to shield the middle class from tax hikes, but we came up empty. Trump did, though, say in an Aug. 9 speech that he wants tax reductions for the middle class. We made similar searches for the four Democrats who opposed Clinton during the primaries. While each of them spoke about the hardships facing the middle class, we found no evidence of them specifically promising to oppose tax increases on the middle class. For our July fact-check, we asked Clinton’s campaign for an explanation of her and got a generic response. "Hillary Clinton’s policies, including her pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, would build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top," Josh Schwerin, a campaign spokesman, replied in an email. For this fact-check, Schwerin did not expand on his previous statement except to point out that some analysts have said Trump’s tax plan would most benefit the wealthiest Americans. Our ruling Clinton said, "I am the only candidate who ran in either the Democratic or the Republican primary who said from the very beginning (that) I will not raise taxes on the middle class." Fifteen of the 17 Republican presidential candidates signed pledges not to raise taxes on anyone, which includes the middle class. Thirteen of those candidates signed the vow last year; the other two inked such a pledge earlier in their careers. Trump wasn’t one of them, but Clinton specifically mentioned the primary field. And that makes the claim both inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate this claim, again, Pants on Fire.

pomt-11716	Missouri is one of "13 states this year have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state."	false	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/15/donald-trump/trump-misses-mark-missouri-unemployment-rate/	When President Donald Trump traveled to Missouri last month to promote tax cuts, he also touted the state’s low unemployment. "Thirteen states this year have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state. And I hate to tell you, but Missouri happens to be one of them," he told a crowd in St. Charles on Nov. 29, 12 days after the October preliminary unemployment rates were released. So is it true that Missouri is one of "13 states this year (that) have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state"? We decided to find out. Missouri unemployment The White House didn’t respond to a request for evidence, so we don’t know how they got their numbers. But the usual way of looking at this question is to use data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official tabulator of employment statistics. The bureau compiles the seasonally adjusted highs and lows for states, which can be found on its website. It lists 13 states that have hit historic lows this year. Not included: Missouri. We looked at seasonally adjusted data, which is the way economists prefer to compare numbers in various months of the year. For example, during the holidays, there’s typically a bump in temporary or seasonal workers. So if employment grows by 2 percent every November due to seasonal workers, seasonal adjustment takes that 2 percent out of the equation. The seasonally adjusted preliminary unemployment rate for October is 3.5 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The historic low was from October 1999 through January 2000 when the unemployment rate was 3.1. Our Ruling In a visit to St. Charles, Trump said that Missouri is one of "13 states this year have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state." In fact, the state’s lowest unemployment rate on record occurred in 1999 and 2000. We rate this statement False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-12-15T10:37:11	2017-11-29	['None']
pomt-00582	"In the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. As a matter of fact, without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jun/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-gained-15-million-jobs-over-/	Addressing supporters in an airport hangar in Addison, Perry said that on his watch, companies in Texas created almost one third of all new American jobs. And, he said, "in the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. As a matter of fact, without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs." Sounded familiar. In May 2013, we found True a Perry claim about Texas accounting for 33 percent of the country’s net new jobs over the last 10 years. That conclusion was supported by comparing state-by-state job gain estimates and a separate calculation of net job gains nationally, both by the federal government. Later, in January 2015, we rated Mostly True Perry’s statement that starting in December 2007, "1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs." His figures mostly held up according to household surveys by the federal government looking into civilian employment including self-employment, though at the time positions not yet recovered outside Texas totaled closer to 350,000, according to the latest available data when Perry spoke to lawmakers Jan. 22, 2015. When we looked at the earlier Texas-nation comparison by Perry, his spokesman encouraged us to consult Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint. Professor Perry wrote in a November 2014 online commentary that from December 2007, the start of the national recession, through October 2014, Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs. "In contrast," he wrote, "civilian employment in the other 49 states without Texas is still 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level … there were 134.9 million non-Texas jobs in October vs. 135.26 million in December 2007." To our query, the scholar emailed a chart showing that based on what the government calls "total employment," covering all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007 while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs. Total employment, he said, serves as a comprehensive indicator and is used to calculate unemployment rates. A little more: The BLS says the definition of employment in the federal household survey, which the governor relied on for his comparisons, "comprises wage and salary workers (including domestics and other private household workers), self-employed persons and unpaid workers who worked 15 hours or more during the reference week in family-operated enterprises. Employment in both agricultural and nonagricultural industries is included." In contrast, the federal government's oft-quoted payroll survey of employers "covers only wage and salary employees on the payrolls of nonfarm establishments." By this other metric, Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the bureau, told us, Texas netted 1.2 million additional jobs from December 2007 to December 2014. In the period, she said, 24 states had net decreases in total civilian employment. But again, those figures weren’t total employment, the indicator chosen by Perry. After Perry declared for president, we circled back to Abbot, who emailed us data indicating that from December 2007 to December 2014, Texas saw an increase in total employment of 1,572,694; the nation as a whole had a surge of 1,169,000. Put another way, but for Texas, the nation would have experienced a total employment decrease of 403,694. When we looked into Perry’s seven-year contrast before, analyst David Cooper of the liberal Economic Policy Institute commented that the timeframe singled out by Perry may deliver a more glowing contrast for Texas than other periods. According to the government’s payroll surveys, he said, the country had added 9.1 million jobs since June 2009, the acknowledged end of the national recession, with Texas accounting for 1.5 million of the additions. Significantly, he said, the rest of the country as a whole lost jobs from June 2009 until February 2010. Since then, he said, the U.S. had added more than 10 million jobs with Texas (again) accounting for more than 1 million of them. At the time, Professor Perry said that in his view, the best comparison of Texas to the rest of the nation starts in December 2007. His point: "Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, while the rest of the country did," he emailed. "Therefore, comparing job gains since June 2009 or Feb. 2010 really won’t make much sense. Of course the non-Texas US gained a lot of jobs since June 2009, and more than Texas, but that’s because Texas never lost any (very many) jobs in 2008 and 2009 like the rest of the country. Texas is a great economic success story, and an anomaly vs. the rest of the country regarding job losses/gains," he wrote. Also at the time, Abbot said by email Perry’s claim could have been precise by referring to "total civilian employment" rather than jobs. That said, as of November 2014, Abbot said, 24 other states had yet to reach pre-recession employment levels. "On a statewide basis, Texas by far leads all states, with total civilian employment growth of 1,410,440. California is a distant second with civilian (household) employment growth of 452,763," Abbot wrote. Our ruling Perry said: "In the last seven years of my tenure, Texas created 1.5 million new jobs. As a matter of fact, without Texas, America would have lost 400,000 jobs." These figures hold up though Perry cherry-picked a time period arguably giving Texas more of a gloss than it might get with other periods. More generally, no governor determines job gains or losses in a state; outside factors tend to prevail. In Texas, the fracking boom comes to mind. Governors don’t create oil and gas fields. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. CORRECTION, 12:40 p.m., June 18, 2015: This fact check was revised to correct our error in quoting an email from Cheryl Abbot of the BLS. This change, clarifying that 24 states had net decreases in civilian employment in the period singled out by Perry, did not affect our rating.

pomt-11704	"We essentially repealed Obamacare because we got rid of the individual mandate ... and that was a primary source of funding of Obamacare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/21/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-says-end-mandate-essentially-obamaca/	In the middle of celebrating passage of a $1.5 trillion tax cut, President Donald Trump pivoted to what the bill did for another one of his major goals. "We essentially repealed Obamacare because we got rid of the individual mandate, which was terrible," Trump said. "And that was a primary source of funding of Obamacare." During the campaign, Trump promised to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. While full-blown repeal eluded him and Republicans in 2017, a relatively late addition to the tax bill did hand him a partial victory. The individual mandate fines people who might be able to afford health insurance but choose not to buy it. The maximum penalty is the higher of 2.5 percent of income or a fine based on the number of adults and kids in the household. The new tax measure reduces the fine to zero. The question is, how far does ending the penalty go toward repealing the Affordable Care Act? And did revenues from the fines represent a primary source of money for the program? The money part is simple. In 2016, about 6.5 million households paid $3 billion in penalties. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers for Congress, reported that in 2017, government costs for the Affordable Care Act totalled nearly $120 billion. The penalties would cover less than 3 percent of that. Other revenue sources are more significant, including taxes on wealthy households -- about $16 billion, and health insurance companies -- about $12 billion. So Trump was wrong when he called the penalty money a primary source of funding. Impact on the entire Affordable Care Act The experts we reached generally agreed that repealing the mandate would undermine the health care law, but key elements would remain intact. In broad strokes, without the penalty, fewer healthy people will buy insurance, which will make it more expensive to cover the people who do. (Reminder: This mainly affects the individual insurance market, which amounts to about 7 percent of all the people covered in the country.) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the mandate would drive up premiums by 10 percent. This would price some people out of the market, and turn away others who might have been ready to buy a plan if it were cheaper. After 10 years, 13 million fewer people would be insured. But even the CBO stressed how mushy any prediction is, noting that the actual impacts "would probably be smaller than the numbers reported in this document." Medicaid expansion The single-greatest coverage gains under the Affordable Care Act came through expanding Medicaid to all low-income adults. Overall, about 20 million people became insured. Of that, the CBO says Medicaid expansion reached 13 million people at a cost of about $70 billion in 2017. Even though Medicaid coverage is either free or very low-cost, eliminating the mandate would have some effect on the growth of that group. The CBO said that in 2027, about 5 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid than the government analysts would otherwise expect. The logic is that fear of the mandate leads people to apply for insurance, at which point they discover they are eligible for Medicaid coverage. Without the stick of the mandate, they wouldn’t have applied. Whatever the scale of that effect, Medicaid expansion remains intact. Effect on the individual insurance market Studies point in both directions on the impact that the mandate alone has on the individual market. When an earlier and similar law took effect in Massachusetts, enrollment jumped among healthy people. On the other hand, research based on the first few years of the national law through 2015 concluded that "the individual mandate’s exemptions and penalties had little impact on coverage rates." The big drivers were the hefty premium subsidies for private insurance and the expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care data, said his sense is that at the end of the day, the change "will hobble the ACA, but not kill it." "The heart of the ACA – the premium subsidies, the Medicaid expansion, and protections for pre-existing conditions – remain in place," he said. "The premium subsidies should provide enough of an incentive for many healthy people to get coverage to keep the individual market reasonably stable." The law provides substantial assistance to keep premiums affordable for people with low incomes (specifically, those making less than 400 percent of federal poverty). Those households represent most of the plans sold through the government’s health insurance exchanges. In 2017, about 8.7 million people benefited. When premiums rise, the subsidies insulate households from most of the impact. Assuming the end of the penalty pushes premiums up, Levitt said the people who will take the hit are those who make over 400 percent of federal poverty (about $98,000 per year for a family of four) and aren’t insulated from increases by the subsidies. That puts about 6.7 million people at risk. That’s a lot of people, even if it’s only about 2 percent of the total population. We reached out to other health care policy experts. Christine Eibner at the RAND Corporation emphasized that the effect of repeal is "highly uncertain." Still, she told us that "on balance, I think the evidence suggests that the mandate is having some impact on enrollment, but it may be small relative to other factors such as the tax credits and subsidies." "We don’t really know what the impact will be," said Martin Gaynor, economist at Carnegie Mellon University. But he went on to warn that "if the mandate is important, then eliminating it will create big problems in the exchange marketplaces, which would likely prove difficult to reverse." Our ruling Trump said that repealing the individual mandate essentially repealed Obamacare and eliminated a primary source of funding for the program. Eliminating the mandate does undercut the Affordable Care Act, but it hardly repeals it. In reality, the major pieces of the Affordable Care Act remain in place. On the money side, the penalties represent less than 3 percent of the cost of the program, and other taxes directly tied to paying for Obamacare are four and five times larger. Overall, this change will be disruptive, but not terminal. It certainly does not "essentially repeal" Obamacare. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-13692	Says Indiana Gov. Mike Pence "denies that there's such a thing as evolution."	half-true	/california/statements/2016/jul/29/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-makes-true-claim-mike-pence-denies-evo/	EDITOR'S NOTE: On July 28, 2016, PolitiFact California rated as True a statement by Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown that Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence "denies that there's such a thing as evolution." We based that ruling on Pence’s comments in a 2009 MSNBC interview. Subsequently, our readers made some good points that led us to reconsider the fact check. They pointed out that Pence never explicitly denies evolution in the interview. Instead, Pence dodges the question multiple times. With his past skepticism of science, this gives the impression that Pence rejects evolution. Taking all of this into account, we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis. California Gov. Jerry Brown came out swinging against Republicans Donald Trump and Mike Pence in his speech at the Democratic National Convention. "Trump says global warming is a hoax. I say Trump is a fraud," Brown, who has made climate change a top priority, said of the GOP presidential nominee. Last month, PolitiFact rated Mostly True a similar statement by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s ‘hoax’ claim. But did Brown stretch the truth in his attack on Pence, the Indiana governor and GOP Vice Presidential candidate? Brown said of Pence: "... it’s not surprising that Trump chose as his running mate a man who denies that there's such a thing as evolution." Our research Asked about Brown’s claim, his spokeswoman pointed to Pence’s 2009 interview on MSNBC’s Hardball. The interview has been widely discussed in recent weeks with Trump’s selection of Pence. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is first asked about evolution at the 8:00 minute mark in this video. Chris Matthews, the show’s host, asked Pence in the interview: "Do you believe in evolution, sir?" Pence responded: "I embrace the view that God created the heavens and the earth and the seas and all that’s in them." Matthews continued: "But do you believe in evolution as the way he did it?" Pence replied: "The means, Chris, that he used to do that, I can’t say." Several minutes later, Pence responded similarly to the same question: "Chris, I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them. … How he did that, I’ll ask him about some day." Pence certainly dances around the topic, but nowhere does he outright deny evolution. Pence’s comments could be interpreted as rejecting evolution, but there’s no hard evidence to back up that idea. One could also say Pence’s comments place him in the category of theistic evolutionists, or those who believe religious teachings are compatible with evolution, said Rodney Duke, a professor of religion at Appalachian State University in North Carolina. "There are many Christians, including scientists, who will affirm that God is creator and yet accept -- or at least not deny -- that natural evolutionary means were used," Duke said in an email. "Therefore, although Pence's remarks were quite circumspect and he did not affirm evolutionary means, his careful wording did not reject them." Our research found no evidence Pence has publicly clarified his comments on evolution. Asked about Pence’s current view on the topic, his spokesman pointed to the same 2009 interview without elaborating. Evolution is not the only science-based process Pence has been circumspect about. He’s also been skeptical of climate change. And, on his campaign website in 2000, Pence challenged established health science, declaring: "Time for a quick reality check. Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’t kill." He went on to say "In fact, 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer. This is not to say that smoking is good for you…" Christian faith Pence has described himself as "a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order." He was raised Catholic. But, as the New York Times reported in July, "His evangelical Christianity is now the driving force behind his political agenda, whether he is working to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood or to make it legal for religious conservatives to refuse to serve gay couples." Though clear on some social issues, Pence has been reticent to state his specific beliefs on science. Asked, for example, whether he supports federal funding for stem cell research by Matthews in the 2009 interview, Pence responded: "I think in our schools we should teach all of the facts about all of these controversial areas, and let our students, let our children and our children’s children decide based upon the facts and the science." Pence takes a ‘have-it-both-ways,’ approach, declining to clarify his personal opinion on these scientific topics. But, again, that approach can’t be described as outright ‘denying’ evolution. Our ruling California Gov. Jerry Brown said GOP Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence "denies that there's such a thing as evolution." Pence, in a 2009 interview on MSNBC, said: "I embrace the view that God created the heavens and the earth and the seas and all that’s in them." When asked again and again whether he believes in evolution, he demures, stopping short of explicitly rejecting it. He clearly did not want to answer the question, which ends up sounding like a ‘No.’ Our research found no evidence that Pence has expanded on his less-than-clear view on evolution, leaving it open to interpretation. In more recent years, the Indiana governor has criticized other science-based initiatives, including efforts to slow climate change. Brown’s statement says Pence "denies" evolution. The Indiana governor certainly doesn’t affirm it. That’s not the same as denying it. We rate Brown’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-07667	"Just 400 Americans -- 400 -- have more wealth than half of all Americans combined."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/10/michael-moore/michael-moore-says-400-americans-have-more-wealth-/	Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore so admired the daily demonstrations against Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker that he traveled from New York to Madison for one on March 5, 2011. The liberal firebrand opened his speech by heaping praise on those fighting the Republican governor’s efforts to take collective bargaining powers from state and local government employees. But he put more firepower into bashing the nation’s rich. "Right now, this afternoon, just 400 Americans -- 400 -- have more wealth than half of all Americans combined," Moore avowed to tens of thousands of protesters. "Let me say that again. And please, someone in the mainstream media, just repeat this fact once; we’re not greedy, we’ll be happy to hear it just once. "Four hundred obscenely wealthy individuals, 400 little Mubaraks -- most of whom benefited in some way from the multi-trillion-dollar taxpayer bailout of 2008 -- now have more cash, stock and property than the assets of 155 million Americans combined." OK, we’ve repeated Moore’s declaration (including the reference to Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian president). Now let’s see if what he asserts -- that 400 Americans "have more wealth than half of all Americans combined" -- is true. Moore has made other staggering claims about the gap between the nation’s rich and poor. In Capitalism: A Love Story, his 2009 documentary, Moore said "the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined." He was awarded a Mostly True by our colleagues at PolitiFact National for that claim. For his Madison speech, Moore posted a version of the text on his website. It included a link to back up his statement about the 400 wealthiest Americans. The link was to a blog post by Dave Johnson, a fellow at the Commonweal Institute, a California organization that says it promotes a progressive agenda. Johnson wrote that in 2007, the combined net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans, as measured by Forbes magazine, was $1.5 trillion; and the combined net worth of the poorer 50 percent of American households was $1.6 trillion. Aside from using slightly different terminology than Moore did, Johnson’s numbers present two problems: They’re four years old. And they indicate that the poorer 50 percent of American households had a higher net worth than the 400 richest Americans. That’s the opposite of what Moore said in Madison. We were referred to another item on Moore’s website that was posted two days after the Madison speech. It cites more recent figures, for 2009. So, let’s start again. In that item, Moore correctly quoted Forbes, which said in a September 2009 article that the net worth of the nation’s 400 wealthiest Americans was $1.27 trillion. Forbes generates its list annually, using interviews, financial documents and other methods to tally their figures. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, with an estimated net worth of $50 billion, topped the 2009 list for the 16th consecutive year The second part of Moore’s claim -- that the net worth of half of all Americans is less than that of the Forbes 400 -- is more complicated. Moore cited a December 2010 Federal Reserve Board report that said the net worth for all U.S. households was $53.1 trillion in September 2009. That was the same month Forbes released its top 400 list. That’s a starting point -- $53.1 trillion is the net worth for everybody. Moore also cited a March 2010 "working paper" by Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University and Bard College. Wolff was a key source in Moore’s claim that was rated Mostly True by PolitiFact National. Wolff’s paper said that as of July 2009, the three lowest quintiles of U.S. households -- in other words, the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households -- possessed 2.3 percent of the nation’s total net worth. Moore then multiplied that 2.3 percent by the nation’s total net worth of $53.1 trillion and got $1.22 trillion. In other words, he was saying the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households had $1.22 trillion in net worth, which is less than the $1.27 trillion in net worth for the Forbes’ 400 wealthiest Americans. Of course, if the net worth of 60 percent of households is less than that of Forbes’ 400 wealthiest, the net worth of 50 percent of the households -- which is what Moore claimed -- would also be less. We contacted Wolff, who said he had reviewed Moore’s calculations. "As far as I can tell, they’re fine," he said. Three economists -- Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics, Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Daniel Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute -- agreed. We made one more check. Since Moore’s statistics were for 2009, we sought figures for 2010. The 2010 net worth of the Forbes 400 was $1.37 trillion, Forbes reported in September 2010. That same month, the total U.S. net worth was $54.9 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Board report cited by Moore. Wolff hasn’t updated his 2009 figures. So we used his 2.3 percent figure again, multiplied by the 2010 total net worth of $54.9 trillion, and found that the net worth of the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households was $1.26 trillion in 2010. That’s less than the 2010 net worth for the Forbes 400. How could it be that 400 people have more wealth than half of the more than 100 million U.S. households? Think of it this way. Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. Some people would still have a pretty healthy bottom line. But many -- including those who lost a job and their home in the recession -- have a negative net worth. So that drags down the total net worth for the poorer half of U.S. households that Moore cited. We also want to add one cautionary note, from Mitchell of the Cato Institute, about Moore’s methodology: The Federal Reserve uses hard numbers to calculate the net worth of all households, but Forbes uses assumptions and interviews along with hard numbers in estimating the net worth of the Forbes 400. There’s no way to know how the differences between the two affect the net worth numbers, but Moore used the data that are available and there’s no indication he "cherry-picked" figures for a desired result, Mitchell said. With that caveat, our assessment indicates that as of 2009, the net worth of the nation’s 400 wealthiest individuals exceeds the net worth of half of all American households. We rate Moore’s statement True.	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2011-03-10T16:16:25	2011-03-05	['United_States']
pomt-07709	Under Gov. Scott Walker’s proposals, "Money is being taken away from workers, and the tax breaks given to major corporations. "	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/04/progressive-change-campaign-committee/wisconsin-ad-says-workers-get-pay-take-major-corpo/	Democratic groups have released a TV ad saying that Republicans in Wisconsin are waging war on the middle class by taking money from workers and giving tax breaks to corporations. The ad features workers speaking directly into the camera. Two workers explain how much money will be taken out of their paychecks when they have to make additional payments to pension funds and for health insurance. One says it will cost his family $400 to $500 a month in lost income; another says she’ll lose $3,000 a year from her paycheck. "Money is being taken away from workers, and the tax breaks given to major corporations," says another worker in the ad. We decided to fact-check that claim. The ad is from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy for America. Both are liberal political advocacy groups; Democracy for America was founded by former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean. First, we’ll check whether money is being taken away from workers. Gov. Scott Walker has asked state employees to contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward pensions and pay at least 12 percent of their health insurance premiums. This means that workers’ overall compensation will be be lower. The estimates PolitiFact Wisconsin reviewed indicate that the changes will vary depending on each worker's particular circumstances, but that most workers would lose between 6.8 percent and 11 percent of their paychecks. So the claim that money is being taken away from workers is true. We should note here that union leaders in Wisconsin have said they would accept the reductions in pay. But they don’t want to accept Walker’s proposal to permanently curtail the unions’ collective bargaining rights. Next, we’ll check whether tax breaks are being "given to major corporations." We found Walker has already signed bills that cut taxes for corporations and other businesses, depending on the number of jobs they create. Walker signed a law on Jan. 31 that said that companies that relocate to Wisconsin will not have to pay corporate taxes for two years. The law stipulates that the company must move at least 51 percent of the workers on its payroll or at least those who account for $200,000 in wages. Walker also signed into law a bill that gives small tax breaks to companies that create jobs. Walker proposed additional tax breaks for business during the campaign for governor. PolitiFact Wisconsin documented those promises on PolitiFact’s Walk-O-Meter, a database of Walker’s campaign promises. That includes reducing taxes on employers and repealing the "combined reporting" requirement for business taxes, a measure that increased tax revenues and was approved in 2009. We’re ruling on the statement, "Money is being taken away from workers, and the tax breaks given to major corporations. " Money is indeed being taken away from workers who will see lower overall compensation, and particularly smaller paychecks. Also, companies that employ significant numbers of workers are getting tax breaks. But the tax breaks signed into law so far are linked to job creation, not simply whether the company is a major corporation or not. Tax breaks are being given to business in the midst of a budget crisis, though. So we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-07853	"I’m the only candidate for Milwaukee County executive that has voted against increasing government pensions."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/11/jeff-stone/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jeff-stone-sa/	For a scandal that destroyed the political careers of several top Milwaukee County politicians, the 2002 pension deal seems a surprising afterthought in the 2011 county executive campaign. Have voters forgotten about the whole mess overseen by F. Thomas Ament, who was driven from the county executive’s office by irate voters? State Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale) hopes not. He utters the P-word in a radio ad that debuted Feb. 7, 2011. The ad doesn’t mention the Ament scandal directly, but that’s clearly the background for the statement. "I’m the only candidate for Milwaukee County executive," Stone says in the spot, "that has voted against increasing government pensions." Is Stone right about his record and that of the four other candidates in the race? The five are hoping to replace Scott Walker, who was elected governor in November 2010. The primary election is Feb. 15, 2011. Let’s start with Stone. Stone’s ad can’t be talking about the county pension enhancements. He is a former Greenfield alderman and a current state lawmaker. He’s never served on the County Board. His campaign told us he referred to a 1999 vote in the Legislature on pension sweeteners for nearly 350,000 public employees covered by the Wisconsin Retirement System. That deal, which estimates at the time said boosted pensions by an average of 10 percent, covered most state and local government workers in Wisconsin, excluding Milwaukee city and county workers who are part of separate pension systems. Stone did vote against the 1999 state pension package. He joined 18 other Republicans (including Walker), and one Democrat, in voting against the enhancements, which passed the Assembly with bipartisan support, 79-20. Stone told us the sweeteners were too costly and state pensions already were generous enough. However, he has not attempted to waive the benefits for himself; he says the process for doing so is unclear and complicated. Stone’s radio ad touched on all the candidates, though, not just his vote. To our ears, it can be heard two ways. One: A subtle suggestion that his opponents have cast votes in favor of pension hikes or otherwise favor bigger pensions. Two: Simply underscoring that only Stone faced a tough decision and came down against pension enhancements. He told us he meant the latter. "It’s what separates me," Stone said. "It implies they never had the responsibility of making those kinds of decisions" or voted in favor of increases. One of Stone’s rivals, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway, did face a similar decision. Holloway was a member of the County Board when the sweeping, Ament-sponsored pension deal came before supervisors in 2000 and 2001. Holloway voted to approve the Ament deal, which passed easily. In the midst of the scandal, he survived a recall election. He later waived any personal gain from the benefits. Holloway points out that he has subsequently voted to cut various pension benefits, increase the retirement age and require employees to contribute 2 percent of their salaries into the pension fund. As for Stone’s two other main rivals, they have not had an opportunity to vote yes or no on pension improvements. Jim Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator, took state office years after the vote Stone cites. We could find no pension enhancement votes during Sullivan’s tenure as a public official, including time on the Wauwatosa Common Council. Sullivan could not recall any either. Asked recently about his view of the Ament deal, Sullivan said: "The 2002 pension deal was irresponsible and wrong. The people of Milwaukee County deserve better than bloated pensions for bureaucrats and elected officials. As county executive, I will never allow a deal of this sort to occur." A footnote: Sullivan has accepted campaign donations from Ament, as the Journal Sentinel reported. Another candidate for exec, philanthropist Chris Abele, is making his first bid for public office. So he has not had a chance to vote on anything. Abele did, however, co-author a 2006 report on the county’s finances in the wake of the pension scandal. He acted in his role as a civic activist and donor, working on a panel set up by the Greater Milwaukee Committee. That report bemoaned "a series of irresponsible pension benefit increases (that) quickly turned a modest pension surplus into a huge pension liability." It called for changes in health care and pension benefits to help reduce the county’s massive unfunded liabilities. The fifth candidate, paralegal Ieshuh Griffin, has not held public office before. Let’s wrap up. Stone claims that he alone voted against pension increases. Some may argue by making a comparison to rival candidates who have never been in a position to cast votes, he adds a slightly misleading touch to the claim. But the context of it is Stone reciting the virtues of his own resume, not attacking others for shortcomings on theirs. We rate the statement True.

pomt-15139	Says he "turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare," but because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history "everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/02/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-covered-everyone-poverty-medi/	Presenting his alternative to the Affordable Care Act, Gov. Scott Walker bragged that even as he refused federal money under the law to expand Medicaid, he made historic progress in insuring Wisconsin's poor. "I turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. And I got to tell you, that was kind of tough in a blue state like Wisconsin. There were even some Republicans that wanted us to grab the money," Walker said Aug. 18, 2015, in a presidential campaign speech in Minnesota. "But we turned it down because we knew how difficult it would be to repeal Obamacare -- and put patients and families back in charge of their own health care decisions -- if states were adding to it, were expanding underneath it. "In my state," Walker continued, "even without taking that expansion, we showed that we could get results. I’m proud to say the state of Wisconsin, for the first time in our history -- first time in our history -- everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid." As we'll see, everyone in Wisconsin who is living in poverty -- at least, based on the federal poverty level -- is now covered by Medicaid. But Walker accomplished that by taking advantage of another provision of Obamacare -- pushing less-poor people off of Medicaid and into the marketplace that was set up under the law, albeit with subsidies to buy coverage. Moreover, his move meant Wisconsin has passed up more than $550 million in federal money, putting an additional burden on Wisconsin taxpayers. Turning down federal funds Walker’s Obamacare alternative was his first major policy initiative as a presidential candidate. It was criticized by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a fellow GOP contender for the White House, as offering a "new entitlement" for every American. We rated that claim Half True. Walker’s plan offers an entitlement -- tax credits to help people who aren’t offered coverage by an employer. But the credits aren’t exactly new, and they’re not available to everyone. The main intent of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, meanwhile, was to expand coverage to the uninsured in two ways: through tax credits similar to those in Walker’s plan to help moderate-income people buy insurance in the marketplace; and by expanding Medicaid for low-income people, including those with incomes somewhat above the federal poverty level. That Medicaid expansion is what Walker references in his claim about insuring Wisconsin’s poor. The Obamacare Medicaid expansion Medicaid provides health coverage to some 72 million Americans, including 1 million people in Wisconsin. Low-income adults, as well as children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities, are eligible. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government, but is administered by the states. Under Obamacare, the federal government agreed to pay 100 percent of the Medicaid expansion cost for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2012, however, said states could opt out of the expansion -- and 19 states, including Wisconsin, have done so, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. When he announced in February 2013 that Wisconsin would reject the Obamacare expansion, Walker explained his decision in part by contending that the nation's growing debt would prevent the government from paying for the expansion in the future. Indeed, a year later he claimed that "federal government reneging" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin had caused about $240 million in extra costs in the 2013-’15 state budget. We rated that claim False. Typical state-federal cost-sharing fluctuations -- not any reversal on a commitment by Washington -- led to higher costs for Wisconsin. So, what did Walker do instead of accepting the extra Obamacare money to expand Medicaid eligibility? Walker’s alternative As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, Walker became the only governor in the country who used the Affordable Care Act to expand access to health insurance while turning down the additional federal dollars available to pay for it. Most of Walker’s fellow Republican governors opted not to expand their Medicaid programs through the law, thereby creating a "coverage gap" -- some 4 million people nationwide with incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the lower limit for premium tax credits to buy insurance in the marketplace. Despite rejecting the federal money, Walker still expanded Wisconsin's Medicaid program, and 145,000 people have gained coverage as a result. Wisconsin is the only state, according to Kaiser, without a so-called coverage gap. Now, childless adults with an income below the federal poverty level — $11,770 — are eligible for BadgerCare Plus, the state's largest Medicaid program. But adults with incomes above the federal poverty level -- including an estimated 57,000 previously covered by BadgerCare Plus -- are no longer eligible for Medicaid. They can buy subsidized private health insurance in the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act. It’s important to note that the federal poverty level is a benchmark. Arguably, few people would contend that someone with an income of $11,770 a year was living in poverty, while someone with an income slightly above that was not. Moreover, Walker’s expansion comes with a higher cost to state taxpayers. The left-leaning Urban Institute estimates that accepting the federal Obamacare dollars to expand Medicaid would have saved $2.5 billion in state dollars from 2015 through 2024. To put it another way, Wisconsin would spend 5 percent less on Medicaid, or an average of $250 million less per year. Our rating Walker said he "turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare," but because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history "everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid." Under changes made by Walker, everyone in Wisconsin with an annual income at the federal poverty level ($11,770 for a single person) is now eligible for Medicaid. That is the first time in Wisconsin that everyone at or below the federal poverty level is eligible for Medicaid. But it's important to note that, while Walker rejected the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid, he used another provision of Obamacare to move less poor people off of Medicaid and into the marketplace created by Obamacare. And Wisconsin has already passed up more than $550 million in federal money, putting an additional burden on state taxpayers. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-14719	Forty percent of illegal immigrants are "people coming legally on visas and overstaying their visas."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/dec/28/ted-cruz/cruz-says-40-percent-illegal-immigrants-have-overs/	Although building a wall on the Mexican border gets most of the headlines, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says other steps also must be taken to keep illegal immigrants from settling in the United States. "Forty percent of illegal immigration doesn’t come across the border; it’s people coming legally on visas and overstaying their visas," the presidential candidate said during a recent interview on "The John Fredericks Show," broadcast from Portsmouth. Cruz pledged to develop a program to record and store biometric information on visas to help track the entry and departure of visitors to the United States. Biometrics refer to characteristics such as fingerprints, eye recognition and DNA. We decided to examine Cruz’s statement that 40 percent of illegal immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas - a claim often cited by Republicans. Two of Cruz’s rivals for the GOP nomination, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also have mentioned the statistic this year. When we asked Cruz’s campaign for the source of the statistic, a spokesman referred us to PolitiFact Texas’ 2013 fact-check of a similar statement made by U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Texas. Carter’s statement was based on a 2006 report by the Pew Research Center that estimated "nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials." While the source data gave an estimate that ranged from 33 percent to 50 percent, the report went middle-of-the-road and called it 45 percent. Pew relied on a 1997 study by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS report concluded that in 1996, 41 percent of illegal immigrants had entered the United States legally. The problem is that neither the INS nor its successor, the Department of Homeland Security, have provided updated statistics on overstayed visas since that aging study. Subsequent estimates have been based on taking that core 1996 data and adapting it to current trends. In 2003, the INS reprocessed the data and estimated that 33 percent of the illegal immigrant population in the nation in 2000 had overstayed their visas. A 2004 report from the General Accounting Office, based on 2000 data, gave estimates on visa overstays ranging from 27 percent to 57 percent. The GAO cautioned that its methodology in reaching the figures was "complex, indirect and marked by weaknesses." Robert Warren, a former INS demographer whose work was a part of that 1997 report, is among those who have published updated estimates based on the old data. Warren, now a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies, theorized in a 2014 study that because it has gotten harder in recent years to enter the U.S. through its southern borders, the percentage of illegal immigrants overstaying their visas has increased and in 2012 may have been 58 percent. But because there’s no new hard data, no one knows for sure. "They’re all ballpark estimates," said Marc Rosenblum, an analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. Our ruling Cruz said that 40 percent of illegal immigrants in the U.S. are "people coming legally on visas and overstaying their visas." This widely cited statistic is based is an estimate based on research going back to the 1990s. The federal government hasn’t provided updated statistics on overstayed visas, and subsequent research has focused on adapting the old data to new trends. Estimates in those reports have ranged from 27 percent to 58 percent of illegal immigrants overstaying their visas. So Cruz is using what research shows to be an acceptable middle figure. But he would be more accurate to refer to the 40 percent figure as an estimate rather than a fact. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06345	"If [Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed] wants to be like Bull Connor, then so be it."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/08/vincent-fort/were-atlantas-tactics-similar-bull-connor/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has spoken frequently about his goal of making this a city that is not too busy to love. But some say the mayor has been downright mean to Occupy Atlanta movement supporters, some of whom were recently arrested by Atlanta police for refusing to leave a city park. How mean? Some made comparisons between Reed, who is black, and one of the most infamous names from the civil rights era: Bull Connor. Eugene "Bull" Connor, the public safety commissioner of Birmingham during those days, became best known for brutal tactics such as siccing dogs on civil rights demonstrators and spraying water from fire hoses at them. When the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a prominent civil rights leader, was taken by ambulance from one protest in Birmingham, Connor lamented, "I wish they'd carried him away in a hearse." In Atlanta, the comparisons to Connor came fast when police arrested more than 50 Occupy Atlanta supporters late last month. One unidentified man carried a cardboard sign that read "Bull Connor Reed" as former Atlanta City Councilman Derrick Boazman, an Occupy Atlanta supporter, was being interviewed by reporters after protesters were released from the city jail. Boazman was quoted in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article as saying that the city’s police chief, George Turner, "sounds like Bull Connor." State Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, who is one of the most outspoken members of the Legislature, said of Reed -- whom Fort strongly supported in the 2009 mayor’s race -- "if he wants to be like Bull Connor, then so be it." We focused on Fort since he was the most prominent elected official we found who made such a comparison about a historical figure whose tactics were so universally reviled. In a telephone interview, the senator criticized us for fact-checking what he called a "rhetorical analogy." Still, Fort vigorously defended his comments, calling them "an appropriate analogy." "The core issue is the same," said Fort, who has taught history at Clark Atlanta University and joined the Occupy Atlanta protests. "An elected official using force to challenge people’s right to free speech." By force, Fort said he was referring to the arrests of the protesters. "[Reed] has violated people’s First Amendment rights and civil rights," the senator added, "and then taken credit for how well [the arrests] worked." Connor was a staunch segregationist who ordered water from fire hoses aimed at nonviolent demonstrators. Under his direction, the Birmingham police officers used violence against nonviolent demonstrators. Reed, on the other hand, has publicly agreed with some of the concerns of the Occupy Atlanta demonstrators. And Reed signed an executive order that allowed them to camp in the park, even though city laws prohibit it. Some critics have accused the mayor of being soft with the demonstrators. So were the mayor’s actions and tactics in removing Occupy Atlanta demonstrators from Woodruff Park comparable to what Connor did in the mid-1960s? Reed said he sympathized with the Occupy Atlanta movement’s concerns about economic inequality and the inordinate influence they say big banks and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans have over the nation’s legislative policies. The mayor signed two executive orders over the course of several weeks in October that let the demonstrators stay in the park, suspending rules prohibiting anyone from being there from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Reed later ordered police to remove demonstrators from the park, citing public safety concerns. Shortly after midnight on Oct. 26, more than 50 people were arrested. No fire hoses or police dogs were used. No injuries were reported. Last weekend, Atlanta police arrested about 20 Occupy Atlanta demonstrators. Some demonstrators claimed police used excessive force, saying in one case that a patrol officer on a motorcycle accelerated into a protester. Another Occupy Atlanta supporter told Channel 2 Action News that police grabbed her by her hair. David Garrow, a historian whose work on the civil rights movement earned him a Pulitzer Prize, said there were no similarities between the actions of Reed and Connor. He called comparisons to Connor "hilariously cheap rhetoric." "It’s the lowest level of ‘Yo Mammaing’ to insult another African-American in that way," Garrow said. "It’s name-calling and nothing else." Yo Mammaing as in: "Yo Mamma is so old, her memory is in black and white." Or, Yo Mamma is so mean to Occupy Atlanta protesters, she ... Never mind. John Giggie, who teaches a course on Southern African-American history at the University of Alabama, also did not find any similarities. "Connor practiced racial hatred that seemed absolutely absent in this incident," Giggie told us. "I think [Fort] is painting history with a very broad brush." Much of the anger toward the mayor from some Occupy Atlanta supporters is based in feelings of betrayal. Reed is mayor of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr’s hometown and has spoken reverently of the civil rights movement and its leaders. The comparison in actions between Reed and an infamous figure such as Connor was too extreme to the experts we interviewed. Our rating: Pants On Fire.

pomt-03856	Says Jennifer Horn, chairwoman of the N.H. Republican Party, owes $92,000 in back taxes.	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/mar/12/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-gop-chairman-horn-under-fire-unpaid-taxes/	Tax Day -- April 15 -- is still more than a month away, but taxes-- and who has been late to pay them--already have been a popular topic this political season. Initially, reports surfaced that Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster, a New Hampshire Democrat, owed nearly $11,000 in late property taxes on her home in Hopkinton and a vacation house in the White Mountains. (Kuster paid the delinquent bills soon after). And now state Democratic leaders are taking aim at Jennifer Horn, chairwoman of the state Republican Party, for her own tax troubles. "Jennifer Horn has embarrassed herself once again," Ray Buckley, chairman of the N.H. Democratic Party, said in a statement issued Tuesday, March 5, 2013. "I would ask her to check her math," Buckley said, regarding Horn’s criticism of Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan’s budget proposal. "But, with $92,000 due in back taxes, I can’t believe that would help." Since she took over as party chairwoman in January, Horn has been a vocal critic of Kuster and her late property taxes. "The time has come for Congresswoman Kuster to stop hiding from her constituents and offer an open and straightforward explanation about her long history of delinquent taxes," Horn said in a February statement. But to what extent does Horn have tax issues of her own? This sounds like a job for PolitiFact. In his claim, Buckley doesn’t specify which taxes Horn allegedly has failed to pay. So, we started by checking on her property taxes. Local records show Horn and her husband William are up to date on their property taxes on their Nashua, N.H. home, valued at $590,500, according to city assessment records. During her run to become the head of the state Republican Party, a copy of an IRS tax lien on Horn’s home surfaced amid questions about her ability to raise funds for the party. Horn acknowledged tax problems, but panned the criticism as personal attacks against her and her family. An IRS tax lien is on file at the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds, which maintains property records for the state’s southern tier. When the IRS issues a lien, it generates a public document intended to alert creditors that the government has a legal right to the property in question. The lien, filed July 20, 2011, shows unpaid balances of $30,541 in 2008 and $61,642 in 2009. Together, the $92,184 total matches Buckley’s claim. But, IRS officials are quick to note that tally does not necessarily reflect the most recent numbers. The federal tax documents don’t reflect any payments made since the lien was issued, according to Peggy Riley, an IRS spokeswoman, and the IRS does not release individual tax records beyond the lien, Riley said. "We file the lien, then we don’t do anything with it until it is totally paid off," she said. Reached for comment, Horn declined to say whether she has paid down the tax lien. But, she did address the difficulties her family has faced. "I have been honest about the struggles that my family faced after my husband lost his job, and we stepped up on our own to pay our obligations," Horn wrote in an email to The Telegraph. Our ruling: Federal tax documents, kept by the county registry of deeds, support Buckley’s claim that Horn owes $92,000 in back taxes -- or at least she did 20 months ago. The tax lien, issued by the IRS in July 2011, reflects the amount Horn and her husband owed at that time, but it does not consider any payments they may have made since then. The lien is still active, which means Horn still owes some amount, but because the IRS does not disclose more recent tax information, it is impossible to tell how much Horn owes at this time. With that in mind, we rate Buckley’s statement Mostly True.	None	New Hampshire Democratic Party	None	None	None	2013-03-12T13:07:56	2013-03-05	['None']
pomt-00567	A Republican budget proposal "would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/11/mike-tate/gop-plan-would-give-wisconsin-weakest-standards-us/	In one of his final public appearances as chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Mike Tate made an observation about the Republican-controlled Legislature and a broad claim about where GOP leaders are taking schools with the 2015-’17 state budget. "I think you’re beginning to see the beginning of the end of the overreach of the Republican majority in Madison," Tate said May 28, 2015 at a WisPolitics luncheon in Madison. Then he flatly stated: "Just yesterday, you saw slipped into the budget a provision that would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country." Let’s see if the changes -- which, as we’ll see, apply only to teachers in middle and high school -- would leave Wisconsin with the weakest teacher standards in the country. The budget The day before Tate’s remarks, there were news stories highlighting the Republicans’ proposal on teacher licensing. The proposal had actually been added to the budget eight days earlier, on May 20, 2015, when the Legislature's GOP-run Joint Finance Committee, in a 1:30 a.m. vote, inserted it along with other education provisions. The Legislature is aiming to adopt a budget and send it to GOP Gov. Scott Walker before the end of June 2015. Walker has not stated a position on the teacher proposal but does have the power to veto individual provisions out of the budget. GOP proposal As it stands now, public school teachers in Wisconsin must be licensed by the state Department of Public Instruction. A bachelor’s degree from an accredited university is one of the minimum requirements. Teachers must also pass state tests that assess their knowledge of a subject as well as their skills in teaching. Under the GOP proposal, the Department of Instruction would be required to issue teaching licenses to individuals who are deemed qualified by a local school board to teach in middle or high school (sixth through 12th grade), though the license would be good only for that school district. There would be two major changes under this alternative form of licensing. 1. Anyone with a bachelor’s degree -- in any subject, and from an accredited or non-accredited university -- could be licensed to teach the so-called core subjects of English, math, social studies or science. The only requirement would be that a school board would have to determine that the person is "proficient in the subject" and has "relevant experience" in the subject. Unlike the standard licensing system, the teacher would not have to pass any state tests to prove his or her subject knowledge or teaching knowledge. The National Council on Teacher Quality, an independent research group, and the Education Commission on the States said they did not know how many states have teacher standards like that one. 2. For non-core subjects -- such as health or foreign language -- no college degree, or even a high school diploma, would be required. Again, no state tests would be required, only that a school board determine that a person is "proficient in the subject" and has "relevant experience" in the subject. A memo on the GOP proposal from the Wisconsin Legislative Council, a nonpartisan research agency that serves the Legislature, says that every state requires a minimum of a bachelor's degree for all grades. The only exception is for technical education. In addition, a spokeswoman for the National Council on Teacher Quality told us it knows of no state that doesn't require at least a bachelor's degree. (The only evidence the Democratic Party cited to us to back Tate’s claim was an Associated Press news article saying Wisconsin may be the first state in the country to certify teachers who don't have bachelor's degrees.) The changes were proposed by state Rep. Mary Czaja, R-Irma. She told us she wants schools to be able to hire teachers who can "fill a niche" -- for example, hiring a nurse with a two-year degree to teach health, or a local mechanic to teach auto mechanics -- without having to hire a permanent teacher at a higher salary plus benefits. She said she trusts schools to hire people who are competent. Sungti Hsu, of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, said the Wisconsin changes would be significant. Across the country, requiring a bachelor’s degree to teach "is pretty much a minimum requirement," he said. It’s also important for teachers to be trained in both the subject they will teach and as teachers, Hsu said. "If Wisconsin changes their requirements," he said, referring to the Republican proposal, "I’m not sure about the weakest, but it certainly would be one of the lowest requirements." Our rating Tate declared that a Republican budget proposal "would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country." If the proposal becomes law, Wisconsin apparently would become the only state not to have a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for teaching some subjects, including health and foreign languages. But that applies only to sixth through 12th grades. And there isn’t evidence to show that Wisconsin’s teacher standards overall would be the weakest in the country.

pomt-03389	Says Ken Cuccinelli "attacked churches for helping the poor."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/jul/08/paul-begala/begala-says-cuccinelli-attacked-churches-helping-p/	"Terrifying," is how Democratic strategist Paul Begala describes the thought of Republican Ken Cuccinelli winning this year’s gubernatorial race. Begala sounded the alarm in a June 27 fundraising letter for the Democratic Governors Association, outlining Cuccinelli’s "extreme positions" against abortion, government entitlement programs and global warming research. This list was familiar until this eye-popper: "He attacked churches for helping the poor," Begala wrote of Cuccinelli. We asked Begala, a frequent CNN contributor, to prove his claim. He pointed to an article in The Virginian-Pilot about a Sept. 29, 2012, keynote address that Cuccinelli gave to the Cherish Life Ministries Christian Life Summit in Ashburn, Va. A video of Cuccinelli’s speech, posted along with the story, certainly shows the attorney general heaping criticism on Catholic church leaders. "One of my great frustrations as a Catholic, present company excepted, is how soft and weak the leadership of my church has been," Cuccinelli said. "They have for decades lobbied government to do this and to do that -- all of which should be done by the church if they’re done at all in society. And so over time they have made themselves out to be nothing but the largest special interest group in America." Begala, to support his statement that Cuccinelli "attacked churches for helping the poor," zeroed in on a comment the Republican made about Catholic bishops: "They’ve helped create a culture of dependency on government, not God," Cuccinelli said, lamenting that bishops were arguing churches "shouldn’t be the primary institution in a society that is responsible for service to the poor." But that statement doesn’t strike us as "an attack on churches for helping the poor." To the contrary, Cuccinelli was criticizing what he said was an effort by the church to hand off some of its charitable role to government. Cuccinelli stressed that point later in his speech: "Two most important things in human life -- your faith in God and, as between ourselves, love -- and government can do neither, can do neither one," he said. "And our churches are asking that institution -- and have for decades -- to step up and take on their role." Cuccinelli made a similar argument in his 2013 book, "The Last Line of Defense." "One reason the American people got stuck with Obamacare was due to a devolution in American thinking over time that it was the government’s job to provide health care for those who couldn’t afford it on their own," Cuccinelli wrote. "But taking care of the poor is ideally the province first of families, churches and charities, not the government." A final note: The Democratic Governors Association, for whom Begala wrote the fundraising letter, is the largest contributor to Cuccinelli’s opponent -- Democrat Terry McAuliffe. It donated $2 million to McAuliffe’s campaign on May 13, according to records compiled by Virginia Public Access Project. Our Ruling Begala said Cuccinelli "attacked churches for helping the poor," a statement that suggests the Republican opposes the charitable work done by religious organizations. But a full reading of Cuccinelli’s comments show he was saying the opposite: That charitable work should be the responsibility of religious organizations -- not the government.

pomt-15006	"While 38 percent of (firearms) dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/08/hillary-clinton/less-percent-noncompliant-gun-dealers-get-their-li/	Following the mass shooting at an Oregon community college that left nine dead, Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to tackle gun violence that includes expanding background checks, banning assault weapons, and going after negligent gun dealers and manufacturers. "Due to lobbying efforts by the NRA, these bad actors are granted unique protections in our laws, and the country’s law enforcement agencies often face barriers when attempting to hold them accountable," reads the plan released Oct. 5. "While 38 percent of (firearms) dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked." We were curious about her claim that less than a percent of firearms dealers found to be noncompliant had their licenses revoked by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, the agency tasked with overseeing gun sales. Clinton’s numbers are slightly off, but she’s right that it’s extremely rare for a noncompliant dealer to lose its license. Whether that means "bad actors" are getting away, however, remains up for debate. Not a straight shot to revocation Clinton’s spokesperson Josh Schwerin told us the campaign got its figures from a 2013 Justice Department audit of the ATF following the Sandy Hook shooting. According to the audit, the ATF found 62 percent of more than 10,000 inspected gun dealers did not violate firearms law in 2011. Clinton’s campaign took this to mean that 38 percent of dealers were noncompliant. But the actual figure is closer to 31 percent, because about 6 percent of gun dealers were categorized as "other" and an additional percent opted to give up their license. Out of the noncompliant dealers, only 71 had their licenses revoked. That’s 0.05 percent of all dealers active that year (over 120,000), but 0.68 percent of inspected dealers. Clearly, both are small numbers. Why do so few noncompliant dealers get their licenses revoked? For starters, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 stipulates that the ATF can only take away licenses when the dealer is "willfully" violating the law. So rather than revoking licenses automatically, ATF gives dealers chances to redeem themselves. If the ATF finds that a dealer has been noncompliant, it first issues a report of violations. More significant violations — for example, not properly logging gun acquisitions and gun sales — or repeated paperwork errors prompt a warning letter or a warning conference. In 2011, as with most years, 97 percent of noncompliant dealers agreed to make changes to become compliant. "There’s a difference between people having a hard time trying to do the right thing versus people who don’t have any interest in doing the right thing at all," said Suzanne Dabkowski, a public information officer and industry operations investigator at ATF’s field division in Columbus, Ohio. "Most people do seem to want to do it correctly." According to the ATF, it’s rare for a dealer to demonstrate a blatant disregard for the law — "willful" noncompliance. This can include serious violations like knowingly selling to straw buyers (someone buying a gun for someone else who wouldn’t be able to pass the background check) or minors or consistently ignoring ATF warnings, said Mike Bouchard, a former ATF assistant director for field operations. Only in those cases does the ATF recommend revocation, and a separate process kicks in. The recommendation first goes through ATF internal review, including legal consultation. If the recommendation is approved, the dealer can request a hearing and make the case that its violations were not willful. Should the ATF decide to press on, the dealer can take the case to the U.S District Court. With all this back and forth, revoking a license can take over two years, according to the Dept. of Justice audit. Meanwhile, dealers facing pending license loss can and do still sell firearms. Procedural pains or procedural justice In her gun plan, Clinton promised to increase ATF funding and "aggressively enforce current law" to weed out rogue dealers. It’s important to note license revocation requires an extremely high burden of proof, thanks to the "willful" violation requirement, according to Lindsay Nichols, senior attorney for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. For example, she said, if a dealer is selling guns without background checks, it could falsely claim that it just forgot to create the required record. Similarly, it would be very difficult for the ATF to prove that a dealer is abetting a straw purchase "unless there is video or audio footage," Nichols said. Gun dealers, however, contend that the inspections regime ensures due process. Many violations reported by the ATF are paperwork mistakes that don’t endanger the public (i.e. writing "Y" instead of "Yes"), said Larry Keane, the senior vice president of the firearms industry’s trade association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation. "The dealers have certain rights, and ATF has certain rights to shut them down if they’re bad apples," he said. "No one minimizes the paperwork violations. That still results in warning letters or more. ...The idea that dealers are selling guns to criminals willy nilly is just false." Many of the most common violations are indeed paperwork errors, but the list also includes not obtaining identification, not reporting multiple handgun sales, and selling guns to someone likely to be prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Here’s a snapshot: If bad dealers are getting away, said Bouchard, "it’s a resource issue." ATF’s staff size, 2,500 agents, hasn’t increased in four decades unlike other law enforcement agencies. To conduct all the inspections due in a year, the agency would need to increase its manpower by 45 percent, according to the Dept. of Justice. On top of that, by law, the ATF is not allowed to keep a centralized electronic database, and it must prioritize other duties (i.e. explosives inspections) over cyclical inspections of firearms dealers. As a result, 58 percent of dealers haven’t been inspected within five years, the legal requirement. In practice, visits actually come only once a decade, reports the Washington Post. "There are so few agents and inspectors to do all the work," said Bouchard. Our ruling Clinton said, "While 38 percent of dealers that were inspected in 2011 were noncompliant with federal law, only 0.05 percent of inspected dealers had their licenses revoked." The numbers are slightly off. About 30 percent of inspected dealers had violated firearms regulations in 2011, and about 0.7 percent of them had their licenses revoked. That’s because revocations are only allowed when the dealer is "willfully" violating the law, which some say is a huge legal obstacle. The inspections and revocations process gives noncompliant dealers the chance to demonstrate willingness to comply, and the vast majority say that they will. We rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-02803	Says Gov. Scott Walker has dropped Wisconsin "to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/01/mike-tate/scott-walker-responsible-wisconsins-low-and-droppi/	Two days before Gov. Scott Walker released his political memoir, Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate used a fund-raising email to highlight what’s not in the book. He claimed Walker is doing a number of things badly, including: "Failing at job creation and dropping Wisconsin to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state." The Nov. 17, 2013, solicitation cites a low ranking and pins the blame squarely on Walker. Is Tate right? Tate's evidence We asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff to flesh out the claim. She said Walker has been campaigning out of state for president since at least March 2013, when Walker told Politico at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he gave a speech, that he would be visiting Iowa in May 2013. Walker at the time (and since) acknowledged he was open to a presidential bid and he declined to pledge to serve a full four-year term if re-elected governor in 2014. Although Walker hasn’t declared himself a candidate for president, nor formed an exploratory committee, he has made many political trips across the country during 2013 and is increasingly mentioned as a potential GOP nominee, particularly since the release of his book. As for Wisconsin dropping to 45th in job growth prospects, Baldauff cited Forbes’ annual "best states for business" feature, published in September 2013. Wisconsin's projected annual job growth was put at 1.3% over the next five years. "The Badger State adopted the slogan of 'Open for Business' in 2011, erecting signs along the state border," Forbes said. "Results have been slow, but Wisconsin’s projected job growth has improved slightly, moving from No. 49 to No. 45 among the states." So, one study ranks Wisconsin 45th for future job prospects, as Tate stated. But contrary to what he claimed, the state’s ranking actually rose, albeit not by much. Other rankings A May 2013 report from the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council ranked Wisconsin 15th in "economic outlook," up from 32nd a year earlier, based on 15 policy variables such as taxes. But that report didn’t rank the states on future job growth and we didn’t find any others that did. Several experts we checked with -- at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Wisconsin Budget Project and the Center on Wisconsin Strategy -- weren’t aware of any, either. As for the rest of Tate’s claim, he directly blames Walker, even suggesting his political travels were a contributing factor. But it goes without saying that the state’s projected job growth depends on more than the actions of one person. As we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, a chief executive such as a governor has influence over jobs, but so do a host of other factors, such as national trends, that are beyond a governor’s control. Our rating Tate said Walker has dropped Wisconsin "to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state." Forbes rates Wisconsin 45th, although that’s a slight improvement, not a drop. And Walker bears some, but not all of the blame, for the ranking. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Tate a Mostly False.

pomt-02844	Says Tom Cotton "voted to turn Medicare into a voucher system."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/19/mark-pryor/rep-tom-cotton-voted-make-medicare-voucher-system-/	Attack ads are in full swing for the 2014 Arkansas Senate race. The latest back-and-forth between incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican, focused on Medicare funding. Each candidate accused the other of cutting funding. "Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70," Pryor's ad said. "Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare," Cotton’s ad shot back. We’ll address Cotton’s Medicare claim in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on Pryor’s statement about the voucher system. Did Cotton really vote for a voucher system? Cotton’s office did not respond to our requests for comment, but we decided to look into it. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims for years, and it’s still hanging around in 2014 rhetoric. Pryor’s spokesman told us the ad was referencing the Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., budget plan. Ryan first introduced his plan as an alternative to the federal budget in 2009, but he modified it in subsequent years as it gained traction in the House. A big part of his proposal has been to rein in future costs for Medicare. Pryor’s spokesman correctly pointed out that Cotton did vote in favor of Ryan’s budget proposal in March. As we noted in an earlier fact-check in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election, we also need to determine if Ryan’s proposed plan in 2013 qualifies as a "voucher system." There’s debate in policy wonk circles about what constitutes a voucher system versus "premium support," the term that Republicans prefer. Ryan’s latest plan, the one Cotton voter for, called for a flat payment to eligible seniors (at an increasing age for eligibility) to purchase private insurance or a traditional Medicare plan. The value of the payment would be either equal to the second-cheapest private plan available in a given area, or the cost of traditional Medicare -- whichever is cheaper. The fact that Ryan leaves in the option for traditional Medicare is noteworthy here. That means people can opt to have their subsidy go toward the current system. So there’s no mandatory move to a private plan. That’s a key difference from Ryan’s 2011 proposal. The other big change is that the 2013 plan allows for a different method of indexing of cost growth, which ensures the payments to seniors keep up with the changing economy, according to both left- and right-leaning health policy experts we spoke to. Could we consider this a "voucher system"? Paul Van de Water, a health policy expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed us toward a book released in 2000 called Vouchers and the Provision of Public Services, which details voucher programs in several spheres, health care being one. A voucher is defined as "a subsidy that grants limiting purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of goods and services." The Brookings Institution, published a paper in 1995 that referred to Medicare reform as "premium support" but didn’t totally rule out the voucher distinction. One distinction between vouchers and premium support is that a pure voucher system would mean handing people money not adjusted for inflation. However, Ryan’s plan does adjust for cost growth by year. So it’s not a perfect voucher system, which conservative health policy expert Robert Moffit at Heritage Foundation told us in a previous fact-check would resemble a simpler system like airline vouchers for food and drink. Yuval Levin, a health policy expert at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center told us he wouldn’t consider the proposal a voucher system at all. There’s definitely debate over semantics, but to the average voter (if not the average policy wonk), it seems like the word "voucher" would accurately describe the basics of Ryan’s proposal (which, by the way, doesn’t sound all that different from the healthcare.gov marketplaces for the uninsured). Calling programs like this "voucher systems" has been common in the field for years without negative connotations, Van de Water said. Our ruling Pryor’s campaign ad said Cotton voted to turn Medicare into a voucher system. Liberal and conservative experts have debated whether it’s a voucher system in every sense of the word. When we set aside the negative connotation that Democrats want to pin to Ryan’s proposal by using the word "voucher," we think it’s still an accurate way to describe the process of encouraging seniors to shop for their own plans from private insurers. The "voucher system" is the colloquial way to refer to a program that gives people credit to purchase something. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14963	Says CIA Director George Tenet told the Bush administration that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack "was coming. So they did have advanced notice."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/21/donald-trump/trump-says-cia-warned-president-bush-9-11-attacks/	The war of words between GOP presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Donald Trump continues, with the most recent clash coming over the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the response of Bush’s brother, President George W. Bush. Jeb Bush has stated several times that his brother kept America safe. Trump said that ignores a crucial fact -- that George W. Bush failed to stop the Sept. 11 attacks. Worse yet, Trump said on Oct. 20, 2015, that Bush knew the 2001 attacks were coming. "His brother could have made some mistakes with respect to the actual hit because they did know it was coming and George Tenet, the head of the CIA, told them it was coming," Trump said on CNN’s New Day. "So they did have advanced notice and they didn’t really work on it." Our question here is simple: Did Tenet and the CIA tell the Bush administration that an attack on U.S. soil was imminent? The answer comes from a special commission created to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) ‘The system was blinking red’ Tenet told staff for the commission, formally the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States, that "the system was blinking red" in the months before the September 2001 attacks. "Threat reports surged in June and July, reaching an even higher peak of urgency," the commission report said. "The summer threats seemed to be focused on Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bahrain, Kuwait, Yemen, and possibly Rome, but the danger could be anywhere -- including a possible attack on the G-8 summit in Genoa." Despite the chatter, there were doubters. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz thought perhaps Osama bin Ladin was trying to study U.S. reactions. Tenet shot that down. The report said that on Aug. 3, 2001, "the intelligence community issued an advisory concluding that the threat of impending al Qaeda attacks would likely continue indefinitely. Citing threats in the Arabian Peninsula, Jordan, Israel, and Europe, the advisory suggested that al Qaeda was lying in wait and searching for gaps in security before moving forward with the planned attacks." The commission’s timeline revealed a consensus that the target lay outside America’s borders. The one prominent exception came in an Aug. 6 briefing document written by two CIA analysts. They titled it "Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US." Essentially, the briefing document stated that bin Laden said he wanted to attack the United States directly and was expected to plan patiently. It spoke of an unconfirmed warning from 1998 that planes might be hijacked to win the release of imprisoned extremists and noted suspicious surveillance of federal buildings in New York. It noted that 70 investigations were underway in the United States. The closest it came to what actually took place was "CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Ladin supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives." What Bush knew The commission interviewed George W. Bush as part of its investigation and included his response to the briefing document. They write: "The President told us the August 6 report was historical in nature. President Bush said the article told him that al Qaeda was dangerous, which he said he had known since he had become President. The President said Bin Ladin had long been talking about his desire to attack America. He recalled some operational data on the FBI, and remembered thinking it was heartening that 70 investigations were under way. As best he could recollect, (National Security Adviser Condoleeza) Rice had mentioned that the Yemenis' surveillance of a federal building in New York had been looked into in May and June, but there was no actionable intelligence." The commission report goes on to say that the briefing document led to no meetings of the interagency Counterterrorism Security Group or the National Security Council to discuss a domestic attack. Tenet met with Bush two more times in August and on Sept. 10. Tenet said he didn’t remember talking to Bush about a domestic threat. News reports since 2004 have described in detail the frustrations intelligence officials like Tenet had in trying to get the White House to focus on Bin Ladin. But none suggest that Tenet thought a domestic strike was likely. Brian Finlay, president of the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, said the Aug. 6 article contained no specific information that would have "prevented the tragedy of that day." "One would have to willingly suspend disbelief to presume that any American official responsible for the national security of our country would have failed to act in the face of clear evidence of an imminent attack," Finlay said. Trump’s accusation "is simply off-base," Finlay said. Our ruling Trump claims that the CIA told the Bush administration that a domestic terror attack was coming. The report assembled over a span of three years after Sept. 11, 2001, found no specific alert. The potential for a domestic attack was discussed in early August, but it was mentioned only in broad terms and was not brought back up. Investigative reports in the years since found that the CIA warnings emphasized possible targets overseas. Tenet told investigators that as late as Sept. 10 he did not talk about a domestic attack with the president. There’s no support that Bush and top White House officials had, as Trump said, "advanced notice" of an attack on New York City or any other place in America. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01501	"The FBI is involved in an investigation about people in the Rio Grande Valley who are using cocaine to buy votes."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/sep/24/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-recaps-fbi-complaints-about-cocaine-tr/	In a debate with his Democratic foe, Republican gubernatorial nominee and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said Texas’ voter-identification law is needed because voter fraud does occur. Cocaine may have even been traded for votes, he said. Abbott said during the Sept. 19, 2014, debate against state Sen. Wendy Davis: "Voter fraud is real. It must be stopped. And voter identification is one of the tools to put a stop to it." State lawyers this week finished defending the law against a federal challenge heard in U.S. District Court in Corpus Christi. A moment later, Abbott said: "I almost hesitate to bring this up, but you know that one of the challenges that’s going on as we speak is the fact that the FBI is involved in an investigation about people in the Rio Grande Valley who are using cocaine to buy votes. We cannot accept or tolerate this kind of lack of integrity in the election process." We wondered: Is the government checking into ongoing trades of cocaine for votes? For starters, the McAllen Monitor newspaper reported on the investigation and the arrests of two women in a Sept. 1, 2014, news story. The story was based on court filings indicating the FBI was looking into allegations that a Hidalgo County commissioner’s campaign manager had used cocaine to draw votes in the 2012 primary election. Neither the commissioner nor campaign manager was identified in news story or the filings, which were posted online by Breitbart.com, the conservative news website. But, the Monitor reported, Veronica Saldivar and Belinda Solis, who worked as politiqueras – paid political campaign supporters who have been known to drive voters to the polls and even pay for votes – had just appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter Ormsby in McAllen. In one of the filings, dated Aug. 28, 2014, Brandon Cook, an FBI special agent, said Solis had told him in a January 2014 interview that a campaign manager gave ziplock bags containing "dime bags of cocaine to politiqueras" to give to voters in exchange for their votes. In the other filing, Cook said that in early 2014, a person identified as "Campaign Worker 1" said he worked for a county commissioner in the 2012 primary election and bought $50 worth of cocaine, split it up and gave it to Saldivar and a person identified as "Campaign Worker 2" to give to voters in exchange for their votes; that worker, Cook said, told the FBI a campaign manager for a candidate gave ziplock bags containing cocaine to Saldvivar and to them to give to voters for votes. Cook said Saldivar recalled giving baggies of cocaine to two voters. Cook also said Saldivar gave authorities a list of individuals she recalled paying with cash, beer, cigarettes or cocaine in exchange for votes. We asked Michelle Lee, an FBI spokeswoman in San Antonio, if trades of cocaine for votes remain under investigation. "Until a case if fully adjudicated, we view it as still under investigation," Lee said by phone. Lee noted, too, Justice on Sept. 19, 2014, issued a press release revealing the arrest in Illinois of a campaign manager, Francisco "Frankie" Garcia, of Donna, who had been charged with conspiring to buy votes, paying for votes and aiding and abetting others to buy votes. A federal indictment returned Sept. 16, 2014 said Garcia worked as a campaign manager for four candidates to the Donna School Board up to the November 2012 general election. After the voters at issue cast their votes, the indictment says, some would be brought to Garcia, who would himself pay in cash or baggies of cocaine. "During that time, he allegedly bought votes and worked with other campaign workers to pay voters and to offer to pay voters in this election to vote for particular candidates," Justice said. "The indictment alleges that Garcia paid voters by giving the voters either cocaine or cash in exchange for their votes." Justice said three campaign workers – Rebecca Gonzalez, 44, and Diana Balderas Castaneda, 48, both of Donna, Texas, and Guadalupe Escamilla, 72, of Weslaco, Texas – previously pleaded guilty to vote-buying charges stemming from this election. Our ruling Abbott said the FBI is "involved in an investigation about people in the Rio Grande Valley who are using cocaine to buy votes." This statement referenced a cocaine-for-votes investigation resulting in several recent arrests. Given Abbott’s phrasing, though, it’s worth clarifying the alleged incidents occurred two years ago. Notably too, the investigation has yet to indicate anything about the voter ID law. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04749	Says most Texas schools spend 45 out of 180 school days in mandated testing.	false	/texas/statements/2012/aug/29/ted-lyon/ted-lyon-says-most-texas-schools-spend-45-days-man/	In an opinion column that appeared in Texas newspapers (including the Austin American-Statesman on Aug. 1, 2012), former state Sen. Ted Lyon criticized current state lawmakers for cutting education funds but sticking to mandated state exams that he called wasteful and expensive. "Mandated tests consume valuable time that should be used for teaching," Lyon wrote. "Most schools spend 45 days out of the 180 days in a school year in some form of mandated testing. This type of thinking is absurd." A Statesman reader asked us: Does Texas spend a quarter of its school days on such tests? We were curious, too, especially as we had recently rated Mostly False a claim that Austin’s school district lists 64 days a year for state testing. In that fact-check, we found 34 days were tabbed by the Austin district in 2011-12 for state testing and make-up/re-test exams, but that not all grades or all students took tests on each of those days. Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us the number of testing dates in Texas schools has increased over the years in response to state and federal mandates. Most of the tests are conducted in high schools, Ratcliffe said, with the introduction of end-of-course exams in the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness program. As we started on this article, we interviewed Lyon by phone and email and were unable to pin down how he arrived at the 45-day figure. Lyon, a Mesquite lawyer and Democrat who was a House member and then senator from 1979 into early 1993, told us that he based his statement on conversations with current and former education administrators, most at the district level, plus work done for Lyon by a researcher. Without giving us specific numbers, he told us that what he learned convinced him that most Texas students were being pulled "into a testing mode all day" for state-mandated tests on at least 45 to 50 days a year. Since the 1980s, Texas students have taken some form of state-mandated exam. Last year, Texas began phasing out the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills and replacing it with the more rigorous STAAR. TEA, the state government body in charge of kindergarten-12th grade public education, oversees the testing program. STAAR is being rolled into place with the high-school class of 2015; students graduating in 2013 and ’14, who took the TAKS in ninth grade, will still take the TAKS to graduate. In our April story, TEA’s Ratcliffe said, "Any one kid is only going to spend two to five days a year taking the state tests" unless he or she fails, in which case re-testing would be possible. We asked for more detail for this story, and Ratcliffe explained that students in grades 3-5, 6-8 and 9-11 are tested on two to five subjects per year. The state’s 2011-12 testing calendar shows that districts were required to hold STAAR and TAKS on 25 specific days plus four flexible testing periods (when districts can schedule tests as needed). If a district had at least one test in each flexible period, its minimum number of testing dates would have been 29. The maximum allowed is 45 days. However, each individual school would only administer the tests required in its grade levels; for example, elementary schools are not conducting the pre-graduation end-of-course exams. And the 29 to 45 dates on the STAAR calendar included re-tests and makeup tests for students who failed or missed the initial exam. Ratcliffe helped us sort out STAAR scenarios with the most and least possible testing for individual Texas students during a school year: Least: Two days. Third-graders only take two tests and aren’t asked to re-test if they fail. So that’s it: two four-hour tests ("pencils up" to "pencils down"). Most: Ten days, if a ninth-grader failed in all five STAAR subjects and had to retake each test. Then there are tests required at the district level. Many large and mid-size districts, Ratcliffe said, require progress checks (such as "benchmark," "field" or six-week tests). Our earlier fact-check found that in the Austin district, benchmark testing ranged from about four days for third-graders to as many as nine days for eighth-graders, with each exam occupying up to two hours. We reached out to officials in several Texas districts, including the ones Lyon named, and heard back from associate superintendent Cathy Rideout of the Mesquite district, just east of Dallas. Rideout said the district’s "benchmark"-type test is a 20-question test given four times a year to make sure students are keeping up with curricula. All or parts of a district’s student body can also take other standardized tests. Rideout emailed us information about several in the Mesquite district: Testing to identify gifted students and students who need scholastic help from state Response to Intervention services. Reading tests for kindergarten, first and second grades. The state requires that such a test be given but lets districts choose which test to give, Rideout said. The Texas Middle School Fluency Assessment of reading skills for some seventh-graders. Tests for students learning English. The PSAT, a preparatory test for the SAT college entrance exam. (Unlike the SAT, the PSAT is taken during school.) The Response to Intervention testing, K-2 reading tests and PSAT occur on seven days, but take less time per day than STAARs, Rideout said. Trying to get a grip on how many tests are required at the district level around the state, we consulted officials with Texas educators’ associations, but found no organization that tracks district testing days. Our ruling There seems to be scant information spelling out precisely how many days most schools give mandated tests. But our sense is that Texas school districts might be giving state-mandated tests on 29 days a school year, while district-level benchmark tests can absorb about four to nine days, though admittedly that’s based only on what we gleaned from the Austin and Mesquite districts for 2011-12. The days devoted to testing at some individual schools — and, more important, for individual students — are far fewer. We don’t doubt that schools focus on the various mandated tests throughout each year. However, we see no evidence that most schools spend 45 days of each year giving the tests, which is what Lyon declared. His statement rates False.

pomt-11073	States with voter ID laws have seen "zero decrease" in participation. "Most have seen an increase."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jun/20/tim-moore/states-voter-id-laws-have-seen-zero-decrease-turno/	Should North Carolina residents have to show photo identification to vote? Republicans who control North Carolina’s state legislature are considering the requirement, and have proposed putting a referendum on the November ballot. Those who support the idea say it’s needed to prevent people from impersonating one another. Critics, meanwhile, say photo ID requirements discriminate against poor people and minorities who may not have driver’s licenses or other forms of photo ID. They also say photo ID is unnecessary, since reports of voter fraud in North Carolina are rare and tend to occur not at polling sites but with mail-in ballots. State Rep. Tim Moore, the Republican House speaker, recently defended the idea in an interview with Spectrum News. Reporter Loretta Boniti asked Moore whether an ID requirement might suppress votes. "Not at all," Moore said in the June 7 interview. "States that have adopted voter identification laws have seen zero decrease in voter participation. In fact, most have seen an increase in voter participation." He went on to say that, "When it comes to voter participation, it's generally dependent on what kind of cycle it is." We decided to look at what has happened in states that did what Republicans would like to do in North Carolina. Was there no decline in voter participation, as Moore said? Thirty-four states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls. Seven states — Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin — have what the National Conference of State Legislatures refers to as "strict photo ID" requirements. By "strict," the NCSL means that voters in those states who don’t present acceptable photo ID must vote on a provisional ballot and then come back with an acceptable ID after Election Day for it to be counted. Voting laws in NC In North Carolina, voters don't have to show photo ID when they vote or register to vote. The proposed ballot question is vague, leaving it up to the legislature to fill in the details on what kinds of IDs would be needed. The North Carolina legislature, which has been controlled by Republicans since 2011, adopted a voter ID law in 2013 that limited voting options and required voters to show photo ID at the polls. Federal appellate judges struck that law down in 2016, saying the restrictions "target African Americans with almost surgical precision." In his interview, Moore didn’t specify what he meant by "voter ID" or "participation." Joseph Kyzer, Moore’s communications director, clarified in an email to PolitiFact that Moore was referring to total turnout. "While fluctuations in voter participation between election cycles are common, none of the extensive studies on this issue have demonstrated that voter ID decreased total turnout in the thirty-two states that have some form of voter ID," Kyzer said. But total turnout — the percentage of eligible voters that make it to the polls — is not the contentious point with voter ID. Turnout is higher in presidential years, an exciting governor’s race increases interest, and other factors drive turnout. The voter ID debate hinges on whether these laws systematically put certain types of voters at a disadvantage compared to others. That was at the heart of the federal appeals court ruling. Effects of voter ID "Turnout alone doesn’t tell the whole story," said Myrna Perez, deputy director of the Democracy Program of the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. "The portion of the population without the ID can be suppressed, and at the same time, people who do have the ID can turn out in larger numbers." Among the most cited and respected studies on the impact of voter ID laws was one conducted in 2014 by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. The GAO did its own study while examining 10 others. When comparing the 2008 and 2012 elections, the GAO analysis found that turnout decreases in Kansas and Tennessee "were attributable to changes in those two states’ voter ID requirements." And of the 10 studies the GAO reviewed, five found that ID requirements had no statistically significant effect on turnout; four found decreases in turnout and one found an increase in turnout. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "Although not the final word on this question, the GAO study provides credible evidence that strict ID requirements may depress turnout," said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin. "It remains clear that the best research on this topic does not support the idea that voter participation increases as a result of a voter ID law, with about half of studies unable to detect a statistically significant effect on turnout and the other half of studies finding a small negative effect on turnout," he added. On the other hand, Adam Berinsky, director of the political experiments research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said "the research findings are mixed. So ‘zero decrease’ may be going too far, but there is no clear evidence of decrease." As for Moore’s claim of an increase in participation, "That seems clearly beyond the scope of findings from credible research," Berinsky said. Votes blocked Several experts pointed to a paper by Benjamin Highton, a professor at UC-Davis, as a good summary of the situation. Highton acknowledges a lack of conclusive studies, but notes "even if we posit that voter identification laws have no influence on turnout because all those without valid identification who would otherwise vote take the necessary steps to obtain proper identification in advance of Election Day, these people do face a higher barrier to voting." Photo ID laws are a "barrier," Highton said, and the barrier is "real, nontrivial, and unequal in impact." Moore’s office pointed to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article showing that turnout rose among black and Hispanic voters from 2006 to 2010 — despite adoption of a new voter ID law in 2007. But the same article noted that the ID requirements blocked some votes from being counted. Under Georgia’s law, an in-person voter who arrives without a photo ID may cast a provisional ballot. The provisional ballot is counted only if the person returns with proper identification by the Friday following the election. "Records show that since 2008, 2,244 provisional ballots were cast by voters lacking photo ID. Of those, 658 returned with an ID and 1,586 did not — meaning their votes did not count," the AJC reported. North Carolina’s short-lived voter ID law yielded similar results. In the state’s 2016 presidential primary, 1,276 ballots weren’t counted because the voter didn’t bring ID to the polls, according to Josh Lawson, general counsel for the N.C. Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement. Of those who did not bring photo ID with them to the polls, nearly 1,100 who possessed valid IDs failed to return to their county board of elections to show their IDs before results were certified, so their votes did not count. An algorithm developed by professors at Tufts and Harvard universities recently found that, in Texas, voters who were black and Hispanic were less likely to have IDs than whites. Their research methods are considered among the most precise for tracking voters, as explained by Wired Magazine. Both sides point to studies Moore’s office pointed to a mixture of academic studies, news articles and opinion columns to support his claim. They look at individual results from specific states, as well as the broad effects of voter ID on turnout. Indiana adopted a voter ID law in 2005. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a liberal Washington think tank that focuses on issues of race, found that black turnout in the 2008 election was at a historic high after rising substantially from 2004. Hans von Spakovsky, a proponent for voter ID and senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, noted the rise in black turnout in both Indiana and Georgia in a 2009 column. A 2017 study by a trio of professors from UC-San Diego and Bucknell University, "Voter Identification Laws and the Suppression of Minority Votes," found "a significant drop in minority participation" in states that implemented strict voter ID laws between 2006 and 2014. But that finding was disputed in another study by five professors who argued the trio used unreliable data to reach their conclusions. (Moore’s office cited that subsequent study to support his claim that there’s no evidence photo ID laws affect voter turnout.) Still, contrary to Moore’s "zero decrease" statement, available data suggest that voter ID can decrease voter participation. Eitan Hersh, who is one of those five professors and also was among the developers of the algorithm used to track Texas voters, said that Moore’s statement is "misleading" since some voters struggle to obtain ID. "At the same time, measuring an aggregate effect of ID laws is hard and there hasn’t been decisive evidence about how many people are actually deterred from these laws," Hersh said in an email. "There has also been no good evidence to suggest the laws increase turnout." Justin Grimmer, another of the five professors, said Moore is exaggerating the research conclusions. "The best I could say is (it’s) lacking a lot of context," Grimmer said. "Acceptable IDs are not held by everyone and disproportionately minorities and low income people don't have IDs. Therefore, if there is a mechanical deterrence effect of ID laws, then it will harm minorities. This was the line of argument used in the Texas ID law case and I find it convincing." PolitiFact ruling Moore said "states that have adopted voter identification laws have seen zero decrease in voter participation. In fact, most have seen an increase in voter participation." There’s a kernel of truth in Moore’s statement, as studies haven't consistently shown a direct relationship between voter ID laws and voter participation. However, a report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found some evidence that participation declines. And experts said studies don't show an increase in participation as a result of voter ID. Moore’s claim that there has been "zero decrease" in voter participation is a misleading exaggeration. We rate his claim Mostly False. ' See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tim Moore	None	None	None	2018-06-20T18:18:16	2018-06-07	['None']
pomt-08832	Hank Johnson voted against legislation to help "first responders, teachers, vets and troops."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/12/liz-carter/johnson-bailed-cops-teachers-firefighters-vets-and/	How could he? That's the question Liz Carter asked last week about U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat. Carter, a Republican running to unseat Johnson, sent out a news release criticizing his vote against a resolution on July 27 that approved billions of dollars for the military efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and other initiatives. "Who in their right mind would vote no on this critical piece of legislation?" Carter said. "Congressman Johnson's refusal to support this bi-partisan legislation only serves to show how out of touch he is with the 4th district. His No vote shows he does not support [police officers, firefighters,] teachers, vets and troops." Carter said the legislation provided $24 billion "to help keep teachers, police and firefighters employed during the recession." She also complained about Johnson's vote on her Facebook page. The 4th Congressional District consists largely of DeKalb County, with portions of Gwinnett and Rockdale counties. Democrats typically dominate congressional elections in that district. Johnson spokesman Andy Phelan told AJC PolitiFact during a telephone interview that Carter didn't have her facts right about the resolution or the congressman's position. We decided to check this one out. The legislation was called House Resolution 4899. The original legislation, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in March, provided $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and $600 million for a summer jobs program, according to Congressional Quarterly, a news organization that closely tracks legislation in Washington. In May, the U.S. Senate passed an expanded version of the bill that included $37.1 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and $13.4 billion for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, CQ reported. On July 1, the House added an amendment to include $10 billion to assist in the hiring and retention of teachers, $5 billion for Pell grants for college students and $701 million for border security, CQ reported. Republicans opposed the additional domestic spending, and there was not enough Senate support to pass the House-amended version, according to CQ. On July 22, the Senate rejected those House measures and returned the resolution to the House. The House voted July 27 on the version of the bill without the funds for teachers, Pell grants and border security, CQ reported. Johnson voted against the resolution because the Senate version of the bill did not have funding for teachers and other domestic priorities he felt were important, Phelan said in an e-mail. Carter e-mailed PolitiFact Georgia a statement saying she "fell prey to relying on a final summary of the H.R. 4899 legislation after having read a prior version of the legislation." She posted a similar message on her blog titled "Oops, I made a mistake, but he still doesn't get it." Carter still said Johnson must answer why he voted against legislation that would help veterans and troops overseas. We're sure Carter and Johnson will debate that as the Nov. 2 election nears. As for her statement, the version of the resolution that Johnson voted against did not include funding for domestic first responders or teachers. It did include money for military veterans and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We rate Carter's attack against Johnson as Half True.

pomt-10821	"And it's going to be difficult for us to do this as long as we're spending $275 million a day on a war that should have never been authorized..."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/20/barack-obama/obama-hits-the-moving-target/	At a presidential forum in Washington, D.C., U.S. Sen. Barack Obama tried to put the massive cost of the Iraq war into context as he rallied to bring troops home. "We've got to have an energy plan that stops sending $800-million a day to some of the most hostile nations on Earth and melts the polar ice caps in the process. And it's going to be difficult for us to do this as long as we're spending $275-million a day on a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged, a war that you and I were opposed to from the start." Obama made that statement at the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees convention on June 19, 2007. The two leading nonpartisan government agencies give different figures, but Obama's assertion is not far from the mark. The Congressional Budget Office, which serves as the fiscal research arm for Congress, reports the estimated cost for the Iraq war since 2001 is $413-billion, or $249.2-million a day. The Congressional Research Service, which analyzes public policy for Congress, calculates the total spending to date at $450.4-billion, or $271.8-million a day. The disparity in the numbers is a matter of how the groups tabulate dollars that don't always have a specific designation. Here's how confusing it can be. When we asked Obama's campaign to explain how he arrived at his $275 million figure, campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki provided yet another number. $305-million per day. This figure is different from the others because it includes projected costs through the end of the 2008 budget year. Here's how the Obama campaign's math works: They take the entire cost of the Iraq conflict to date, ($450.4-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service) add the Bush administration request in 2008 ($166-billion) and divide by the number of days from the start of the conflict, March 19, 2003, to the end of the next budget year, Oct. 1, 2008 (2023 days). The number Obama used at the forum, Psaki concluded, "is actually a more conservative estimate of the average spent per day."	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2007-09-20T00:00:00	2007-06-19	['None']
pomt-04701	Says Mitt Romney has put forward a plan "that would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/martin-omalley/mitt-romneys-plan-would-cut-taxes-millionaires-whi/	Martin O’Malley, the Democratic governor of Maryland, made a hard-charging case for President Barack Obama and against Republican nominee Mitt Romney. "And yet Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan now say they want to take America back. And we have to ask: Back to what? Back to the failed policies that drove us into this deep recession? Back to the days of record job losses? Back to the days when insurance companies called being a woman a ‘pre-existing condition,’ " O’Malley said, speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. "No, thank you. I don't want to go back. Do you? Instead of a balanced, achievable plan to create jobs and reduce the deficit, Mitt Romney says, puts forward a plan that would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class." We should note O’Malley’s remarks were modified from the advance transcript sent to reporters. In the advance version, O’Malley said more simply, "Mitt Romney says he will cut taxes for millionaires and raise them for the middle class." The idea is clear enough, though: Romney wants to cut taxes for millionaires while raising taxes on the middle class. So does he? That’s not how he would explain his own plan. Romney would say he wants lower tax rates for everyone. But it’s not quite that simple. Let us explain. Romney’s tax plan Generally speaking, Romney’s plan would lower tax rates for everyone while getting rid of exemptions, deductions and loopholes. That way, people would pay lower tax rates, but more income would be subject to taxes, so the changes wouldn’t blow a hole in the deficit. Other ideas from his tax plan: eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax; and cutting the corporate rate to 25 percent. Romney has said he wants to keep tax rates low on savings and investment, which tend to benefit the millionaires. But he’s also said that people at the high end "will still pay the same share of the tax burden they’re paying now," which suggests he wants to maintain the current progressive system where people pay more taxes as a percentage of income if they make more. The biggest sticking point -- especially for fact-checkers and independent analysts trying to analyze Romney’s plan -- is that Romney hasn’t specified what exemptions, deductions and loopholes he wants to get rid of. It’s impossible to tell if Romney’s math adds up. The Tax Policy Center analysis One group that’s tried to unpack his plan is the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax analysis group that has analyzed tax plans put forward by candidates and officials. The group's report, first published on Aug. 1, 2012, analyzed Romney’s plan by choosing common exemptions and deductions to scrub from the tax code. The Tax Policy Center had to choose on its own what exemptions and deductions to get rid of, but the analysts tried to select the ones that most conformed to the principles Romney has outlined. (The Tax Policy Center refers to them as "tax preferences.") Still, the math didn’t work. If the tax plan is to generate the same amount of revenue and offer across-the-board tax cuts, some exemptions for the middle class would go away. "As a result, a revenue-neutral reform within these constraints would cut taxes at the high-end while raising them in the middle and perhaps bottom," wrote Donald Marron, the center’s director, in a blog post about the study. Meanwhile, the across-the-board rate reductions would benefit the wealthy, who overall would see lower tax burdens, according to the center’s analysis. The Obama campaign has used the study as evidence for its claims that Romney’s plan means tax increases for the middle class. When the campaign puts those claims in the proper context, it’s a reasonable point. Romney’s tax plan is lacking in details, and the Tax Policy Center’s conclusions are compelling evidence. Depending on how the Obama team has phrased it, we’ve rated their claims anywhere from Half True to Mostly True. In this case, O'Malley goes too far to declare Romney’s plan a tax increase on the middle class. Marron of the Tax Policy Center says there is insufficient evidence for the harsh Democratic talking points that have evolved since the policy center released its report: "I don’t interpret (the report) as evidence that Gov. Romney wants to increase taxes on the middle class in order to cut taxes for the rich, as an Obama campaign ad claimed. Instead, I view it as showing that his plan can’t accomplish all his stated objectives. One can charitably view his plan as a combination of political signaling and the opening offer in what would, if he gets elected, become a negotiation." Supporters of Romney’s plan have said it’s not fair for the Tax Policy Center to select which tax preferences to get rid of, and that they’re assuming tax increases that aren’t part of Romney’s plan. We reviewed their study and found that it did make assumptions, but that those assumptions tried to give the Romney campaign the benefit of the doubt. Our ruling O’Malley said at the Democratic National Convention, "Mitt Romney . . . puts forward a plan that would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class." Actually, Romney’s plan includes across-the-board tax cuts for everyone, including millionaires. It does not specifically include tax increases on the middle class. But Romney’s tax plan is vague and doesn’t appear to be able to keep all its promises. Romney has said he wants to eliminate deductions while cutting tax rates for everyone; bring in the same amount of revenue for the government; keep a higher burden on the wealthy; and keep low rates on savings and investments. A credible, independent analysis shows these goals are in tension with each other and don’t add up. The Romney campaign has repeatedly declined to offer more specifics. In the past, the Obama campaign has pointed to this report and framed its claims more carefully, and we’ve given them positive ratings when they’ve done so. Here, O’Malley is blunter. He says that Romney plan "would cut taxes for millionaires while raising them for the middle class." It might, but that’s not what Romney says his intentions are. Instead, he would like rate cuts for everyone. We rate O’Malley’s claim Half True.	None	Martin O'Malley	None	None	None	2012-09-05T14:52:27	2012-09-04	['None']

pomt-01191	In 2010, uninsured voters made up "about 5 percent of the electorate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/04/charles-schumer/uninsured-vote-low-rates-charles-schumer/	Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer ruffled some feathers among his own party recently when he said passing Obamacare was the wrong thing to do. In remarks at the National Press Club Nov. 25, Schumer, of New York, said it wasn’t politically prudent for the Democrats in Congress to focus their energy on health care. The vast majority of voters who brought President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats into office in 2008, Schumer said, wanted policy that addressed the recession, not health insurance. In fact, he said, uninsured voters -- those who would get many of the law’s immediate benefits -- were a relatively insignificant portion of the electorate. "The Affordable Care Act was aimed at the 36 million Americans who were not covered," Schumer said. "It's been reported that only a third of the uninsured are even registered to vote. In 2010, only about 40 percent of those registered voted. So even if the uninsured kept with the rate, which they likely didn't, you would still only be talking about 5 percent of the electorate." There’s a lot packed into that quote, but we’re most interested in the last part of Schumer’s claim: that uninsured voters only made up 5 percent of the electorate in 2010, the year Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. We asked Schumer’s office where they got that stat. They laid out for us their calculations, using figures from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Election Project, a website run by a University of Florida professor that tracks election data. Well, we crunched the numbers ourselves, and our results lined up with Schumer’s. Here’s how we got those figures. In 2010, about 42.6 million people of voting age were uninsured, according to the Census. Of those 42.6 million, we estimated that 14.6 percent -- or 6.2 million -- are illegal immigrants, according to the Migration Policy Institute, meaning they are not eligible voters. This brings us down to about 36.4 million eligible voters who do not have health insurance. We should note that this figure does not account for people who are ineligible to vote for other reasons, such as a felony conviction. Additionally, Schumer’s office came up with a slightly lower count than we did. The next step is to find out how many of these 36.4 million uninsured eligible voters actually voted in 2010. That year, 41.8 percent of the voting-eligible population in the United States voted in the general election. Schumer said in his National Press Club remarks that he assumed that voter turnout among the uninsured reflected overall voter turnout. And 41.8 percent of the 36.5 million uninsured eligible voters is 15.2 million. Then we calculated what percentage of the total electorate (217.6 million) are these 15.2 million uninsured eligible voters -- 7 percent, compared to Schumer’s 5 percent figure. In any case, both Schumer’s and our calculations potentially overestimate the number of uninsured people who voted in the 2010 general election. That’s because the uninsured population is less likely to vote than the insured population. An October 2014 Pew Research Center study found that of all "likely voters," 93 percent have insurance coverage, and only 7 percent do not have coverage. (Compare this to the general population, of which 13.4 percent is uninsured, as of October 2014.) "I believe (the Pew figures support Schumer’s) point on the more limited potential impact of the uninsured vote on this election," said Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University. Additionally, the uninsured population has a lower level of voter registration than the insured, according to a 2012 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll. The poll found that 64 percent of uninsured people are registered to vote, compared to 86 percent of insured people. Our ruling Schumer said that in 2010, uninsured voters made up 5 percent of the electorate. We crunched the numbers and came up with a figure close to Schumer’s -- 7 percent. There’s reason to believe, though, that 5 percent and 7 percent are both overestimates. This only reinforces Schumer’s overall point that the uninsured don’t make up a significant portion of actual voters. We rate Schumer’s claim True.

pomt-11050	Kurt Russell said that celebrities shouldn't "get political" when it comes to Donald Trump.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/27/twentyeightmay/story-takes-actor-kurt-russells-comments-about-pol/	A story on Facebook said that actor Kurt Russell "falls into the rare category of celebrities who isn’t crying over Hillary Clinton’s loss" and doesn’t feel a need to announce his political opinions. Russell said that "the last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political," according to an article on Twentyeightmay, a pro-Donald Trump website. The story said that Russell showed Trump’s "famous foes that it’s time to shut up about our president." Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The website uses actual quotes by Russell but omits when he actually said them, creating a false connection to Trump. The Twentyeightmay story includes this quote by Russell: "This is a business that’s heavily promulgated by people who have a politically liberal bent. I don’t begrudge them that. I’m a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways." The story said that Russell made those comments in response to Meryl Streep’s comments at the Golden Globes. But Streep’s criticism of Trump for imitating a disabled reporter occurred at the awards ceremony in January 2017 while that quote by Russell was published in September 2016 in an interview with Stephen Whitty, a freelance critic at the time for The New Jersey Star-Ledger. Whitty told PolitiFact that Russell "was talking, very generally, about being a libertarian or conservative in Hollywood" and that he didn’t recall him ever mentioning any candidate by name. The twentyeightmay story also said that Russell recently said: "The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political." Russell did make that statement, but that was on The View in December 2015 when Whoopi Goldberg asked him about his recent comments that he believed gun control laws wouldn’t deter terrorists. At the time he made statements about gun control, he was discussing his upcoming movie The Hateful Eight, directed by Quentin Tarantino. "The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political. It's just something I can't stand watching. So having said that, no, I was asked, I was asked to put it in context somehow with this movie. You know, my personal feeling is that there's a big difference between fantasyland and reality. Fantasyland is what we do. You're either writing something, writing a song, writing a book, doing a movie, doing a television show. That's fantasyland. And that’s where that stuff belongs." Russell continued, saying that people have different opinions about how to deal with terrorism and he talked about his views on why the Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment. We were unable to find any contact information on the twentyeightmay website. Our ruling A story by the Twentyeightmay website said that actor Kurt Russell said that celebrities shouldn't "get political" when it comes to Donald Trump. This is a case of using an actual quote by an actor but taking it out of context to create a false impression. Russell said in a December 2015 interview on The View, "The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political." But the Twentyeightmay story portrayed Russell’s quotes as an attack on Trump, and that wasn’t the case. The story didn’t make it clear when Russell made these statements.

pomt-08547	U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson "has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending" and has voted for "many substantial increases in federal spending."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/01/chuck-donovan/candidate-says-isakson-no-fiscal-hawk/	Note to readers: a letter to the editor responding to this item appeared Oct. 11, 2010. The letter appears at the end of the article. Chuck Donovan gave us a challenge. The Libertarian nominee for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat asked AJC PolitiFact Georgia to check out some claims on his campaign website about the incumbent, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. Voters will decide among Isakson, Donovan and Democrat Michael Thurmond on Nov. 2. We looked at Donovan's blog, which included a post called "Isakson's Inconsistencies." The post challenged the Republican on a host of issues, but one line questioning Isakson's conservative credentials on federal spending stood out. "Mr. Isakson has never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending," Donovan began. "However, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits." Challenge accepted. Isakson spokeswoman Sheridan Watson showed us a page on the senator's website full of news releases and statements highlighting votes and bills he supported to curb spending. It also noted Isakson has twice won the Taxpayers' Friend Award from the National Taxpayers Union for his efforts to curb federal spending. "Happy investigating," Watson wrote us. Donovan's post was researched and written by fellow Libertarian Allen Buckley, an Atlanta-based attorney and certified public accountant who won 2 percent of the vote in an unsuccessful campaign against Isakson in 2004. Let's look at the first part of Donovan's claim: Isakson has never proposed or voted for a substantial cut in federal spending. The senator's website offers four main arguments to dispute Donovan. Isakson has voted often to cap discretionary spending, programs that are not entitlements such as Medicare and Social Security. Discretionary spending, which includes the Defense Department budget, has amounted to about as much as 40 percent of the total federal budget in recent years. Second, the senator has been a big proponent of biennial budgeting, preparing and adopting budgets for two-year periods. The federal budget is currently adopted on an annual basis. Biennial budgeting proponents argue the idea would allow the federal government to adopt two budgets in one year and spend the second year taking more time to improve how government works. Others, including the Congressional Budget Office, have warned biennial budgeting could backfire if the revenue streams are uncertain, which makes it difficult to budget accurately. Third, Isakson supports the Pay It Back Act, which would require that money repaid by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) be used toward deficit reduction. The fourth idea is legislation introduced in 2006 and 2007 by U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., called Stop Over-Spending. Isakson co-sponsored the bill. SOS aimed to reduce the federal deficit and essentially balance the budget by 2012 through slowing the rate of growth for entitlement programs, except for Social Security, if Congress doesn't meet deficit reduction targets. It also gave the president a line-item veto. The Senate never voted on the bill. The SOS bill received positive reviews from the conservative organizations National Review and the Heritage Foundation, saying it would have forced Congress into disciplined spending. University of Virginia political science professor James Savage was one of the few academics who studied the bill when it was introduced and he had problems with it. Savage and others contend that deficit reduction is not sound economic policy during a recession because more federal investment is needed to revive the economy, either through cutting taxes, lowering interest rates or spurring consumer spending through a stimulus. There are examples of Isakson's efforts to curb spending. For example, Isakson voted in 2006 against a $109 billion emergency spending bill for Iraq and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts along the Gulf Coast because it included earmarks for projects such as $700 million to relocate a railroad in Mississippi. Isakson voted in 2005 for legislation that included cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. The cuts were estimated to trim $36 billion, about 2 percent, from budget deficits forecast at $1.6 trillion during the following five years. Now, let's look at whether Isakson has voted in favor of many substantial spending increases. Donovan's camp says Isakson went along with Republicans on a series of spending increases when the GOP controlled Congress. Much of Donovan's argument on this point deals with bills from 2001 to 2004, when Isakson was in the U.S. House. During that time, Isakson voted for several bills during a time when the gross federal debt grew from about $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2001 to nearly $7.4 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2004. The debt was projected to rise to $13.8 trillion for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Isakson voted in 2002 to spend $350 billion over 10 years for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. Additionally, he voted for bills that increased defense spending by about 10 percent a year and legislation that raised the discretionary spending cap from $661 billion in 2001 to $819 billion in 2004. The senator has been more of a fiscal hawk since Democrats became the majority party in Congress in 2007, Donovan said. The senator voted in 2006 with 51 of his 54 fellow Republicans to increase the national debt limit by $787 billion, raising the debt ceiling to $9 trillion. Some senators defended the decision, saying additional funds were needed for health and education programs. Isakson also voted in 2008 for the $700 billion TARP but has since criticized expansion of that legislation. So where does this leave us on Donovan's statement about Isakson? Donovan put himself on safer footing on the Truth-o-Meter by saying Isakson has voted for "substantial" increases in spending than his claim that Isakson hasn't supported spending cuts. Isakson has voted for some major spending increases, particularly to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The need for that spending is for others to decide. But Isakson's support for the "Pay It Back" plan, SOS and other legislation shows Isakson has made efforts to lower spending, several of them fitting the average person's definition of "substantial." We believe Donovan's statement leaves out some context that led us to a different conclusion about Isakson's record on federal spending. We rate his statement as Half True. Letter to the editor: The October 1, 2010 truth-o-meter says an allegation made on the website of Chuck Donovan, Libertarian Party U.S. Senate candidate, is half true. The article notes that I researched and wrote the provision—which is correct. The provision reads: Mr. Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in federal spending; however, he has voted in favor of: (a) many substantial increases in federal spending; and (b) tremendous annual deficits. The article did not consider the four facets of the statement, but instead focused on spending. The allegedly untrue part is the part about Mr. Isakson’s proposals relating to, and votes for, substantially cutting spending. Cited in favor of Mr. Isakson are proposed caps on discretionary spending, Mr. Isakson’s support for biennial budgeting and Mr. Isakson’s support of the Pay It Back Act, which reportedly requires money paid back by banks and other businesses who received taxpayer dollars from the TARP be used towards deficit reduction. These things are not bad things, but they do not reduce spending at all. Concerning caps on future discretionary spending, it appears the reporter or the truth-o-meter judges, or both, failed to distinguish a cut in spending from a limit on future spending increases. Also cited is the Stop Over Spending (SOS) bill, which I was told by the reporter with whom I met was the only thing the Isakson campaign cited in its defense. As I explained to the reporter, nothing in the SOS bill requires that any spending be substantially cut at all. I thoroughly provided reasoning therefore. I gave the reporter examples of things that would result in a substantial cut in spending, such as repeal of Medicare Part D. According to the Medicare Trustees, Medicare Part D had a present value liability figure in 2008 that exceeded 31 percent the net worth of all Americans combined as of the end of 2009. I encourage all readers to read the SOS bill (it can be found online). Also cited in favor of the senator is his vote against a spending increase relating to Iraq and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts because it included $700 million in earmarks. Voting against a spending increase is not proposing, or voting in favor of, a cut (or a substantial cut) in spending. The only thing cited to cut spending was small proposed cut in Medicare and Medicaid that would reportedly have cut 2 percent from budget deficit forecasts over five years. The spending cuts were estimated to be $36 billion. The per-year average spending cut would be $7.2 billion (i.e. $36 billion divided by 5). Total federal spending for 2008 amounted to approximately $2,983 billion. I do not believe something that could cut spending by 0.2 percent (i.e. 7.2 divided by 2,983) could reasonably be considered to substantially cut spending. It is akin to a 2 cent saving on a good that would ordinarily cost $10. After publication, through email correspondence with the reporter, I was told the truth-o-meter judges felt the average person would consider the SOS and pay-go, etc. as significant efforts to cut spending. I replied by first noting that Senator Isakson consistently voted against pay-go when his party was in power. I also offered the following example that an ordinary reasonable person could understand: If an individual said his family spends $1,000 per week but plans to limit future spending increases, but the individual said no other actions would be taken regarding spending, no ordinary reasonable person would think that person had planned to cut his family’s spending, let alone cut the spending substantially. Martindale-Hubbell is the organization that "rates" lawyers, and the rating is done by other lawyers. I have, and for many years have had, an AV rating from Martindale-Hubbell. An AV rating is the highest rating in terms of work quality and integrity (including honesty). Simply put, I tell the truth. In sum, Senator Isakson never proposed, nor voted in favor of, a substantial cut in spending. Thus, I told the truth. The GAO said in 2007: "GAO’s long-term simulations continue to show ever larger deficits resulting in a federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control." While I am very disheartened by the truth-o-meter article, what is really sad is that you have helped Mr. Isakson so he can continue fulfilling GAO’s prophesy.

pomt-08256	"Pres. Obama's finance team is recommending a . . . 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/nov/12/chain-email/e-mail-claims-obamas-financial-team-wants-1-percen/	Is President Obama's finance team scheming with Congress to place a 1-percent tax on every banking transaction you make? That's the assertion of an e-mail that's been showing up in local inboxes. It says: "President Obama's finance team is recommending a transaction tax. His plan is to sneak it in after the November election to keep it under the radar. This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution." The e-mail is anonymous -- isn't it always? -- but it says, in effect, that if you deposit $1,000, $10 will go to the government. If you withdraw $1,000, $10 from the balance remaining in your account will be sent to Washington. The e-mail claims that the bill, HR-4646, was introduced by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. Because DeFazio is from Oregon, Oregon PolitiFact checked into the claim and reported its findings last month. Here's what they said, reprinted with a few editing changes: The bill, HR-4646, is indeed actual legislation whose subject has something to do with taxation. But that's where the similarities end. The "Debt Free America Act" was introduced by Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Pa., in February 2010. He proposed a 1-percent tax on all money transactions, "including cash transactions, checks, credit cards, those processed through the Federal Reserve Bank, and those collected at the point of sale." Fattah's idea was to use the money to pay down the national debt and eventually replace the income tax. He has proposed similar legislation since 2004. HR-4646 had no support -- and certainly not from Obama's "finance team" -- and is now dying a quiet death in committee. Yet the resolution continues to live online, where the DeFazio connection has been repeated by a former Hernando County (Fla.) commissioner. Penny Dodge, DeFazio's chief of staff, told PolitiFact Oregon that the congressman opposes HR-4646. An unamused DeFazio doesn't know who is behind the e-mail attack. "It's slanderous," DeFazio said of the electronic claim. "I have nothing to do with the bill, no one pays any attention to the bill. It's chronically introduced, and never received any attention before this." One final point about the e-mail that's been circulating in Rhode Island. It says at the beginning, "You can confirm with Snopes as it is no exageration (sic)," a reference to our good friends at Snopes.com, which examines the truthfulness of urban legends. Yet if you actually search Snopes.com, you'll discover that the website concluded that it IS an exaggeration. That's a trend we've been seeing a lot lately -- e-mails with bogus information that try to sound authentic by falsely claiming that Snopes has found it to be true. For all those reasons, we rate this ridiculous e-mail Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-11-12T00:01:00	2010-10-31	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-08626	"Barnes opposed the creation of the HOPE Scholarship and campaigned against Zell Miller on the issue."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/20/GaGOP/republican/	There are some things you just don’t do. Ever. You know -- pull on Superman’s cape, spit into the wind. Oh yeah, and if you are a politician in Georgia, you can put dissing the HOPE Scholarship on that short list. That’s exactly what state Republicans have accused former Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes of doing. Barnes is running against Republican Nathan Deal and Libertarian John Monds in November to become the state’s next governor. But in 1990, Barnes was in a furious Democratic primary that included then-Lt. Gov Zell Miller and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young for the party’s nomination for governor. Barnes lost, and Miller defeated Young in a runoff. Barnes ran for governor again in 1998 and won, but he lost his bid for a second term to Republican Sonny Perdue four years later. "Barnes opposed the creation of the HOPE Scholarship and campaigned against Zell Miller on the issue," the GOP said in a Sept. 7 news release. It was among a number of charges the GOP leveled against Barnes. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether that was possible. How could someone run for statewide office in Georgia and oppose HOPE? HOPE provides full tuition and some book and fee money to college students who maintain at least a 3.0 grade-point average. The scholarship and the state's free pre-kindergarten classes are funded through lottery proceeds. The merit-based award is used by more than 200,000 Georgians a year. Barnes spokesman Emil Runge said Barnes has always supported the HOPE program, even though he opposed the lottery. "Over 20 years ago in a primary election, Roy Barnes said he was against the lottery, but in that same election he introduced a merit-based college scholarship program for Georgia’s college students that paid for tuition and other fees," Runge said. "As governor, Roy strengthened and protected HOPE, and expanded HOPE to students and teachers and made HOPE available for accredited home schoolers, students at technical colleges and paraprofessionals." So what's going on here? To get the answer, you have to travel back to another era of Georgia politics, back when Democrats ruled, as they had since the Reconstruction. Back then, in 1990, if a candidate won the Democratic primary, that person was likely to become Georgia's next governor. The Georgia Republican Party had yet to truly flex its muscle. The Democratic primary was, in fact, THE election in most statewide races those days. And the primary was a bruising, take-no-prisoners intraparty battle. Such was the case when Miller and Barnes squared off. Democratic operative James Carville, who would later become a well-known political brawler, was Miller's campaign manager. Newspaper articles from that era reveal just how intense and divisive the battle of the lottery had become. They detail Miller going from desk to desk on the state Senate, twisting arms to rally support for a state lottery to aid education. Then-Sen. Barnes, the articles state, was fighting just as hard against the proposal. Barnes at the time was the state Senate floor leader for Gov. Joe Frank Harris. "On the other side, Sen. Roy Barnes (D-Mableton) ... had hired a camera crew to capture for future campaign advertising the anti-lottery speech he delivered forcefully from the well of the Senate," noted one 1989 article published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The article reported that on the Senate floor, "Mr. Barnes said the lottery has not raised education spending dramatically in other states and misleads people into thinking they can get rich quick." "If you think it’s going to raise a bunch of money for education, you’re wrong," Barnes said, according to the article. Barnes was holding firm on his anti-lottery position in June 1990, according to an AJC article about a school board convention in Savannah. "Mr. Barnes praised the group for 'standing up against this politically popular but totally irresponsible campaign gimmick,' " the article states. Miller was elected governor in 1990. The lottery passed the Legislature in 1991, with the stipulation that all profits be used for education. Voters narrowly approved it in 1992. HOPE began the next year. Georgians today take the lottery, and HOPE, for granted. But in the run-up to the 1990 governor's race the proposal was dicey political terrain to trod, said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. By the time Barnes was publicly opposing it in 1989, it had already failed nine straight times before the Legislature. "When Zell Miller came out in favor of the lottery it was a risky move," Bullock said. "You were alienating major parts of Georgia's religious community." Barnes, in a recent Associated Press news story, talked about his initial opposition. "Originally, I had problems with the lottery," the former governor said in the interview. "I thought that it was the state taking advantage of its own people. But it's here." So was Barnes opposing the HOPE Scholarship when he opposed the lottery? Bullock said there is a distinction. "If you opposed Miller’s lottery program, you knew you were opposing some plans for education," Bullock said. "It was clear Miller was talking about new funding for education, but not specifically HOPE at that time." But the GOP release said Barnes specifically opposed HOPE. Barnes, ironically, used the same attack against Gov. Sonny Perdue eight years ago. An AJC article the month before the 2002 election details how Barnes had released an attack ad accusing Perdue of opposing HOPE because he had opposed the lottery in the Senate years earlier. Barnes was toying with the truth in the 2002 TV ad. And the state GOP is using the same tactic against Barnes this year. Barnes did oppose a state lottery. That much is clear. If Barnes had been elected in 1990, it is highly doubtful the state lottery would have passed during his tenure. And without the lottery, HOPE would not exist. The lottery eventually became the funding mechanism for the popular scholarship program. However, Barnes never specifically opposed HOPE, and he even backed expanding the scholarship program on his watch. The GOP statement about Barnes contains some element of truth. But it also ignores critical facts that would give a reasonable person a different impression. We rate the GOP claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09832	"Any government-run 'public' plan ... forces more employers to drop employee coverage due to rising costs and pay an additional 8% payroll tax for each worker."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/26/ginny-brown-waite/health-care-bill-does-not-force-employers-drop-c/	Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite sent a mailing to constituents explaining her opposition to the Democrats' health care reform plan. "Unfortunately, I believe the legislation currently being considered in the House of Representatives could spark the government takeover of health care," she wrote. "The American people will have fewer choices, rationed care and higher costs. This is the last thing we need right now." Brown-Waite, a Florida Republican, lists bullet points for why she opposes reform. One of the points says, "Any Government-Run 'Public' Plan ... Forces more employers to drop employee coverage due to rising costs and pay an additional 8% payroll tax for each worker." Her phrasing is misleading. As we've noted before , the House health care reform bill leaves the employer-provided health insurance in place. It seeks to make it easier for individuals to buy health insurance on their own by creating a national health care exchange, a kind of one-stop shop for health insurance. One of the options on the exchange will be a government-run plan that provides basic coverage at a price likely to be lower than private insurers. So her description of the overall health bill as a "government-run 'public' plan" is a distortion of the plan. That is only one element, and a small one at that. In another item, we addressed claims from the mailer about how much the health bill would cost. Here, we'll address her claim that health reform "forces more employers to drop employee coverage due to rising costs and pay an additional 8% payroll tax for each worker." It's true that the overall plan imposes a penalty on employers who don't offer health insurance to their workers. Employers with payrolls over $400,000 pay an 8 percent penalty on their total payroll. That means it's not a tax for "each worker," but a tax on overall payroll. Small businesses are exempt from a penalty if their total payroll is less than $250,000 a year. We've read all 1,000 pages of the House bill, though, and it seems clear that the penalty is intended to be a disincentive to dropping health care insurance. The tax penalty is part of a section titled "Shared Responsibility" that includes a requirement that all individuals carry health insurance. Brown-Waite writes that the plan forces more employers to drop coverage "due to rising costs." Some who oppose the reform believe that it will inevitably result in higher costs, forcing employers to drop coverage. But that would be an unintended consequence. The exchange is intended to foster competition and lower costs, not force people into a public plan. (For more details on this issue, read our story Health care reform: a simple explanation .) The mailer gives the impression that the bill forces employers to drop coverage and then taxes them to create a government plan. We turned to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan research center that collects and analyzes data on employee benefit plans. The institute does not take positions on policy issues. We asked if it was likely that employers would drop coverage if the House bill passed. "I don't think anybody really knows what employers are going to do," said Paul Fronstein, a senior researcher. Employers offer benefits voluntarily right now, he said, and they do it for business reasons, because it helps them recruit and retain workers. Most workers prefer not to have to buy insurance on their own. "Employers offer coverage to be competitive in the labor market, and they offer coverage because their workers have no alternative due to the dysfunctional individual market," he said. If health reform makes the individual market more competitive, employers might not feel like they must offer health benefits to retain their workers. We should note that the tax penalty, sometimes called an employer mandate, remains controversial and may not be part of the final legislation. We find Brown-Waite's statement misrepresents the way the bill works. We asked her office for an explanation but got no response. It's worth noting that the mailing reads like campaign literature, but was actually paid for with tax dollars. Members of Congress get to mail their constituents without paying postage, a perk known as "franking," and Brown-Waite's mailer clearly states it was "prepared, published and mailed at taxpayer expense." We find Brown-Waite's mailer does not accurately describe the bill. She incorrectly describes the overall plan as a "government-run 'public' plan." She is right that there is an 8 percent tax, but she mischaracterizes it as a tax on all businesses, when it is a tax on employers who do not offer health insurance. We rate her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Dennis Kucinich accurately described the lifespan of the popular program. "You know, of course we ought to be raising the cap in order to protect Social Security, which is solid through about 2040 without any changes whatsoever," he said. U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton also referred to that date. Indeed, the most recent report by Social Security actuaries concludes that 2041 is the year when the system would run out of money. To be sure, while the system is "solid" until then, that doesn't mean it doesn't need attention. If no changes are made, as Kucinich says, the annual cost of paying out benefits will exceed the payroll tax money flowing in by 2017, according to the 2007 report from Social Security actuaries. From that point forward, benefit payments would come out of the Social Security trust fund. The year 2041 is when all those assets would be exhausted. The cap Kucinich mentions is a limit on the amount of salary that is taxed for Social Security. Right now, that cap is at $97,500, but Kucinich said he supports raising it to tax more income. In 2007, the program had 50-million beneficiaries and 163-million covered workers and their families.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2007-09-27T00:00:00	2007-09-26	['None']
pomt-00030	That Kurt Russell said President Donald Trump is "relentless," "dedicated," "determined" and "courageous" and "stands there in the face of pure evil, rock solid & ready to fight for us. God bless this brave man."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/no-kurt-russell-did-not-tweet-trump-relentless-ded/	A recent Facebook post displaying a picture of Kurt Russell with a quote from the actor praising President Donald Trump has been circulating the social media site. After its posting on Saturday, the photo-quote combo quickly spread and has been shared more than 7,500 times within three days. Facebook flagged this post as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As you might have guessed, Kurt Russell didn’t actually say it. Here is the quote attributed to the actor, in full: "President Donald J. Trump is relentless. I've never seen a man so dedicated & determined. I'd like to think I would be as courageous as he is, but I just don't know. The world is after him & he stands there in the face of pure evil, rock solid & ready to fight for us. God bless this brave man." #VoteRedToSaveAmerica We found the first instance of this quote originated on Twitter the morning of Nov. 3 by an account belonging to "Snake Plissken," which uses Kurt Russell’s photo as a profile picture. Kurt Russell played a character named S.D. Bob "Snake" Plissken in the films "Escape from New York" and "Escape from L.A." In addition to the fact that the account does not have a blue verified check mark signifying it is actually an account belonging to the famous actor Kurt Russell, the account’s Twitter biography states plainly, "I’m not Kurt Russell." Nevertheless, as of Monday afternoon, the tweet has been retweeted over 5,000 times and has more than 12,000 likes. Russell has had his quotes taken out of context before.

pomt-00335	Says CNN’s Anderson Cooper stood in a ditch during Hurricane Florence to exaggerate water levels.	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/18/viral-image/hoax-uses-2008-anderson-cooper-photo-proof-fake-hu/	A 10-year-old photo of CNN’s Anderson Cooper is circulating the internet as "evidence" of exaggerated Hurricane Florence coverage by the media. Variations of the post have generated thousands of social media shares, including Donald Trump Jr. on Twitter and a senior official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Instagram. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Speaking from the studio, Cooper took the last 10 minutes of Anderson Cooper 360° on Sept. 17 to defend himself against the 2008 photo-turned-2018 meme that said he exaggerated the floodwater levels of Hurricane Florence by standing or kneeling in a ditch. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo was taken during a liveshot in 2008 while Cooper was in Texas covering Hurricane Ike. Clips of the 2008 footage were posted on several blogs at the time, verifying the segment’s age. At the time, Ike had been downgraded to a tropical storm, but there was still significant flooding in the area where Cooper was reporting. Cooper notes several times that the water is receding. At one point, he has his cameraman film a wooden pole that is still wet from when water levels were about a foot-and-a-half higher. "You can see the water is definitely going down," he said in the 2008 liveshot. Cooper also said in the original liveshot that he’s standing next to a road that is on higher ground than most of the area and is being used for evacuations. He points out that there is a drop-off from the road to the surrounding area. In his fact-checking segment, Cooper said his camera crew was standing near the road to keep the camera equipment dry. He also said he was not standing on the road because he did not want to hinder the evacuation efforts. Doug Thomas, a long-time CNN audio technician, was the cameraman seen in the viral photo. He died in September 2017. Our ruling This photo comes from 2008 coverage of Hurricane Ike. Cooper repeatedly shows the range of water depth in the liveshot and is not on his knees or in a ditch. Because the photo is from 2008, the liveshot was not taken to "make @realDonaldTrump look bad." We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-02892	The University of Texas is starting "the first medical school at a major Tier One" university "in the last 50 years."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/nov/08/steve-leslie/one-measure-ut-opening-first-medical-school-top-ti/	A University of Texas official declared that the Dell Medical School slated to open in Austin in time for students to enroll in 2016 happens to be the first one to debut at a top-notch research university in decades. Steve Leslie, the university’s special assistant to the president for medical education, prefaced the claim to history by telling Austin-area residents at the Oct. 29, 2013, town hall that the school will shine. "We will follow through on making this an outstanding medical school that all of you expect us to deliver for Austin and Travis County and for the state of Texas and more broadly than that," Leslie said. "This is the first medical school at a major Tier One public research university, major Tier One university public or private, in the last 50 years; these are big deals to start." Other U.S. universities have opened medical schools more recently, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. By email, spokeswoman Lesley Ward listed about half a dozen examples including Florida State University. But the UT official made a more nuanced claim by referring to UT’s uniqueness among major "Tier One" institutions. Leslie's descriptive, "Tier One," has nothing to do with UT’s famous Main Building or, for that matter, big cakes. But it’s familiar to us because in 2012, we rated as Mostly True a group’s statement that Austin "is the biggest city in America with a Tier One research university (UT-Austin) but without a medical school." That claim could have been clarified with the detail that Texas A&M University has a medical college in nearby Round Rock that it wants to develop into a full-blown school. And in that story, we explored how to define a Tier One university, partly by considering the suggestion that about five dozen institutions that are members of the Association of American Universities should be considered Tier One schools. The association says it chooses members "based on the high quality of programs of academic research and scholarship and undergraduate, graduate, and professional education in a number of fields, as well as general recognition that a university is outstanding by reason of the excellence of its research and education programs." Leslie’s claim, a UT spokesman told us, was based on institutions that were AAU members before they opened their medical schools. He noted by email that AAU membership also was the indicator relied upon in a Jan. 8, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news blog post stating that Texas had three Tier One universities: UT, Texas A&M University and Rice University. Leslie did not mention the AAU-first distinction in his town-hall remarks. Susswein said by email that if Leslie had done so, audience members might not have understood, so he "used the common shorthand" of Tier One. "Any way you cut it, it's been a long time since a medical school has been started at a top-tier AAU university," Susswein wrote. Susswein also emailed us a spreadsheet showing when AAU-member institutions have opened medical schools since 1955 and when those institutions became AAU members. UT has been an AAU member since 1929. The spreadsheet indicated that two other institutions opened medical schools about 50 years ago after they were AAU members or the year they joined that group. Penn State University, an AAU member since 1900, opened a medical school in 1963, while Michigan State University opened a medical school in 1964, the year it joined the AAU. The spreadsheet indicated four institutions opened medical schools between 1966 and 1977 before becoming AAU members. These were the University of California Davis; the University of Arizona; UC San Diego; and Texas A&M University. We confirmed that each of those universities joined the AAU after their medical schools opened, according to university web pages and a list of AAU member-institutions. Then again, we became aware of a wider way of identifying Tier One universities during our 2012 look at that classification. At the time, AAU spokesman Barry Toiv said by telephone that in exploring how to define such universities, he would defer to a list of 108 doctorate-granting universities with "very high research" activity as designated by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which traces its classification of colleges and universities to work by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. And our check of institutional web pages indicated that among the universities designated by Carnegie as having "very high research" activity, several opened medical schools in the latest few decades. Specifically, the University of South Florida enrolled its charter class in 1971; the University of South Carolina opened its medical school to students in 1977; the Florida State University College of Medicine welcomed its first students in 2001; and the University of Central Florida established its medical school in 2006. By email, Susswein said he recognized "that others may use a broader definition for ‘Tier One’ universities. Under that broader definition, we are one of a handful of top-tier universities to launch a medical school in the past 50 years." Our ruling Leslie said UT is starting "the first medical school at a major Tier One" university "in the last 50 years." As Leslie did not say, UT is the first institution that was already in the prestigious AAU to plan a medical school launch since Michigan State and Penn State opened schools 49 and 50 years ago, respectively. Several other AAU-member universities opened medical schools from 1966 to 1977, but none was a member of the association at the time their medical school opened. Another way of identifying top-tier universities, the Carnegie approach, places UT among more than 100 very high-research institutions. We identified four universities considered high-research entities--though none of them is in the AAU--that opened medical schools from 1971 to 2006. We rate Leslie’s claim, which would have benefited from these clarifications, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-05724	The Atlanta area’s water planning district "is now the national leader in conservation."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/06/pat-stevens/claim-atlanta-area-national-leader-water-conservat/	Atlanta may be known as the capital of the South. Or for its place in civil rights history. Or for the fact that an alarming number of its road names include the word "peachtree." Now a local water official thinks the metro area deserves another claim to fame: leader in water conservation. Pat Stevens is chief of the Environmental Planning Division of the Atlanta Regional Commission, which staffs the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District. This district manages the region’s water supply. Stevens told a group of business leaders that the planning district is outpacing even California, which has earned national attention for its water conservation efforts. "The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District is now the national leader in conservation," Stevens told the crowd, according to a Jan. 24 story on AccessNorthGa.com. "We have out-California'ed California," Stevens said. We were curious. Since when was this region a leader in water conservation? Water is a precious commodity in Georgia, so much so that the state has been battling Alabama and Florida in federal court for water rights for decades. The state’s water supply is uncertain, and in 2001, state legislators created the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District to develop the region’s water policy and coordinate its implementation. We called up Stevens, who told PolitiFact Georgia that she typically says that the planning district is "a" national leader in conservation, not "the" national leader, but she doesn’t dispute the accuracy of the news story. We evaluated her quote as published. We also sought out top experts in water conservation for their assessments. They acknowledged that the Atlanta region has made improvements in its water planning, but all thought that calling the area "the" national leader, or even "a" national leader, goes too far. "None of that is true," said Mary Ann Dickinson, executive director for the Alliance for Water Efficiency, a national water conservation group. "I wouldn’t say that metro Atlanta is the leader in conservation efficiency by any means," said Jenny Hoffner, the director of the water supply program for American Rivers, a national group that advocates for clean water and conservation. "On its face, it’s a silly claim. But that’s not to say that Atlanta hasn’t made some great strides," said Charles Fishman, a journalist who specializes in water issues. Stevens cited several specifics to defend her statement. We’ll address the major ones here. * Nowhere else in the country have so many local governments come together to do this kind of work over such a short period of time: The metro water district covers 15 counties from Hall to Coweta counties, an area that includes more than 90 cities and dozens of water systems. It was founded in 2001, decades after similar organizations in places such as Southern California and Las Vegas were founded. The North Georgia district is relatively young. But at least one larger area -- California -- is implementing specific water conservation goals. A 2009 law requires the state to reduce urban per-capita water use 20 percent by 2020. As of 2009, the local district’s plans were less ambitious. Water planners expect a 13 percent reduction in water use by 2035 if water systems follow district rules. The district has since made changes to its rules that are not accounted for in this prediction. * Declines in per-capita water use: According to metro water district numbers, per-capita water use has declined from 149 gallons per day in 2000 to 110 gallons in 2010. Critics said that outside factors such as the economy might play a role in this reduction Utility use typically declines during a downturn. * Following North Georgia water district conservation rules is mandatory: The 2001 state statute establishing the water district requires members to follow the district’s rules or face permit revocation. No permit has been revoked for water conservation problems, a Georgia Environmental Protection Division spokesman said. California also sanctions water suppliers who fail to comply with its water conservation statute. They are not eligible for state water grants or loans. Experts gave PolitiFact Georgia other rebuttals to the metro district’s claims. Dickinson noted that the district does not fund conservation efforts such as low-flow toilet replacement rebates. That’s the responsibility of local governments and water services. By way of contrast, Dickinson cited the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. This water district has budgeted $19.1 million this fiscal year to fund business and consumer rebates on things such as more efficient toilets, sprinklers, washing machines, and for pulling out water-thirsty turf, according to its spokesman. All the experts we interviewed noted that the North Georgia district has not set specific, mandatory water use reduction goals as California has done. They also listed programs they think are innovative and more effective at reducing water use. They included a law in Orlando that requires developers to install reclaimed water lines to new subdivisions. In San Antonio, nonprofit businesses can get low-flow toilets for free, including installation. The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District certainly deserves credit where credit is due. Per-capita water use is down (though the cause is disputed) and current rules do aim to conserve water. But we found no consensus that the region has a reputation as a national leader in water conservation, much less as "the" national leader. Given what we found, a stronger claim is that the region is playing catch-up. The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District was formed decades after similar organizations elsewhere, and it doesn’t fund conservation efforts that other areas have. Since Stevens’ statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, her statement meets PolitiFact’s definition of Mostly False.

As the new year began, McCain fought back with two Web ads rapping Romney on his foreign policy experience. The ads claim Romney says the next president doesn't need foreign policy experience. Romney has never uttered those words, but here's what he did say on the Fox News program Hannity & Colmes : "If we want somebody who has a lot of experience in foreign policy, we can simply go to the State Department and pluck out one of the tens of thousands of people who work there." Romney, whose comments came in the wake of the assassination of Pakistan opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, also told CNN's Anderson Cooper: "If foreign policy experience were the measure for selecting a president, we'd just go to the State Department and pick up one of the thousands and thousands of people who've spent their whole life in foreign policy." That has become Romney's standard response to questions about his foreign policy experience. He says the nation needs a leader rather than a specialist in foreign affairs and often cites Ronald Reagan as an example of a strong leader without a foreign policy background. By contrast, McCain plays up his foreign policy credentials from his time in the Senate, especially his role as an outspoken supporter of additional troops in Iraq. It's clear that Romney didn't say exactly what McCain has attributed to him. It also is clear that while McCain doesn't quote him directly, he's taking Romney's words a bit too literally. The question then is how to judge the accuracy of what McCain has charged. Did Romney say a president doesn't need foreign policy experience? Mostly, yes he did.

pomt-08153	"There’s talk in Congress now about basically confiscating your private 401(k) or IRA plan and rolling it into Social Security to strengthen Social Security."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/03/william-howell/virginia-speaker-william-howell-says-congress-cons/	Your tax-deferred retirement savings are in danger of being seized by the federal government warns William Howell, speaker of Virginia’s House of Delegates. "There’s talk in Congress now about basically confiscating your private 401(k) or IRA plan and rolling it into Social Security to strengthen Social Security," Howell, R-Stafford, said during a Nov. 13 interview on Freedom & Prosperity Radio, a conservative weekly show broadcast in much of Virginia. Howell made the statement to bolster his pet cause: Passage of a U.S. constitutional amendment that would give states the collective right to repeal any law or regulation approved by the U.S. Congress. Under the proposed amendment, which Howell will ask the Virginia General Assembly to endorse this winter, a federal act would be nullified if two-thirds of the states passed resolutions demanding so. Howell brought up the confiscation of IRAs and 401(k)s, then added: "Well, if Congress were ever to pass a law like that, I would think two-thirds of the states would rear up and say, `I want to repeal that law,’ and this (amendment) would give them the right to do that." When we asked Howell for the basis of his confiscation claim, he said, "That idea has been floating around from Democrats for years." That was news to the AARP, a powerful lobby for Americans for seniors that watches legislation affecting retirement accounts and Social Security. "Haven’t heard anything like that at all," said Ginger McDaniel, communications director of AARP Virginia, when read Howell’s confiscation comment. "I’m sure we would know if anything like that was being considered." It was also a surprise to Roberton Williams, an economist and senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington who specializes in pensions and retirement accounts. "I’ve heard absolutely nothing about that," he said. "If that was a serious suggestion, it would be all over the place in this town." Howell’s office later sent us a variety of sources to back his claim. They all seem to stem from an Oct 7, 2008 hearing by the House Committee on Education and Labor probing the recession’s impact on retirement security. The values of 401(k)s and IRAs were plummeting. The panel discussed whether the federal government should promote alternative plans that would shield retirement savings from economic turmoil. One of the speakers was Teresa Ghilarducci, an economics professor at the New School for Social Research, a New York City think tank. She urged creation of a new savings plan that she called a Guaranteed Retirement Account. It would require workers to save 5 percent of their annual pay. The accounts, unlike IRAs and 401Ks, would not be controlled by workers but instead deposited with the federal government, which would kick in $600 a year in the form of a tax credit. Upon a worker’s retirement, the government would guarantee an annual return three percent above inflation. Ghilarducci also proposed that Congress "allow" workers to convert their IRAs and 401Ks into a Guaranteed Retirement Account, according to a video of the hearing. There was no talk about coercion or government seizure of existing accounts. A story on the hearing in the next day’s Washington Post made no reference to a confiscation plan and waited until the 12th paragraph to make its only mention of Ghilarducci. There was no coverage in The New York Times. Almost a month later, on Nov. 4, 2008, the conservative Carolina Journal Online used Ghilarducci’s testimony to write, "Democrats in the U.S. House have been conducting hearings on proposals to confiscate worker’s personal retirement accounts, including 401(k)s and IRAs and convert them into accounts managed by the Social Security Administration." Howell’s office sent us a copy of the story. The web has been replete with unfounded rumors of retirement account confiscation ever since. They usually cite Ghilarducci’s testimony. Another rumor -- although Howell doesn’t mention it -- puts Vice President Joe Biden behind the seizure effort. The source is said to be a report Biden released in February on the state of the middle class. We read the section on retirement security and found proposals to encourage savings, but nothing that remotely suggested confiscation of retirement assets. Howell, despite his radio comments, said the public shouldn’t lose sleep worrying about the seizure of retirement plans. He said the November 2 elections, which put Republicans back in control of the House of Representatives, have eased his mind. "I know its not going to happen now that the Republicans have the House," he said. "But I use it as the kind of thing that could happen in Congress if its powers are unchecked." Howell’s radio comments, sounding the confiscation alert, came 11 days after the election. So let’s review: Howell says there’s "talk in Congress about basically confiscating your private 401(k) or IRA," which suggests there is serious consideration of such a proposal. He cites two-year-old testimony by a think-tank economist that makes no mention of seizing tax-deferred saving plans. We can’t find a single story in a national newspaper that warns of confiscation. AARP, the nation’s largest lobby for seniors with a reported 40 million members, says it "hasn’t heard anything about it at all."

pomt-11875	"For the last 10 years, our economy has grown at less than 2 percent on average every single year for 10 years. We have not had a decade like that in a century in America."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/31/james-lankford/lankford-overstates-slow-growth-past-100-years/	The Republican message on tax reform is that it holds the key to kicking the economy into high gear. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has talked of steady yearly growth of 3 percent or more each year with passage of the package. Many economists, regardless of their economic leanings, say that prediction is unlikely to play out, but Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said it makes sense to him. "If the economy is stuck in the same track over and over again, somehow, you have got to be able to bump that to get it going," Lankford said on CBS News’ Face the Nation on Oct. 22. "For the last 10 years, our economy has grown at less than 2 percent on average every single year for 10 years. We have not had a decade like that in a century in America." The government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis tracks economic growth, and that’s where we turned to check Lankford’s statement about America’s lackluster performance compared to the last 100 years. His office told us he was looking at average growth from 2007 to 2016. According to the government statistics, real gross domestic product, or GDP, rose an average of 1.37 percent during that time. The yearly rates ranged from a drop of -2.8 percent at the low point of the Great Recession in 2009 to a high of 2.9 percent in 2015. So yes, the average is less than 2 percent, as he said. Lankford then counted each 10-year period working backward from 2007. His office sent us these numbers, using BEA data: 1967-76 3 1977-86 3.4 1987-96 3 1997-2006 3.3 2007-16 1.4 This raises a couple of questions about his specific words. First, Lankford said growth hadn’t been so low in a century. The bureau’s data only goes back to 1930, which is less than 100 years ago. Lankford would need more than another dozen years of data. His data source can’t prove his point. Second, the exact nature of Lankford’s decades was unique to his claim. Counting backwards by tens from 2016 isn’t necessarily the only way to define a decade. Yes, a decade means 10 years. But often, when talking about history, it means a 10-year period beginning in years that end in zero. The History Channel, for example, has its sections on the 1960s, the 1970s and so on. Based on that understanding, the numbers would tell a different story. In the first decade of this century, 2000 to 2009, the average annual rate of growth was 1.82 percent. That would undercut his argument that growth has not been under 2 percent for each decade going back a century. Then again, looking back at the decades between 1930 and 1999, average annual growth in each period has been over 2 percent. Our ruling Lankford said that average yearly growth in the past 10 years has been under 2 percent and that "we have not had a decade like that in a century in America." Lankford is correct that growth since 2007 has averaged under 2 percent. The data don’t carry his argument over a full century because the government numbers only go back to 1930, not 1917 as would be necessary. He also has cherry-picked his definition of a decade. His numbers are correct by the yardstick he chose, but by another common interpretation of decade, average growth in the first 10 years of this century fell below 2 percent. That runs counter to the heart of his assertion. At the same time, using that definition, it is fair to say that growth since 2000 has been lower than in the decades before that.

pomt-07036	"If you look at our tax mix, the share of corporate revenues as a percentage of our overall revenue mix has declined by about half over the last 30 years."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/02/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-corporate-taxes-share-us-revenue-/	Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has spent months trying to fashion a bipartisan plan to slash the federal debt through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. In a June 27 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Warner seemed confident that the two parties would reach an expedient budget deal that will increase the national debt limit before an Aug. 2 deadline when the U.S. faces possible default on it loans. But Warner questioned the will of Congress and business to repair long-term structural problems in the federal budget that have caused debt to soar. "I get discouraged when I hear some of my friends say we need to ease the tax burden on business," he said, stating that corporate income taxes make up a much smaller percentage of total U.S. revenue than they did a generation ago. "If you look at our tax mix, the share of corporate revenues as a percentage of our overall revenue mix has declined by about half over the last 30 years," Warner said. We reported in Junethat the U.S. tax rate on corporate profits, at 35 percent, is the highest among industrialized democracies. The effective corporate tax rate, a calculation of the average rate businesses actually pay after deductions, is 27.6 percent and ranks fourth highest among international economies. Warner’s comments raised a new question on the topic: Did the corporate contribution to U.S. revenues really shrink by 50 percent? Kevin Hall, Warner’s spokesman, said the senator compared Congressional Budget Office figures from 2009 to those in 1979. In 2009, corporate payments made up 6.6 percent of total government revenue, down from 14.2 percent in 1979. So that is a reduction of more than half the earlier share. Both years were times of economic gloom. The earlier year saw an oil crisis and gasoline shortages in the wake of the Iranian revolution. In July, President Jimmy Carter called on the nation to reduce oil imports and energy use during his "crisis of confidence" speech. And in 2009, the recession-wracked nation was combating its worst economy in 75 years. The Dow Jones Industrial average bottom out at 6,626 points, about 47 percent beneath its current level. The unemployment rate hit 10.1 percent in October. By choosing 2009 as a year of comparison, Warner is cherrypicking his statistics. Businesses struggled that year, and the 6.6 percent share of federal revenues paid by corporations was the lowest mark in 26 years. Had Warner used 2010 as the end date of a 30-year comparison, he would have come up with less sensational numbers. In 1980, when the top corporate rate was 46 percent, income from those payments made up 12.5 percent of all revenue, compared with 8.9 percent in 2010. In fiscal 2011, which ends in September 30, corporate payments are expected to make up 9.1 percent of revenue, compared with 10.2 percent in 1981. What about the three fiscal years before 2009? How did corporate taxes compare to the figure from 30 years earlier? *2008: 12.1 percent, compared with 15.0 percent in 1978 *2007: 14.4 percent, compared with 15.4 percent in 1977. *2006: 14.7 percent, compared with 13.1 percent in 1976. So in the three years before 2009, the share of corporate tax revenue was barely changed from the levels of 30 years ago. The gap in 2010 shrunk substantially from the gap in 2009, and this year’s gap is projected to be even smaller. But if you go further back, from 2001 through 2003 the corporate revenue was half of that 30 years before. In 2004, payments were about 33 percent lower then 1974, and in 2005 the decrease was about 13 percent. In the decade stretching from 2001 through 2010, corporate taxes averaged 10.3 percent of total federal revenue. During the stretch from 1971 to 1980, those taxes averaged 14.2 percent of revenue. So the decline from 30 years ago is really more like one-fourth, not the one-half cited by Warner. Let’s review. Mark Warner says corporate taxes, as a share of total government revenue, have fallen by half in 30 years. He has focused on 2009, which creates the biggest gap, but Warner’s statement holds true for three other years in the last decade compared with 30 years earlier. But for the majority of years in the last decade, Warner’s statement does not hold up. The decline over the last 30 years -- comparing averages from the 1970s to those of the last decade -- is 27.7 percent. Warner is right about the overall trend of corporate taxes providing a smaller share of government funding. But by focusing on 2009, he exaggerates the decline. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-14030	California has "the same water infrastructure from when we were 16 million people."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/may/31/dianne-feinstein/does-california-have-same-water-infrastructure-it-/	U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, has called solving California’s water wars one of the toughest challenges of her career. Tougher, she says, than passing a federal assault weapons ban in 1994. But the reason the 82-year-old lawmaker says she keeps pushing is simple: The state’s water infrastructure is outdated and its drought emergency persists. She has spearheaded a bill that would pump $1.3 billion into water desalination, recycling and storage projects. One of her recent comments about the need for that bill caught our attention. California has "the same water infrastructure from when we were 16 million people," Feinstein said in a Q&A with the Sacramento Bee on April 3, 2016. "We had better get cracking, because it’s only going to get worse." She made a similar claim on February 19, 2016 during a speech at a Public Policy Institute of California event. Feinstein makes the claim at the 27:30 mark in the Public Policy Institute of California video above. Was Feinstein right? Does California, a state known for innovation, really rely on a plumbing system from generations ago with no substantial upgrades? View of the Oroville Dam in Northern California. Construction started on this early piece of the State Water Project in 1957. It was partially completed by 1964. Photo by Dept. of Water Resources. Our research California is now home to nearly 40 million people. It was more than a half century ago, around 1960, when the state had about 15.7 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. To get a better read on Feinstein’s accuracy, we spoke with Jay Lund, director for the Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis. "In some ways it’s true," Lund said. "We haven’t built very large water projects for quite a long time -- since the State Water Project, really." Construction started in the late 1950s and early 1960s on the State Water Project, a massive set of reservoirs, aqueducts and pumping plants that store and deliver water up and down the state to 25 million Californians. The backbone of the project, including Lake Oroville and the California Aqueduct, was finished in the 1960s and early 1970s. Chrisman Pumping Plant at the Grapevine is one of the southernmost along the California Aqueduct. Photo By Amy Quinton / Capital Public Radio. Feinstein’s spokesman, Tom Mentzer, pointed to a state timeline for the project to explain the senator’s statement. Her claim "conveys the idea that California’s core water conveyance and storage infrastructure was designed when the state’s population was approximately 16 million," Mentzer said. "The timeline shows initial facilities were finished by the 1970s. A number of subsequent facilities were built later, but they’re not the core infrastructure." Construction on another ambitious project -- the federal government’s Central Valley Water Project, which irrigates the San Joaquin Valley -- started in the late 1930s and was completed in the early 1970s. Smaller projects Lund said California hasn’t built anything as large since then. Some of the state’s major water districts have independently added "some important pieces" of storage and conveyance in the last couple of decades, Lund said. One example is Diamond Valley Lake in Riverside County, the largest reservoir in Southern California. It was completed in 2000 by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and holds up to 800,000 acre feet of water, "almost as big as Folsom (Lake)," Lund noted. Another is Los Vaqueros Reservoir, completed in 1998 by the Contra Costa Water District near Brentwood. It holds 160,000 acre feet. And last December, the $1 billion Carlsbad Desalination Project, built by private firm Poseidon Water, started converting ocean water into drinking water for residents in San Diego County. It’s expected to contribute up to 10 percent of the region’s water supply. California’s water system is "not exactly the same," as the early 1960s, Lund added. "But it’s substantially the same in terms of the broad water supply and flood control projects." Projects above represent the bulk of the California State Water Project (SWP) as well as a few additional projects, it does not represent all the water projects in California. Our ruling U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein said California has "the same water infrastructure from when we were 16 million people." Large portions of the state’s modern-day water system, including the State Water Project and Central Valley Project were built in the 1960s, when California reached the 16 million population mark. Some pieces of those systems, which continue to provide water to California’s cities and farms, were completed in the 1970s. In more recent decades, water districts have constructed significant storage reservoirs, plus a large desalination plant, to supplement regional supplies. Feinstein’s comment could have used this additional information. Still, it’s clear that California has not constructed any new statewide projects to match the scale of those of started in the 1960s.

pomt-07574	"Regime change (in Iraq) took eight years"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-regime-change-iraq-took-eight-ye/	During a March 28, 2011, address to the nation, President Barack Obama drew a comparison between his course in Libya -- where the United States and its allies are enforcing a no-fly zone against Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi -- and Iraq, where Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush, used military force to oust Saddam Hussein. "The task that I assigned our forces -- to protect the Libyan people from immediate danger and to establish a no-fly zone -- carries with it a (United Nations) mandate and international support," Obama said in a televised address from National Defense University in Washington, D.C. "It’s also what the Libyan opposition asked us to do. If we tried to overthrow Gadhafi by force, our coalition would splinter. We would likely have to put U.S. troops on the ground to accomplish that mission or risk killing many civilians from the air. The dangers faced by our men and women in uniform would be far greater. So would the costs and our share of the responsibility for what comes next." He continued by making a comparison to the Iraq War. "To be blunt, we went down that road in Iraq," Obama said. "Thanks to the extraordinary sacrifices of our troops and the determination of our diplomats, we are hopeful about Iraq’s future. But regime change there took eight years, thousands of American and Iraqi lives, and nearly a trillion dollars. That is not something we can afford to repeat in Libya." We wondered whether it was fair for Obama to say that "regime change" in Iraq "took eight years" -- which would mean that it’s still ongoing or that it recently ended. Whether Obama is correct depends heavily on the definition of "regime change." Is it accomplished simply with the ouster of the old regime? Or is it accomplished with the installation of a new, stable government? To investigate this question, let’s recap the chronology of the political situation in Iraq, starting with the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. To assemble the chronology, we’ve drawn heavily on a detailed BBC chronology of recent Iraqi history. 2003 May: U.N. Security Council officially backs U.S.-led interim authority. Baath Party and institutions of the former regime are abolished. July: U.S.-appointed governing council holds its first meeting. December: Hussein captured. 2004 June: U.S. turns over sovereignty to interim government of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. 2005 January: Eight million votes cast in Transitional National Assembly elections. April: Parliament names Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, president, and Ibrahim Jaafari, a Shiite, prime minister. October: Voters approve a new, federal democratic constitution. December: Iraqis vote for first full-term government and parliament since the invasion. 2006 January: Shiite-led United Iraqi Alliance wins election but falls short of a majority. April: President Talabani asks Shiite compromise candidate Nouri al-Maliki to form a new government. December: Hussein executed. 2007 August: A key Sunni bloc, the Iraqi Accordance Front, withdraws from the cabinet following a dispute over power-sharing. 2008 July: The Iraqi Accordance Front rejoins the government. 2010 March: No coalition wins enough votes for a parliamentary majority. August: Iraq's two main political blocs suspend talks on forming a government. November: Parliament reconvenes and reappoints Talabani as president and al-Maliki as prime minister. December: Parliament ends deadlock and approves a new government, minus a few ministries where no agreement could be reached. We see supporting evidence for either interpretation of "regime change" in this chronology. On the one hand, Hussein’s regime was ousted quickly after the war began and was succeeded by a U.N.-sanctioned transitional government. In turn, the transitional government was succeeded by a democratically elected interim government and two subsequent rounds of democratic parliamentary elections, all supported by a voter-approved constitution. On the other hand, Obama has a point that the process of establishing a new government has been, at best, imperfect and drawn-out. At various points, the process of forming a government has slipped into months of paralysis. "Regime transition can take a long time, even a decade or more," said Marc Chernick, a foreign policy specialist who teaches at Georgetown University. "What Obama stated was perfectly fair, indeed, even optimistic, as it is not clear to me that a new regime, especially a democratic regime, has been consolidated." And establishing democracy in Iraq required the presence initially of U.S. troops -- through August 2010, when the final U.S. combat brigades withdrew -- and now home-grown forces. "The regime has relied on foreign forces to prop it up for eight years," said Robin Wright, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace. "Especially during the 2004-2007 period, the U.S. secured the state from foreign fighters, al-Qaida and an insurgency. The regime change was arguably not viable until Iraqi troops could take over from the U.S." Michael O’Hanlon, a foreign policy specialist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, agrees that both interpretations are credible, though "on balance, I think his point is fair. He was clearly describing the overall effort, not a particular phase of the campaign." Ultimately, we think both interpretations of the term "regime change" are credible. Obama has clearly staked out a position on one end of the spectrum, which experts tell us is a defensible approach. But we think it's also valid to point out that the Hussein regime is long gone, replaced by an internationally recognized successor government. While that government has been less than stable, other democratic countries have had periods of political volatility as well. We rate Obama’s statement Half True.

pomt-01046	"Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/23/andy-puzder/ceo-carls-jr-says-obamacare-has-caused-millions-fu/	Critics of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s health care law, have assembled a long list of complaints about the law. One provision that’s getting increasing scrutiny these days is the penalty on employers who don’t provide their workers with health insurance. For workers who are on the job at least 30 hours per week, companies must offer health coverage or be hit with a financial penalty. The Obama administration twice delayed enforcement of this requirement, but it finally took effect this month for companies with at least 100 workers, and it is set to start next year for companies with between 50 and 99 workers. (The rule will not apply to small businesses with fewer than 50 workers.) Some Republicans have urged changing the rule so the cutoff is 40 hours a week, rather than 30. The House has passed a bill to do that; it’s now heading to the Senate, though the White House has pledged to veto it. A reader asked us to check out a Jan. 13 column on this topic in the Wall Street Journal. It was written by Andy Puzder, the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants, which is the parent company of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. In the column, Puzder explained his company’s thought process about whether and how it should provide health coverage to its employees. Puzder’s column makes clear that he’s no fan of the Affordable Care Act, particularly the employer mandate: "So what does Obamacare’s 30-hour rule accomplish? Some would argue that it does a lot, pointing to the previously uninsured who now have employer-sponsored health insurance. In our company, that would be 2 percent of total employees and 6 percent of eligible employees. "For results like that, Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time, imposed a tax on lower-income workers who cannot afford it, forced millions of people out of insurance they liked, restricted access to doctors for millions of others, and created an enormous bureaucracy that discourages our doctors and nurses while suppressing health-care system innovation." Here, we’ll take a look at just one of these claims -- that "Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time." The bottom line, we found, is that there isn’t enough data to state a number with any specificity. Suggesting that it’s "millions," as Puzder did, is speculative -- something he acknowledged to PolitiFact. At the same time, the number of people experiencing a cut in hours isn’t trivial, with informed estimates putting it into the low hundreds of thousands of people. Puzder elaborates When we reached out to Puzder, he sent us a detailed response. (We’ve posted the full text of it here, but we’ll excerpt it in this article.) Puzder acknowledged that "there is no definitive data available" on the question. That said, "there is also nothing definitive to the contrary of which I am aware," he added. Puzder noted -- and other economists agree -- that employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is imperfect for answering this question. The BLS threshold in hours per week for "full-time" employment is different than it is for the Affordable Care Act. In addition, BLS counts someone who works two 20-hour-a-week part time jobs as one full-time worker. Both of these factors complicate any calculations using BLS data. The available evidence is also murky for another reason: It’s impossible to tell whether any changes actually stem from the Affordable Care Act, as opposed to the labor-market dynamics of the recovery to the Great Recession. However, Puzder provided some anecdotal evidence from his own sector -- restaurant chains -- that suggests a plausible case for "millions." Many restaurant chains, he noted, are operated as franchises. In his own company’s case, 230 franchisees own 73 percent of the company’s 2,920 restaurants in the United States; the company itself owns the rest. While the parent company employs about 20,000 people, its domestic franchisees employ many more -- about 55,000. And industry leaders like McDonalds and Burger King have more franchises and franchise employees. The disparate nature of franchise ownership makes it difficult to calculate the number of workers who may have had their hours cut. Based on his own experience at his company and the conversations he’s had with other industry CEOs, Puzder thinks it’s reasonable (but, he acknowledges, unscientific) to assume that 20 percent to 25 percent of their operational employees have had their hours cut to under 30 per week due to the employer mandate. And if that’s the case, the math adds up quickly. The International Franchise Association counted nearly 8.1 million employees in 2012, working at 750,000 franchise establishments. If these franchise employers lowered the hours of 20 percent of these employees, that would equal 1.6 million employees. Adjusting the hours for 15 percent would impact 1.2 million. And this number doesn’t include employees of the parent company; nor does it include the employees of retail companies that do not franchise. Puzder also referenced a data set being compiled by Jed Graham, a journalist with Investor’s Business Daily. (Editorially, Graham’s publication has argued firmly against the Affordable Care Act, but several of the economists we checked with said Graham’s information is valuable.) When we accessed Graham’s database in January 2015, he had documented just over 450 employers that had made cuts to work hours or staffing levels as a result of Obamacare. However, this list by itself doesn’t get to "millions," and because it has been compiled anecdotally rather than using scientific sampling, it can’t simply be scaled up to estimate a national figure. (We’ll also note that a full 81 percent of the employers that made cuts documented by his list are government entities; the share of private companies, which were the the focus of Puzder’s op-ed, accounted for just 19 percent of his list.) What all this means is that it’s easy build a scenario in which "millions" of workers could see their hours cut. But neither Puzder nor our own research has produced incontrovertible evidence that it has actually happened. What the data shows That said, it’s likely that the law is having some impact on part-time hours, albeit a smaller one than "millions." • One study -- authored by Bowen Garrett of the Urban Institute and Robert Kaestner of the University of Illinois and published by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation -- found a modest (0.6 percentage-point) increase in the share of employees working part-time during the first seven months of 2014 compared to what would typically be expected based on previous economic recoveries. However, the authors attributed this finding to the dynamics of the recovery from the Great Recession, rather than to the Affordable Care Act. Ultimately, they found little change during the run-up to the implementation of the employer mandate -- an indication that the provision wasn’t having a big effect on pushing workers involuntarily into part-time work. • Another study, by Helene Jorgensen and Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, did find a "small rise" in the share of employees working 25 to 29 hours a week during the first half of 2013 -- but this bump came at the expense of those working fewer than 25 hours a week, not at the expense of those working 30 or more hours a week. That’s not the dynamic one would expect if Obamacare was pushing employers to cut hours. • Neither of the previous two studies offered hard estimates of how many workers saw their hours cut. But one analysis did -- one written by Ben Casselman, the chief economics writer at the website fivethirtyeight.com. When Casselman looked at the data, he found that the proportion of part-time workers working just below 30 hours a week had been rising for about two years, while the share working just over 30 hours was falling. That’s consistent with the trend Puzder pointed to. Here’s a chart that accompanied his story: Overall, Casselman concluded that "the health law has likely led a few hundred thousand workers to see their hours cut or capped. That’s small in the context of an economy with 150 million workers. But it isn’t a minor issue for those workers. Most of them are among the economy’s most vulnerable: low-wage, part-time workers who likely have few other options." Several economists we checked with said Casselman’s estimate of "a few hundred thousand" was more plausible than Puzder’s "millions." "I think we can safely say that at this point it's clearly not ‘millions,’ because that size shift would be noticeable in the aggregate data," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. " ‘A few hundred thousand’ seems a lot more plausible." It’s worth noting that Casselman’s "a few hundred thousand" and Puzder’s "millions" are not apples-to-apples figures. Casselman included employees who were already working part-time when their hours were cut, not just those who (as Puzder wrote) saw their full-time jobs shrink to part-time jobs. So Casselman’s figure may actually overstate the number of employees who saw their jobs specifically shift from full-time to part-time. That makes it even harder to reach the "millions" threshold. Possible benefits Finally, several of the economists told us that focusing only on the negative aspects of Obamacare-inspired changes in working hours painted an incomplete picture. While it’s true that the law hurts employees who would like to work longer hours, the law also aids unemployed workers who are only too happy to work in newly created part-time jobs, as well as older workers who would like to retire but haven’t yet reached Medicare age and individuals who prefer part-time work and no longer have to take full-time jobs in order to secure health insurance. Indeed, the law makes it easier for Americans to start businesses on their own, since they are able to leave jobs where they work for someone else and still be able to secure affordable health care for themselves and their families. And it may be having that effect: Baker noticed that during the final quarter of 2014, the number of self-employed Americans rose by a whopping 400,000 compared to the previous year’s fourth quarter. Those 400,000 jobs are not counted in the widely reported BLS job-creation numbers, which only survey companies with payrolls. Our ruling Puzder said that "Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time." The statistics, in this case, are inadequate to either prove or disprove that "millions" of Americans have seen their job go from full-time to part-time due to the law. That number is possible, but unsupported. That said, there’s evidence suggesting that hundreds of thousands of workers may have seen their hours cut as the law’s impact began to be felt. That’s not "millions," but it’s not insignificant either. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Andy Puzder	None	None	None	2015-01-23T10:00:00	2015-01-13	['None']

pomt-07283	Deregulation of the state’s telecommunications industry will create 50,000 jobs in Wisconsin.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/23/rich-zipperer/state-sen-rich-zipperer-says-deregulation-telecomm/	Wisconsin law governing telecommunications hasn’t been changed since the days of beepers and fax machines. As one industry executive put it, the industry is regulated by rotary-phone laws in a smart-phone era. That’s why a telecom deregulation bill sped through both houses of the Legislature with relatively little opposition. The measure is the first major revision of the state telecommunications law since 1994, and would, among other things, remove regulations that force phone companies to invest in old-fashioned land lines. One premise of the bill -- approved by wide bipartisan margins in the Senate and Assembly on May 11, 2011 -- is that if telephone companies are no longer forced to spend money on old technology, they’ll instead pour resources into broadband for high speed Internet service. And that will lead to economic growth. How much growth? The new law could create 50,000 jobs, according to a study cited by state Sen. Rich Zipperer, R-Pewaukee, one of the measure’s main sponsors. He made the claim in interviews with the Journal Sentinel April 26 and May 4 and in testimony about the bill. Others, including top telecom executives, used the figure at public hearings, with one saying it could mean $2.6 billion in new investment in the state. And the jobs figure showed up in a report by the Discovery Institute, commissioned by Wired Wisconsin, a group pushing for broadband expansion, and the Wisconsin Technology Council, a nonprofit and nonpartisan group that advises the governor and Legislature and encourages networking and economic development. The Discovery Institute is a conservative Seattle-based think tank best known for advocating "intelligent design" creationism. Fifty thousand jobs? Sounds like a no-brainer. And a big down payment on Gov. Scott Walker’s goal of creating 250,000 jobs in the next four years. But what’s the basis for the numbers? When we dug into the data (and news release) trail, what we found resembled an old-fashioned game of telephone, where something is repeated again and again and then changed in small ways to suit political arguments. First, let’s be clear: The jobs claim doesn’t relate directly to telephone service or the people who work for the phone company. One expert, Barry Orton, a University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications professor, believes deregulation could result in job cuts because the phone companies would need fewer workers to handle landlines. Rather, the advertised jobs and economic boom would come from more people using high speed Internet, which would presumably improve efficiency among other things. The 50,000 number stems from a broadband expansion project called ConnectKentucky staged in that state between 2005 and 2007. The project included increased publicity about broadband, and, in some cases, gave people free computers. A key result was that 7 percent more people signed up for broadband service. The survey estimated consumer savings in time, miles driven and health care and calculated the impact on job creation and retention thanks to broadband. ConnectKentucky was transformed into a national project called Connected Nation. That group took the Kentucky results -- the 7 percent increase -- and extrapolated the economic impact of broadband adoption for each state and the country as a whole. For Wisconsin, Connected Nation says the increased use in broadband would lead to an "direct annual income growth of $1.8 billion," and 50,748 jobs created or saved, with a total economic impact of $2.6 billion. These numbers assume that broadband service is as widely available and attracts subscribers in the same way it was in Kentucky five to seven years ago. The Kentucky and national "Connect" groups have drawn criticism for their ties to the telecommunications industry. "ConnectKentucky is nothing more than a sales force and front group for AT&T paid for by the telecommunications industry and by state and federal governments that has achieved far more in publicity than it has in actual accomplishment," telecom expert Art Brodsky wrote Jan. 9, 2008 in a blog on the Public Knowledge site. Brian Mefford, Connected Nation’s CEO, issued a rebuttal that said the blog was inaccurate, and that Bellsouth/AT&T’s contributions accounted for a fraction of ConnectKentucky’s revenue. In any case, the study did not look specifically at the situation in Wisconsin, including the current economic climate, and was done by a group that has ties to the industry, which is seeking deregulation. So, its conclusions are on shaky ground from the start. There have been other efforts to estimate how an expansion of broadband service will lead to economic growth. The Connect group and others rely upon a 2007 study by the Brookings Institution, a moderate to liberal-leaning think tank, that created a formula to gauge the economic impact of broadband expansion. "A one percentage point increase — equal to roughly 3 million lines — is associated with nearly 300,000 more jobs, assuming that the economy is not already at full employment (or the lowest rate of unemployment that can be achieved with a low, stable rate of inflation). Obviously, such a projection is subject to estimation error and depends on the existence of some slack in the labor market." But those projections were from 2007 -- before the worst recession in more than 70 years kicked in. Yet another jobs yardstick is found in a 2010 study by the Communication Workers of America, which provides no attribution for its figures, but seems to rely in part on the Brookings report. The CWA study says: "Studies show that each additional $5 billion investment in broadband creates 250,000 jobs – 100,000 direct and indirect jobs from telecom and IT equipment spending plus another 150,000 in ‘network effects’ spurring new online applications and services. With every percentage point increase in broadband penetration, employment expands by nearly 300,000 jobs." That report did not provide a Wisconsin-specific number. Asked about the estimate he has cited, Zipperer said it’s impossible to predict how many jobs will stem from deregulating landline telephone service. "I don’t know exactly how many jobs it’s going to create," he said in an interview. Asked why he cites the 50,000 figure, he responded: "because it’s the only number that’s been out there. That’s the number that’s out there from one organization." Wired Wisconsin executive director Thad Nation said telecom companies have made "no direct promises" about how much they will expand broadband service. He said the 50,000 jobs figure is "speculation." The group notes that Ohio and Illinois deregulated their phone companies and have seen a growth in investment from companies thanks to expanded broadband service. Look at one report from an Ohio tech group. The largest recent item in the report tied to job creation was from October: $57,400,000 from First Energy Service Co. in Akron to update the smart grid. 2,870 potential jobs created.* The asterisk leads to the CWA formula -- in other words, it’s an estimate that leads back, again, to the Brookings formula. Clearly high speed Internet service helps people and businesses work more efficiently. Indeed, TDS Telecommunications Corp., a phone company that is shifting its emphasis to broadband, TDS has invested $100 million in Wisconsin in the past three years, and is advertising 60 job openings based on future growth. But the question at hand is the use of the oft-cited 50,000 number. In arguing for deregulation, Zipperer -- and others -- cited that number. It was generated based on the experience in another state more than five years ago. The methodology there has been recycled in a series of different reports, papers and press releases seeking to build urgency over telecom deregulation. What’s more, the study that’s been tied to the telecom industry, which is seeking the deregulation. Even Zipperer and other backers admit they do not know how many jobs the new law will create, or how much money will actually be invested by telecom companies. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Mexico joined with Guatemala and other Latin American countries to argue in federal court that Georgia’s law interferes with international relations. What’s worse, they said, it puts their citizens at risk of harassment by U.S. law enforcement. Not so fast, Olens said in a radio story aired June 28. Mexico has little right to complain in light of its own immigration laws. "If you're from Guatemala and you are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed," Olens told AM 750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB. "But here we have both Guatemala and Mexico complaining that we have laws to discourage illegal immigrants in our country." Illegal Guatemalans are "automatically jailed" if they’re discovered in Mexico? Sounds harsh for a nation that’s complaining about Georgia’s law. We decided to check this out. Georgia’s House Bill 87 aims to crack down on illegal immigration in this state. One of its more controversial provisions would give police the authority to investigate the immigration status of people who they believe have committed crimes and who cannot produce identification. Another would punish people who, while committing another offense, knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants or encourage them to come here. Last month, a U.S. district judge temporarily stopped these provisions from going into effect. We contacted Olens spokeswoman Lauren Kane, who said that Olens’ claim was incorrect and he will not repeat it in the future. She said in an email that he was unaware Mexico had changed its immigration law a few years ago. Then, violating Mexico immigration law was a criminal offense. Now it isn’t. Mexico has tried to improve conditions for migrants, although human rights advocates say these efforts aren’t enough. In 2008, reforms decriminalized immigration violations, said Andrew Selee, who directs the Mexico Institute, a research and policy center at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. Merely being present in Mexico without papers is a civil violation, not a criminal one, experts told us. Violators are not arrested or put in jail, which is designated for criminals or those suspected of crimes. They are sent to detention facilities and undergo a separate administrative process. Illegal migrants may, if they choose, be deported within 48 hours and avoid a criminal record. If they contest their deportation, their stay in detention is much longer. Legislation signed in May by Mexican President Felipe Calderon aims to improve conditions further, said Amnesty International researcher Rupert Knox, who is an expert on Mexico. The new legislation reaffirms that people who cross the border into Mexico without papers are guilty of a civil offense, not a criminal one, according to Knox and news reports. It emphasizes they have a right to health care and education. It also draws tighter restrictions on who can detain illegal migrants. Before the May legislation, Mexican police could detain an illegal migrant and hand him over to national immigration authorities for deportation. Now, only those detected by national immigration authorities can be sent for deportation. Mexican police are not allowed to stop people on the suspicion that they are in the country illegally, Knox said. In sum, Guatemalans found illegally in Mexico are not "automatically jailed," as Olens said. Since immigration violations are not criminal offenses, irregular migrants who are discovered are sent to a noncriminal detention facility, not jail. Their cases are not handled by the criminal courts, but by a separate administrative system. Also, if a Mexican police officer detects an illegal migrant, he cannot detain him for deportation. Only immigration authorities can do that. As Olens’ spokeswoman acknowledged, he’s wrong. Olens earns a False.	None	Sam Olens	None	None	None	2011-07-26T06:00:00	2011-06-28	['Mexico', 'Guatemala']

Greg Abbott delivered a barbed comparison. "Now many of us in this room including myself have ridiculed states like California and Illinois as bastions of failed big government," Abbott said in his Feb. 17, 2015, State of the State address in the Texas House chamber. "You’ll be as surprised as I was to learn that Texas has more full-time state employees per capita than California and Illinois." "That was shocking – and I think it must be changed," Abbott continued. Abbott’s office didn’t respond to our request for factual backup for his Texas-to-Californ’ois comparison, but R.J. DeSilva, staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, pointed out a chart in the agency’s latest Fiscal Size-up report, published in 2014. The chart indicates that in 2011, Texas state government had 124 full-time equivalent positions for every 10,000 residents, the same ratio as Wisconsin, and also lower than the ratios for 42 states. Still, as Abbott declared, California, with 108 such positions per 10,000 residents, and Illinois, with 102, were among a few states with fewer full-time positions in state government for every 10,000 residents. Here's the whole list: SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau as cited in Figure 75, "Fiscal Size-up, 2014-15 Biennium," Legislative Budget Board, February 2014. More recent figures Seeking more up-to-date data, we emailed a U.S. Census Bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, who guided us to the bureau’s March 2013 survey of state government employment, its latest tally. To reach per-capita counts, Bernstein recommended we compare the figures to the agency’s July 2013 state-by-state population estimates, which he sent us. We focused on the bureau’s "full-time employment" counts for each state government, which reflected all agencies including institutions of higher education--though not part-time workers, who fill many roles in public colleges and universities, a bureau expert, Jesse Willhide, advised. Upshot: The figures suggest Texas in 2013 had 105 full-time state government workers per 10,000 residents; California had 85; Illinois 79. We also checked full-time equivalent comparisons for the states, which would fold in part-time employees. By this filter, Texas had 119 full-time equivalent workers per 10,000 residents; California 103; Illinois 99. Texas perspectives We ran these figures by Kate Johanns of the Texas Public Employees Association, which lobbies on behalf of Texas state employees and retirees, and Eva DeLuna Castro, a fiscal affairs expert for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income residents. Both pointed out the bureau’s state government employee counts might seem inflated because they roll in workers at public colleges and universities, which draw on income streams besides the state budget Abbott was talking about. Moreover, Castro suggested, comparisons of employee ratios between states don’t account for different ways different states deliver services. Knowing "what’s a local responsibility in one state versus another is important, because it’s the combined effort that matters," Castro emailed. "That’s why many analysts doing state-level comparisons use the State + Local FTE (full-time equivalent) count." Her nudge led us to tap census bureau data for 2013 covering state and local full-time government employees; Texas had 5 for every 100 residents; Illinois 4.4; California 3.8. Another take Hoping for out-of-state insight, we reached Scott Moody, a New Hampshire-based senior fellow with the Illinois Policy Institute, a research group that says it generates policy ideas promoting personal freedom and prosperity in the Land of Lincoln. By phone and email, Moody agreed it makes more comparative sense to focus on state plus local government workers state by state, which he does in his research presenting ratios of government workers to every 100 workers in the private sector drawing on employee counts from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. The private-sector comparison is helpful, Moody said, because government agencies and the private sector "both draw from the pool of labor. In the very short-term, hiring more government workers reduces the pool of labor for the private and vice-versa. This is an important dynamic that is lost in per-capita comparisons," he said. With Moody’s help, we downloaded a chart indicating that in 2013, Texas had more state/local full- and part-time government workers for every 100 workers in the private sector than California or Illinois: Source: Website, "Govt Workforce," Key Policy Data (accessed Feb. 19, 2015) Broadly, Moody told us, he sees value in comparing a state’s ratio to the national average. "If you’ve above the national average," Moody said, "that’s a good sign you’re out of whack." In 2013, when Texas had 105 full-time state government workers per 10,000 residents, the national average was 117, according to the census bureau. Per Moody, six states in 2013 had fewer state employees per 100 private-sector workers than Texas: Pennsylvania, California, Nevada, New York, Florida and Illinois. And Texas, which had nearly 4 state employees per 100 private workers, ranked among 30 states with a lower ratio than the national average of nearly 6 state workers per 100 private employees, Moody found. Most recently, according to his research, the ratio of Texas state workers to private-sector workers declined from 2010 through 2013, the last year shown. Also, that year’s ratio of nearly 3.8 was down about 17 percent from the 4.6 state workers for every 100 private-sector counterparts--the highest mark since 1979--in 1994. Source: Website, "Govt Workforce," Key Policy Data (accessed Feb. 19, 2015) Our ruling Abbott said that to his shock, Texas has more full-time state employees per capita than California and Illinois. That's so. However, this claim lacked substantial context; Abbott cherry-picked two of a few states with lower per-capita state-employee rates than Texas, failing to note Texas ranks among states with the lowest proportion of state government workers. Notably too, its ratio in 2013 trailed the national average. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-12924	Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, "are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-property-taxes-percent/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recited a number of statistical accomplishments during his seventh state of the state speech on Jan. 10, 2017, including one that dates back to two decades before he was born. "Property taxes -- as a percentage of our personal income in this state -- are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II," the 49-year-old Republican said. "Think about that -- since the end of World War II." Cutting property taxes has been a priority since Walker took office in 2011, as is shown on our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks the governor’s campaign promises. We rated Promise Kept Walker’s pledge to freeze property taxes during his first term; and In the Works his promise to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010. But on the measure Walker cited, are property taxes lower than they have been in generations? Share the Facts Politifact 0 6 Politifact Rating: Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, "are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II." Scott Walker Republican Wisconsin governor In a speech Tuesday, January 10, 2017 -01/-10/2017 Read More info The speech Figures highlighted during a formal address such as the annual state of the state speech are likely to have been well vetted. But as we found during our live fact checking of Walker’s speech on Twitter, the governor made some statements that could benefit from clarification. Walker said more people were employed in Wisconsin in 2016 than at any time in history. When that same claim was made in June 2016 it rated Mostly True. But we pointed out economists generally prefer the unemployment rate, which accounts for population growth over time. Walker’s speech also touted listening sessions he has held throughout the state. But as we found in checking an August 2016 claim by a potential 2018 gubernatorial candidate, Democratic state Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire, Walker’s sessions were "invite-only and excluding the press." World War II times To back Walker’s statement on property taxes, the governor’s office pointed to a July 2015 memo from the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayer Alliance. The memo stated that Wisconsin’s property tax burden was at 3.6 percent of personal income, the lowest since 1946 (when it was also 3.6 percent). Dale Knapp, the alliance’s research director, gave us the raw numbers: The levy was $9.45 billion in 2015 on property taxes payable in 2016. That figure amounts to 3.6 percent of total personal income of $263.3 billion in 2015. Knapp told us comparing property taxes to income is one way to see how much of a take property taxes have on the state’s economy. He said the memo reflects the most recent figures available. (A note: In a January 2017 report, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau measured property taxes versus income at 10 intervals dating back to 1970. Wisconsin’s property tax level per $1,000 of personal income exceeded the national average during each period and ranked 12th nationally in 2014, the latest year covered in the report.) Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project, didn’t dispute the taxpayer alliance’s 3.6 percent figure. But she told us one thing to note is that some people haven’t benefited as much from Walker’s property tax cuts. For instance, Walker’s 2011-’13 state budget stopped inflation adjustments for the state Homestead Credit, which softens the impact of property taxes and rent on persons with lower incomes. The program can put more than $1,100 back in people’s pockets through income tax refunds. For 2016, people with a household income of less than $24,680 could qualify for the credits. Cornelius cited figures from the state fiscal bureau showing that the credits have been reduced by $133.5 million since Walker ended the inflation adjustments. That means the money stayed in state coffers rather than being refunded to residents. The office of state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, also pointed to Walker's budget moves, including limits on how much school districts can levy in property taxes, in noting that more than half of Wisconsin's 424 school districts have passed referendum initiatives since the beginning of 2012. Our rating Walker said Wisconsin property taxes, as a percentage of personal income, "are the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II." It’s worth noting that one change Walker made reduces income tax refunds given to lower-income taxpayers through the state Homestead Credit, which is aimed at softening the impact of property taxes. But an analysis by the respected Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance shows that on the measure Walker cited, property taxes are the lowest they have been since 1946. We rate the statement True.

pomt-10004	Obama's budget plan would "take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. ... Historically, it's been about 40 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/26/judd-gregg/judd-gregg-says-obamas-budget-drives-national-debt/	Sen. Judd Gregg, a Republican senator from New Hampshire, has been making the rounds on political news programs this week, criticizing President Barack Obama's budget as too costly. Gregg has repeated one statistic over and over to make his point: that Obama's budget plan would increase the national debt to 80 percent of gross domestic product. "Seventeen trillion dollars worth of debt at the end of 10 years, $11 trillion at the end of five years," Gregg said. "This translates into a debt-to-GDP ratio which we have not seen in this country since the end of World War II when we were trying to pay off the war debt. Basically, you take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. That's the public debt. Historically, it's been about 40 percent." At 80 percent, Gregg has been fond of saying this week, the United States would be getting into "banana republic" territory. Debt-to-GDP ratios may not get a lot of public attention, but economists follow them closely as a good indicator of economic health. "Over the long haul, that is the most important number," Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Gregg's numbers come from an analysis of the Obama budget by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that the national debt would grow by $9.3 trillion between 2010 and 2019 under Obama's plan. According to the CBO, the debt held by the public would rise, from 41 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 to 57 percent in 2009 and then to 82 percent of GDP by 2019. That comports with Gregg's statement. Projections put out by the administration's Office of Management and Budget in February were a little more optimistic, due largely to differing assumptions about the future growth of the economy. According to the White House forecasts, the national debt-to-GDP ration would rise to 67 percent in 2019. Still, by either count, the debt-to-GDP ratios are climbing. Gregg is right that since the post-World War II years, debt-to-GDP has averaged about 42 percent. He's also right that if the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 82 percent in 2019, that would be a level we have not seen in the United States since World War II. According to historical budget tables, the debt-to-GDP ratios actually climbed over 100 percent, peaking at 109 percent in 1946. Since then, the ratios have spiked occasionally as a result of recession or war, but have never gone above about 50 percent. That will change this year. It's less clear if that 82 percent would put us in the "banana republic" range. According to the CIA World Factbook, the United States has the 22nd highest level of public debt as a percentage of GDP in the world. There are no separate statistics for banana republics, but it's worth noting that many Latin American countries have a lower public debt ratio than the United States. Regardless, Gregg is right that 82 percent would be remarkably high and put the country in unenviable company. So why should we care? If the debt-to-GDP level were to go to 82 percent, Heritage's Riedl said, "It's a simple fact that interest rates would go through the roof." Moreover, he said, it would be harder for companies to borrow money; harder for people to get mortgages. It would decrease productivity and overall economic growth. "It's just not a sustainable ratio," Riedl said. Jonathan DeWald, a spokesman for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that specializes in analysis of budget deficits, also cautioned that as interest rates increase in coming years, interest payments on the growing national debt will continue to eat up more and more of the overall budget. Obama has warned not to place too much stock in the "out years" of budget projections because "none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight or 10 years from now." And Obama has said that making investments today in education, health care and energy will pay off down the road with a stronger economy, which presumably would create a better debt-to-GDP ratio. Gregg is on solid ground, relying on projections from the CBO, a highly respected, nonpartisan arm of Congress, about the long-term debt-to-GDP ratios. We rate his statement True.

Perry and Dewhurst had called on the 2013 Legislature, which convenes in January, to authorize drug screening of applicants for unemployment assistance or Temporary Aid for Needy Families, which provides government aid to children and their parents or relatives who are living with them. Dewhurst said: "We owe it to Texas taxpayers to structure our welfare and unemployment programs in a way that guarantees recipients are serious about getting back to work." Deshotel said in his response: "There is no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group." None? Deshotel, a House member since 1999, told us by phone that he should have said there is "little evidence" that low-income people abuse drugs more than others. By and large, he said, he believes Texans with more disposable income--those with greater wealth--are the biggest users of illegal drugs, especially cocaine. Deshotel followed up by email, pointing out that in the federal government’s 2007 National Survey of Drug Use and Health, a little over half of unemployed and full-time employees reported trying marijuana. The survey indicates 23 percent of unemployed individuals had tried cocaine, compared to 19 percent of full-time employees and nearly 15 percent of part-time employees. The annual survey, conducted since 1971, draws on face-to-face interviews of some 70,000 individuals aged 12 and older. Since the survey does not gauge drug use levels by income level, the closest possible indicator may be job status. In the 2007 survey, nearly 2 percent of unemployed individuals reported more than 100 days of cocaine use in the previous year, compared to 0.4 percent of full-time workers. More than 10 percent of unemployed individuals said they had used marijuana more than 100 days, the survey says, compared to 4 percent of full-time employees. Last year, PolitiFact Florida touched on the survey while tackling a flip-side version of Deshotel's claim. In June 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott told an interviewer: "Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare." At the time, Scott’s office pointed out that the government used its 1999 and 2000 surveys to publish a report titled "Substance Use Among Persons in Families Receiving Government Assistance." Among the findings, researchers concluded that "past-month illicit drug use was higher in assisted families than in unassisted families among persons aged 12 to 64." Specifically, the report said 9.6 percent of people in families receiving some type of government assistance reported recent drug use, compared to 6.8 percent among people in families receiving no government assistance. PolitiFact Florida also cited research by Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago professor who studies substance abuse among welfare recipients, suggesting that "substance abuse and dependence are relatively uncommon" for such recipients. Yet the same research found--by reviewing many different surveys--that "approximately 20 percent of TANF recipients report that they have used an illicit drug at least once in the past year." Pollack told PolitiFact Florida that compared to other women of the same age, TANF recipients are more likely to use illicit substances, though he said most women who have used an illicit drug in the past year do not meet the diagnosis of being dependent on, or abusing, drugs. A lot of casual marijuana users may well test positive, Pollack said, but they do not have a "drug problem." We ran Deshotel’s statement past Pollack, who called it an oversimplification, though he said substance abuse is widespread and not limited to low-income residents. Pollack nudged us to contact Beau Kilmer, co-director of the California-based RAND Drug Policy Research Center, which says it provides decision-makers with research on substance use and drug policy. Kilmer emailed us his writing from a 2010 book stating that a "wealth of evidence" suggests substance use and poverty are "closely connected." Surveys of the homeless show "staggering rates of alcohol and drug dependency," Kilmer wrote. Like others, Kilmer cited the 2007 federal survey, writing that its results indicate that individuals living below the federal poverty line were 50 percent to 100 percent more likely than individuals with incomes at twice the poverty level to report use of an illicit drug in the past month or dependence/abuse in the past year, he wrote. However, Kilmer wrote, the "limited scientific literature examining a causal connection between poverty and substance abuse remains unsettled." By telephone, Miguel Ferguson, an associate professor at the University of Texas School of Social Work, took issue with Kilmer’s characterization of the differences in illicit drug use suggested by the survey results. The percentage differences underscored by Kilmer may be statistically significant, Ferguson said, but in real-world social terms, the contrast between 2 percent of survey respondents living at twice the poverty level and above having abused or depended on an illicit drug in the past year compared to 5 percent of individuals living below the poverty line is practically no difference--at best, he said, marginal. "Given what I know about living in poverty and the stress that people are under, I am shocked that it is that low," Ferguson said. We shared Kilmer’s chapter with Deshotel, who noted by email the slight difference in reported dependence on an illicit drug between the groups, adding: "My ultimate argument is that there is no significant difference between those who use drugs who are poor and those are not that would warrant the state spending tax dollars to test some beneficiaries and not others." Deshotel also pointed out an April 17, 2012, New York Times news article indicating that after Florida imposed drug screens on its applicants for cash benefits, 2.6 percent of applicants failed the test--the most common reason being marijuana--over the first four months, or 108 of 4,086, according to results obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, which won a court order blocking the Florida drug screens. An additional 40 people canceled the tests without taking them, the newspaper said. Separately, we asked the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a federal agency that supports research to prevent and treat drug abuse and addiction and mitigate consequences, to evaluate Deshotel’s statement. By email, Susan Weiss, the institute’s scientific adviser to its director, told us through a spokeswoman: "There are a variety of factors that can contribute to drug abuse, socio-economic status being one of them, along with family support, peers/siblings that use drugs, genetics" and "school problems. Being poor doesn’t necessarily put you at risk, nor does being rich protect you from risk." All that said, Weiss later said, poverty can be a major stressor in a person’s life leading to drug use. In 2011, Florida’s ACLU offered other government and academic research for PolitiFact Florida to consider. Researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a part of the National Institutes of Health, published findings in 1996 that said welfare recipients "using, abusing, or dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs are consistent with proportions of both the adult U.S. population and adults who do not receive welfare." The research relied on 1992 data and concluded that drug use among welfare recipients ranged between 1.3 to 3.6 percent, compared to 1.5 percent for non-welfare recipients. The caveats here are much like the government research Scott’s office highlighted. Namely, it includes other types of welfare than cash assistance, and it's old. The report was published in 1996 and relies on 1992 data. Another researcher used data from Michigan--a state that participated in drug-testing for welfare recipients until a federal court held in 2003 that subjecting every applicant to a drug test without reason was unconstitutional. In Michigan, 10 percent of recipients tested positive for illicit drugs. That's comparable to the National Survey on Drug Use & Health, which found that in 2007-08, 8.95 percent of all Michigan residents (grouping non-welfare and welfare recipients) said they used illicit drugs in the past month. Our ruling Deshotel said there is "no evidence that poor people abuse drugs more frequently than any other socio-economic group." We agree with PolitiFact Florida that it's difficult to make broad generalizations about whole groups of people. And it's even more difficult to definitively measure drug use. Some research indicates drug abuse among the poor and those who are not poor is consistent. However, there also are studies showing a higher prevalence of drug use among some welfare recipients. So, evidence is debated. Still, the idea that there is no evidence that low-income people use drugs more frequently does not hold up. As Pollack told us, that's an oversimplification. We rate this absolute claim as False.	None	Joseph "Joe" Deshotel	None	None	None	2012-11-26T06:00:00	2012-11-13	['None']

pomt-15097	"We've just now given over $100 billion" to Iran, "the equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/16/mike-huckabee/huckabee-us-giving-iran-equivalent-5-trillion/	Iran is getting a sizeable award for the nuclear deal with the United States -- to the tune of $100 billion, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said at the second Republican debate. The Iran deal was a big topic at the Sept. 16 CNN debate, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Several of the candidates blasted the deal between the United States, Iran and several world powers -- including the former governor of Arkansas.. "We've just now given over $100 billion (to Iran)," Huckabee said. "The equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion." We’ve looked into similar claims before, so we decided to take a look at Huckabee’s version. The $100 billion It’s true that Iran will reap significant economic benefits from the deal, because many sanctions levied against Iran will be lifted if Iran complies with restrictions on its nuclear program. Iran will have access to a good deal of these funds within several months of the deal being enacted, said Matthew Kroenig, a professor of international relations at Georgetown University. Huckabee made it sound as if the United States is giving some kind of subsidy or compensation. But the money already belongs to Iran; Iran just hasn’t been able to access it. In similar claims by other candidates and officials, the $100 billion figure has referred to the dollar amounts of Iran’s foreign assets that could be unfrozen when sanctions are lifted. An example is money Iran earned from selling oil but is held by a foreign bank. It also includes the billions of dollars Iran has lost in revenues and opportunity costs because the country has not been able to fully participate in the global marketplace, said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law and an expert on economic sanctions, in a prior interview with PolitiFact. Estimates of the value of Iran’s foreign assets start as low as $25 billion, and they run as high as $150 billion. Most experts we’ve interviewed on this question peg the amount of unfrozen assets at about $100 billion, but no one is 100 percent sure of the amount. Iran has financial obligations other than the sanctions, so even if all the sanctions are lifted, Iranian officials won’t suddenly have all of these assets at their disposal. For example, Iran owes billions to China for infrastructure projects. The lower estimates take into account restrictions on the money other than the sanctions, said Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, also in a prior interview. The Obama administration has said that after Iran pays its outstanding financial obligations, it will have about $56 billion at its disposal. How does this translate into $5 trillion in America? The $5 trillion Based on a prior fact-check, we can deduce that Huckabee is comparing the Iranian and U.S. economies based on gross domestic product, the standard measurement of an economy’s size. According to the World Bank, Iran’s economy is $415 billion. So the $100 billion in sanctions relief amounts to about 25 percent of the economy. The United States’ economy is about $17 trillion. Twenty-five percent of that is $4.25 trillion -- a little low but not too far off from Huckabee’s $5 trillion. It’s not a perfect measurement, said Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, who said she would be more interested in comparing the two in terms of GDP per capita. Though, "I do think it gives an interesting comparison of the scale," Sinclair said of Huckabee’s claim. Our ruling Huckabee said, "We've just now given over $100 billion (to Iran). The equivalent in U.S. terms is $5 trillion." Huckabee’s $100 billion figure is one of the most commonly cited estimates of how much the Iranian economy will reap from sanctions relief under the Iran deal, though no one is fully certain of the amount. But he gives a misleading impression of the transaction by implying the United States is giving the money to Iran when it would just unfreeze the assets. We rate Huckabee’s claim Half True.

pomt-05117	Obama has "racked up more debt than any president in history — over $5 trillion."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/27/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-obama-has-racked-more-debt-any-ot/	A lot of claims are circulating about government spending and the federal debt, usually in statements attacking or backing the policies of President Obama. PolitiFact has looked at a number of the claims and found that their accuracy varies widely -- mostly because Obama’s record on federal government spending is a lot more flattering than is his record on debt. We found it was inaccurate to claim, as Mitt Romney did, that "since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history." In fact, Obama has presided over the slowest growth in spending of any president in the past 60 years using raw dollars, and the second-slowest if you adjust for inflation. But we also found that while spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year. The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven’t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there’s an annual deficit, the national debt grows. That led to the frequently cited -- and wrongly exaggerated -- claim that the debt has increased more under Obama than under all previous 43 presidents combined. It also led to this blog posting by Rep. Jim Renacci, the Republican incumbent facing Democratic incumbent Rep. Betty Sutton in Ohio's newly redrawn 16th congressional district: "In less than one term, (Obama has) racked up more debt than any president in history — over $5 trillion." The statement interested PolitiFact Ohio because it was less sweeping and more specific than many others. Responding to our inquiry, Renacci's staff cited a CBS News story from March, which compared the debt growth under Obama's three years and two months in office to eight years under George W. Bush. On Jan. 20, 2009, the date Obama took office, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion. At the time of the CBS story, it had increased by $4.9 trillion. By the day Renacci's statement was posted, the Treasury Department's online "Debt to the Penny" calculator showed the debt at more than $15.7 trillion -- an increase of $5.1 trillion. During the two terms of the Bush presidency, whose debt exceeded all predecessors, the debt rose $4.899 trillion. So Renacci's numbers checked out. But Renacci's statement that Obama "racked up" the debt, fails to account for factors beyond Obama's control. Obama did approve the stimulus bill and a deal to extend tax cuts, both of which contributed to the debt. Not surprising though, that Obama’s Treasury Department blames most of the current debt on decisions made under Bush, including tax cuts (which it says cost the government $3 trillion), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which it tallies at $1.4 trillion) and the Medicare prescription drug program ($300 billion). They may have a point that there is plenty of blame to spread around. It is clear that some elements of the increase in the debt are a result of decisions made before this administration took office. And it’s worth noting that the president doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Legislation that increases spending, such as the extension of the tax cuts, requires approval from Congress. In the case of the tax cuts, that support came from both Republicans and Democrats. Experts note, too, that the weak economy has contributed to the debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits. Renacci is accurate in asserting that the national debt has increased since Obama took office by more than $5 trillion, more than any previous administration. But his statement assigns direct control -- and blame -- to Obama. Lost in that is the impact of the faltering economy, decisions made before Obama took office and the fact that others, such as Congress, also have had a role in increasing the debt.

pomt-07452	According to David Cay Johnston, "the average American pays about 22 percent of their income to federal taxes. The richest 400 Americans … pay about 16 percent of their income to federal taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/19/chris-hayes/journalist-chris-hayes-says-average-american-pays-/	As tax filing day approached on April 15, 2011, Chris Hayes of the liberal magazine The Nation, said on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show that the super-rich pay less of their income toward taxes than average Americans do. "Conservatives, in arguing against taxes going up (for) the wealthy, want you to focus on what percentages of all income taxes are paid by the wealthy," Hayes told Maddow. "Maybe your conservative co-worker sent you an e-mail about this, or your kid's baseball coach, or your right-wing dad. ‘The wealthy pay all the income tax in this country. Everyone else is just along for the ride.’ "The sleight-of-hand here is that's just income taxes. Middle class and working class and poor people pay payroll taxes and they pay sales taxes. They paid tons of state and local taxes. They pay their fair share. "The wealthy, on the other hand -- look at what's happening to their marginal tax rate over the last five decades. Does that pattern look familiar at all? What we've been seeing, the central fact of the American economy over the last several decades is an increase in inequality with more income going to the people at the very top. At the same time, the people at the very top have seen their tax burden decrease. "This week, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston published a great article called Nine Things the Rich Don`t Want You to Know About Taxes. In it, I learned for the first time that every year, the IRS conducts this study of the 400 wealthiest tax filers. And what the data revealed recently is remarkable. According to Johnston, the average American pays about 22 percent of their income to federal taxes. The richest 400 Americans, 16 percent, pay about 16 percent of their income to federal taxes." We wondered whether Hayes’ description of the statistics was accurate. So we first took a look at the document he referenced. The document, compiled annually by the Internal Revenue Service, takes a close look at the 400 tax returns with the highest level of adjusted gross income during a given year. The most recent available data covers 2007. The document shows that the 400 top-earning tax returns pulled down a total of $137.9 billion during the year, and that those taxpayers shelled out $22.9 billion in federal income taxes. That works out to a 16.6 percent tax rate. So by this measure -- which, we’ll note, only addresses federal income tax, not federal payroll taxes -- Hayes is close. We then used the same method to calculate the tax rate for the nation as a whole. Americans paid $1.116 trillion in income tax during 2007, on adjusted gross income of $8.688 trillion. That works out to a tax rate of 12.8 percent. The rate is slightly higher if you use a different figure as the denominator -- adjusted gross income from all the returns for which tax was due, as opposed to all returns that were filed, some of which resulted in no taxes owed. Using the second, more limited figure, the tax rate is 13.8 percent. Still, using either figure, the tax rate is lower for Americans as a whole than it is for the top 400. What gives? When we contacted Hayes, he said he relied on Johnston’s work. So we contacted Johnston, and he provided us with his calculations, as well as an explanation of how he put the statistics together. What Johnston did is to create a separate tax model to determine the tax burden for a single worker at the median wage -- an individual worker who earned $26,000. Johnston proceeded to use standard income tax rules to determine what this taxpayer would owe. Unlike the IRS calculation, Johnston also factored in the payroll tax. He found the individual’s total tax bill would be $6,084 -- 23.4 percent of the worker’s cash wage, and 22.3 percent of the worker's total income. His number for the top 400 was close to what the IRS had found -- he adjusted it slightly upward to account for payroll taxes. Johnston’s final tax rate for the top 400 was 16.9 percent. So, based on these numbers, Hayes’ statement would be essentially correct. However, this is not the only way to look at the figures. For starters, the top 400 compilation included tax returns of all sorts -- couples with kids, couples without kids and individuals. But Johnston’s comparison is to an individual. Individual tax returns amount to a plurality of all tax returns filed, but they’re not a majority. In all, 46 percent of returns are individual returns, 38 percent are joint or surviving spouses, 15 percent are for head of household and 2 percent are married filing separately. This means that a modest majority of returns are for multi-person households. Why is this important? Because a childless individual can’t claim child tax credits or additional personal exemptions that could reduce the individual's tax rate. So if you looked instead someone who’s married with a couple of kids, they would likely have a lower tax rate than the 22 percent Johnston found. In an e-mail conversation, Johnston said Hayes made a reasonable statement. "To compare the average of the top 400 for whom we have actual data against the model example of a single worker at the median is entirely reasonable," he said. "To compare the top 400 to ‘America as a whole’ is ludicrous. That includes some people whose incomes are negative and some who make almost a million dollars a day. Since Hayes wrote about the average and I wrote about median, then the reasonable comparisons would be to compare to the median income ($33,000) or the median household income from Census (approaching twice that) or the median wage worker, as in my example." If anything, Johnston said, Hayes understated the number, considering that data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development suggests that the middle 20 percent of the population has an overall tax burden closer to 30 percent. "What is the point of these comparisons? It is to show that by the classic, standard method of measuring tax burdens the system is no longer progressive," Johnston said, adding, "If you want to pick lint have at it." So where does this leave us? We agree with Johnston that simply using the IRS calculations -- income tax paid divided by adjusted gross income -- isn’t a perfect solution either, because among other things it doesn’t include the payroll tax, and, as Hayes noted in the interview, payroll taxes are borne more heavily by lower- and middle-income Americans. But while Johnston’s calculation may be "reasonable," it isn’t the only reasonable way to make the comparison. Describing an individual filing singly as "the average American," as Hayes did, means focusing on a type of filer with relatively high tax rates, compared to families. Just as the United States has "people whose incomes are negative and some who make almost a million dollars a day," average Americans also include people who are married and have kids, and who in turn benefit from tax breaks that reduce what they owe. We understand that Hayes was relying on an expert tax journalist for his numbers and that the numbers as they were calculated are correct. But the calculation was based only on one of type filer, so we do think that it’s important to add context to his comment. We rate his comment Half True.

pomt-03613	University of Wisconsin System's reserves are in the "mid- to low-range" of comparable university systems.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/08/kevin-reilly/uw-systems-reserves-fair-middling-system-president/	The late Al McGuire parlayed his 1977 national championship as Marquette University's basketball coach into a lucrative speaking and broadcasting career. Asked at one point if he had enough money, McGuire playfully boasted: "I have so much now, I don't even count it. I weigh it." Nice. Satisfied smiles were harder to find in April 2013 when it was reported that the University of Wisconsin System, after years of tuition hikes, had accumulated reserves of $648 million. Incensed state lawmakers, primarily Republicans, suggested the system was so fat with cash, it needed a belt and suspenders to keep its breeches up. Not so, countered UW System president Kevin Reilly. Defending his institution to lawmakers April 23, 2013, four days after release of the state report that revealed the $648 million, Reilly asserted that the reserve is in the "mid- to low-range" of what comparable public university systems have. In other words, it didn't weigh as much as the critics claimed. Let’s see if he’s right. The system The UW System describes itself as one of the largest systems of public higher education in the country, serving more than 181,000 students. It is made up of 13 four-year universities, including the flagship UW-Madison, 13 two-year campuses and the statewide UW Extension. The system’s total reserve revealed by the state report was $1 billion as of June 30, 2012 (a figure that has since been projected to grow by $150 million by the end of June 2013). Of the $1 billion, $648 million is unrestricted. That’s the reserve figure that has received the most focus. The state report said the $648 million -- up 13 percent from one year earlier -- represents about one-fourth of the UW System’s unrestricted budget. In the wake of the lawmakers’ furor over the funds, the Chronicle of Higher Education cited data from Moody’s Investors Service saying the median amount of cash that university systems keep on hand is in that range -- 23 percent of their operation budgets. But when we asked the UW System for evidence to back Reilly’s claim, spokesman David Giroux provided data from a different calculation, saying it allowed for a better comparison of state university systems. Reilly’s evidence That data compared the UW System’s "primary reserve ratio" to the ratios at five state university systems that are among the institutions the UW System considers to be its peers. The UW System said its 25 percent primary reserve ratio, as of June 30, 2012, equals $1.13 billion in expendable net assets divided by $4.5 billion in total expenses. That put Wisconsin in the mid- to low range in the UW System’s comparison of primary reserve ratios -- although Giroux acknowledged that the list of five institutions cited by the UW was not an exhaustive comparison, but rather utilized financial reports that were available online. Here’s how they ranked: 1. Texas: 95 percent 2. Illinois: 34 percent 3. Minnesota: 29 percent 4. Wisconsin: 25 percent 5. California: 21 percent 6. Georgia: -5 percent We asked three experts about those figures: Eastern Michigan University accounting professor Howard Bunsis, whose specialties include governmental accounting Susan Menditto, director of accounting policy at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, which represents business and financial officers of more than 2,500 colleges, universities and university systems Certified public accountant Larry Goldstein, president of Campus Strategies LLC, a Virginia management consulting firm that serves higher education agencies and institutions, including the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Some of the experts calculated different primary reserve ratios for some of the institutions; Bunsis, for example, calculated Georgia’s ratio to be 18 percent, not -5 percent. Nevertheless, the experts’ 1-to-6 rankings were the same as the rankings put out by the UW System. That would appear to back Reilly’s claim that the UW System is in the middle to low range among its peers in terms of cash reserves. But let’s take a closer look at the measure the UW System used. And let’s do a broader comparison. Primary reserve ratio All three experts agreed the primary reserve ratio is an important and commonly used ratio for determining a university system’s financial strength. They said Wisconsin’s ratio of 25 percent indicates that, if the UW System’s income were cut off, it would have enough reserves or "expendable assets" to meet its expenses for three months -- three months being 25 percent of one year. (What is an appropriate level of cash reserves, of course, is in the eye of the beholder and doesn’t relate to the Reilly claim we’re fact checking. But we’ll note that Bunsis said a primary reserve ratio of 15 to 20 percent is considered prudent, 40 percent "very solid" and anything over 50 percent high. Menditto cited a consultant’s report that said 40 percent is advisable.) "Peer institutions" The question of which university systems the UW System should be compared to is trickier. Unfortunately, the experts told us, there is no large compilation of university systems’ primary reserve ratios. And there are other issues: the experts didn’t necessarily agree that the Illinois, Minnesota, California and Texas state systems, because of their makeup, were truly peers of Wisconsin; and some systems that could be comparable, such as Ohio and North Carolina, produce consolidated financial statements at the campus level, but not the system level. We were able, however, to find primary reserve ratios for three other state systems that can be compared to Wisconsin’s. Goldstein, the Virginia consultant, said Maryland, though a smaller state university system, is a peer of Wisconsin; and indeed the UW System considers it a peer, Giroux told us. Goldstein said Maryland’s primary reserve ratio is 37 percent. The UW System also has long considered the State University of New York system as being a peer and Goldstein agreed. Goldstein told us that, like Georgia, SUNY has a negative primary reserve ratio -16 percent. And while the UW System doesn’t consider the Nebraska state system as among its peers, Nebraska system considers Wisconsin as one of its peers. Goldstein said Nebraska’s primary reserve ratio is 67 percent. So, here’s how that list looks: 1. Nebraska: 67 percent 2. Maryland: 37 percent 3. Wisconsin: 25 percent 4. SUNY: -16 percent Our rating Reilly said UW System's reserves are in the "mid- to low-range" of comparable university systems, as though that fact has been clearly established. Using a key measure, Wisconsin’s level of reserves is below that of some of its peers. But there is debate about whether some of the state systems the UW System considers to be peers are in fact peers. And figures simply aren’t available for other peer systems. With the evidence available, we find Reilly’s statement partially accurate but missing important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-13499	Says Russ Feingold broke his 1992 promise to always get the majority of funding from Wisconsin residents.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/07/ron-johnson/feingold-broke-promise-fund-campaign-primarily-sta/	In 1992, Democrat Russ Feingold introduced himself to Wisconsinites as a regular guy supported by regular guys (and gals). He listed campaign promises on his garage door and repeatedly said he would take the majority of his funding from Wisconsinites — not out-of-state residents or interest groups. He stayed true to that pledge throughout campaigns in 1992, 1998, 2004 and 2010 — when he was unseated by Republican Ron Johnson. In the 2016 rematch, Feingold has reversed course and is now taking the majority of his money from out of state. Johnson frames this as a broken promise in a recent campaign ad, noting that at the time Feingold’s pledge originated he did not limit it to any time period. Rather, he declared he was making the commitment "for the future." Let’s take a closer look. Feingold’s promise PolitiFact Wisconsin examined this issue before, giving Feingold a "Full Flop" in October 2015 for reversing his position and accepting a majority of his funding from out of state. The Flip-O-Meter ruling only examined whether Feingold had changed his position — which he clearly did. We are taking another look because Johnson now alleges that in doing so Feingold broke a promise to always get the majority of his funding from Wisconsinites. The ad is the latest volley on this point, which Johnson has also made in an interview, a tweet and on his website. If you ask Feingold now, his pledge was always for the campaign at hand. "When I said in 1992, whenever I said that I would get a majority of my contributions from Wisconsin citizens, I made that pledge for that term," Feingold said in January 2016 as part of an "On The Issues with Mike Gousha" appearance at Marquette University Law School. Let’s go to the tape. Feingold stated in a 1992 TV ad that he would "rely on Wisconsin citizens, not out-of-staters, to pay for this campaign" -- a promise he touted often. But he also took it a step further. In an August 1992 primary debate on C-SPAN, an opponent accused Feingold of making a self-serving pledge because he was a newcomer to national races who didn’t have the out-of-state contacts his opponents did. "It’s not just self-serving, because I’m promising it for the future," Feingold responded. "I’m saying that’s a pledge that I’m going to keep. I’m not going to get in (office) and go, ‘OK, where are the PACs and where are the out-of-state contributions?’ "I’m making a pledge for the future." That is clearly not a pledge Feingold is keeping this time around. An analysis of Federal Election Commission data by the Center for Responsive Politics shows 70 percent of individual contributions to Feingold’s campaign during this election cycle have come from out of state. That’s the same number cited by Johnson in the ad. Feingold has acknowledged the change in position, asserting in an August 2015 interview that keeping the 24-year-old pledge "makes no sense now" since the campaign finance landscape has changed dramatically due to a deluge of massive, undisclosed contributions. We encountered a similar question in 2014 when the group One Wisconsin Now claimed Walker broke a promise not to take contributions during the budget process -- a claim we rated False. In that case, the group misrepresented the nature of the promise. First, the pledge was from Walker’s brief gubernatorial bid in 2006, not his successful bid in 2010. And the promise, part of his first 100 days plan, referred to a specific period: "Scott Walker will not accept any campaign contributions (from any source) from the time he takes office (January 3, 2007) until the state budget is signed into law." That’s not the case for Feingold, who repeatedly cited the pledge, said at the time the promise was "for the future," and then went on to follow it for three future campaigns. Michael Tyler, a spokesman for Feingold’s campaign, declined repeated requests to comment on how Feingold reconciles the "for the future" line with his current assertion that the promise, from the start, was only for the campaign at hand. Our rating Feingold used the words "pledge" and "promise" in 1992 while asserting his grassroots funding plan was for that election as well as "for the future." The future is here, and Feingold has failed to keep his promise. Not only that, he claims he never said the pledge applied going forward, despite video evidence to the contrary. Johnson’s ad includes several clips that, while short, are used in context. We rate Johnson’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/88b81dd7-e06d-4c6e-97f2-3eba9e4c5b9c	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-09-07T05:00:00	2016-08-23	['Wisconsin', 'Russ_Feingold']

pomt-05696	"A hundred percent of all the jobs lost during the recession have been reclaimed in Texas … while the nation is at about 36 percent."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-regained-all-jobs-it-los/	Looking forward, Dallas Morning News reporter Gromer Jeffers Jr. asked Perry in a February 2012 interview what his priority is for the 2013 Texas legislative session. Perry, appearing on WFAA-TV in Dallas, opened his reply by touching on one of his favorite topics: jobs. Noting that Texas is a growing state, Perry said: "We’ve got a lot going on. We’re creating a huge amount of jobs. A hundred percent of all the jobs lost during the recession have been reclaimed in Texas, have been re-created if you will, while the nation is at about 36 percent." People are moving to Texas for those jobs, Perry said, which creates challenges for energy, for water and for education — issues that Perry said would top his legislative priorities. During Perry’s two most recent campaigns — his 2010 re-election effort and his bid to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee — he repeatedly touted job gains in Texas, often saying that the state’s performance, compared to the rest of the nation, showed that Texas economic policies should serve as a model for the country. We fact-checked a lot of Perry’s job-related claims, in many cases finding them Half True because even when his cited statistics were accurate, his explicit or implied claim of credit was not supported. Job gains or losses in individual states are driven by many factors, with neither gains or losses fairly attributable to an individual officeholder. In the WFAA-TV interview, though, Perry did not lay claim to credit for all the jobs regained in Texas. So we’re focusing this fact-check on whether he accurately compared developments in Texas and the nation. That is, did Texas regain all jobs lost during the recession while the country recaptured just 36 percent? Perry’s calculation holds, as we’ll detail later in this look. But we paused first at whether Texas’ return to pre-downturn employment levels means everyone who lost a job has landed back on a payroll. No, said Cheryl Abbot, an economist with the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas. That’s because even though Texas has about the same number of jobs as it did before the downturn, it also has more people and a larger labor force. "Yes, we have regained all the job slots … that we had prior to the recession," Abbot said. "But as to who is filling those slots, we have no information. It could be new residents or Texans who got a job who had been unemployed." John Heleman, the state’s chief revenue estimator, touched on this issue during a Feb. 21, 2012, hearing of the Texas House Appropriations Committee after noting that Texas "had regained all the jobs it lost during the recessionary period" while the United States had regained 36 percent. Still, Heleman said, the Texas unemployment rate was not falling "as fast as one would hope" and later noted that Texas is a growing state. "Our labor force has grown," Heleman said. "And in the years of the recession, we added people to our labor force that are currently not yet finding jobs. So, actually regaining all those jobs is a very good thing and a very positive thing, but we still have some ways to go." Richard Fisher, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, made a similar point about the unemployment rate in a Feb. 15, 2012, speech praising the Texas economy and its jobs recovery. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state labor force was about 11.7 million in the summer of 2008, when the state’s total number of jobs started to drop. By January 2012, the labor force, meaning the number of people employed or looking for work, had surpassed 12.5 million. When Heleman spoke to the committee, he noted that the national unemployment rate had dropped to 8.5 percent in December 2011 from its recent recession high of 10 percent while the Texas rate had fallen to 7.8 percent from a high of 8.5 percent. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics has since revised the monthly Texas unemployment rates, putting the more recent high at 8.2 percent in December 2010 and the December 2011 figure at 7.4 percent.) Before the number of Texas jobs began to drop, the state’s unemployment rate was below 5 percent. So, population growth, perhaps helped along by the attractiveness of the Texas economy, helps explain that it’s unlikely that every Texan who lost a job in the recession has gained a new one. It’s true too, though, that Perry didn’t directly say everyone is back on a payroll. And what of the job figures behind Perry’s comparison? Unlike previous job statements we’ve checked in which Perry compared Texas’ performance to that of the 49 other states combined, here, he is contrasting the state’s record with that of the nation as a whole. To back up Perry’s claim, his spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, pointed us to a part of the Texas state comptroller’s website that tracks economic indicators for the state. It included this information: "By December 2011, Texas employers replaced all 433,400 jobs shed during the recession as our economy rebounded more quickly than the U.S. as a whole and continues to add jobs. Nationally, through January 2012, only 36 percent of recession-hit jobs have been recovered." R.J. DeSilva, a spokesman for Comptroller Susan Combs, sent us the details of how the Texas-U.S. comparison was worked up, calling it a "peak-to-trough analysis" that shows the pace of job recovery in Texas compared to the U.S. "The analysis is done to show the negative effect on employment in Texas from the pre-recession peak number of jobs to its trough, and the number of jobs (that) have been added back since then. The same analysis is used for the U.S. employment peak through its trough." DeSilva told us that the analysis was done using nonfarm employment figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Let’s start by looking at the national job figures. The country’s most recent recession began in December 2007 and lasted 18 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. U.S. employment was at its peak in January 2008, with 138 million jobs. From there, the number of jobs dropped for 25 straight months, long past the declared end of the national recession, June 2009. The number of U.S. jobs hit its trough of 129.2 million in February 2010. For its analysis, the comptroller’s office calculated the number of jobs that the nation lost as the difference between the peak and the trough, for a net loss of 8.8 million jobs. (See graphs at right.) Next, the comptroller’s office calculated the nation’s net jobs gained over the 23 months that followed the February 2010 employment trough. The bureau’s data show that in all but four of the intervening months through January 2012, the number of U.S. jobs rose. In January 2012, the most recent national jobs figure at the time of the analysis, the United States had 3.2 million more jobs than it did in February 2010. Finally, the comptroller’s office compared the 3.2 million net jobs gained since February 2010 with the 8.8 million net jobs lost before then, calculating what percentage of the number lost had been gained back. That’s 36 percent (3.2 million is 36 percent of 8.8 million). The office applied the same logic and methodology to Texas’ jobs numbers: calculating the number of jobs lost — on a net basis — between the state’s most recent employment peak and trough, and then comparing that figure with the number of net jobs gained since the trough. Texas’ job losses did not follow the same time line as the nation’s. The state’s total number of jobs didn’t start to consistently drop until summer 2008. Also, while it took the United States 25 months to reach its most recent jobs nadir, Texas hit its low point in 16 months, with the number of jobs falling from more than 10.6 million in August 2008 to about 10.2 million in December 2009. That’s a reduction of about 400,000 jobs (exact number: 433,400). Texas experienced month-to-month job gains in 20 of the 24 months after its trough. And in December 2011, the most recent jobs figure available for Texas from the BLS, the state had 440,200 more jobs than it did in December 2009. So, Texas added more jobs after hitting its employment low than it lost in the 16 previous months. And its December 2011 total of nearly 10.7 million jobs returned the state to its pre-downturn level of employment. One note on Perry’s wording: He said his comparison was of jobs lost "during the recession," but the analysis on which his statement is based wraps in job losses that occurred — nationally and in Texas — beyond the recession’s end in June 2009. Still, we see that his point was to contrast how far the state and the nation have come in terms of recovering jobs that were lost during the economic downturn, and his backup, the comptroller’s analysis, does that. Our ruling As Perry indicated, Texas has as many jobs as it had before the recession — more, in fact — while the nation as a whole has not climbed as far back. Still, the Texas unemployment rate, though falling, remains higher than its pre-recession level, and, of course, not every Texan who lost a job has regained one. We rate Perry’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-03-11T06:00:00	2012-02-26	['Texas']

pomt-03543	"18 percent of our land in our state right now is either federally, state or county owned for conservation purposes."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/26/alberta-darling/Nearly-1-in-5-acres-in-Wisconsin-is-owned-by-the-f/	If state Sen. Alberta Darling is correct, nearly one of every five acres of land in Wisconsin is owned by the federal, state or county government and is set aside for conservation. That’s open space for forests and parks, as well as for activities such as fishing, hiking, camping and snowmobiling. Darling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, uttered the statistic in the context of: When is enough, enough? With the Legislature considering a reduction in what the state spends on such land acquisitions, it’s time for a conservation conversation. Joint Finance and stewardship Darling is co-chairwoman of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, a 16-member panel of Senate and Assembly members that reviews all state appropriations and revenue -- most notably the state budget. Inevitably, the committee makes changes in the governor’s biennial budget proposal before the Legislature adopts the budget and the governor signs it into law. On May 15, 2013, in the thick of reviewing Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s 2014-2015 budget, the GOP-controlled committee discussed whether to spend less on the state stewardship program, which is one way government buys land for conservation. The money comes from borrowing and is repaid with tax dollars. At one point during the discussion, Darling stated: "We've had a lot of people around the state tell us, you know, the stewardship program's a great program. We have a lot of very precious lands. But we have 18 percent of our land in our state right now is either federally, state or county owned for conservation purposes. A lot of our constituents are saying, What is the endgame here?" So, let’s see where the 18 percent claim comes from. (By the way, Walker’s budget proposal kept stewardship spending the same -- $120 million over two years. After its discussion, Joint Finance voted to reduce that amount by $18 million. The state budget is supposed to be finalized by July 1, 2013.) Darling’s evidence Darling spokesman Bob Delaporte cited two sources to back Darling’s statement. 1. A January 2013 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It estimated that 5.89 million acres, or 16.95 percent, of Wisconsin’s 34.8 million acres were owned for conservation as of June 30, 2012. That includes the 1.5 million-acre Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in the North Woods; state forests, such as the 232,000-acre Northern Highland American Legion State Forest in Iron, Oneida, and Vilas counties; as well as county parks and forests. 2. A March 2013 email from the Department of Natural Resources to the Joint Finance Committee co-chairs, which quotes a higher figure: 18.5 percent. That email noted Wisconsin’s rate is higher than Illinois’ and Iowa’s, which are both below 3 percent; but lower than Michigan’s 22 percent and Minnesota’s 25 percent. Darling’s spokesman told us the senator "went with 18 percent" during the finance committee discussion because that figure is between the fiscal bureau’s estimate, rounded up, of 17 percent and the DNR’s estimate of 18.5 percent. Indeed, either figure, if accurate, would essentially back Darling’s claim, given that they are estimates. We talked with the authors of the fiscal bureau report and the DNR’s email, as well as other officials. One reason the DNR figure is higher is that it included federally owned properties such as military installations. Another reason the DNR’s figure varies from the fiscal bureau’s figure is the estimates were done at different times. So, we came up with the following breakdown to provide the best figures available. The county and federal acreage numbers are from the fiscal bureau, which the DNR agreed is the most up to date. And the DNR provided us its current figures for state-owned conservation land. (One note: The state figure includes conservation land owned only by the DNR and the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, not other agencies or the University of Wisconsin System.) Unit of government Acres owned for conservation % of total acres in Wisconsin Counties 2,470,000 7.11 Federal 1,856,500 5.34 State 1,571,563 4.52 Total 5,897,816 16.97 So, rounding up, 17 percent is, in fact, the best available figure. To be sure, the total percentage of land in Wisconsin set aside for conservation is actually somewhat higher, because neither the fiscal bureau nor the DNR attempted to count how many acres of conservation land are owned by tribes, municipalities or private entities. But Darling’s claim was strictly on federal, state and county land. Our rating Darling said 18 percent of land in Wisconsin "is either federally, state or county owned for conservation purposes." The more up-to-date figure is 17 percent, but it is an estimate. We rate Darling’s claim True.	None	Alberta Darling	None	None	None	2013-05-26T09:00:00	2013-05-15	['None']
pomt-03258	Says "in Oregon today, the average debt upon college graduation is more than $24,000."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/aug/10/jeff-merkley/average-debt-upon-college-graduation-more-24000/	A university degree doesn’t come cheap, and politicians are well aware that voters of all stripes wish college was more affordable. In a guest column last month in the Portland Tribune, Oregon’s junior U.S. senator wrote of his desire to make college more affordable to help grow the economy. In the piece, Democrat Jeff Merkley also cited the debt burden shouldered by the state’s university graduates. "In Oregon today, the average debt upon college graduation is more than $24,000, with many students in debt $50,000 to $100,000," he wrote. At least $24,000 on average? That’s not chump change. For that money, students could splurge on a new car, plunk down a sizeable down payment on a first home or fly off on a very grand tour of Europe. In fact, $24,000 is almost half of the median annual household income in Oregon, according to the latest U.S. Census figures. We decided to focus our fact check on that statistic. Jamal Raad, Merkley’s spokesman, wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Oregon that the $24,000 figure comes from a June 2013 fact sheet from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning D.C. think tank. The average debt per borrower in Oregon is $24,370, according to the report. That figure includes both public and private universities, said David Bergeron, the center’s vice president for post-secondary education policy. The figure originated from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Household Debt and Credit Report, which provides a quarterly snapshot of trends in borrowing, including student loans. The statistic comes from a sample of consumer credit data and accounts for federally backed and private loans students borrowed, said Matthew Ward, a spokesman for the bank. The average amount borrowed by Oregon students is a bit less than the $24,810 U.S. average, according to the report. It also noted that 17.1 percent of Oregon consumers -- defined as those with a credit record -- carry student debt. The report listed "average debt per borrower," not average debt per college graduate. In other words, many students incur student debt even if they drop out and never graduate. Some students incur no debt. Graduates from Oregon colleges in 2011 incurred an average debt of $25,497, according to The Institute for College Affordability & Success, a nonprofit that tracks student debt. The figures are for public and private schools and are based on voluntary reports submitted to college guidance company Peterson’s, which administers a financial aid database. The numbers are only as reliable as the universities are able to track and report. And college financial aid officers aren’t always aware of private loans that can add up. The institute’s numbers indicate that debt amounts can vary widely for private colleges, some of which offer more generous financial aid packages than public universities. For example, Reed College graduates in 2011 left with an average debt of $20,840; Lewis & Clark College $22,956; Willamette University $25,932; and Linfield College $29,754. We’ll note here that student debt figures are generally calculated out of the pool of graduates who leave school with debt — about 63 percent of Oregon students, the institute said. In other words, about 37 percent of students in Oregon graduate debt free. This matters because officials made similar statements about average debt per graduate in Ohio and Virginia, resulting in Half True rulings from sister PolitiFact organizations. They neglected to account for students who graduate without debt. Merkley, unlike the other politicians, did not talk about the "average student" but the "average debt." We’ll come back to this point later. Finally, we checked with the Oregon University System. The average debt of graduates in the class of 2011 across all seven state schools was $23,839, according to the OUS 2012 Fact Book. The figures are for federal loans borrowed by students at each institution. About 59 percent of graduates left with debt. Merkley said that the average debt upon college graduation in Oregon is more than $24,000. The studies we found came up with three figures that largely back him up. The studies calculated student debt in different ways, making apples-to-apples comparisons impossible even though they’re all within range of one another. The studies also fail to account entirely for private loans students take out directly, which would likely increase the average student indebtedness amounts. Still, the reports back up Merkley’s statement. The only point left to quibble over is clarifying that 37 percent of students graduate from university in Oregon without any debt. That is additional information that could help readers understand that the $24,000 figure is among those who leave college in debt. Unlike officials in other states, Merkley did not write about the "average kid" or student incurring a certain amount of debt. He wrote about "average debt" upon graduation. That makes his statement accurate, but it needs additional information and context. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Jeff Merkley	None	None	None	2013-08-10T06:00:00	2013-07-11	['Oregon']

pomt-08189	On an earmark moratorium.	full flop	/texas/statements/2010/nov/26/kay-bailey-hutchison/us-sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-voted-against-earmark-/	Before the Republican gubernatorial primary, Gov. Rick Perry painted U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison as a Washington insider, all but hanging a scarlet "W" around her neck and crowning her "Earmark Queen" for funneling federal tax dollars to Texas projects. The upshot: Perry not only walloped Hutchison, he stepped smartly in line with an escalating Republican-led call to stop earmarks — spending items (or pork) tucked into the budget by individual lawmakers. And lately, Hutchison has lent her support to Republicans who want to ban earmarks for two years. Does that mean she's flip-flopped on the so-called "earmark moratorium?" According to a February study by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government-spending watchdog, Hutchison, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, ranked 19th among the 100 U.S. senators in fiscal year 2010 for steering tax dollars to specific projects in their home states. The state's junior senator, John Cornyn, ranked 54th. Since 2008, Hutchison has secured $3.6 billion in earmarks for Texas projects, according to the Dallas Morning News, which in March 2009 quoted Hutchison saying: "I do think that earmarks are a legitimate role of Congress. I don't think that we should be earmarking things that do not have a national interest. Can it be overdone? Yes. Should it be transparent? Yes. But that is the role of Congress, to determine how we spend money." Critics say that earmarks are likelier to serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group than the national good. In March, House Republicans adopted a voluntary year-long earmark ban, which is non-binding (U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, was one of a handful GOP lawmakers to defy the House moratorium) but symbolically significant. On Nov. 18, House Republicans voted to extend the ban through the next Congress, which convenes in January. Such a ban failed to clear the Senate in March. Then, Hutchison voted with the majority to table an amendment by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., to ban earmarks for two years, prohibiting Congress from considering any proposal including an earmark. In the 68-29 vote, 24 Republicans voted to continue consideration of the ban and 15 voted to put the idea aside. Cornyn, who was a cosponsor of the amendment, voted against tabling the measure. Before the vote, DeMint said on the Senate floor: "The trust in our government is at an all-time low, and the earmarks that we send across the country are mostly with borrowed money. With all of our debt, the corruption, the waste, every American has a right to question what we're doing right now." In a March 16 press release Hutchison issued about her vote to table the DeMint's amendment, she said "this legislation does not rein in the federal budget. Ironically, it would hand even more power to President Obama and his administration, while not cutting one cent of deficit spending. Texas’ elected representatives have a far greater understanding of Texas priorities than federal bureaucrats in the Obama administration. The same amount of funds would be spent; the only issue was who would make the decision – Congress or the president’s appointees." Our finding: Not everyone agrees with the logic that the federal government would control discretionary spending in the absence of earmarks. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said: "It's a convenient argument that people like to make" overlooking the reality that each president's budget can't take effect without congressional approval. But what a difference seven months, and perhaps the midterm elections, may have made for Hutchison. On Nov. 16, Hutchison came out in favor of another effort to ban earmarks, at least among Republicans, when GOP senators adopted a proposal by DeMint to ban earmarks for two years. Like the House GOP's action last spring, the endorsed ban isn't binding; it's a caucus agreement. But GOP senators are calling on Democrats to do the same. The Hill reported Nov. 22 that the full Senate is expected to vote soon on a proposal banning earmarks for three years, as an amendment to a food-safety bill. After pushing back against the renewed push for a ban in the days before the GOP caucus vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also pledged his allegiance to the ban, which Cornyn again cosponsored. McConnell and other earmark defenders have said the spending items account for a tiny slice of federal spending and are important for their districts. Earlier this month, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True Indiana Republican Sen. Richard Lugar's statement that "eliminating earmarks does not reduce spending." In a Nov. 16 statement she issued announcing her support for the ban, Hutchison called it "a way to the start the process of reform that is essential to address the crushing debt our country has accumulated." But she didn't abandon her position that if Congress doesn't direct some spending it yields decisions on discretionary spending to the White House: "The president will have 100 percent of the discretion in all federal programs... As we reform the budget process, our goal should be to cut overall spending levels, while preventing inappropriately targeted funding by both the administration and Congress." We wondered if DeMint's proposal has changed since March, in a way explaining Hutchison's support this time around. Her office didn't respond to our query. Separately, we consulted Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that favors balanced budgets and reducing the national debt. Gordon told us DeMint's latest proposal is not substantively different from what he offered in the spring. "Seems to me the intention is exactly the same," he said. Also, Wesley Denton, a DeMint spokesman, told us the language of the senator's proposed moratorium has not changed. When we asked Hutchison spokeswoman Courtney Sanders why Hutchison voted in favor of the moratorium this month after voting to table his March proposal, Sanders pointed us to the senator's Nov. 16 statement. In an opinion article published in the Nov. 22 Austin American-Statesman, Hutchison writes: "House and Senate Republicans recently took a historic step and voted to support a moratorium on congressional earmarks. I supported that effort because it will give Congress the opportunity to make our nation's budget process more transparent and accountable and allow us to focus on cutting spending." Hutchison also writes that she has "fought hard to bring federal resources to projects that are priorities for communities in Texas and where there is a national service," but her article concludes that "overall government spending is out of control and we must focus on cutting spending across the board." So, to the Flip-O-Meter. In March, Hutchison voted to table DeMint's amendment to freeze earmarks for two years. This month, she voted in favor of a DeMint-backed ban in a vote limited to GOP senators. True, Hutchison's first vote was to set aside legislation temporarily banning earmarks and the second was in favor of a voluntary earmark ban taken by Senate Republicans. But both were significant — and contradictory — stands on an earmark moratorium. We call this a Full Flop.	None	Kay Bailey Hutchison	None	None	None	2010-11-26T06:00:00	2010-11-16	['None']

pomt-05084	Says the health care law rations care, like systems in Canada and Great Britain.	false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-health-care-law-rations-care-syste/	Gov. Rick Scott continues to oppose the national health care law and said Friday that Florida would be opting out of parts of the law. In a blitz of media appearances over the week, Scott said the state would not expand Medicaid, an existing health insurance program for the very poor. He also said he wouldn’t allow the state to open health insurance "exchanges," places where consumers will comparison shop for health insurance. Scott also repeated the claim that the health care law rations care. Scott said driving down the costs of health care should be left to the free market, and that expanding government-run health insurance programs to the uninsured was a bad idea. "Insurance is not the answer. (The answer is to) drive down the cost of health care. You have insurance in places like U.K. and Canada, where they say, oh we cover you. But you don’t get it, because it’s rationed. That’s what’s going to happen," Scott said in an interview on Fox News on July 2. Earlier in the interview, Scott said: "Look, government health care programs everywhere in the world do three things. They promise you the world. They say, oh we’re going to cover everything. Then what they do is they run out of money and they underpay hospitals, doctors, and guess what happens? They don’t want to take care of you. There’s fewer of them, just like what’s happened in England, Canada, places like that." Scott’s answer is problematic on several levels. For one thing, people in the United Kingdom and Canada do receive care. Sometimes patients have to wait for appointments, but they do receive care. More significantly, Scott implied that the types of systems in Canada and the United Kingdom are what’s going to happen under the current health care law. That’s not the case. In Canada, the government pays the bills for health care for everyone. The closest comparison for this country would be if Medicare (the health insurance program for people over age 65) were extended to everyone. In the United Kingdom, the government runs the National Health Service, directly owning hospitals and employing doctors. The health care law does neither of those two things. Instead, it leaves in place the current systems of Medicare, Medicaid and employer-provided insurance. It expands Medicaid coverage for the very poor, and offers credits to people of modest means to buy insurance on their own. To make those purchases easier, it creates health insurance exchanges, where plans have to meet minimum standards and explain their coverage in plain language. On the specific charge of "rationing," we’ve fact-checked several claims about the health care law, that various parts of the law result in rationing. Scott’s statement doesn’t refer to a specific part of the law. Here’s the bottom line: The health care law rations care no more nor less than the current health care system does. The current health care system -- whether it’s private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid -- does not allow people to have all the health care as they want. Under the new law, people still can’t have all the health care they want. We rate Scott’s statement False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-07-02T19:09:22	2012-07-02	['Canada']

pomt-15367	"The average age a child is trafficked into the commercial sex trade industry is between 11 and 14 years old."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/jul/06/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-says-average-age-child-sex-traffickin/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes recently called on the U.S. to toughen its "zero tolerance" laws against sex trafficking. "The average age a child is trafficked into the commercial sex trade industry is between 11 and 14 years old," Forbes, R-4th, wrote in a June 16 post on his congressional website. Statistics from the murky world of child prostitution are spotty and become even more elusive when focused on the small subgroup of child prostitutes -- perhaps 10 percent -- who have been sold into the sex trade. So we wondered whether Forbes’ statement is accurate. In his post, Forbes hyperlinked to a bulletin from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that says, "The children at risk are not just high school students -- studies show that the average age a child is trafficked into the commercial sex trade is between 11 and 14 years old." Hailey Sadler, Forbes’ spokeswoman, pointed us to two other government agencies that have made identical or similar claims. She noted two instances by the FBI and one by the Congressional Research Service. Sometimes the agencies didn’t cite a specific study as the source of the age claim. And when they did identify a source, they credited a 2001 study at the University of Pennsylvania on child sex trafficking in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The study was largely based on interviews with child prostitutes. "The age range of entry into prostitution for the boys, including gay and transgender boys, was somewhat younger than that of the girls, i.e., 11-13 years vs. 12-14 years, respectively" the report said, adding that other studies from the 1980s and 1990s found similar results. But there are issues with the research: A small sample of child victims were interviewed -- just 63 boys and 107 girls. None of the children were controlled by sex traffickers, according to Richard Estes, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who was lead writer of the report. "All were street children who had run away either from their homes or an institution," he emailed to us. The survey dates back to the 1990s and even Estes doesn’t claim the findings are still relevant. "No one knows what the true statistical picture looks like today in 2015 given all of the very significant legal and public awareness changes that resulted from our investigation," he said. Dan Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, told us it’s implausible that children enter the sex trade at an average age of 11 - 14. "The use of the term ‘average’ would suggest that there’s a whole group that are starting younger than that (11-14 years old) to compensate for the kids that are older than that as well," Finkelhor said. "It’s just not true." In other words, children who started at 16 or 17 would have to be balanced by those who started at eight or nine. Sadler, in backing Forbes’ statement, also cited a 2009 report by Shared Hope International, an anti-trafficking group. It says "research has shown that the average age of entry into prostitution and pornography is 12 to 14 years old in the United States." Although there’s no research footnote, the report says the statistic is "confirmed" by information officials in Clark County, Nevada gathered on 96 girls -- aged 11 to 17 -- they arrested for prostitution. The report has a chart on the ages of the girls. We did the math and found the average was 14.96 years old. That’s young, but not as young as the average ages cited by Forbes or Shared Hope. We couldn’t find updated national figures on the child sex trade, and for good reason. Jay Albanese, a professor and criminologist at Virginia Commonwealth University, said recent research has taken municipal looks at the problem. For example, Albanese said one study found that girls in Tijuana, Mexico were forced into prostitution between 14 to 17 years old. Another study focusing on child prostitutes in New York City found that the average age of entry into the sex trade was just over 15 years old. Another study found that in Atlanta sex trade workers interviewed averaged 14 years old. "Therefore, studies have found variation in the ages of CSEC (commercially sexually exploited child) victims, which reflects the fact that these are local and regional studies---not national studies," Albanese said. "But it can be said that victims across these studies are overwhelmingly teenagers." Getting back to Forbes, it should be noted that he is among many politicians and child advocates who have cited the average 11-14 starting age for sex trafficking victims. Finkelhor told us the claim has gained credibility by repetition, not research. Sadler, Forbes’ spokeswoman, noted that the congressman offered a caveat further down in his web post, writing that "human trafficking is a crime that takes many forms, so it can be difficult to quantify or track … Victims are ‘hidden’ and so much is unknown about the crime." With that proviso, Sadler said Forbes’ statement "is as accurate as possible given current data." Our ruling Forbes wrote,"The average age a child is trafficked into the commercial sex trade industry is between 11 and 14 years old," This widely-circulated claim is based on a small-sample, national survey from the late 1990s that focused on street children who resorted to prostitution. None of the children were controlled by sex traffickers. Even the main author of the report says his findings are outdated and may no longer be relevant. We couldn’t find updated national research examining the age children enter the sex trade. Several studies in large cities put the average age around 14 or 15. Forbes acknowledged further down in his statement that human trafficking "can be difficult to quantify or track," but he didn’t tie that qualifier to the age statistic, which he stated as fact. Child prostitutes obviously enter the sex trade at young ages, but the average age is by no means established and there’s evidence it may be higher that Forbes’ figure. And again, all of the age research deals with street children -- not those who are being controlled by traffickers. On the whole, we rate Forbes’ statement Half True.

pomt-04098	Members of Congress "specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed, such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment" ... (and) from the healthcare reform."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/16/chain-email/did-members-congress-exempt-themselves-complying-h/	A new poll released this month by the firm Public Policy Polling showed Congress to be less popular than colonoscopies, root canals or cockroaches. To get a lower favorability rating than Congress, the Washington newspaper The Hill reported, they had to be compared to lobbyists, playground bullies, telemarketers and the Kardashians. Maybe that explains why people keep forwarding a viral email making damaging claims about Congress. Our friends at Snopes.com, the urban legend checker, say the email has been circulating in various forms since at least 2000. But it’s still circulating. A reader who recently received a version of the email forwarded it to PolitiFact Ohio asking about its accuracy. It asserts that relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers "are exempt from having to pay back student loans" -- a ridiculously false claim that Snopes.com and our colleagues at FactCheck.org debunked and that we rated Pants on Fire. We also rated as Pants on Fire its claim that members of Congress can "retire with the same pay after only one term." But readers also asked about another claim in the email: that members of Congress "specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed, such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment, while ordinary citizens must live under those laws. The latest is to exempt themselves from the healthcare reform, in all of its forms." PolitiFact first examined the claim that members of Congress are exempt from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act in 2009, when the legislation was still under consideration in Congress. We rated it False. That claim was based on the assumption that the health care reform plan would have sent everyone -- except Congress -- into a new "public option" federal insurance plan. It would not have. In fact, the law as passed did not even include a public option -- and Section 1213 of it requires members of Congress and congressional staff, starting in 2014, to buy health plans created by the health care act or offered through the state exchanges the act establishes. Political scientist Norman Ornstein, a long-time observer of Congress and a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, debunked the claim of congressional exemption in a piece he wrote for the Washington newspaper Roll Call. "On the assertion that Members of Congress are exempt from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act: also false," he wrote. "Members of Congress are subject under the health care reform law to the same mandate that others are to purchase insurance, and their plans must have the same minimum standards of benefits that other insurance plans will have to meet. Members of Congress currently have not a gold-plated free plan but the same insurance options that most other federal employees have, and they do not have it provided for free. They have a generous subsidy for their premiums, but no more generous (and compared to many businesses or professions less generous) than standard employer-provided subsidies throughout the country." FactCheck.org examined the broader claim that members of Congress "specifically exempted themselves from many of the laws they have passed (such as being exempt from any fear of prosecution for sexual harassment)," and found it "15 years out of date" in 2010. The reason: Passage of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. It specifically made sure a variety of laws dealing with civil rights, labor and workplace safety regulations applied to the legislative branch of government. The independent Office of Compliance was set up to enforce the laws in Congress. The act specifically prohibits harassment based on sex, race, color, religion, national origin, age and disability. Ornstein, who has been sharply critical of Congress (and only last month co-authored a piece for Foreign Policy magazine titled "Yes, Congress Is That Bad") said it is "not surprising that, in tough times, Americans would be inclined to believe the absolute worst about their elected officials. "But at least," he added, "let the criticism be fair and based on facts instead of persistent urban legends." PolitiFact Ohio would agree. At best, the chain email's statement about Congressional exemptions is ridiculously out of date. At worst, it is cynically inaccurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates Pants on Fire!

pomt-01316	Suicide comes from federal government largesse "saying you are not worth anything but you are going to get something for nothing."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/27/don-young/alaskas-don-young-says-suicide-linked-federal-gove/	In mid October, long-serving Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, provoked a firestorm with a series of comments about suicide. It’s a significant issue in his home state: In recent years, Alaska has experienced suicide at roughly twice the national rate. The controversy began when Young spoke to more than 100 students and staff at Wasilla High School on Oct. 21, 2014, just days after a student at the school had committed suicide. Young, according to news reports, told an audience that suicide shows a lack of support from friends and family -- a claim that inspired an immediate negative response from some in the audience. "A friend of the victim shouted to Young that a disease, depression, was at the root of suicide," the Alaska Dispatch News reported. "Young bristled at the interruption and responded to the student with profanity." Later that day, Young’s office released a statement saying the congressman should "have taken a much more sensitive approach." But Young doubled down in an event the next day, appearing before 100 people at a senior center. According a recording excerpted in the Dispatch News, Young told the group, "When people had to work and had to provide and had to keep warm by putting participation in cutting wood and catching the fish and killing the animals, we didn’t have the suicide problem." Suicide, he added, comes from federal government largesse "saying you are not worth anything but you are going to get something for nothing." We wondered: Is there proof that suicide in Alaska has been linked to receiving government payments? Before digging any deeper, we should note that Young’s office has since apologized for his comment. In a statement to PolitiFact on Oct. 23, Young’s office said he "discussed what he believes are leading causes of youth suicide in our state, including the impact of drugs and alcohol, depression, a feeling of worthlessness, and a lack of support systems. Congressman Young did not mean to upset anyone with his well-intentioned message, and in light of the tragic events affecting the Wasilla High School community, he should have taken a much more sensitive approach. … Issues like suicide and domestic violence cannot be discussed in isolation or generalities. Each and every case is different, and should be addressed in that manner." Then, a day later, in a speech to the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention, Young "shared his sincere and honest apology" and said the suicide of a nephew "may have caused me to mangle some of my statements." Still, since suicide is a significant problem in Alaska, we thought the substance of his original comment was worth a closer look. Explaining suicide in Alaska According to the state Department of Health and Social Services, the age-adjusted rate for suicide in Alaska between 2003 and 2010 was almost twice the national average. In 2010, suicide ranked as the sixth-leading cause of death in Alaska and the leading cause of death among persons aged 15–24 years. The main reason for Alaska’s high rate is the unusually high frequency of suicide among Alaska Natives -- that is, indigenous Alaskans. The suicide rate for rural Alaska Natives is three to four times higher than it is for Anglos, said Matthew D. Berman, an economist at the University of Alaska-Anchorage who has studied the issue. In a paper published earlier this year, Berman reported suicide data for Alaska Natives going back to 1950 (see chart below). The rate was basically flat from 1950 to the mid 1960s, then rose rapidly from the mid 1960s to the mid 1970s before falling again. The rate peaked in the late 1980s and has fallen slowly but consistently since then. One problem with the connection Young pointed to is that the creation of the state’s biggest source of "largesse" -- the annual dividends paid to all Alaska residents from the proceeds of natural-resource extraction -- doesn’t track with the ups and downs of Alaska Native suicide rates. The Alaska Permanent Fund, as the resource-extraction fund is known, began paying dividends to residents in 1982, usually between several hundred dollars and $2,000 in a given year. Yet the growth in Alaska Native suicide predated those dividends, and the suicide trend since creation of the fund has generally been downward. "This is a classic case of offering a simple answer to a really complicated problem," Berman said. "When I have visited rural Alaska, I see people hauling firewood, fishing, and hunting for food. The rural cash economy depends heavily on government, but state spending plays a bigger role than federal these days, and most of the income comes from employment." Moreover, researchers have found evidence that factors other than money tend to influence the rate of suicide in Alaska Native communities. Suicide tends to be lower among Alaska Natives who live in traditional ways, and among those who live in the larger, Anglo-dominant culture. Those who are are most susceptible to suicide are those who are firmly rooted in neither society, and perhaps transitioning between them. James Allen, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, has found that older Alaska Natives, who tend to have a stronger connection to cultural traditions, are at lower risk of suicide. This tracks with data from other polar indigenous populations, such as the Sami people of Norway. Sami people who participate in the traditional pursuit of reindeer herding tend to have lower rates of suicide, according to Siv Kvernmo, a researcher at the University of Tromso. As for the second group with lower suicide rates -- Alaska Natives who have relocated from rural villages to urban centers -- Berman reports that suicide rates in small, rural communities are more than twice as high as those among urban Native residents. Indeed, he writes, that the post-1980s decline in suicide rates may stem from more Alaska Natives moving to urban areas. (Today, about 10 percent of the state’s population lives in small, rural, predominantly Alaska Native communities.) In other words, Berman writes, the data suggests that "opportunities in the modern economy (higher median incomes) and a strong traditional presence (linguistically isolated households) offer some protection against young male suicide." "Research suggests that it was local communities' loss of control over their communities and land that is more relevant to the rise in suicide, not welfare," Berman told PolitiFact. In other words, Alaska Native suicide is a much more complex subject than Young was letting on. Our ruling Young said that suicide comes from federal government largesse "saying you are not worth anything but you are going to get something for nothing." Data suggests high suicide rates among Alaska Natives stem more from cultural changes, including the transition from rural, traditional practices to urban life. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01828	"For the first time in history, (Thor’s) hammer is being held by a woman."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/18/whoopi-goldberg/odins-beard-whoopi-goldberg-flubs-fact-about-femal/	This fact-check nearly has it all: A deep dive into comic lore, epic superhero battles in alternate universes, female empowerment and a bombastic but mistaken celebrity. The only thing missing is politics, but it’s Friday, so let’s take a break from all that. We couldn’t say no to a reader’s plea to fact-check Whoopi Goldberg of ABC’s The View about big news out of the comics world this week (though not the other piece of news of Archie dying after taking a bullet intended for his gay friend). "Thor, the God of Thunder, he messed up," Goldberg said in the July 15, 2014, segment. "He is no longer worthy to hold that damn hammer of his. And for the first time in history that hammer is being held by a woman." Almost, Whoopi. Almost. Marvel Comics announced this week it will introduce a new God of Thunder in the new comic series Thor in October -- and she will be a woman. The company billed it as a shocking shakeup, releasing an image of a blond, muscular woman outfitted in metal plating and a helmet with Mjölnir, the hammer of Thor, in her grasp. "This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it's unlike any Thor we've ever seen before," said series writer Jason Aaron in a statement. This does not mean, as Goldberg wrongly said, that it’s the first time a woman will hold Mjölnir. The editor of the upcoming series, Wil Moss, addressed this point in a Q&A with Time without going into specifics. Time: "Has there ever been a female Thor before?" Moss: "There have been occasional alternate universe stories where there have been female Thors. And there have been occasional stories where a female has picked up the hammer; like there’s an X-Men story where Storm picked up the hammer. But there’s never been a female Thor." The inscription of Mjölnir reads: "Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor." In the news release, Moss joked that it’s time to update the inscription. Neil Johnson, owner of Emerald City Comics in Clearwater, Fla., said that, "All through the history of that character, when Thor’s been knocked out by a supervillain or whatever, there have been characters that have been worthy enough to pick up and wield the hammer." Several female heroes have been "worthy" of holding the weapon, joining Superman, Captain America and male heroes deemed worthy. This often happens when Thor has been incapacitated or is being punished by his father Odin in alternate storylines and the main canon. We found examples from reddit, the website Den of Geek and Johnson. The earliest example of a woman wielding the hammer is Jane Foster, Thor’s human love interest, in a 1978 What If? issue (No. 1 on this list). In this alternate storyline, she discovered the hammer and became Thordis, saving Thor’s alter ego Donald Blake and beating off alien rock monsters. In another alternate reality issue in 1994, Rogue of the X-Men used her mutant power of absorbing others’ powers and basically sucked up Thor’s life force, using his hammer to wreak destruction on Thor’s alien realm, Asgard, before seeing the light and becoming the hero. Our reader pointed us to a 1996 crossover event between DC Comics and Marvel in which DC’s Wonder Woman wielded Mjölnir. Wonder Woman obtained the hammer and its powers ahead of a showdown with Marvel’s Storm, a female character from the X-Men, but decided not to use it because it would not be a fair fight. (And so she lost.) And then there was the Earth-X miniseries in which Odin transformed Thor into a female version of himself per the urging of Thor’s mischievous brother Loki (see the cover). This was an alternate future timeline, and some reasonable comic fans may argue (as a few did in our reddit thread) that those are considered non-canon and should not count. Still, Storm is one example of a woman who held the hammer in a story within regular continuity "if people are worried about it," Johnson said. Storm uses Thor’s hammer in the 2011 comic X-Men: To Serve and Protect #3 to destroy an imitation hammer called Stormcaster given to her by Loki (again, bad intentions) in a 1985 comic. Other female hammer-holders include Black Widow and Crusader, both in What If scenarios. Read Den of Geek for more. Another character, Tarene, aka Thor Girl, had her own hammer but did not use Thor’s Mjölnir. Our ruling Goldberg said Thor "is no longer worthy to hold that damn hammer of his. And for the first time in history that hammer is being held by a woman." It appears Goldberg mixed up her talking points. While this is the first time a woman will be Thor, it’s not the first time a woman has held Thor’s hammer.

pomt-00348	Says Sean Hannity told listeners of his radio show that "Beto O’Rourke is asking for help in getting undocumented to vote."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/sep/14/blog-posting/hannity-orourke-asked-help-getting-undocumented-im/	A website called joemygod.com claimed that Sean Hannity told his radio audience that Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke asked for help getting immigrants in the country illegally to the polls so they could vote. It is true that Hannity said that. What is not true is that O’Rourke is asking for that help. O’Rourke is seeking to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate. He’s challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. The election is Nov. 6. "Hannity tells radio audience that Beto O’Rourke is asking for help in getting undocumented to vote," said a Sept. 7 post on joemygod.com. The website includes posts about politics, LGBT news and entertainment. The site’s Twitter account has more than 68,000 followers. Joemygod.com’s story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story accurately reflects what Hannity said on his Sept. 7 radio show. The conservative pundit said: "A text message was sent out by a Democratic Senate hopeful down, where is this, in Texas. With this guy, what’s his name — O’Rourke, everybody loves so much, Beto O’Rourke is the guy’s name. Locked in a tight race, they say, with Ted Cruz — I think Ted Cruz will win." Hannity adds that Cruz has been "an enormous help" and a reliable senator for President Donald Trump. "Anyway, O’Rourke’s race, it goes on to say, ‘we are in search of volunteers to help transport undocumented immigrants to polling booths.’ They’re doing that in Texas. I’m not making it up, it was in the Austin American-Statesman," Hannity said. What Hannity failed to mention is that O’Rourke’s campaign said the text message "was sent by an impostor," and not by O’Rourke or his team, according to an American-Statesman Sept. 5 story. The Austin American-Statesman publishes PolitiFact Texas. The joemygod.com story is accurate. We rate it True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Editor's note: We revised the ruling statement of this fact-check Sept. 18 in effort to make the focus of this fact-check (which is that Hannity told his listeners inaccurate information) more clear.

pomt-11537	Says Tim Burns and Rebecca Dallet "have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/14/michael-screnock/have-2-supreme-court-hopefuls-campaigned-against-s/	Conventional wisdom on the 2018 primary election for Wisconsin Supreme Court says the real battle is between Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet and Madison lawyer Tim Burns. That’s because they’re viewed as competing for votes on the left, while Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock is seen as the lone conservative. The two candidates who get the most votes in the Feb. 20 primary will face off April 3 for the seat held by Michael Gableman, who is not seeking re-election. Currently, Gableman is among the conservative justices who have 5-2 control on the seven-member court. In his first radio ad of the campaign, Screnock attacked both Dallet and Burns while also alluding to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed Screnock to the bench. In the spot, released Jan. 29, 2018, Screnock introduces himself and then makes a two-part claim about Dallet and Burns: They have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench. Is that what Burns -- who has been especially outspoken about his political views -- and Dallet have been doing? It's worth noting that Screnock has hired GOP consultants and has received a $31,152 in-kind donation from the state Republican Party. He also released a radio ad that points out he was appointed to the bench by Walker. But to evaluate his claim, here’s a look at statements made by Burns and Dallet since they announced their candidacies and up until Screnock made his claim about them. ‘Openly criticized’ Walker laws We found that Burns has been repeatedly critical of laws signed by Walker: Burns statements on laws signed by Walker Act 10 Interview, Jan. 8, 2018 Walker’s union-curbing Act 10 "is blatantly unconstitutional." Act 10 Speech, June 2, 2017 Justice Michael Gableman (who had not yet announced he would not seek another term) restricted "workers’ right to bargain." ‘Walker’s agenda’ League of Women Voters Q&A "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has been a rubber stamp for Scott Walker’s harmful agenda." Voter ID Candidate forum, Jan. 29, 2018 "I believe that gerrymandering and photo ID are great dangers to democracy." Foxconn Interview, Jan. 8, 2018 On state’s $3 billion incentives for Foxconn: "I am opposed to the notion of large corporations playing on a different playing field from our small farms and our small businesses." Burns’ campaign told us this part of Screnock’s statement, as it applies to Burns, is accurate. In contrast, we found only one Dallet statement about a Walker law. But her criticism was of the Supreme Court, not Act 10. Dallet statement on laws signed by Walker Act 10 Interview, Jan. 2, 2018 On a challenge to Walker’s Act 10 union-curbing law: "I think that the (Supreme) Court got it wrong ….I think that they didn’t analyze the actual issue. The issue in the Act 10 case was whether the right to association was being violated by all of the penalties essentially being put on unions. And they analyzed it under a right to collective bargaining, which everyone agrees, there is no right to collectively bargain. There is a right, instead, to have freedom of association." Dallet told us in a statement: "I’ve been careful to limit my criticisms to decisions the court has already made, in cases that have been completed," such as the Act 10 case. Now to the second part of Screnock’s claim. ‘Campaigning to implement policies from the bench’ Both Burns and Dallet have made statements indicating positions they hold on issues, though Burns has been considerably more direct. Burns statements ‘Liberal values’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 "On the Wisconsin Supreme Court, I will be an unshakable champion of liberal, democratic and progressive values." Taxes Interview, Jan. 8, 2018 In response to a question, says taxes on the wealthy should be raised to provide attorneys for poor in civil cases such as evictions. ‘We’ Democrats Interview, Jan. 17, 2018 "We" won, referring to victory the previous day by Democrat Patty Schachtner in state Senate special election. ‘I’m a Democrat’ Interview, Jan. 9, 2018 "I’m a Democrat with a big D." Middle class Interview, Jan. 17, 2018 "When the Legislature or a governor passes a law that's a basic attack on our middle-class democracy, that's when courts have to step in and say, No way, Bub." ‘Progressive majority’ Interview, Jan. 8, 2018 "We can have a progressive majority on the court by the spring of 2020." ‘Expanding rights’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 "If expanding rights is legislating from the bench, count me in." ‘Political values’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 "From day one of this campaign, I have been candid with voters about what my political views are and my belief that political values -- when you have a constitution that talks about equal protection and due process -- ultimately impacts how you decide cases." ‘Political decisions’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 "I am the first candidate on the left in this state for this position who has said enough is enough with this nonsense that judges don’t make political decisions." Reproductive rights Candidate forum, Jan. 29, 2018 "I believe the government has no role in our bedroom or our reproductive decisions, period." ‘Progressive politics’ Speech, June 2, 2017 "I am running a nonpartisan race, but I will not run from progressive organizations and I will not run from progressive politics. I am proud of the values we share." (Speech to Wisconsin Democratic Party convention) Against conservatives Twitter, Jan. 29, 2018 Radio host Jay Weber "spends a fair amount of time criticizing me, but only after he expresses fear that with this election, conservatives could lose control of the court by 2020. In case I have not been clear — THAT IS MY GOAL." Burns’ campaign rejected this part of Screnock’s claim. A spokeswoman pointed out that Burns has said he believes in giving great deference to the Legislature, but must closely scrutinize cases when a "law infringes on a protection outlined in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights," or "makes it so democracy cannot repair itself" or "infringes on a group that historically does not have political power." Nevertheless, some of Burns’ statements call for specific actions, such as being a "champion of liberal" values, saying his goal is to create a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, saying taxes on the wealthy should be raised and outlining his position on abortion. Dallet, meanwhile, has said justices shouldn’t be elected based on party ties and has criticized Burns for taking positions. For example, she told the 2017 Wisconsin Democratic Party convention: Some will tell you that the solution to partisan judges on the right is to elect more partisan judges, just from the other side. I have a different view of the world, in that I think judges really do need to be independent ….I don’t think the answer is just to come here and tell you that judges need to vote like partisan Democrats to counteract partisan Republican judges. If we fall into the trap of politicizing the third branch, we turn our backs on our true progressive history. At the same time, Dallet has stated which issues are important to her. Dallet statements ‘Rights under attack’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 "We’re living in a time when our rights are under attack every day. Equal protection under the law, clean air and water -- women are under attack." ‘Rights act risk’ Dallet campaign event, Jan. 17, 2018 "I look at (the Supreme Court) and I look at all the rights that we care so deeply about -- things like public education, things like clean air and water, equal protection under the law and all the things that make Wisconsin great -- I think, are at risk." ‘The policies we want’ Dallet campaign event, Jan. 17, 2018 "It is the time for women. It’s a time for making sure we stand up and our rights are protected. And experience matters to get the policies we want to move forward and to protect our rights." ‘Mass incarceration’ Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 "I’m not going to apologize for standing up for safer communities and for victims. And I think that we can do that while also trying to address racial injustice and the problem of mass incarceration." Trump ‘attacked’ rights Campaign TV ad, Jan. 29, 2018 President Donald Trump has "attacked our civil rights and our values. (Dallet will) protect them ….I’ll keep protecting our rights and defending our values." Trump remarks Twitter, Jan. 12, 2018 "I was deeply disappointed to see our nation’s discourse further degraded by President Trump’s horrific comments attacking people from Haiti, El Salvador, and various African countries. It is unacceptable and I condemn these remarks." Trump reference Interview, Jan. 5, 2018 I’m running "because our rights are under attack -- our civil rights -- every day, tweet by tweet. Our right to clean air and water, our right to equal protection, women’s rights and we’ve got a broken Supreme Court." Values Candidates forum, Jan. 22, 2018 "I believe in clean air and water, I believe in our public education system and I believe in working people. I think we need to ensure we increase participation in our voting system, not decrease it. I think we need to address racial and gender inequality head on, not sweep the vestiges of a racist and patriarchal system under the rug." Women, environment Interview, Jan. 18, 2018 "Just look at our president and you have to worry about equal protection under the law. Women are under attack. We have to protect our environment." ‘Empowering women’ Women’s march speech, Jan. 20, 2018 "I am a mother of three and a judge, and I’ve spent my life empowering women." Doug Jones win over Roy Moore Twitter, Dec. 12, 2017 "Tonight’s win is for the victims. To the women who were brave enough to come forward, thank you. #AlabamaSenateElection" Gay marriage Speech, June 2, 2017 "My proudest day in the courtroom was when the federal court finally made all of us equal under the law when it comes to love and marriage. I’d been out of town, and as soon as I got home and heard the news, I grabbed my robe, I headed down to the courthouse, and I ended up being a part of a lot of happy couples’ special day, and a part of history." Democrat’s victory Twitter, Jan. 16, 2018 Retweets this headline: "Democrat Patty Schachtner has beaten GOP state Rep. Adam Jarchow to win the special election to represent Wisconsin's 10th Senate district." Tammy Baldwin event Twitter, Oct. 27, 2017 "I was lucky enough to see @SenWarren (U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.) speak on Saturday in Milwaukee, along with this great crowd!" Voter ID Interview, Jan. 9, 2018 "Voter ID -- everyone should be able to vote. Same with gerrymandering. Voting is one of our basic civil rights, our way that we can change our society. And when you take that right away -- we should all care about that." So, Dallet suggests she would be inclined to act against Wisconsin’s voter ID law, but otherwise has more generally stated which issues are important to her rather than indicating she would take certain actions. In her statement to us, Dallet said voters "want independent, nonpartisan judges who share their values, and ... I won’t be afraid to stand up to Donald Trump and Scott Walker, or whomever is in power, when I’m on the Supreme Court bench." Our rating Screnock says Burns and Dallet "have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench." Burns has been explicit on both counts. Dallet hasn’t criticized laws signed by Walker or campaigned to implement certain policies, although she has identified certain issues that are important to her. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Michael Screnock	None	None	None	2018-02-14T06:00:00	2018-01-29	['None']
pomt-10847	"Joe Biden is the only candidate with a plan to get us out of Iraq and keep us out."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/09/joe-biden/first-with-details-but-its-not-the-only-plan/	A recent TV ad states that Joe Biden is the only candidate with a plan to "get us out of Iraq and keep us out." This isn't true: Most of the Democratic candidates have put forward plans for an Iraq withdrawal. But those other plans have been sketchy and short on details, while Biden's plan was an early and significant proposal that went beyond the military and addressed the future of Iraq. Still, his sweeping claim to be "the only" candidate with an Iraq plan goes too far, so we give Biden a half-true. Biden, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, developed his Iraq plan with Leslie Gelb, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations. The plan includes five points: * Separate Iraq into three autonomous provices -- Shiite, Sunni and Kurd -- with a central government in charge of border defense and distributing oil revenues. * Guarantee the Sunnis a proportionate share of oil revenues, even though their land is oil-poor, as an incentive. * Increase reconstruction aid paid for by the Arab states. Tie it to jobs creation and protection of minority rights. * Initiate a diplomatic effort with Iraq's neighbors and create a mechanism for enforcing regional agreements. * Withdraw the bulk of U.S. troops by summer of 2008, leaving about 20,000 to fight terrorists and secure borders. But if Biden was first with a thoroughly outlined plan for Iraq, he is not alone. Barack Obama, for instance, released on Sept. 12, 2007, a plan that rivals Biden's for specifics. Obama's plan does not call for decentralization, but it has in common some of Biden's other points: increased diplomacy to involve neighboring states; more aid for Iraq from other countries; and increasing accountability for regional agreements. Obama's plan also calls for a new constitutional convention in Iraq led by the United Nations, and it outlines specific proposals for Iraq's humanitarian crisis, particularly for Iraqis within their own country and in other countries. Other Democratic candidates' plans focus on troop withdrawal. Their plans also mention political reconciliation, but so far give few details on how it should unfold.

pomt-01364	In 1968 "the average corporate CEO made 20 times the average worker’s pay. Today that multiple is about 350."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/oct/19/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-ceos-make-350-times-more-workers/	Former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, who’s mulling a presidential run, says there’s a lack of "economic fairness" for working families in the United States. During a recent address to the National Press Club in Washington, Webb lamented that compensation to top corporate executives has been soaring while workers’ pay has remained flat. "When I graduated from the Naval Academy (in 1968), the average corporate CEO made 20 times the average worker’s pay. Today that multiple is about 350," said Webb, a Democrat. Let’s see whether Webb’s figures on the growth in pay disparity are correct. 1968 pay Amy Hogan, Webb’s daughter and occasional spokesperson, sent us an email providing with some sourcing for her father’s claim. But it didn’t explain how Webb came up with the CEO-to-worker pay ratio for 1968. Our search failed to turn up data for 1968, but we found a couple sources that listed ratios from around that year. In 1965, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, the average CEO made about 20 times a typical worker’s pay. Average earnings for a CEO were $126,000, while workers made $5,947. Adjusted to today’s dollars, the executive made $819,000 and the worker made $39,500. In 1970 the ratio was 30-to-1, according to research by Kevin Murphy, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California. The top executives averaged $196,310 in earnings, while workers made $6,540. Adjusted to today, the CEO made about $1.2 million and the worker was paid $40,100. Current pay Hogan told us Webb’s 350-to-one claim was based on an article in The Wall Street Journal last year that cited statistics on executive pay compiled by the AFL-CIO. The labor union found that in 2012, the average CEO made 354 times more than the average worker. The AFL-CIO has updated statistics for 2013. Based on data from 350 corporations listed in Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the union said CEOs received total annual compensation averaging $11.7 million. Average pay for production and nonsupervisory workers was $35,239. By this measure, CEOs made 331 times more than the average worker. The AFL-CIO does not have the final word on this subject, however. Its finding is on the high side of a number of estimates published by different organizations on CEO-to-worker pay ratios. There’s no standard formula for computing the figure and the results vary based on which corporations -- and how many of them -- are used in a study. The definitions of CEO compensation differ. For example, some researchers count the value of all stock options made available to a CEO during a year, while others only count the value of options the executive cashed. Similarly, researchers use different definitions to define workers and compute their compensation. In general, workers are considered to be non-supervisory personnel. Because corporations aren’t required to reveal compensation figures for their entire staff, researchers cull figures for worker pay from broad, national data. The Economic Policy Institute concluded the pay ratio for last year was 296-to-1. It said average CEO compensation at 350 large corporations was $15.2 million and pegged workers’ average pay at $55,800. Here are two other CEO-to-worker pay ratios we came across: Bloomberg: 204-to-1 in 2011 and 2012 University of Southern California: 307-to-1 or 420-to-1, depending on how stock options are counted. While the studies produce different numbers, they all point to eye-popping differences in earnings between CEOs and workers. Researchers say CEO compensation has soared in recent decades largely because generous stock options have been weaved into their pay packages. Webb says income disparity should be eased by overhauling the tax code. He favors eliminating income tax breaks that favor the wealthy and raising levies on capital gains and dividends. Several executive pay experts told us Webb’s figures were credible based on research they had seen. But they cautioned against reading too much into CEO-to-worker ratios saying they don’t really shed much light on what type of compensation CEOs should ultimately receive. "I think it’s dangerous to kind of collapse the whole debate into that ratio," said David Larcker, a professor of accounting and corporate governance at Stanford University. "You want to focus on things like how much value are people (CEOs) creating and what share of that value should they get and what would be equitable across society, and those are very, very hard questions to answer." We should finally note that better data on CEO-to-worker pay ratios may soon be available. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill requires publicly traded companies to disclose their ratios quarterly. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is developing guidelines on how the figures should be computed. Our ruling Webb said that in 1968 the average CEO earned 20 times more than a typical worker, and today, the ratio is about 350 to 1. His numbers describing today’s ratio, while credible, are on the high side of research. Webb relies on a study by the AFL-CIO. EPI puts the figure at 300-to-1. Last year, Bloomberg pegged the ratio at 204-to-1. The University of Southern California put the ratio at 307-to-1 or 420-to-1, depending on how stock options are defined. There’s no doubt about Webb’s main point: the gap between CEOs and workers has seismically expanded over the last half century. But there’s room to quibble over the numbers he uses. So we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Jim Webb	None	None	None	2014-10-19T14:58:49	2014-09-23	['None']

pomt-03549	"We have one charter school that for seven years has been rated unacceptable."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/may/24/bill-ratliff/bill-ratliff-says-texas-has-one-charter-school-rat/	In an interview with Texas Monthly magazine, Bill Ratliff aired support for whittling state-mandated tests faced by students, while also saying it makes sense for lawmakers to bear down on charter schools that have failed to fulfill academic expectations. The lobbyist, a former Republican state senator who was elected by colleagues to be the state’s lieutenant governor from 2001 to 2003, noted that legislation then awaiting final action would permit additional charter schools and "crack down on bad charter schools. We have one charter school that for seven years has been rated unacceptable. Well, why do we allow that to continue?" We wondered if that seven-year statement holds up, ultimately finding that the troubled school was years out of business when Ratliff spoke. Charter schools background At the least, Ratliff's statement seemed against the grain of our January 2013 finding that the state can shut down a regular poor-performing school in as little as three years. The story quoted a Texas Education Agency spokeswoman as saying the state can shut down charter schools even more quickly. In multiple ways, though, charter schools--which receive public dollars but are run by private nonprofit entities--have enjoyed greater leeway under state law than traditional public schools, as noted in an April 11, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. "Intended to be laboratories of innovation, they are freed from many state education laws, such as teacher contract rules," the story said. "They now serve about 3 percent of Texas public school students on about 500 campuses." That story quoted state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, as estimating that about 10 percent of charter campuses had failed to meet expectations, and also saying the state had struggled to revoke their licenses. "While there are some top-rate charter schools in the state, others are disproportionately among the lowest performing," the story said. In 2011, the story said, nearly 18 percent of "charter schools were deemed ‘unacceptable’ while only 4.9 percent of traditional public schools were hit with that lowest rating." A state report By telephone, Ratliff told us he believes he spotted the seven-year example in information noted by his client, Raise Your Hand Texas, which describes itself as advocating greater investment in the schools. Shannon Ratliff, the elder Ratliff’s nephew and a spokesman for the group, pointed us to a report highlighting poor-performing charter school campuses as the likely basis for the other Ratliff’s claim. The state’s Sunset Advisory Commission concluded in a January 2013 report listing legislative recommendations related to the education agency that charter schools account for 17 percent of school districts and schools, but 71 percent of the state's schools facing sanctions for failing to meet academic or financial standards. And the report’s Appendix D notes that from as early as 1998 through 2011, the state had rated four charter campuses as academically unacceptable for six nonconsecutive years or more, including a campus that had drawn the rating in seven years. Schools draw the ratings based on an array of indicators led by whether student performance improves from the year before on the state’s mandated tests--and those results are further broken out by the ethnicity of students and the share of students who come from economically disadvantaged households. Identifying the school The published chart does not identify campuses by name. But education agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson emailed us a spreadsheet, drawing on agency records, indicating the Gabriel Tafolla Charter School in Uvalde was rated "academically unacceptable" or the equivalent in 2000 through 2002 and 2005 through 2008, a total of seven years. The school was rated "academically acceptable" in 2004, 2009 and 2010, according to the spreadsheet. Culbertson said the school, launched in 1998, at one point had permission to enroll students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. To get a sense of why the school drew its low ratings, we peeked at campus rating reports for 2005 through 2009 and 2010, starting from an education agency web page. The reports indicated that the number of students taking state-mandated tests fluctuated from about 40 to a little more than 60. Basically, too, according to the summaries, the school’s "academically unacceptable" ratings arose from students not showing state-required improvements on the tests, though each report also had bright spots. In 2007, for instance, students generally showed sufficient improvement in social studies and math, the summary says, and students living in economically disadvantaged circumstances made required improvements in reading. But students fell short of required improvements on state writing and science tests and among subgroups, economically disadvantaged students fell short in math, according to the summary. Culbertson told us the school drew its "academically acceptable" rating in 2009, despite showing a failure to meet required improvement across five subcategories, because the state that year judged schools based on projected improvement. Surrendered charter We identified one other significant twist. The Uvalde school closed in August 2010, Culbertson said by telephone, citing low enrollment. A separate Gabriel Tafolla Academy had opened in August 2009, she said, and it lasted through 2011-12 before the entire charter school district folded and returned its charter to the state. That shutdown happened for financial reasons, according to a June 2012 letter sent to the state by the academy’s chief officer, Deanna Kilpatrick. A closure resolution was approved June 7, 2012, by the Community Council of Southwest Texas, which held the charter. By phone, Sunset staff aide Sarah Kirkle told us two of three charter schools shown on the chart as having been rated "academically unacceptable" for six non-consecutive years similarly were no longer operating by early 2012, while the third school appeared to have improved performance and remains in business. Ratliff, apprised of what we learned, said that when he made his statement, he thought the charter school had been rated unacceptable for seven straight years and remained in business. On both fronts, he said, "I am probably in error," though he said it’s still troubling that a school could have multiple years of unacceptable ratings and not be shuttered by the state. Our ruling Ratliff said: "We have one charter school that for seven years has been rated unacceptable." His present-tense statement struck us as suggesting a school had been rated unacceptable seven straight years and was somehow still chugging. Both conclusions are incorrect, though the statement has an element of truth. The state rated a Uvalde school "academically unacceptable" for three straight years, 2000 through 2002, and four straight years, 2005 through 2008.

pomt-02772	"(U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston) voted to fund (Obamacare)."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/10/paul-broun/broun-video-doesnt-tell-whole-story/	U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah, was recently on the Fox News Channel to talk about his approach to make "Obamacare" work better for Americans. Fellow Georgia congressman Paul Broun, apparently, wasn’t impressed. "Jack Kingston wants to keep Obamacare," Broun said in a YouTube video. "He voted to fund it and now he wants to fix it." Broun, an Athens Republican, ended the two-minute video by explaining his approach to improving health care -- and it starts with repealing the controversial health care law. The two Republicans are in a crowded field of candidates vying to win the GOP’s U.S. Senate nomination in 2014 for the Georgia seat being left open by Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ retirement. Kingston disputed Broun’s claim, which prompted Broun’s campaign to dispatch a press release titled: "Broun to Kingston: How Is This a Lie?" PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d get in the middle of this dispute. Broun spokeswoman Christine Hardman offered two examples of what he said were Kingston’s votes for the law. The first was Kingston’s vote in September 2012 for an appropriations bill. The second was Kingston’s support for a budget written earlier this year by former GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, a House member from Wisconsin. The 2012 legislation, House Joint Resolution 117, was a bill that helped fund the federal government for six months, through March 2013. The legislation provided $1 trillion for federal agencies, services and disaster recovery. The federal agencies include the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the health care law. "The bill makes minimal changes to fiscal year 2012 spending levels, except in cases that would cause catastrophic, irreversible, or detrimental changes to government programs, and to ensure good government and program oversight," the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee said in a statement at the time. The resolution passed by a 329-91 margin, with nine House members who didn’t vote. Broun was one of the 91 no votes, along with Rep. Phil Gingrey, a House Republican who is also running for the U.S. Senate. Kingston voted in favor of the bill, as did all 10 of his remaining colleagues from Georgia. Now, to the other half of Broun’s case against Kingston. On March 12, Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, presented his latest plan to balance the federal budget in 10 years. Much of it calls for spending cuts and projected revenue increases through tax cuts to businesses that Ryan believes will help the economy grow. Six days later, Broun wrote an op-ed that appeared in The New York Times decrying Ryan’s plan, saying the cuts don’t go far enough. "We must repeal Obamacare — including the associated taxes, which the Ryan budget leaves intact by assuming the enactment of tax reform later on. We’ll replace it with a market-based health care system devoid of government involvement and managed by patients and their doctors, a plan I have described in my Patient Option Act," Broun, who practiced general medicine, wrote. Congress, as you know, has not been able to agree on a long-term budget plan. A resolution sponsored by Ryan to fund the government on a short-term basis passed the House on March 21. Kingston voted in favor of the resolution, but Broun cast his vote against it. Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said the rationale behind Broun’s claim is illogical. "The whole premise that Mr. Kingston supports Obamacare or has wavered in his dedication to its repeal is absurd," Crawford told us via email. "He has voted more than 40 times to repeal and replace. That effort has seen seven parts of the law dismantled or defunded." Kingston’s congressional website is full of news releases critical of the law or highlighting his votes against it. He voted against the bill when it passed the House by a slim majority in March 2010. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said Broun was "nibbling around the edges" with his claim because Kingston voted against the original legislation. She noted the September 2012 appropriations bill helped fund spending to operate the federal government, and it was not an entitlement bill. "That accusation doesn’t reflect anything close to someone supporting Obamacare," said MacGuineas. So where does this leave us? Again, Broun said Kingston has voted to fund the health care law. Kingston has voted for federal legislation to keep the government running. Broun is using that to base his argument since the legislation includes spending for the health care law. However, it was a piece of a much larger spending package that includes defense spending and disaster recovery. Using that logic, Kingston could argue that Broun voted against defense spending. Broun’s claim contains an element of accuracy, but it gives people a misleading perception of Kingston’s position on Obamacare. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04163	Says Texas economy is about 30 percent larger than Australia’s.	false	/texas/statements/2012/dec/20/larry-kilgore/larry-kilgore-says-texas-economy-about-30-percent-/	As tens of thousands of signatures piled up on a petition for Texas to withdraw from the United States, Larry Kilgore of Arlington told The New York Times that the state could stand on its own. "Our economy is about 30 percent larger than that of Australia," Kilgore said in a Nov. 23, 2012, Times news story. We decided to check that claim and one from the petition itself, which said Texas "is the 15th largest economy in the world." That’s True. First, we set aside pretty much all considerations of practicality, because secession would upend a number of factors affecting the Texas economy. Besides, as Austin American-Statesman humor writer John Kelso observed in a Dec. 8, 2012, column, nearly 25 million Texans hadn’t signed it. Kilgore has run for numerous offices in Texas since 2004 as a pro-secession candidate. His basis for this statement, he told us by phone, was a comparison of nations’ gross domestic product to that of Texas. GDP is the most-used measure of national economic output, defined as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country. Kilgore said he drew his numbers from NationMaster, a Sydney, Australia-based website that compares nations and U.S. states on matters from health and crime to economy, using data from many sources to generate lists and graphs. NationMaster’s Australia page gives the country’s GDP as $606 billion, citing "Economic Importance, 1998" as its source. The site’s Texas page gives the gross state product as $881 billion, citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics information from March 2006. So although the numbers are both presented as current data on the website, and they show Texas’ GDP to be 45 percent larger than Australia’s, they appear to represent the Texas economy in 2006 and the Australian economy in 1998. "Are you serious? My goodness," Kilgore said, when we asked if he’d known the site was using data that old. "I guess we need some more updated numbers." He had not looked at the sources, he said, and didn’t do further research. The Texas state comptroller’s office annually calculates where Texas would rank globally if it were a nation. Spokesman RJ DeSilva told us by email that the comptroller uses the GDP calculated for Texas by the federal Bureau of Economic Statistics and sent us the 2011 figure: $1.3 trillion. By phone, bureau spokesman Thomas Dail suggested we compare the Texas figure to national GDP calculated with current prices in U.S. dollars. That would be "conceptually consistent," he said. Dail guided us through the steps of generating the Texas statistics on his agency’s website. Separately, we found a fact sheet from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with the country's annual GDPs using current prices and U.S. dollars. GDP in $US billion 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Texas 1,147.404 1,209.267 1,129.537 1,222.904 1,308.132 Australia 944.8 1,033.5 976.0 1,242.1 1,487.4 Who’s bigger? Texas 21% bigger Texas 17% bigger Texas 16% bigger Australia 2% bigger Australia 12% bigger The bureau’s data and the Australian government’s numbers show that Texas’ GDP was larger than Australia’s in 2007 through 2009, but not in 2010 or 2011. For 2011, Australia’s GDP of $1.487 billion was 12 percent larger than Texas’ $1.308 billion GDP. Our ruling Kilgore said Texas’ economy is 30 percent larger than Australia’s, but that was based on mismatched, outdated figures. We rate his statement as False.

pomt-14299	"I have now put out all of my emails."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-i-have-now-put-out-all-my-emails/	Controversy over Hillary Clinton's practice of using a private email server while she was secretary of state is continuing to have repercussions in her presidential campaign. The latest is a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial criticizing the Democrat's rationale, saying that "the only believable reason for the private server in her basement was to keep her emails out of the public eye by willfully avoiding Freedom of Information laws." NBC's Chuck Todd asked her about the accusation that she's too secretive during a taped April 2 interview for Meet the Press. Clinton repeated her acknowledgment that her use of a private email server was a mistake, along with her assertion that all of her work-related correspondence was sent using government-operated email servers, which would mean that all of those emails should be sitting in government files somewhere. In any event, she said, all of her emails have been released. "I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails," she said. "Go and ask others for their emails. Ask everybody else who's in public office. I'm the one who's done it, and I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do." So are all the emails out? Literally, no. Clinton says she had about 60,000 emails on her private server during the four years she was secretary of state. She and her staff deleted more than 31,000 without any government review in December 2014 on the basis that they were personal correspondence and had nothing to do with her government job. The remaining 30,940 were turned over to the State Department, in paper form, for review and archiving. In March 2015, a House committee demanded that Clinton hand over her server to see if sensitive material had been deleted. In August, Clinton authorized the transfer. She then asked the State Department to publicly release the work-related correspondence, which it began to do in May 2015. The last batch, consisting of about 3,800 pages, was released Feb. 29. Clinton has consistently insisted that the emails did not include any information that was classified at the time she sent or received the correspondence. She turned out to be correct. (Editor's note, July 11, 2016: Based on the information publicly available at the time, she appeared to be correct. The FBI's report from July 2016 subsequently revealed she was not correct. Although that does not affect our ruling on this statement, we have downgraded another statement that she never sent or received classified material and rated that False.) But ultimately, 2,093 emails were given some form of classification, including 22 now marked "top secret," which have been fully withheld from the public. The rest have been redacted. The 22 "top secret" emails were part of seven email chains covering 37 pages. They were not classified at the time they were sent. But a few additional emails have also not been released, even though they were not considered classified. Nineteen were exchanges between Clinton and President Barack Obama that covered eight different chains. They were withheld under the law governing the release of presidential documents, designed to encourage candid exchanges of opinion between the president and his staff. There was also one email withheld at the request of an unspecified law enforcement agency. As for the correspondence that Clinton considered to be personal and private, it’s unclear if any of those emails have been recovered. Bloomberg reported in September that the FBI had obtained the server from a company called Platte River Networks in Colorado and had recovered those deleted emails. McClatchy reported in October that some emails were synched with a cloud storage system run by Datto Inc. of Connecticut and Clinton agreed to have that data released to the FBI. However, McClatchy reported "conflicting accounts as to whether the developments could lead to retrieval of any of Clinton’s more than 31,000 personal emails, which she said she deleted from her private server upon turning over her work-related emails to the State Department, at its request, in December 2014." That’s a fairly critical point, as congressional Republicans have questioned whether any of those "personal" emails contained government business. State Department spokeswoman Lauren Hickey said the released documents only included the work-related emails that Clinton turned over. Any additional material that might have been recovered by the FBI have not been released. Our ruling Clinton said, "I have now put out all of my emails." In reality, only about half of the emails sent or received by Clinton on her private email server have been released. Clinton’s comments focus on emails that she and her staff deemed work-related. Clinton says the half that aren’t available are personal and private. The problem is, it was Clinton and her staff who made that determination. Those emails -- more than 30,000 -- haven’t been available for public review, and it’s not entirely clear they can be retrieved. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

pomt-03815	"The hole in the earth that’s going to be dug (for the proposed Gogebic mine) is bigger than my entire district."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/22/evan-goyke/wisconsin-rep-evan-goyke-says-proposed-gogebic-min/	The size of the proposed Gogebic iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin dominated debate as a bill to relax state mining laws made it through the Legislature and to Gov. Scott Walker’s desk. Supporters said the new law would maintain the state’s environmental standards while making it easier for the company to open a mine and create thousands of jobs. Opponents argued lawmakers were moving too quickly for a project of its size. During the March 7, 2013 Assembly debate, state Rep. Evan Goyke (D-Milwaukee) noted the vastness of the proposed mine and tried to put it into context. "The hole in the earth that’s going to be dug is bigger than my entire district," Goyke declared. That raised some eyebrows in Madison … and sent us to the plat books and the calculator. How big is this proposed mine? And how big is Goyke’s district? The project is proposed by Gogebic Taconite, a division of Florida-based Cline Resource and Development. The company first proposed the iron ore mine in Ashland and Iron counties in 2011. A bill sought by the company to modify state laws to make mine development easier died in 2012. A similar measure was approved in 2013 and signed by Gov. Scott Walker on March 11, 2013. The new law "relaxes environmental protections for iron mining -- but not other forms of mining -- and provides more clarity to the state process of reviewing an iron ore mine application," according to the Journal Sentinel’s report on the bill signing. We dug into a similar claim once before. In January 2012, we rated Mostly Falsea claim by state Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber (D-Appleton), who said "the central size" of the mine "could be about two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago." Size of the mine When it comes to the size, Gogebic and the state Department of Natural Resources officials have offered slightly different sizes. Gogebic president Bill Williams was quoted byPolitiFact Wisconsinin 2012 as saying that the mine would be about four miles long and a half mile wide. Williams gave a rough estimate and said the mine would need up to 5,000 acres.Williams didn’t respond to a request for a more precise estimate. A state DNR mine expert, Ann Coakley, said the mine might be 1.5 miles wide. At 4 miles long and at that width, the mine would be 6 square miles or 3,840 acres, according to a conversion calculator. And that’s before you add in access roads, rail lines, processing facilities and other facilities. Size of the district So what about the 18th Assembly District, which Goyke represents? The district lies within the city of Milwaukee, and it contains roughly the same number of people as any other Assembly district -- 57,480. But it’s far smaller, geographically, than most because it’s an urban district. The 18th stretches from Capitol Drive to the north and roughly Interstate 94 to the south. The northern part is 14 blocks wide, between N. 49th and N. 35th streets, and it lies between 60th and 15th streets at the southern base. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Technology Services Bureau, the 18th District is 3,609 acres. Another way of visualizing the mine: It’s about 4.5 miles from Miller Park to the Milwaukee Art Museum. And the Menomonee Valley corridor is roughly a mile to 1.5 miles wide. The mine wouldn’t be a rectangular swath -- plans call for it to wrap down and around a ridge in an area known as the Penokee Range, but you get the idea. Let’s put the mine into the context of the North Woods. The vast 74th Assembly District that includes the mine site is 3.3 million acres. So, the mine represents about a tenth of 1 percent of it. Another yardstick: Iron County alone is 802 square miles, or 513,280 acres. Let’s power down our calculators. Goyke says the proposed Gogebic mine would be larger than his district. Using the smallest size estimates, the mine would cover 3,840 acres, or 231 acres more than the 18th Assembly district. Goyke got his numbers right. But he’s also got an advantage -- geographically, his densely populated district is the second smallest in the state, trailing only the 8th on Milwaukee’s south side. We rate Goyke’s statement True.

pomt-06510	"Our government right now. . . (is) spending 40 percent more than what we take in."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/11/michele-bachmann/bachmann-right-spending/	Editor’s note: We originally published this item on Oct. 11, 2011, the night of a Republican presidential primary debate in New Hampshire. We thought Bachmann’s remark during the debate had the same ring as others we’ve checked, including one by Florida Senator Marco Rubio that "40 cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed," as well as a similar statement by North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad and another by Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell. We rated each of those True, as well as Bachmann’s statement. However, an alert reader noticed that Bachmann’s statement didn’t match the others and told us we should have done our math differently. We looked again and found the reader is correct. We rated Bachmann’s claim based on government spending when we should have based it on revenues. So we have fact-checked her statement again, published this new analysis, and kept the rating True. The U.S. government is living on credit, spending more than it receives and borrowing to keep up. So Rep. Michele Bachmann says we need to tighten our belts. "Our government right now -- this is significant -- we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in," Bachmann said during a Republican presidential debate on Oct. 11, 2011, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. The Congressional Budget Office has released preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2011, which ended Sept. 30. According to the CBO’s chart, the federal government had revenues of $2.3 trillion and expenditures of $3.6 trillion, leaving a deficit of $1.3 trillion. To calculate Bachmann’s figure of "spending X percent more than what we take in" -- the percent by which expenditures exceed revenues -- divide $3.6 trillion by $2.3 trillion. The answer: about 56 percent. Two experts, one from the conservative Heritage Foundation and one from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, verified our math. "If you say that spending is xx percent more than revenues, then the ratio is spending over revenues. So if you take in $2 and you spend $3, then you're spending 150 percent of revenues or you’re spending 50 percent more than you take in. That aligns with Bachman's language pretty closely," said JD Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Bachmann’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiry, but we suspect she was slightly off because she misstated a figure that has been cited by others in recent months. "We're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend," Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said in January 2011 on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. And Scott Rigell, a Republican who represents Virginia’s Second District, said in a February 2011 press release, "We are a nation $14 trillion in debt and are borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend." Those cases refer to the proportions of spending funded by taxes versus borrowing, said Richard Kogan of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Using the CBO’s new numbers, the proportion is 36 percent -- pretty close to 40 cents on the dollar. But Bachmann's claim referred to revenues ("what we take in"), so 56 percent is the right number. Our ruling Bachmann said, "Our government right now -- this is significant -- we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in." It turns out, she was actually lowballing the number. The correct percentage by which federal spending exceeded revenues in 2011 was 56 percent, not 40, but Bachmann’s broader point is correct. We rate her statement True.

pomt-07160	The Obama administration has cut taxes on small businesses 17 times.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/dnc-chair-wasserman-schultz-says-obama-has-signed-/	In a face-off between the heads of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee on NBC's Meet the Press on June 11, 2011, the discussion turned to what the government should be doing to accelerate job creation. "I think we need to cut taxes on small businesses," said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. "Well, that's good," retorted DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., "because we've done that, 17 times." Looking out for small businesses is a mainstay of political rhetoric these days. "The small business community is sort of a favored group on which to shower tax breaks," said Joseph Rosenberg, research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. But have there been 17 tax cuts for small businesses by the Obama administration? Asked for backup, the DNC press office pointed us to a Feb. 25, 2011, posting on the official White House blog titled "Seventeen Small Business Tax Cuts and Counting." The post enumerates 17 small business tax cuts and credits created or extended through legislation signed by President Barack Obama. Eight of them were included in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (aka the economic stimulus), the Affordable Care Act (aka the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (aka the Hire Act). Among the cuts: the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees, and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months. Another eight came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by President Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000. Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012. Here's the full list: From the Recovery Act, HIRE Acts, and Affordable Care Act: 1. A new small business health care tax credit 2. A new tax credit for hiring unemployed workers 3. Bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment 4. 75 percent exclusion of small business capital gains 5. Expansion of limits on small business expensing 6. Five-year carryback of net operating losses 7. Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses from 10 to 7 years to allow small business greater flexibility in their investments 8. Temporary small business estimated tax payment relief to allow small businesses to keep needed cash on hand From the Small Business Jobs Act: 9. Zero capital gains taxes on key investments in small businesses 10. Raising the small business expensing to $500,000 11. An extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation 12. A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed 13. Tax relief and simplification for cell phone deductions 14. An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs’ start-up expenses 15. A five-year carryback of general business credits 16. Limitations on penalties for errors in tax reporting that disproportionately affect small business And from the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act: 17. 100 percent expensing Tax experts at conservative think tanks like Heritage and Americans for Tax Reform don't quibble much with the list, but they do with the context. "I can't argue with any of these, but it ignores all the proposed and enacted tax hikes on small business," said Ryan Ellis, director of tax policy at Americans For Tax Reform. For example, he said, it ignores President Obama's proposal to allow Bush-era individual income tax cuts to expire for those making more than $250,000. "A clear majority of small business profits are earned in households making at least $250,000 per year." Ellis said. "...That's a tax hike on the small business sector." There are also a number of tax increases included in the health care law, Ellis said, some of which apply directly to small businesses. For one, he said, businesses with more than 50 employees could face a tax penalty if they don't provide enough health insurance to their employees. Another example, the 10 percent tanning tax, which he said is "nearly exclusively applied to small businesses." "So the overall story is much more of a problem for small firms than the Obama administration would suggest," Ellis said. Curtis Dubay, senior tax policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, allowed that "there have been targeted tax cuts for small businesses." But, he said, "it's an error to just point to the number of tax cuts. You have to look at the overall impact and that certainly has been steep tax hikes." Dubay also noted that six of the 17 cuts were not just for small businesses but were made widely available to all businesses. Richard Morrison at the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group, said that "nothing on (the White House list) stands out as egregiously unjustified from a fact-checking perspective. Some of them are temporary, and some aren’t targeted exclusively at small businesses, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they shouldn’t 'count' as far as Rep. Wasserman Schultz’s claim is concerned." We think there's room for critics to note that in addition to the 17 tax cuts enumerated by the White House, there are there are also some tax increases in the health care law that will fall on some of the same small business owners that got tax cuts. Some health care law tax increases won't go into effect for a couple years. And with some, like the excise taxes on tanning beds, one could argue it is a tax on the customer, not the small business. As for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire, that might certainly affect a number of small business owners. But that's still just an Obama proposal. It hasn't happened. The only policy actually signed by the president so far was a compromise agreement that extended the tax cuts through 2012. So we rate Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True.

pomt-05006	Says "the money is in the budget" to give a tax break to "everyone," including people making more than $1 million.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/18/lou-greenwald/assembly-majority-leader-lou-greenwald-claims-mone/	Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald has been a longtime critic of Gov. Chris Christie for providing tax breaks to millionaires, but apparently he and other Democratic legislators approved a new state budget with funding to do just that. Those dollars would provide a tax break for "everyone," including people earning more than $1 million, the Camden County Democrat said during a July 15 interview on "Inside Story" on Philadelphia-based 6abc. But PolitiFact New Jersey found Greenwald is wrong to suggest that funding would support an across-the-board tax cut. Christie originally called for an across-the-board reduction in the state income tax, but the Republican governor and the Democrat-led Legislature have since indicated that any tax cut would likely be limited to individuals below a certain income level and not apply to millionaires. Also, Greenwald and other Assembly Democrats have advocated for a plan that includes raising taxes on millionaires, not lowering them. First, here’s the exchange between Greenwald and "Inside Story" host Matt O’Donnell. O’Donnell: "Do New Jerseyans deserve a tax break right now? Do all of them deserve a tax break right now, not next year?" Greenwald: "The answer to that question is yes, and the money is in the budget to give them a tax break this year." O’Donnell: "Everyone?" Greenwald: "Everyone." O’Donnell: "Including people who make more than a million dollars?" Greenwald: "Oh, absolutely." Now, here’s the history behind the tax cut debate raging in Trenton. Christie kicked off the discussion with his State of the State address in January, when he called for an across-the board 10 percent cut in the state income tax. That proposal equaled a tax cut for all New Jerseyans. But Christie and the Democrats have indicated that such an across-the-board cut is now off the table. In early March, Democrats in the State Senate and the State Assembly each laid out their own tax cut proposals, which only would benefit households earning up to $250,000 per year by providing an income tax credit based on their property taxes. The key difference between the two proposals was that the Assembly Democrats called for increasing taxes on taxable income exceeding $1 million. The Legislature last month approved legislation sponsored by Greenwald to authorize that tax hike. At that point, the tax increase was no longer tied to an income tax credit, but instead to boosting property tax relief payments for residents earning up to $250,000. But Christie conditionally vetoed that bill and recommended amending it to implement an income tax credit for homeowners with $400,000 or less in taxable income. The governor’s latest proposal is based on the Senate Democrats’ plan. Democrats, who set aside $183 million in the fiscal year 2013 budget for a tax cut, have said a reduction only would occur if Christie meets his revenue projections in the coming months. While it remains unclear whether any tax cut will be approved, Christie and the Legislature have indicated that a reduction would not be an across-the-board cut, but limited to residents below a certain income level and not apply to millionaires. In response to our findings, Brian McGinnis, communications director for Greenwald, told us the assemblyman’s point was that reducing the property tax burden for the middle class would ultimately benefit all New Jerseyans, including millionaires. "The Majority Leader has frequently talked about the hidden tax on all New Jerseyans being the hit a family’s property values take because property taxes are so high," McGinnis said in an e-mail. "In providing significant property tax relief to 95% of New Jersey families, our plan would have addressed this problem — helping to stabilize property values and benefiting people throughout the state, including millionaires. "Furthermore, as the Majority Leader said in the interview, lower property taxes for the middle-class makes our state a more attractive place to live, meaning millionaires (whom the Governor calls job creators) can attract more talented employees." Our ruling In a TV interview, Greenwald said "the money is in the budget" to give a tax break to "everyone," including people making more than $1 million. But Christie and Democratic legislators have indicated that any tax cut would likely be limited to New Jerseyans below a certain income level and not apply to millionaires. In fact, Greenwald has been a leading advocate of doing just the opposite: raising taxes on millionaires. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14942	"The top 1 percent pay 45 percent of all taxes in the country."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/oct/26/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-top-1-percent-pay-nearly-half-all-ta/	A high school student at a New Hampshire town hall quizzed Jeb Bush on how he will close tax loopholes for the rich. Bush said that although tax brackets are progressive -- meaning the more you earn, the more you pay -- they end up being regressive because rich people invest in the stock market and then have less taxable income. "On taxes, we do have a progressive tax rate when you consider that the top 1 percent pay 45 percent of all taxes in the country," Bush said during the Oct. 14 town hall in Concord. "That is a fairly disproportionate amount." Bush then summarized his tax proposal, which includes a tax break for the rich as well as the middle class and cuts the corporate tax rate. Also under Bush’s plan, a family of four that earns $40,000 or less would pay no federal income taxes. We wanted to look at Bush’s comment about how much the wealthy pays in taxes. Does the top 1 percent pay nearly half the taxes in the country? Income taxes vs. all federal taxes We found that the accuracy of Bush’s comment depends on what type of federal taxes we consider. (Our analysis won’t cover state and local taxes, which vary across the country.) The Tax Policy Center, home to widely quoted nonpartisan experts on taxes, calculated in June that the top 1 percent will have 16.5 percent of total income in 2015 and pay 43.6 percent of federal income taxes. So Bush would have been very close to correct if he had specified income taxes, but instead he said "all taxes." If we consider all federal taxes, the proportion paid by the top 1 percent is less than what was cited by Bush: 27.9 percent. That calculation by the Tax Policy Center includes a slew of federal taxes that includes income, payroll, corporate, estate and excise taxes. "It’s the difference between all taxes and federal income taxes," said Mike Tanner, a tax expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. "He didn’t say federal income tax, but if he is talking about federal income tax he is right." It’s important to note that while both calculations show an overall progressive federal tax system -- meaning the more you earn, the more you pay -- certain types of taxes are regressive, including payroll and excise taxes. The top 1 percent pay just 5.5 percent of payroll taxes even though they earn about 16.5 percent of total income. In contrast, the middle quintile has 13.8 percent of total income but pay 15.8 percent of payroll taxes. We found another calculation that shows slightly lower numbers than the Tax Policy Center for how much the wealthy pay in taxes. The Congressional Budget Office found that for 2011, the top 1 percent received 14.6 percent of before-tax income and paid 24 percent of all federal taxes and 35.4 percent of all individual income taxes. (The November 2014 report is the office’s most recent one, but it looks at numbers that are a few years older than the Tax Policy Center report.) We sent a spokesman for Bush’s campaign a summary of our findings. Matt Gorman said that Bush was responding to questions about the progressivity about federal income tax brackets. The student did talk about "tax brackets" and closing "tax holes for rich people," but he didn’t directly ask a question about "federal income tax rates." (Here is PolitiFact’s transcript of their exchange.) Our ruling Bush said, "the top 1 percent pay 45 percent of all taxes in the country." Bush was answering a question about taxable income, the progressivity of our tax system and closing loopholes for the rich. So part of the question he faced related to income taxes. And part of his answer related to income taxes, because he talked about his own plan for income tax cuts. But Bush could have been more specific in his reply. The 45 percent number applies to federal income taxes, not all taxes. Bush spoke generically about "all taxes," so if we look at all federal taxes, the share for the top 1 percent was 27.9 percent. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-10-26T15:27:47	2015-10-14	['None']
pomt-13377	"Republican Mark Kirk is outsourcing his campaign to a Super PAC funded almost exclusively by a bunch of hedge fund billionaires. ... I don’t have a Super PAC."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2016/sep/28/tammy-duckworth/duckworth-uses-super-pac-claim-against-kirk/	In campaign fundraising email after campaign fundraising email, Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Tammy Duckworth notes that, unlike her opponent Republican Mark Kirk, she isn’t benefitting from a Super PAC and needs donations from average Illinoisans. Duckworth repeatedly references hedge-fund-billionaire Super PACs supporting Kirk, says she doesn’t have any such help and is counting on "your support." In an August 31 email, she says, "But while our campaign has always been about supporters like you, Republican Mark Kirk is outsourcing his campaign to a Super PAC funded almost exclusively by a bunch of hedge fund billionaires. ... I don’t have a Super PAC. I’m counting on your support to continue traveling the state and spreading the word about how I hope to serve working families in the U.S. Senate." Another fundraising email from Sept. 19 says, "We have a real shot here in Illinois at flipping this Republican seat blue, but we’re up against a flood of super PAC spending that could derail our campaign." The matchup between incumbent Kirk and Duckworth is on the national radar of both political parties and numerous outside groups as it’s considered one of a handful of races key to determining whether Republicans keep majority control of the Senate. Because of that, it could be expected the candidates, party committees and Super PACs would fundraise heavily. So we wondered whether Duckworth’s repeated claims were true. Super PAC influence Super PACs can raise unlimited funds, but they cannot coordinate with a candidate or give directly to a candidate or a candidate’s campaign. That type of outsourcing a campaign to another entity is illegal. Citizens, corporations and organizations face strict limits on how much they can give when they give directly to a candidate. We asked Duckworth’s campaign manager, Matt McGrath, what the campaign’s source was for the claim that Kirk is "outsourcing his campaign to a super Pac." McGrath noted news stories referencing Independent Voice for Illinois, a Super PAC, or independent expenditure committee, run by Kirk’s former chief of staff and former campaign manager, Eric Elk. McGrath said in an email, "We deduced it by looking at its leadership and public disclosures of its donors, and independent entities who know this stuff inside and out, like opensecrets.org, have confirmed it." Open Secrets, a nonpartisan project of the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks and tallies money in U.S. politics, does show the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC so far has raised nearly $1.3 million, spending $1.17 million against Duckworth and $117,000 in support of Kirk. Elk has confirmed his involvement in the Super PAC in both the Chicago Sun-Times and Springfield State Journal-Register. He previously described the PAC as supporting the election of people who support "common sense values" of Illinoisans. Further, the main contributors to the Independent Voice Super PAC are hedge-fund operators and employees as well as entrepreneurs. The Center for Responsive Politics recently took a deeper look at the Senate race in Illinois: "Outside spending in the 2016 face-off has, thus far, disproportionately benefited Kirk. More than $1.6 million has been spent to back the incumbent or oppose Duckworth, while comparable outlays to help Duckworth come to less than half that, $713,901 to date." "Chief among the active outside groups is Independent Voice for Illinois," the Center’s story continued, "which has spent a little less than $1.1 million to oppose Duckworth. The Super PAC has received $350,000 from employees of Citadel LLC, a hedge fund, and $250,000 from Elliott Management, a hedge fund management firm. Employees of both companies were also among Kirk’s top contributors in 2010. To date, no single-candidate Super PAC has chipped in for Duckworth." But the Duckworth campaign said Kirk had "outsourced his campaign." Kirk is benefiting from heavy spending by the Independent Voice super PAC, but federal data show the Kirk campaign has raised $11.3 million and spent $8.4 million for his re-election effort, while Duckworth has raised $10.1 million and spent nearly $5 million so far. That brings us to the third claim, that Duckworth does not have the support of a Super PAC. As the Center for Responsive Politics reported, no single-candidate Super PAC supports Duckworth, but, their story confirms, $713,901 has been spent by PACs and outside groups to support Duckworth. According to the Center, the Senate Majority Super PAC spent $384 against Kirk and in support of Duckworth and NextGen Climate Action Super PAC spent just under $1,000 against Kirk. Not all outside spending comes from Super PACs. Duckworth also has been the beneficiary of $623,379 in spending by a nonprofit called VoteVets.org. Super PACs have to disclose their donors, but nonprofit 501(c)(4) groups like VoteVets.org do not. (Graphic/data, courtesy of Center for Responsive Politics, www.opensecrets.org) Our ruling Duckworth said her opponent is outsourcing his campaign to a Super PAC funded almost exclusively by hedge-fund billionaires. Kirk is the beneficiary of a Super PAC that so far has spent exclusively on the Illinois U.S. Senate race, but it is not accurate to say he is "outsourcing" his campaign. In fact, by law, "outsourcing" a campaign to a Super PAC would be illegal. And while Duckworth does not have a so-called single-candidate Super PAC, she does benefit from some minimal Super PAC spending as well as some other outside spending by VoteVets.org and from state and national Democratic party organizations.

pomt-08595	Says Julie Parrish wants to add a sales tax to everything we need to buy including food, clothing, medicine and school supplies.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/oregon-democrats-claim-julie-parrish-wants-sales-t/	Oregon House Democrats are everywhere this campaign season with the claim that Republicans support a sales tax, even one as high as 30 percent. In that vein, Future PAC, the Democrats’ campaign committee, sent a mailer recently that accuses Julie Parrish, a Republican running in House District 37, of wanting to add a sales tax. The mailer says Parrish "has been very vocal about where she stands" and "Say NO to Julie Parrish and her sales tax." It also states, "Julie Parrish wants to add a sales tax to everything we need to buy including food, clothing, medicine and school supplies." Democrats say she posted a comment on OregonLive’s website in February that provides the basis for the claim. We took a look. In February, Parrish posted a commentary on OregonLive called "Not feeling rich." In it, she complains that increasingly taxes are being shouldered by businesses and people with higher incomes. She says her household income of nearly $250,000 isn’t "rich," when she has school loans to repay and three kids to put through college. The piece was popular, with a lot of back- and-forth commentary between Parrish and others. Will Rasmussen, the Democrat in the District 37, points to one of her posts, in which she writes the following at 5 p.m.: "Instead of being arbitrary, wouldn’t it make more sense to find ways in our state to: A. cut the budget, B. assess a sales tax, C. re-do the special interest (property tax) levies?" Then she writes, "Why should kids in the West Linn district be entitled to a better education than those in Southern Oregon?" But anyone who reads through the entirety of her comments can see that Parrish is talking about a sales tax as part of a broader tax restructure. At 10:51 a.m., earlier that same day, she says: "Taxing smokers (which I don't smoke) and expecting them to shoulder the healthcare in the state is unfair. Proposed taxes on drivers to fund other mass transit isn't right either. Taxation based on income is arbitrary. If you want to tax the wealthy, do it on spending -- a sales tax." And in response to this comment at 6:34 a.m., "Pssst, Julie . . . whisper this to yourself . . . sales tax . . . sales tax . . . sales tax . . ." she wrote at 10:18 p.m. "I will....as long as we ax all the other taxes and start from scratch! In our state, we'd pass a sales tax, and keep all the other ones too - just because ;-)" That sounds more cheeky than serious. The claim by Oregon House Democrats and candidate Will Rasmussen contains some element of truth -- Parrish would consider a sales tax -- but it ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression. She wouldn’t be the first candidate, Republican or Democrat, to complain about Oregon’s system of taxation. And if elected to the House, she certainly wouldn’t have the power to get a sales tax implemented. We rate this claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00519	"46 percent of women between the age of 16 to 24 despise sexual contact" in Japan.	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/23/aziz-ansari/startling-stat-checks-out-46-percent-young-women-j/	Aziz Ansari departs from the usual comedian slapstick in his first book, Modern Romance, teaming up with a sociologist and traveling overseas to examine the science of how people date in the Internet-at-your-fingertips age. The academic effort intrigued The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart during his June 16 interview with Ansari. Stewart asked his former Daily Show intern if he learned anything shocking during his time reporting for the book. Ansari zeroed in on how dating culture in Japan wasn’t what he expected. "Well, when we went to Japan, I definitely had this thought of like, ‘Oh, that’s, like, such a technologically advanced culture, they're probably like on the cutting edge of whatever online dating or apps. And then you get there and you realize, I read all these articles, there’s like a crisis there," he said. "And like there was some insane statistic, like, 46 percent of women between the age of 16 to 24 despise sexual contact. And 25 percent of the guys in that same age. "Despise. Despise. Like, that is like, an aggressive word." Ansari’s claim about nearly half of Japanese young women not being interested in sex also struck us as incredibly high, so we decided to check it out. What his book says In Modern Romance, Ansari spotlights international cultures in three cities that offer wildly different perspectives on dating: Paris, where relationships are more casual and similar to other European countries; Buenos Aires, which he describes as "romantically aggressive;" and Tokyo, where a lack of romance among young people amid falling marriage rates and birthrates has the government on edge. Japan is going through "a crisis of sorts," and leaders are trying to intervene by offering subsidies for parents with kids and throwing state-funded dating events. Ansari brings up the figure about young women not being into sex in his book with a host of other scary statistics, writing, "In 2013 a whopping 45 percent of women aged 16 to 24 ‘were not interested in or despised sexual contact,’ and more than a quarter of men felt the same way." Ansari’s coauthor, New York University sociology professor Eric Klinenberg, showed PunditFact by email that the statistic is also cited in 2013 stories about Japanese young people’s disinterest in sex in the Guardian and Slate. Just one problem for English speakers: The source for the statistic is a survey by the Japan Family Planning Association and written in Japanese. PunditFact doesn’t know Japanese, but Kumiko Endo, a Japanese-American academic, does. Endo helped Ansari and Klinenberg navigate the complex story of Japan’s changing relationship norms for Modern Romance. A 34-year-old single woman born and raised in Japan, she said it makes sense why she chose to focus on the identity of Japanese singles and their role in the economy at The New School for Social Research. What the Japanese research shows The Japanese Family Planning Association has conducted this survey every two years since 2002, sending it to 3,000 people between 16 and 49. About 1,300 people responded in 2012, Endo said. Both men and women were asked to rate how interested they are in having sex from Very Interested, Somewhat Interested, Not Very Interested, Not Interested at All, and I Feel an Aversion to It. The percentage of women who responded they were not interested in sex at all or felt an aversion to it was 60.3 percent for ages 16-19 and 31.6 percent for ages 20-24. Combine the age groups, and the average response was about 46 percent negative — the figure that drove attention-grabbing stories in Western media. The association released its newest survey for 2014 a few months ago. In that survey, 65.8 percent of women 16-19 were not interested in sex or felt an aversion to it, and 39.2 percent of women 20-24 felt the same way. This survey is the only one we could find that asks about specific views of sex. Endo mentioned another survey by the government, the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, that asked 4,276 women, of which about 3,400 were 18 to 34, if they had ever had any kind of sexual encounter. The percentage of women ages 18-19 who said they had never had sex was 68.1 percent; for women 20-24, it was 40.1 percent; for women 25-29, it was 29.3 percent; and for women 30-34, 23.8 percent. "So even at age 34, one out of four women are virgins in Japan," Endo said. "It’s definitely not a religion that’s pushing that number." (Japan is a secular society.) Endo mentioned a third survey by the NIPSSR that could corroborate the family planning association’s statistic. This one asks men and women if they have any relationships with the opposite sex — even platonic ones. Again, the results speak to a trend of disinterest. In 2010, 49.5 percent of unmarried single Japanese women between the ages of 18-34 said they have no relations with the opposite sex. For men, it was 61.4 percent on average. What changed There’s no simple explanation for what’s going on in Japan. It’s been years in the making, though the drastic change has occurred in a relatively small window of time. First of all, it’s important to understand some cultural differences. Endo says that where westerners might see sex as an act unto itself, in Japan "sex was never an isolated thing." In addition, the younger generation has never known anything but economic stagnation, which Endo notes could psychologically dampen interest in sex. And Japanese younger than 27 also are the first to come up in a very changed educational system, one that is no longer centered on competition. All of these things, she speculates, might create a "generational identity" that feels differently about sex than the older cohort. The funny thing is, among younger Japanese, it is only attitudes toward sex, not marriage, that have changed. In the corporate-centered society that catapulted Japan into a leading world economy after World War II, men would graduate from college with job offers from corporations that offered employment and benefits for life. They met their wives through family or work, and the women would then leave their jobs to take on the role of primary caregiver for children and the elderly. Family structure and the corporate system effectively constituted Japan’s "welfare society," where the government indirectly provided for the people through its support of the corporations; in turn, their smooth functioning was based upon the understanding that women would provide child care and elderly care while receiving security and benefits in return as part of their husbands’ and sons’ lifetime employment. But the country’s real estate bubble burst in the 1990s, sending Japan into a long period of economic depression and stagnation. Where there once was job stability and the ability to plan ahead, there is now a system in restructuring mode and uncertainty. On top of the worsened labor market, young people in Japan also have the burden of caring and preparing for the oldest population in the world. It would be reasonable to assume that all of these factors would cut into their interest in marriage, but it really hasn’t. In 2010, 86.3 percent of men and 89.4 percent of women still said they "intend to marry some day." Japanese women assuming a strong professional role is relatively new, and gender equality in the labor market is decades behind other advanced industrialized nations, Endo said. But even though Japanese women are more and more highly educated and career-oriented, she said women 18- to 24-years-old have been expressing an increasing desire to become full-time housewives. It’s just that many of those same women say they’re not very interested in sex by itself. Our ruling Ansari said, "46 percent of women between the age of 16 to 24 despise sexual contact" in Japan. Despise seems a slightly bold word for it. Still, the surveys on this question all point to a healthy proportion of the young Japanese population having little interest in sex, relationships and dating, and one survey in particular reflects what Ansari said. Experts say Ansari had it right. We rate this claim True. Update: This item was updated on June 25 with more details about the relationship between marriage and sex in Japan.

pomt-10968	"The Railroad Commission of Texas has nothing to do with railroads."	true	/texas/statements/2018/jul/19/roman-mcallen/texas-railroad-commission-nothing-to-do-railroads-/	Roman McAllen of Denton offered delegates to the Texas Democratic Party convention a familiar refrain about the state’s anachronistically named oil and gas regulatory agency. "Finally, we have to change the name," McAllen said in his June 22, 2018 speech. "The current one is very misleading. The Railroad Commission of Texas has nothing to do with railroads. This would be like calling the Food and... Drug Administration the Department of Transportation. This is about basic transparency," he said. McAllen, the 2018 Democratic nominee for a seat on the commission, faces the Republican incumbent, Christi Craddick, on the November 2018 ballot. It’s widely known the commission regulates oil and gas drilling and production, well plugging and site remediation, pipeline safety and damage prevention, surface mining of coal and uranium, gas utility rates and alternative fuels. Still, was McAllen right that the commission--steered by three elected members, each one having a six-year term--has nothing to do with railroads? The commission says so on a web page titled "Who Regulates Railroads in Texas?" That page says the commission "no longer has any jurisdiction or authority over railroads." Yet the agency started with a vigorous rail focus. In 1890, James Stephen Hogg won election as governor while calling for a constitutional amendment authorizing lawmakers to start a commission to bird-dog customer-gouging out-of-state railroad companies, according to a 1905 book compiling Hogg’s papers. Hogg devoted 6,000 words of his April 1890 campaign kickoff speech to making the case for a commission to regulate rates and traffic on the state’s rail lines. His slogan: "Hogg and The Commission." Hogg said in his speech: "The issue so sharply drawn in the present campaign is, shall corporate power or the State control? The fight is on and the issue is unmistakably presented." The law creating the commission took effect in June 1891. In its infancy, the commission regulated in-state railroad rates including passenger fares, according to a commission web page titled "The 'Railroads' in the Railroad Commission." "When the commission was founded in 1891, there were some 8,700 miles of track" in the state, the page says. "When the railroads reached their peak in Texas in 1930, there were 17,500 miles." But following World War II, goods increasingly "began to travel by truck and people by buses and cars and the miles of track began to shrink," the page says. Meantime, oil and gas regulation proved paramount. In a 1981 book on the commission, David Prindle of the University of Texas said that a few years after the Spindletop oil well gushed in 1901--birthing the economy’s dominant oil sector--the commission landed responsibility for regulating oil and gas pipelines. Prindle’s book calls the commission’s subsequent actions dealing with railroads "of only limited interest." Changes in federal law later vested rail safety in a federal agency (1970) and left states with no guiding role in rail rate-setting (1980), the commission’s "railroads" web page says. In 2005, finally, legislators transferred remaining rail safety oversight to the Texas Department of Transportation, "leaving the commission with no regulatory authority related to any aspect of the rail industry," the agency says. Name-change moves stall McAllen is hardly the first person to say the agency’s name should reflect its revised duties. But promoters of a change failed to persuade the 2017 Legislature to act and previous efforts to swap in an energy-oriented name faltered in 2005, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, according to a 2016 news account. That Austin American-Statesman news story quoted Rep. Tom Craddick, the Midland Republican and former House speaker representing the oil-rich Permian Basin region, in opposition. Craddick’s daughter, Christi Craddick, who seeks re-election against McAllen, said then that changing the name wasn’t her priority when it’d cost money needed for other needs--a position she reaffirmed in a statement emailed to us by an aide, Lauren Spreen. Our ruling McAllen said the railroad commission has nothing to do with railroads. It did, for more than a century. But it hasn’t had a thing to do with railroads since late 2005.

pomt-07192	Says that Sarah Palin and Craig Huey "would ban a woman's right to choose in every case"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/08/janice-hahn/california-attack-ad-links-craig-huey-sarah-palin-/	A new campaign video from California congressional candidate Janice Hahn, a Democratic Los Angeles city councilwoman, is remarkable not so much for its attacks on her opponent Republican Craig Huey -- it's fairly standard abortion and the-Republicans-want-to-end-Medicare fare -- but rather for its efforts to tie Huey's positions to that of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. "Sarah Palin and Craig Huey. Which would ban a woman's right to choose in every case? Both Palin and Huey," the narrator begins. "Which supports a radical plan to end Medicare, but wants to give tax breaks to the wealthy? Palin and Huey again." "But which one called Planned Parenthood a 'murder mill'? Only Craig Huey. We don't need Craig Huey's extremist right wing agenda." The Palin cameo is an intriguing political strategy, one that appears to bank on Palin's negative baggage. "They clearly see Palin as a polarizing figure," said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of the independent Rothenberg Political Report in Washington, D.C. "And so the more closely they can tie Huey to Palin the better." The ad appears to be aimed at sparking larger voter turnout in the heavily Democratic Los Angeles district, he said. Huey, a business consultant and political commentator, and Hahn are facing off in a July 12 special election to replace former Democratic Rep. Jane Harman, who retired in February. We’re fact-checking two claims in this ad. In a separate item, we looked at whether Huey called Planned Parenthood a "murder mill." Huey claims a campaign staffer actually wrote that phrase on his political blog, but since it’s his website, he’s standing by it. We rated the claim True. In this item, we will focus on whether both Palin and Huey "would ban a woman's right to choose in every case." Is it true that both Palin and Huey "would ban a woman's right to choose in every case?" Let's start with Palin's position on abortion, which was well-established during the 2008 elections. The Hahn campaign pointed us to a Dec. 4, 2009, article in POLITICO describing Palin as an "anti-abortion star." Palin spelled out the nuances of her position clearly in an ABC News interview with Charles Gibson on Sept. 13, 2008: Gibson: Roe v. Wade, do you think it should be reversed? Palin: I think it should and I think that states should be able to decide that issue... I am pro-life. I do respect other people's opinion on this, also, and I think that a culture of life is best for America... What I want to do, when elected vice president, with John McCain, hopefully, be able to reach out and work with those who are on the other side of this issue, because I know that we can all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in America and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and should be empowered to embrace, to allow that culture of life. That's my personal opinion on this, Charlie. Gibson: John McCain would allow abortion in cases of rape and incest. Do you believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother is in danger? Palin: That is my personal opinion. Gibson: Would you change and accept it in rape and incest? Palin: My personal opinion is that abortion (should be) allowed if the life of the mother is endangered. So Palin's lone exception to her hard-line stance on abortion is when the life of the mother is in peril. Huey takes a similarly conservative view of abortion. "His personal opinion on abortion is that he opposes it," said Dave Gilliard, a consultant to the Huey campaign. Huey was adopted, he said, so this is "a very personal issue for him." However, Gilliard said, Huey "understands that the Supreme Court has ruled on this issue and that Congress cannot change that and cannot ban abortions." So it's wrong, he said, for the ad to claim that Huey would ban abortions. "He has said specifically many times that he understands the Supreme Court has made its decision," Gilliard said. "He thinks it's a bad decision and wishes they would change their mind. But Congress cannot ban abortions." As backup for ad's claim, Hahn's campaign manager Dave Jacobson pointed to several blog postings on electionforum.org, a website that Huey manages as an outlet for his political beliefs. In one of them, on Jan. 28, 2011, Huey sent out a note of thanks to those who attended a March for Life rally in Washington D.C. "During this time of reform in Washington, we cannot ignore the unborn or forget about the immoral, twisted Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision," he wrote. Other posts to the website (hereand here) make clear Huey’s hard line on abortion. We think there's a bit of hair-splitting in the debate over the ad's claim. Huey’s position on abortion appears to be very similar to Palin’s. Whether they "would ban" a woman’s right to choose, depends a bit on how you interpret the phrase "would" and whether they make any exceptions. It's true that Congress does not have the power to overturn Roe v. Wade -- which Huey’s campaign says he understands and respects. But we also think it's fair game to say what your opponent "would" do if they could. However, we think the word "ban" is too sweeping, since Palin, at least, makes an exception for the life of the mother. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02180	Dave Brat "worked on Democrat Gov. Tim Kaine’s Council of Economic Advisors while Kaine tried to raise our taxes by over $1 billion."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/28/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-dave-brat-advised-served-economic/	U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor, R-7th, has launched a TV ad accusing his primary election opponent, Randolph-Macon College professor Dave Brat, of being a closet liberal. "Brat worked on Democrat Gov. Tim Kaine’s Council of Economic Advisers while Kaine tried to raise our taxes by over $1 billion," the announcer says. Brat complained to us that the ad perpetuates "a lie" that "I am behind the large tax increases of Kaine." So we decided to examine the facts in Cantor’s ad statement and it’s implication that Brat counseled Kaine, who was governor from 2006 to 2010, on tax policies. Cantor’s campaign provides backup for the ad on the website http://wecheckthefacts.com/. The site says, "Professor Brat proudly accepted an appointment by Gov. Tim Kaine to serve on his Board of Economists." It links to a state Senate resolution confirming Kaine’s 2006 appointment of Brat and 11 others to the panel. The group, now known as the Joint Advisory Board of Economists, or JABE, helps the state’s Finance Department refine predictions for the state’s economy as part of the governor’s annual budget proposal process. Board members do not receive compensation. Finance Secretary Ric Brown -- who has served in his post under governors from both parties, including Kaine -- said the board weighs in on a national economic forecast prepared by Global Insight and a Virginia forecast offered by the state Department of Taxation. The panel seeks consensus of variables such as anticipated unemployment, wages and inflation. The board members "respond to forecasts in terms of their areas of expertise," Brown told us. "They do not do revenue, but they do the economic underpinnings." After a consensus is reached on the direction of the state economy for the next year, the Taxation Department prepares two or three projections for Virginia revenues. Those estimates are reviewed by another board, the Governor’s Advisory Council on Revenue Estimates. This group -- consisting of the governor, senior legislators and chief executives from major companies in Virginia -- reaches a consensus for the revenues projections that the governor folds into his proposed budget. Brown described JABE, the board Brat served on, as "part of an overall process that does feed into the revenue process and policy changes." But he said the board does not make tax recommendations. Brat and the 11 other JABE members appointed by Kaine all had doctoral degrees in economics. Ten of the 12 were appointed to council by several governors and served multiple terms. Eight of them, including Brat, were appointed by both Democratic and Republican governors. Brat was first named to panel by Kaine and reappointed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. Two of economists, Christine Chmura of Richmond and Roy Pearson of Williamsburg, have served under six governors. Another, Roy Webb of Richmond, has served under five governors. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who took office in January, has not yet made appointments to the council. Now, let’s address Kaine’s tax-increase record. Cantor’s website linked to several articles from the Richmond Times-Dispatch and PolitiFact Virginia. In 2011, we found that Kaine had unsuccessfully proposed about $4 billion in tax hikes during his administration. He twice sought increases of about $1 billion in transportation taxes. He also proposed a $1.9 billion increase in income taxes, offset by a $650 million cut in local car taxes. Ray Allen Jr., a political adviser to Cantor, emailed us that the ad contains two "facts which are not in dispute," referring to Brat’s service on the advisory panel and Kaine’s efforts to raise taxes. "There is no public record of the professor ever disagreeing with Gov. Kaine on taxes," Allen wrote. Our ruling Cantor’s TV ad says, "Brat worked on Democrat Gov. Tim Kaine’s Council of Economic Advisors while Kaine tried to raise our taxes by over $1 billion." Brat clearly served on the panel and Kaine clearly sought tax hikes. The ad does not explicitly say these two events are connected, but mentioning them in the same sentence creates an unfair impression that Brat was part of a group that advised Kaine to raise taxes. There’s no evidence that occurred. The panel, as pointed out by the state’s long-serving secretary of finance, weighed in on the direction of the state’s economy. It did not advise the governor on revenue and tax policies. Cantor’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13760	"America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/trumps-claim-us-taxes-tweaked/	Donald Trump tweaked one of his most repeated falsehoods as he accepted the Republican nomination for president. On the final night of the Republican National Convention, Trump positioned himself as the fiscally sound counter to rival and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whom he claimed is proposing a tax hike. "Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, I mean everyone," Trump said. "America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it'll happen and it'll happen fast." This is the fourth time we’ve weighed in on a statement from Trump about America’s tax rate. The difference tonight is the slightly tempered tone. Instead of declaring the United States as having the highest tax rate, he said we’re one of the highest-taxed countries. That’s progress. But it’s still not 100 percent accurate. Back in May, Trump said, "We’re the highest-taxed nation in the world." We rated that False because, according to the Pew Research Center last year, America is slightly behind the middle of the pack when it comes to the taxed revenue portion of gross domestic product. Raj Shah, a Republican National Committee spokesman, told PolitiFact that Trump was talking about the corporate tax rate. Trump didn’t specify that distinction in his speech, though his tax-rate claim was immediately followed by the business-specific line about reducing taxes that will spur growth of new companies and jobs. We’ve previously fact-checked a statement about whether the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, and found it pretty accurate. Of the most advanced and industrialized nations in the world, America ranks third highest for general top marginal corporate income tax rates with a 39.1 percent tax on corporate profits, exceeded by Chad and the United Arab Emirates. So the United States does have a higher corporate tax rate than most of its industrialized peers. That said, it’s worth remembering that the official tax rates are one thing, while the tax rates corporations actually pay can be substantially less. In practice, U.S. companies pay less because they can claim deductions and exclusions. Trump teed up his statement by mentioning the tax impact on "middle-income Americans and businesses," which could easily lead listeners to perceive this as a question of overall tax burden, not businesses specifically. Our rating Trump called the United States "one of the highest-taxed nations in the world." Trump tweaked his language this time in effort to improve his accuracy, saying it’s "one of" the highest taxed nations. If you believe that he meant the corporate tax rate, given the details about companies and jobs that followed the claim, then Trump’s comment is pretty accurate. However, he didn’t specify that distinction, and a reasonable listener could take away from Trump’s remark that he meant taxes overall, particularly given that he set up the line with a joint reference to middle-income Americans and businesses. We rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8860395-ac6d-4568-be87-4971393efacb	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-22T00:34:21	2016-07-21	['United_States']

pomt-13564	Says Marco Rubio "voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act."	true	/florida/statements/2016/aug/24/patrick-murphy/rubio-voted-against-violence-against-women-act-mur/	Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy is attacking Marco Rubio, his presumptive general election opponent in the race for Senate, for allegedly voting against domestic violence measures. Murphy lambasted Rubio for having a "terrible record on women’s health" in an Aug. 19 post on his website. Murphy’s post said Rubio opposed the right to choose an abortion, Obamacare and Planned Parenthood. "He even voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act," Murphy’s campaign wrote. That sounded like a ready-made attack for election season, so we checked the voting record. Sure enough, Rubio voted against the legislation. But he had his reasons. Qualified support The original 1994 Violence Against Women Act was championed by then-Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. It provided grants to authorities on the state and local levels for domestic violence hotlines, police training, legal and housing assistance, and more. It has been credited for a decrease in domestic violence and an upswing in reporting incidents to police. The act was reauthorized in 2005, then due to expire in 2011. That brings us to Rubio’s first term. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sponsored a Senate bill in 2011 to continue the provisions of the act. It didn’t come to a vote until the following year. Rubio said he supported reauthorizing the law. But he voted against it. On April 26, 2012, Rubio and 30 other Republicans voted against Leahy’s bill, which still passed with at least some support from both sides of the aisle. Rubio released a statement after the vote saying he was in favor of the act, but opposed portions of the bill. Rubio pointed out he had voted for a proposed amendment he thought better addressed rape kit backlogs, sentencing guidelines and law enforcement databases. He added that he was against Leahy’s bill because it didn’t deal with spending controls the way he liked and gave the Justice Department control over state programs. "I support reauthorizing the current Violence Against Women Act as written and hope we can vote for it once it comes out of the House-Senate conference committee," Rubio said. Leahy’s bill passed the Senate, but died in the House that year. The reauthorization came back in 2013, with Rubio again voting against it in the Senate, where it passed Feb. 13 with bipartisan support, 78-22. All 22 nays were Republicans. Rubio released another statement saying he liked provisions of the bill and was proud it included human trafficking protections, but he again said he wished the original law had been reauthorized. "Unfortunately, I could not support the final, entire legislation that contains new provisions that could have potentially adverse consequences," he said. He echoed some concerns from the year prior, saying he disagreed with how the bill shifted funding from domestic violence programs to sexual assault programs and took power out of state hands. He also opposed a provision allowing Native American tribal governments greater jurisdiction in abuse cases, giving tribal courts the power to prosecute non-Native American men. On Feb. 28, 2013, the House reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act with a bipartisan vote of 286-138, with 87 Republicans voting for it. Our ruling Murphy said Rubio "voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act." Rubio voiced support for the original law, but he and some Republicans in both the Senate and House opposed certain provisions added to the bill pertaining to spending and federal oversight. Rubio voted against the bill in 2012 and 2013, but it passed with bipartisan support the second time. Even though he had clearly stated his reasons why, Rubio still voted nay.

pomt-07306	"The new beverage tax will increase the cost of sodas, juice drinks, sports drinks, iced teas, and flavored water up to 50%."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/18/american-beverage-association/beverage-association-says-ri-tax-would-increase-su/	Taxes are on everyone's mind, especially in the wake of Gov. Lincoln Chafee's widely criticized proposal to impose a sales tax on previously exempt items. Now, the folks who bring us a wide variety of beverages are protesting a proposed new tax on sugar-flavored drinks. In full-page newspaper advertisements, pamphlets and placards on store shelves, the American Beverage Association, an advocacy group representing the nonalcoholic beverage industry, is warning consumers that they are going to see an increase of up to 50 percent in the price of their favorite beverage. For example, the placard we saw at a local Stop & Shop had a big red stop sign and the words: "The new beverage tax will increase the cost of sodas, juice drinks, sports drinks, iced teas, and flavored water up to 50%." The claim left us thirsting for the truth, so we started making inquiries. At issue are two identical bills in the state legislature -- one in the House (H5432), the other in the Senate (S2952). Both call for a tax of 1 cent per ounce on drinks with added sugar or high-calorie sweetener. Thus, a 20-ounce bottle of Pepsi would cost you an extra 20 cents. A 2-liter bottle of Mountain Dew would cost an additional 68 cents. The potential revenue, estimated at $28 million per year, would not be used to help the cash-strapped state, at least as the legislation is now written. It would instead be given to the Health Department for anti-obesity programs. The goal is to move consumers away from "sugar-added beverages, which have no nutritional value and which have a tendency to contribute to a lot of health problems," said Steven DeToy, director of public and government affairs for the Rhode Island Medical Society, one of the groups pushing the legislation. Nationwide, non-diet sodas make up about 70 percent of the $75 billion carbonated soft drink market in the U.S., according to John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they now account for half the added sugar in the U.S. diet. Opponents say the tax would be one more burden to consumers, driving shoppers across state lines to buy their soda while doing little to reduce obesity. To find out how much the proposed tax would raise prices, we went shopping. We discovered that when it comes to the purchase of individual bottles and cans, the claim wasn't close to true. A 20-ounce bottle of Coke selling for $1.49 would increase in price by 13 percent, to $1.69. An 8-ounce can of Red Bull selling for $2.29 would cost $2.37, 4 percent more. A dozen 12-ounce cans of soda priced at $6.19 per case, which we found at a Providence Rite Aid, would cost $7.63, and additional 23 percent. But if you buy soda on sale and in volume, the percentage increase is greater. For example, at Stop & Shop, you could get three of those 12-packs for $10 (or $3.34 per pack); in that case the price would increase to $4.78 per pack, or 43 percent more. If you bought a 2-liter bottle of Pepsi (68 ounces) as part of a 2-for-$3 promotion ($1.50 each), it would make each bottle cost $2.18, or adding 45 percent to the cost of each bottle. And with a 3-liter bottle of Stop & Shop-brand root beer, selling at 4 for $5 (or $1.25 each), the tax would increase the per-bottle price to $2.26, or 81 percent more, even more that the beverage association warns. So the increases are all over the scanner. There's another problem with the American Beverage Association claim. The legislation would tax only drinks to which sugar, high-fructose corn syrup or another high-calorie sweetener has been added. Diet sodas would be exempt. So would drinks with more than 50 percent fruit or vegetable juice. So would beverages you get from a soda fountain. A Coke at McDonald’s, unless it was in a bottle, would not carry the tax. In its claim, the beverage association is ignoring those distinctions. One reason may be that the wholesalers might cover the cost of the tax by spreading it out among all beverages. (They made that argument during a March 9 hearing before the House Finance Committee.) That means consumers would pay more for all types of drinks, healthy or otherwise. However, if they adopted that practice, the overall increase to consumers would fall even further. The "up to 50%" claim, as tenuous as it is, would be even less accurate. In summary, it is correct that if you were to buy a sugary drink on sale and in bulk, the added price could approach -- and in some cases exceed -- 50 percent because the tax would be levied on a per-ounce basis. But for individual bottles and cans, the tax would typically be far lower -- 20 percent or less for a 20-ounce drink bought for 98 cents or more. In addition, opponents of the bill are inaccurately implying that the increase would apply to all sodas, juice drinks, soft drinks, iced teas and flavored waters. That's not true; that's not how the bill is written. And if the companies decided to jack up the prices for the diet drinks and all-natural fruit drinks that would be exempted from the tax, the beverage association's estimate of the potential price increases would be even less true. By trying to have it both ways, the American Beverage Association is making a claim that is accurate but leaves out important details. So we rate its statement as Half True.

pomt-14820	"The Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-libyan-people-have-voted-twic/	During the presidential race, any discussions about Hillary Clinton and Libya have typically focused on the deadly attack on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012. But after a recent foreign policy speech, Clinton was asked about the success -- or lack thereof -- of democratization in Libya, a country ruled for decades by dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The question focused on Donald Trump’s argument that removing dictators in the Middle East leads to more chaos in places like Iraq, Yemen and Libya. Wasn’t Trump right, the questioner asked? Clinton responded, "Well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named." She then zeroed in on the situation in Libya: "The Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want," Clinton said in the Nov. 19, 2015, speech. "They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others. So I think it's too soon to tell, and I think it's something that we have to be, you know, looking at very closely." We wondered whether Clinton was correct to say that "the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want," so we took a closer look. The big picture Finding anything to cheer about in Libyan politics and governance today requires a lot of squinting. "Libya has no leadership at all at the moment," said Amanda Kadlec, a project associate in defense and political sciences at the RAND Corp. who specializes in Libya. "Even though two governments -- one based in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk -- are competing for power, it is essentially a non-governed state, because the mandate of the most recent elected government expired at the end of October this year. Its members extended the mandate, a decision that foreign governments on the whole have not supported." In other words, Libya’s government is pretty close to non-functional right now, so any victories in the democratization process are hard to find. That said, Clinton did acknowledge that point in her answer, so we’ll focus on the more specific assertion she made -- that the Libyan people have participated twice in "free and fair elections." Free and fair elections? There have been three major elections held in Libya since the fall of Gaddafi -- parliamentary elections in July 2012, elections for the constitutional drafting assembly in February 2014, and parliamentary elections in June 2014. Each received at least some praise from outside observers for integrity of the balloting process, but each, to one degree or another, also faced problems. (A Clinton campaign spokesman said she was referring to the two parliamentary elections, not the constitutional drafting assembly.) Here’s a brief rundown: • Parliamentary election, July 2012. This election, which took place in something of a honeymoon between Gaddafi’s fall and the emergence of armed fighting, offers the strongest support for Clinton’s claim that free and fair elections have been held in Libya. The Carter Center -- an organization founded by former President Jimmy Carter that offers election assistance to newly democratizing countries -- released a post-election report in May 2013 that found Libya’s first national vote to be "a major step forward in the country’s transition from authoritarian rule to participatory democracy." "Despite overwhelming challenges," the center wrote, "Libyan authorities organized the election in a timely, orderly, and impartial manner that offered Libyans a historic opportunity to exercise their franchise." The report described most of the country as "peaceful and jubilant" on election day, with about 62 percent turnout among registered voters. Still, even in this relatively successful election, problems lurked. "Security challenges in Benghazi, Ajdabiya, and Kufra both immediately preceding the polls and on election day significantly marred polling in these areas," according to the Carter Center. "Attacks on materials and polling stations led to the death of (a Libyan election official) and caused polling stations to be consolidated or to open late. Looting of offices in Benghazi and Tobruq and destruction of election materials in (a government) warehouse in Ajdabiya also had significant impact on the process." And Kadlec of RAND suggested that this vote was a step forward, albeit a small one. "In theory, Libyans expressed their genuine desire for a democratic Libya by voting in elections," she said. "But after generations under a completely closed dictatorship, Libyans who had never been exiles had little to no frame of reference as to how elections would translate into an effective form of governance." • Constitutional drafting assembly election, February 2014. By the time of the next election, a year and half later, the "jubilance" had begun to fade and problems increased. The Carter Center, which observed this election as well, found it "soundly administered" but added that it "failed to achieve the desired inclusiveness to have a truly representative body." The center praised national election officials for "making the polls accessible to the vast majority of the Libyan population" but added that 13 seats of the 60-member assembly remained unelected, "including five of the six seats for Libya’s Amazigh, Touareg, and Tebu communities as well as one of the six seats reserved for women." The Carter Center also expressed concern about falling turnout rates, stemming in part from security problems. "Due to security concerns resulting from attacks on polling stations and resistance in some communities to the elections, 115 polling stations, including 34 planned for the Amazigh community, were unable to open at all, and 34 were forced to close during the day," the Carter Center found. "Polling for these centers was adjourned and rescheduled." "The low levels of participation and the general fatigue with the country’s political road map may well be an indication that Libya’s political institutions remain in danger of being hollowed out — valued more by the people for what they can deliver in patronage than as real institutions through which the country’s political future can be charted," the report concluded. • Parliamentary elections, June 2014. The problems that emerged in the February 2014 vote continued to plague the vote four months later. In addition to low turnout -- documented by empty polling places shown on television -- security problems had become a distinct problem. In Benghazi, Islamist insurgents opened fire on a local security headquarters, killing at least five and wounding at least 30, according to the BBC. In another incident in the same city, gunmen assassinated human rights activist Salwa Bughaighis as she returned home from voting. Polling places in cities such as Derna, Kufra and Sabra were closed for security reasons. In addition, the vote itself proved not to have a lasting positive impact. While the results amounted to "a devastating defeat for the Islamists" -- as Mohamed Eljarh, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Rafik Hariri Center, wrote at the time -- Libya’s highest court in November 2014 ruled the results unconstitutional, in a decision that critics said came "at gunpoint" from militias that controlled Tripoli. This resulted in a split government -- one in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk in eastern Libya. The elected representative body in Tobruk is now all but defunct, its mandate expired. "Libyans have had difficulty in establishing effective government due to the reasons (Clinton) describes -- internal divides, external actors, terrorism -- but it does go much, much deeper than that, and totally depends on who you ask," Kadlec said. "Some point to the NATO intervention, while others point to post-revolution neglect by western powers." Ali Abdullatif Ahmida, a University of New England political scientist who specializes in Libya, places at least part of the blame on Clinton. "She and the Obama administration dropped the ball and left the Libyan people to armed militias who lost in the election and terrorized people and prevented (the elected representatives) from working in Tripoli," Ahmida said. Our ruling Clinton said that "the Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want." Even acknowledging that Clinton mentioned some of the problems with Libya’s democratization in the rest of her comments, she is spinning the facts of recent Libyan elections in the most favorable way. Security concerns kept some polling places closed, and the most recent election was punctuated by a mass shooting by Islamist attackers and the assassination of a leading human-rights advocate. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-11-23T11:27:51	2015-11-19	['Libya']
pomt-13909	Says British voters "under 50, especially millennials, overwhelmingly voted to stay," in the European Union. "It was older voters who voted to leave."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/26/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-brexit-vote-young-people-voted-stay-old-/	Since the United Kingdom’s stunning vote to leave the European Union, political observers have wondered what the ramifications will be in the United States, especially what it will mean for the 2016 election. On June 26, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., for his take on Britain’s exit (Brexit). Kaine, believed to be on Hillary Clinton’s shortlist for vice president, said the United States has to maintain its ties with Europe and the United Kingdom. He also noted the generational gap among those who voted to stay in the European Union and those who voted to leave. "Young voters, those under 50, especially millennials, overwhelmingly voted to stay," Kaine said. "And it was older voters who voted to leave." The United Kingdom voted to leave the union 52 percent to 48 percent, and it seems generally understood that older generations pushed the "leave" campaign over the threshold toward a win. But how do the numbers actually stack up? Usually, journalists and others rely on exit polling to learn about demographic breakdown of votes and also to call the results of an election before all ballots have been counted. However, there were no official exit polls from the Brexit vote, in part because of the difficulty of constructing a good poll on such a rare referendum. However, we did find an unofficial exit poll of more than 12,000 people, conducted by Michael Ashcroft, a British former politician and businessman who also conducts public polls. His Brexit findings support Kaine’s claim. According to Ashcroft, who supports Brexit, a majority of voters 44 years old and younger voted to remain, while those 45 and older voted to leave. (Kaine specifically mentioned voters 50 and younger, and this is as close as Ashcroft’s poll gets to that bracket.) Kaine also said millennials were especially enthusiastic about remaining in the European Union, and he’s correct. Those between 18-24 years old voted 73 percent against Brexit, and those between 25-34 years old voted 62 percent to stay, according to Ashcroft’s poll. That’s in stark contrast to voters 65 and over who voted 60 percent in favor of leaving the European Union. Ashcroft’s polling is in line with the results of surveys conducted in advance of the vote. "Call your nan!" was a pitch in the last days of the "stay" campaign, pushing youngsters to try and flip their grandparents. The Wall Street Journal analyzed and consolidated polling from several agencies and found that among those polled, people aged 18-24 opposed Brexit 60 percent, compared to 20 percent in favor, while the rest were undecided or were not planning to vote. Among those aged 24-49, 45 percent wanted to remain, while 39 percent favored leaving. The balance flipped among older groups, with 48 percent of those aged 50-64 supporting Brexit, while 42 percent opposed. And 60 percent of those aged 65 or older supported Brexit, and just 34 percent wanted to remain in the European Union. In further support of the generational gap, the Telegraph found that areas with a higher concentration of people over the age of 65 tended to have a higher percentage of people voting in favor of Brexit compared to areas with a lower concentration of older voters. In light of this split, many young people in Britain are now expressing frustration that an older generation has made a monumental decision about the future, yet it’s the younger people who will spend many more years of their lives living with that decision. British millennials have only ever known the United Kingdom as part of a larger European community, as it joined the the European Union’s precursor more than 40 years ago, noted Cassie Werber, a Britain-based writer, in Quartz. They’re used to the freedom to work and travel throughout Europe, as well as the presence of many different cultures in their own country, particularly in a post-Soviet world. "By the time we were born, the U.K. already had become a country in which people with widely diverse heritages coexisted, for the most part in peace," Werber wrote. Our ruling Kaine said of the Brexit referendum, "Young voters, those under 50, especially millennials, overwhelmingly voted to stay. And it was older voters who voted to leave." Based on the best polling we have, all signs point to a significant generational divide on the question of whether the United Kingdom should have remained in the European Union. It’s clear as day that millennials — those about 34 or younger — favored remaining. It seems that those between 35-50 slightly favored staying, too, while older generations heavily favored Brexit. The only caveat is that we don’t have official exit polls to support Kaine’s claim. For that reason, we rate Kaine’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1a7fc8df-7397-4369-b89d-6c9fa32dbe8a	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-06-26T17:31:56	2016-06-26	['European_Union', 'United_Kingdom']

pomt-12722	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "threatens citizens with arrest if they continue asking for a town hall."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/07/resistance-report/article-falsely-claims-ron-johnson-threatens-citiz/	Some Facebook readers flagged as "fake news" a March 2, 2017 article that carried this headline about Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson: Republican Senator Threatens Citizens with Arrest if They Continue Asking for a Town Hall The article was published by Resistance Report, which describes itself as a "social justice-oriented media company dedicated to providing the bold, combative, thought-provoking journalism that will be critical over the next four years." So, we thought we’d see whether Johnson made such a threat. A letter The article accuses Johnson of dodging requests to hold town hall meetings, but eventually responding to the requests with a "cease-and-desist" letter. But that letter had nothing to do with town hall meetings. As we reported on the same day the Resistance Report article was published, Johnson had sent a letter to a Milwaukee man who acknowledged he had called Johnson’s office as many as 83 times in a day. The letter warned that if the man visited or called Johnson’s office (written communication was OK), staff would call U.S. Capitol Police. Citizen Action of Wisconsin had cited the letter in claiming that "people who come to" their dissent actions "get a ‘cease and desist’ letter" from Johnson's office. We rated the group’s claim False. The man was involved in some Citizen Action activities involving Johnson. But the letter was based on his personal contact with Johnson’s office, not any Citizen Action activities. (A few days later, Citizen Action posted an apology for making its claim.) Tom Cahill, an editor for Resistance Report, told us that since the man "had called his senator's office 83 times, it seems as if his goal is for Johnson to hold a public town hall so his senator can answer his questions directly." But that is complete speculation. The letter also went to a single person. It was not a general response to "citizens" who may request a town hall meeting, as the article claimed. Our rating Resistance Report says Johnson "threatens citizens with arrest if they continue asking for a town hall." A letter by Johnson’s office that was cited by the group warned a man that if he did not stop calling and visiting Johnson’s office, the Capitol Police would be called.

pomt-08764	"Obama’s stimulus, passed in his first month in office, will cost more than the entire Iraq War."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/25/mark-tapscott/did-stimulus-cost-more-war-iraq/	Washington Examiner editorial page editor Mark Tapscott warned readers Aug. 23, 2010, to expect to hear a lot from Democrats about the cost of the Iraq War. It might be expensive, he said, but not as expensive as President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus. Citing data from conservative writer Randall Hoven, Tapscott said, "Obama’s stimulus, passed in his first month in office, will cost more than the entire Iraq War -- more than $100 billion more." Really? Could the nearly seven-year-long war cost less than the 2009 stimulus, which was designed to keep the U.S. economy from sliding into a depression? At first glance, the numbers look pretty close. The most recent figures from the Congressional Budget Office, released in August 2010, put the total cost for the stimulus -- from February 2009 through 2019 -- at $814 billion. Estimated funding for the war in Iraq totals $709 billion from 2003 to 2010, according to the same CBO report. But note the different time periods. The stimulus costs are projected through 2019. But the war spending is calculated only to the end of this year. We also should note that the $814 billion cost for the stimulus includes $70 billion to fix a problem with the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is designed to target the wealthiest taxpayers but is gradually affecting more people in the middle class. As for the war cost, we found a variety of opinions on the total. Some reports have higher estimates than the CBO’s for that same time period. A July 2010 report from the Congressional Research Service estimated the cost at $748 billion, which includes costs for the military, the State Department and foreign aid, and Veterans Administration medical costs related to the war. Add in supplemental appropriation from 2010, and you get about $750 billion, said James R. Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that studies tax and fiscal issues. Another expert on defense spending told us it’s also important to account for inflation. "The cost of the Iraq War going back seven years and the cost of the stimulus act through 2019 cover a broad stretch of time over which inflation becomes important," Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said in an e-mail. The center is a think tank that focuses on defense issues. Adjusted for inflation, the cost of the Iraq War to date totals $756 billion and the stimulus act totals about $820 billion, according to Harrison. So by that barometer, Tapscott is right that spending on the stimulus exceeds the cost of the Iraq war, although by $64 billion, rather than $100 billion. But there’s a big assumption in his logic. As Harrison put it to us, the comparison "assumes the cost of the Iraq War ends" this year. The costs are still adding up. Although the last combat troops have been withdrawn from Iraq, there are still 49,700 troops on the ground conducting security patrols and training Iraqis. And troops are expected to remain until the end of December 2011. Harrison noted that the president’s 2011 budget includes an additional $43.4 billion for Iraq, and "even if the withdrawal continues as planned, we are likely to see a request of $10 billion-$5 billion in the 2012 budget." And the number could be much higher depending how broadly you define the cost of the war. Some experts believe you should include the continuing costs of disability compensation and medical care for Iraqi war veterans -- costs that will last for decades. Linda Bilmes, senior lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-author of the Three Trillion Dollar War, argues that official government estimates of the war’s costs are too low because they do not take into account costs such as higher combat pay and recruiting costs, Social Security disability payments for veterans who can no longer work, the cost of restoring the military to its pre-war strength (replacing the bullets and bombs that have been used). She and Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-prize winning economist at Columbia University, argue that the "true" cost of Iraq will be several trillion dollars. Bilmes also notes that there are a higher number of disabled veterans from the war in Iraq than in previous wars. According to Bilmes, there are eight veterans wounded in combat in Iraq per fatality, compared with 2.6 wounded in combat per fatality in Vietnam. In addition, she said in an e-mail, 10 percent of Vietnam veterans enrolled in Veterans Administration health care -- whereas 44 percent of Iraq veterans have already enrolled in VA health care. Her book estimates the long-term cost of continuing medical care of Iraq and Afghanistan vets to be hundreds of billions of dollars. So let’s recap. If it were true that the war and its costs had truly ended today, then Tapscott would be right. But he says that the stimulus will cost more than the "entire" war, and we are persuaded by the experts that with nearly 50,000 troops still in Iraq, it is premature to say the war is over. And when you make reasonable adjustments for inflation, the expected costs of the troops still there and the long-term cost of medical care and re-stocking the military for all the bullets and bombs, it appears likely the war costs will exceed the stimulus. So we find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12810	"While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-cnn-cut-bernie-sanders-c/	President Donald Trump has repeatedly labeled CNN as "fake news," but is it true that Sen. Bernie Sanders agrees with him? That was the message from Trump in an early-morning Twitter take. "While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network," Trump tweeted Feb. 12. "They said technical difficulties." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump is referring to CNN’s Erin Burnett’s interview with Sanders, I-Vt., on Feb. 10, a few days before his tweet. Trump’s tweet, however, mischaracterized the reality of the Sanders-Burnett exchange. His tweet echoes a post on InfoWars, a website that pushes conspiracy theories. Here’s what actually happened. Sanders and Burnett were discussing the news that Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn called the Russian ambassador to the United States before the inauguration to discuss easing sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama in retaliation for interference in the election. Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump officials had said in media interviews that Flynn did not discuss the sanctions with Sergey Kislyak. A minute into the interview, Burnett played a clip of Trump responding to reporters’ questions on his plane about Flynn’s comments. Trump said, "I don't know about that, I haven't seen it. What report is that? I haven't seen that, I'll look at that." After the clip, Burnett asked Sanders if it’s a "problem" that the president hasn’t seen the report. That’s when Sanders actually criticized Trump for his tendency to dismiss news outlets’ negative reports as fake news. Here’s the back-and-forth: Burnett: "He says he knows nothing about it, hasn't seen any of these reports. Is that a problem?" Sanders: "Well, I don't know, maybe he was watching CNN fake news, what do you think?" Burnett: "You don't buy it?" Sanders: "That was a joke." Burnett: "I know it was a joke. I'm saying, you don't buy what he said, obviously?" Sanders’ audio cut out after Burnett acknowledged the joke, so CNN cut to commercial break. "It looks like we've lost connection with Senator Sanders," Burnett said. "So let's just try to get that back up. Do we have him back? OK. So what we're going to do is take a break, I don't want to waste our time, we only have the senator for a few minutes, we're going to take a break, we're going to come back and continue our conversation with Senator Sanders." Burnett picked up the interview after the break, going on for nine more minutes to ask Sanders about the administration’s contentious travel ban, the Republican plans to replace the Affordable Care Act and Trump’s attacks on Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. CNN reporters including Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper also shot back at Trump’s tweet misrepresenting the exchange. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump tweeted, "While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!" Trump’s tweet distorted what happened when Sanders brought up "fake news" on CNN. Sanders was actually criticizing Trump’s repeated outcries that CNN is a fake news source. His audio did go out after this joke, but the CNN host picked up the interview after a commercial break for about nine more minutes. Trump gave the inaccurate impression that Sanders was booted for calling CNN "fake news." That’s not what happened.

pomt-10437	"We spend a staggering amount of money on health care — over $2-trillion and almost twice as much as any other country per person."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/08/john-mccain/first-in-health-spending-but-not-far-ahead/	Depicting rising costs as the biggest problem facing the U.S. health system, Sen. John McCain used an April 28, 2008, appearance at a Miami children's hospital to lament the huge sums the United States is spending on health care and to call for fiscal restraint. "We spend a staggering amount of money on health care — over $2-trillion and almost twice as much as any other country per person. Within the decade total health care spending will more than double and consume nearly one out of every five dollars in America," McCain said. McCain's facts and figures are mostly correct. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, citing 2005 data, puts national health spending at just under $2-trillion annually, accounting for 16 percent of the economy. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the government's two big public health programs, projects health spending will be nearly one-fifth of the gross domestic product by 2016. But McCain is a bit off in saying the United States' per capita spending is almost twice as much as other nations. Though it certainly leads the pack — spending $6,401 per person on health care according to an analysis of 2005 data by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — nations such as Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland each spend more than $4,000 per person. Austria, Iceland, Belgium, France, Canada and Germany also spent more than half of the U.S. figure. It's worth pointing out that these other nations have some form of universal health insurance in which the government subsidizes the financial risk of getting sick. The fact that the United States has no such mandate, but still spends ever greater sums on health care, speaks in part to inefficiencies and waste within the system. The United States isn't getting better results for the money; it had the lowest life expectancy — 77.8 years — among the 15 countries that spend the most, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an umbrella group for 30 industrialized nations committed to free market principles. And there are widespread disparities in the quality of care, depending on one's insurance coverage, income, race and ethnicity. McCain's statement accurately takes stock of the scope of medical inflation and places it in the context of overall national spending. But because he overstates how bad the U.S. problem is in relation to other nations, we rule his statement Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-05-08T00:00:00	2008-04-28	['None']

abbc-00223	Equality for Australian women has worsened dramatically since the beginning of this decade, with high levels of sexual harassment in the workplace, the former President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, recently warned.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-13/fact-check-global-gender-gap/10051632	Professor Triggs' claim is fair. The index benchmarks countries on their progress towards gender parity. First, it awards each country a score based on the size of its gender gap. Then, it ranks countries according to their scores. Australia's overall gender gap ranking has worsened from 23rd position in 2010 (eight years ago), to 25th in 2012 (six years ago), to 35th in 2017. Professor Triggs is correct in pointing out that Australia has "regressed to 46th in the world [2016] and then slightly come back again to the thirties [35th in 2017]." The low point in 2016 was due to Australia's worsening rankings on the measures of economic participation and opportunity for women, and political empowerment — two measures that Professor Triggs specifically highlights. Professor Triggs made her comments in the context of a panel discussion about sexism in the workplace. In reaching a verdict, Fact Check focussed on economic participation and opportunity. Significantly, Australia's ranking for economic participation and opportunity has worsened dramatically in the past six and eight years. It was in 24th position eight years ago and 22nd position six years ago. By 2017 it had slumped to 42nd position. Eight years ago it had closed 72.7 per cent of the gender gap. Six years ago it had closed 72.9 per cent of the gap and by 2017, it had closed it by 73.1 per cent. Notably, Australia closed 74.1 per cent of its gender gap in 2014 and it has not been at that level since. Professor Triggs is also correct in noting that Australia holds a number one ranking, along with other countries, when it comes to educational attainment. Finally, Australia's overall ranking has to be seen in context. According to the World Economic Forum the 2017 global gender gap report showed that slow but steady global progress on improving parity between the sexes came to a halt in 2017, with the global gender gap widening for the first time since 2006.

pomt-02864	"I have returned money every year since taking office."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/15/lynn-westmoreland/westmoreland-says-hes-no-big-spender/	U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, who prides himself on being a fiscal conservative, made an interesting claim about his frugality in one recent article. The Coweta County Republican said his office "runs on as little money as possible to properly serve my constituents, and for that reason I have returned money every year since taking office." The Citizen newspaper reported the comments. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Westmoreland, who’s been in Congress since 2005, is correct about his penny-pinching ways. Westmoreland was responding to questions about staff spending during that October partial government shutdown we’d all like to forget. Westmoreland’s spokeswoman, Leslie Shedd, said the congressman’s claim was correct and sent us an annual breakdown of how much money he has returned to the federal government. Congressional spending has attracted more scrutiny since the shutdown. Two Georgia congressmen, Hank Johnson, D-Lithonia, and Tom Price, R-Roswell, are spending $5,000 or more a month on office space, well more than their colleagues, according to a recent WXIA-TV investigation. Each year, each member of Congress gets between $1 million and $1.9 million from the federal budget to pay their staff and for office space, travel and other expenses. The allocations are called Member’s Representational Allowance, or MRA. The House of Representatives decreased the MRA budget by 5 percent in 2011 and by slightly more than 6 percent in 2012. Westmoreland has received an annual average of nearly $1.4 million. The overwhelming majority of Westmoreland’s spending was on his staff. Here’s Westmoreland’s breakdown of the money he said he’s returned: Year Amount 2005 $53,034 2006 $15,969 2007 $52,570 2008 $41,818 2009 $179,462 2010 $150,005 2011 $143,970 2012 $120,077 The total, Shedd noted, is $756,905. "As a note, as of right now, we plan to return money once again in 2013 -- even though we are dealing with sequester and budget cuts," the spokeswoman said. The House of Representatives keeps track of MRA spending in quarterly reports on its website dating to 2009. Prior spending is recorded in small, thick books kept in some local libraries. PolitiFact Georgia examined Westmoreland’s spending online and looked at some of those books at Emory University’s Woodruff Library. In each year, we found Westmoreland’s expenses were less than his MRA budget. Our calculation showed Westmoreland spent less than his office told us. Experts told us that some office spending in December may not have been included by the end of the year, thus, the difference. The quarterly reports do not include a detailed breakdown of when each expenditure was made. So what happens with the unspent money? "Any unexpended MRA appropriated balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year is available for two additional fiscal years before being returned to the U.S. Treasury as part of returned FY appropriations," according to the House website. We took a look at the other members of Congress from Georgia and each one of them had spent less money in 2012 than was budgeted. Westmoreland spent less than most of his Georgia colleagues in 2012. To sum up, Westmoreland said he has returned money from his allotted budget each year he’s been in office. The numbers he sent -- and that we independently reviewed -- show he makes a good point. Our rating: True.	None	Lynn Westmoreland	None	None	None	2013-11-15T00:00:00	2013-10-16	['None']

Roosevelt strove to import the socialism of Soviet Union dictator Josef Stalin, Broun said. In fact, Broun said, he sent emissaries to learn from the dictator himself. "Franklin Delano Roosevelt sent his advisers, his close-held friends, his Cabinet people, to go visit with Stalin in communist Russia to study what ... Stalin was doing there so that FDR could replicate it here in the United States," Broun said on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. "And he did everything he possibly could to do so." This was like no version of history your PolitiFact Georgia scribes studied. Was Roosevelt in cahoots with Stalin, a murderous despot, to bring communism or socialism to the United States? Certainly, Roosevelt expanded the federal government greatly. He created the popular Social Security program and started the Works Progress Administration, which employed millions in public works projects as wide-ranging as building bridges and documenting folk culture. We contacted Broun’s office and asked for proof. His spokeswoman referred us to "The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression," a 2007 book that is critical of New Dealers. We read it. It does not even suggest Roosevelt sent his aides to Stalin to learn about communism. "The Forgotten Man" does say that some future New Dealers visited the Soviet Union on their own in 1927, more than a year before Roosevelt became governor of New York and some five years before he won the presidency. Some were inspired by Russia in their New Deal work. Its members dubbed the trip "the first non-Communist, unofficial American trade union delegation." The contingent included professors, labor leaders, lawyers and writers. They were not sent by Roosevelt, and the trip took place before Stalin’s purges of the 1930s. "The Forgotten Man’s" author, Amity Shlaes, a senior fellow in economic history at the Council on Foreign Relations, was hesitant to criticize Broun but said his specific claim is not accurate. The trip to the Soviet Union resembled more recent junkets to China, especially those in the 1980s, Shlaes told PolitiFact Georgia. People have been willing to overlook China’s poor human rights record and the lack of democracy out of excitement for the country’s economic possibilities. Russia played that role for the world in the 1920s. "These particular people are not traitors," Shlaes said of the visitors to the Soviet Union. Other experts were more critical of Broun. Thomas Remington, an Emory University professor who has written numerous books and articles on Russian politics, called Broun’s comments a "malicious, scurrilous lie." "It’s so deeply misguided that it is an astonishing statement," Remington told us. Remington said the United States had diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, so American officials in that country did send intelligence to Roosevelt, much as the Central Intelligence Agency does today. As president, Roosevelt had some awareness of Stalin’s brutality, and he was not willing to replicate his approach in the U.S., Remington said. Roosevelt attempted to implement policies to make capitalism stronger, although Remington acknowledged that some thinkers believe those policies "were in small measure, socialism." Susan Butler, author of "My Dear Mr. Stalin: The Complete Correspondence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Joseph V. Stalin," is working on her second book about the relationship between the two men. She called Broun’s claim "a whole bunch of hooey." Butler said none of Roosevelt’s domestic or foreign initiatives aimed to bring socialism to the U.S. The United States needed trade partners as it emerged from the Great Depression and allies to form an international peacekeeping organization after World War II. Roosevelt built a relationship with Stalin to achieve these goals, she said. "This," she said of Broun’s speech on the House floor, "has no relation to the truth." To sum up: The book Broun’s spokeswoman said supported his version of history did not. Its author said she knew of no evidence that Roosevelt sent his aides to study communism in the Soviet Union to "replicate it here in the United States." Future New Dealers did travel to the Soviet Union -- five years before Roosevelt was elected president. Roosevelt did not send them, much less assign them to learn about socialism. At the very least, the claim is inaccurate. Two experts we consulted said it made no sense. Broun needs to brush up on his history before he gives his next lecture. False.

pomt-10071	Geithner's failure to pay self-employment taxes while working for the IMF "is a mistake that is commonly made for people who are working internationally or for international institutions."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/16/barack-obama/Geithner-tax-error/	In the efforts to dismiss Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy Geithner's tax problems as a little more than an embarrassing speed bump on the way to confirmation, supporters have repeatedly characterized his tax error as a common one. Barack Obama made a just such an argument in Geithner's defense on Jan. 14. "Look, is this an embarrassment for him? Yes," Obama told reporters. "He said so himself. But it was an innocent mistake. It is a mistake that is commonly made for people who are working internationally or for international institutions. It has been corrected. He paid the penalties.” Here’s the quickie background: The IRS audited Geithner in 2006 and found that he failed to pay self-employment taxes on compensation he received as an employee of the International Monetary Fund for tax years the IRS was looking at, 2003 and 2004 (by law, the IRS could not audit him for years before 2003). So Geithner paid $16,732 in back self-employment tax, plus interest. The IRS waived penalties for those years. Then in late 2008, when Obama made known his intention to nominate Geithner to his Cabinet, the presidential transition team vetted Geithner and discovered a few more problems in Geithner's tax returns, including the fact that in addition to not paying self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, he also didn't pay them for 2001 and 2002. So in December 2008, Geithner voluntarily amended his tax returns for those years and wrote a check to the IRS for another $25,970. His nomination followed immediately after. The question here is whether Geithner's failure to pay self-employment taxes related to his employment at the IMF was a common problem. By some accounts, it can be confusing for IMF employees to figure out their tax obligation. As an international organization, the IMF is exempt from the FICA and Social Security taxes that most Americans get deducted from their paychecks automatically. U.S. nationals who work for the IMF in the United States are required to pay them on their own, and do so by filing as self-employed taxpayers. "It is a strange situation," said the Tax Policy Center's Eric Toder, who admitted that he has struggled trying to figure out his own tax obligation when he did some consulting work for the IMF. "You wouldn't know from looking at the tax forms what you are supposed to do." Some Republicans note, however, that the IMF gave ample documentation to its workers about what they should do. The Senate Finance Committee overseeing Geithner's confirmation hearing posted several documents given to Geithner by the IMF designed to help employees understand their tax obligations. For one, there's the IMF Employee Tax Manual given to new hires, which describes how to pay self-employment taxes. The IMF pays additional money to U.S. employees, on top of their regular salary, to offset self-employment taxes, and quarterly and year-end wage statements include the amount of self-employment taxes added to wage income. Lastly, IMF employees are required to annually file a form requesting the self-employment "gross ups" to wages. Still, said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, "the rules are just really complicated. I suspect this really was just an honest mistake." The Obama campaign hangs its argument that Geithner's was a "common mistake" on a Nov. 17, 2006, document in which the IRS estimates that as many as half the employees of foreign embassies, foreign consular offices and international organizations who are subject to U.S. tax "either fail to report their wages, claim deductions they are not entitled to, incorrectly establish SEP/IRA retirement plans, fail to pay self-employment tax or fail to file tax returns at all." The IRS offered a one-time settlement to these employees to pay up, with interest. No penalties would be levied, and the IRS said the employees would not be required to pay beyond three years back. Geithner's audit came before that settlement, but since the deal specifically includes employees of international organizations (like the IMF) failing to pay self-employment taxes (as was the case with Geithner), Obama would seem to be on firm footing. But does that 50 percent estimate apply to IMF employees specifically? William Murray, a spokesman for the IMF, doubts it. "There has been no indication of widespread noncompliance by IMF employees," Murray said. There's no question the tax obligations for IMF employees can be confusing, particularly for new hires, Murray said. "Mistakes happen," he said "But not paying taxes? That is not common." It's extremely rare for the IRS to garnish an IMF employee's wages due to failure to pay taxes, Murray said. But other than those being garnished, the IMF has no way of knowing how many others are misreporting their taxes. Geithner's audit, for example, would not have triggered any notification to the IMF, he said. Bottom line: It's impossible to know exactly how many, or what percentage, of the IMF's employees fail to pay their self-employment taxes. You might argue that even if half of the employees at international organizations (IMF or any other) failed to pay self-employment taxes, you would hope the guy heading up the U.S. Treasury would be among the 50 percent to get it right. Nonetheless, the IRS did generally flag employees of international organizations failing to pay self-employment taxes as a problem area. So we think Obama was on pretty firm gound when he called it common. And so we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-01-16T15:21:48	2009-01-14	['None']

pomt-11206	"It begins: California appoints first illegal alien to state office."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/14/breaking-dawn/headline-exaggerates-appointment-undocumented-immi/	A headline exaggerates about a state appointment of an undocumented immigrant in California. "It begins: California appoints first illegal alien to state office -- Trump has a better plan," said a May 10 headline on The Breaking Dawn. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. While the story itself has some accurate information, the headline is misleading. An undocumented immigrant, Lizbeth Mateo, did receive an official appointment by the state of California. But the headline creates a misleading impression by omitting key information about the nature of her post. She is serving in an unpaid position on a 12-member advisory committee, and she wasn’t the first undocumented immigrant to get such an appointment. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Mateo, a 33-year-old Los Angeles attorney, is a well-known immigrant activist. In 2013, she participated in a group called the Dream 9, comprised of undocumented immigrants from Mexico who were raised in the United States. The group left for Mexico and then tried to re-enter the United States by seeking asylum as a protest. Mateo was held at a detention center in Arizona before she was released. We found no contact information on the website of The Breaking Dawn, a site that is supportive of President Donald Trump and includes several stories raising alarm about "illegal aliens." Mateo’s appointment In March, the California Senate Rules Committee appointed Mateo to the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, known as Cal SOAP. The committee advises the California Student Aid Commission on efforts to increase college access for poor students. Mateo didn’t respond to an email and message from PolitiFact, but she told the media in a March statement that "while undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made." Appointees serve at the pleasure of the Senate Rules Committee, so she will serve until she is replaced or steps down, said Dan Reeves, chief of staff to Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León. Mateo was appointed one day after Trump visited California and slammed the state’s sanctuary policies. The Sacramento Bee reported that Mateo was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, and came to the United States with her parents when she was 14. She graduated from Santa Clara University School of Law in 2016 and passed the California bar exam the next year. (Undocumented immigrants are allowed to apply for the bar in California.) The Senate initially announced that the appointment was a first for the state, but Senate officials later clarified that, in 2016, Gov. Jerry Brown named a student in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to the California State University Board of Trustees. Reeves said that he believes Mateo is the first undocumented immigrant not protected by DACA to receive a statewide appointment. Mateo told NPR that when she applied for DACA, the Obama administration wanted her to explain why she left the country during the Dream 9 protest. She said the administration denied her DACA application. Some California lawmakers want to increase civic participation of undocumented immigrants. If it passes, SB 174 would allow for all California residents, including undocumented immigrants, to receive appointments to state and local boards and commissions that are not merely advisory. Mateo was appointed to an advisory committee, so SB 174 would not affect that appointment, said Michael Soller, spokesman for state Sen. Ricardo Lara, a sponsor of the bill. Our ruling A headline said, "It begins: California appoints first illegal alien to state office." Mateo is an undocumented immigrant and did receive a state appointment. But the headline doesn’t fully capture her role: she will serve in an unpaid position on a 12-member advisory committee about improving college access for poor families. Also, although the state Senate initially said Mateo’s appoint was a first, it later found that the governor had appointed another undocumented immigrant to a state board in 2016. The other immigrant had federal protection from deportations, while Mateo does not. We rate this headline Half True.

pomt-06392	Wisconsin’s concealed-carry permit rules demand more proof than other states that safety training requirements are met, rendering "all existing (training) certificates insufficient" as part of the permit application	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/31/national-rifle-association/nra-says-wisconsins-concealed-carry-permit-rules-r/	Firearm-rights advocates were thrilled in July 2011 when Wisconsin passed a concealed-carry law described as the fifth-best in the U.S. from their viewpoint. At the time, the state was one of only two that did not allow people to carry concealed weapons. But folks on both sides of the expressed concerns while awaiting detailed rules on how to get a permit. The law takes effect Nov. 1, 2011. The NRA was upset at rumors that Wisconsin’s Department of Justice would require live-fire training and mandate at least four hours of safety instruction overall. Meanwhile, critics feared that online video courses might be deemed enough to get a permit. Some of those rumors were unfounded -- permit applicants need not fire a gun (as in Minnesota), and training must be face-to-face with a certified instructor. The four-hour length was approved, though, in the emergency rulesissued by Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen. Nevertheless, despite the specific rules that drew criticism from gun advocates, Wisconsin’s overall law is still in the Top 10 for ease of access to permits, according to Nik Clark, head of Wisconsin Carry Inc., a nonprofit gun-rights organization. Something little discussed in the back-and-forth was the fact that applicants can get permits even if their training was years ago. And that’s where the National Rifle Association comes in. The NRA remains unhappy about an issue related to proving an applicant has received past training. In a lobbying alert to its members on Oct.15, 2011, the group’s legislative arm said the state Justice Department overstepped by requiring too much information on the certificates needed as proof of firearms safety training. "No training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands," the NRA alert said. "This renders all existing certificates insufficient for submission with a citizen’s license application. DOJ could have easily established a system that would have allowed existing training certificates to be submitted while ensuring that the requirements of the concealed weapons law are met." The NRA contends some would-be applicants will be discouraged, or will not be able to track down their instructors to get the required proof (for instance, if an instructor died or moved away). It argues in those cases applicants will have to get retrained because of DOJ’s "demands." What are those demands, and are they unique to the Wisconsin rules? The NRA could not provide a state-by-state comparison to back up its claim, so we did a brief survey of states based on governmental and private research. We also interviewed firearms safety trainers. So let’s get armed with some facts. We will not focus on what proof is needed in the case of military, law enforcement or security firearms training, or hunter education courses. The dispute is over proof of training run by groups such as the NRA and other state and national organizations. In that case, the DOJ rules require: A signed statement from the instructor confirming graduation from a course that meets Wisconsin’s general requirements (no specific curriculum is mandated as in some states). The name, address and phone number of the instructor or organization, the name of the course and where and when it was held. The name of the organization that certified the instructor. The length of the course. Based on our check of permit rules around the country, it’s not hard to find states that require some of the same things Wisconsin requires. We learned of certificates of training that required confirmation of the course length (Missouri); the instructor’s name and signature (Michigan, Florida, Minnesota); and a statement attesting to the course meeting state law (Michigan) -- the same things Wisconsin requires. And it’s not hard to find states that seek similar items -- Utah requires instructors to stamp the application, for instance. On the other hand, we could find no state that required all of what Wisconsin is seeking. The instructor contact information, in particular, is unusual on the graduation certificate. Some states -- not including Wisconsin -- directly certify instructors and their courses, giving them access to the same information. "You’re on your own over there," said Gary Shade, of Shade’s Landing, a personal protection and firearms training company in Apple Valley, Minnesota. In addition to Shade, we spoke with Bill Schmitz, of BDJ, Ltd. in Redgranite, Wis.; Tim Grant, of American Association of Certified Firearms Instructors; and Michael Bender of the Personal Protection Academy in Madison. All said they would have to re-do their certificates because of the Wisconsin rules. Some complained about it; others said it was no big deal. The proof requirements directly affect NRA trainers, who along with instructors from other organizations will have to re-work and re-issue their graduation certificates to meet the specific Wisconsin rules, our research found. This summer, after the law passed but before Van Hollen’s rule came out in October, some people jumped the gun and got trained with less than four hours of instruction or got trained through online courses, according to our interviews with several training companies. Others got enough training but were handed certificates that don’t include all the required information. There is time and expense involved for trainees and instructors in going back at this. Van Hollen says the rules are reasonable and an anti-fraud move. "The DOJ’s requirements for training certificates allow instructors to verify that the permit applicant named on the certificate actually took the course," DOJ spokeswoman Dana Brueck told us. "Given the Legislature required ‘proof’ of training, it only makes sense to have the instructor sign the document." Brueck said the course location verifies the training was face to face. A final point: We found that evaluating the NRA assertion that "no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands" is a matter of how you read the statement. Does the group mean nobody else asks for "any" of the information Wisconsin does, or that, taken as a whole, no other state seeks all of what we do? NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said it was the latter. Our conclusion The NRA claimed that "no training certificates anywhere in the country contain the information that the Wisconsin DOJ demands." We found elements in common with what other states require, as well as some that appear to be unique to Wisconsin’s rules on certificates. We think it’s reasonable to interpret the NRA claim as meaning no other state asks for as much as we do on the certificate, so that part of the statement is basically accurate with some clarification. The group also said the DOJ rules render all existing graduation certificates "insufficient for submission with a citizen’s license application." There’s ample evidence that is true for courses run by organizations such as the NRA. The NRA’s overall point is a technical one, but requires some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05175	Sherrod Brown "gave huge bonuses to executives."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/15/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-campaign-says-sherrod-brown-gave-huge-/	Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican hoping to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown from the U.S. Senate in November, mixes attacks on Brown with promotion of his own candidacy in his 30-second TV ad "Change." Brown "gave huge bonuses to executives," the announcer and onscreen graphic say. PolitiFact Ohio checked out the ad’s claim. The ad cites Brown's Feb. 13, 2009, vote on H.R. 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus. It also cites a March 17, 2009, article in The New York Times about the outcry over disclosures that the American International Group paid $165 million in bonuses. The story does not mention Brown. When PolitiFact Ohio contacted Mandel's campaign, also cited a Fox Business story that the stimulus legislation allowed firms like AIG, which had received funds through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to give out executive bonuses that had been agreed on prior to the bill becoming law. President George W. Bush pressed Congress to approve TARP to rescue the financial industry and avert what many feared could be a doomsday economic collapse. The Senate approved it 74-25 on Oct. 1., 2008. Brown and Ohio's then-Sen. George Voinovich were among the the 39 Democrats, 34 Republicans and one independent senator who voted for it. Mandel has been publicly critical of Brown’s vote for TARP, which Mandel says he would have opposed. But the root of the statement that Brown "gave huge bonuses to executives" isn’t in TARP. It is a provision of the stimulus legislation that allowed the AIG bonuses. The final stimulus bill included restrictions on bonuses that were less stringent than those in an earlier version of the legislation. The earlier Senate version of the stimulus bill, which Brown voted for, would have capped executive pay and forbidden any firm that received TARP funds from giving out bonuses. No such restriction was in the version passed by the House. When the two versions went to closed-door conference negotiations to work out a final compromise, the ban was rewritten to allow bonuses be paid on contracts signed before the bill's passage. That means bonuses that the companies, negotiating with their employees, had already approved. Then-Sen. Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democratic who was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote the amendment in the first Senate version of the stimulus bill that would have banned all bonuses. He said his amendment was altered before final passage at the request of the White House and the Treasury Department. "At the time," the Wall Street Journal reported, "few objected to that move, which was designed to ensure the measure was constitutional." So where does that leave the Mandel claim? Brown did vote for the final version of the stimulus bill. But to label the stimulus bill as a vote to give "huge bonuses to executives" isn’t just inaccurate and misleading, it’s ridiculous. Brown, in fact, had voted to ban all bonuses, but that ban was loosened in House-Senate negotiations before the final version was enacted. The legislation prohibited use of federal money for future bonuses. But the bill did not enable bonus-paying that would not have existed otherwise. More importantly, while the bill did not prevent the AIG bonuses, it is not accurate to say that the bill -- or Brown -- "gave" anything. AIG gave the bonuses to its executives before the stimulus legislation was approved. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim that Brown "huge bonuses to executives" rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-03800	Says "PPS employees have paid their own PERS contributions for many years."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/26/portland-public-schools/do-portland-public-schools-employees-pick-their-sh/	A reader alerted PolitiFact Oregon to a Portland Public Schools Board newsletter from January highlighting actions Oregon’s largest school district has taken to reduce spending. "Our budget reflects years of rear-guard action to protect teaching positions from state funding cuts," read the letter signed by members of the school board. "For example, we have reduced the cost of pensions for all employee groups – PPS employees have paid their own PERS contributions for many years." The reader asked us to investigate this claim, as she was surprised to learn that Portland Public Schools employees pay into their retirement. Most public employers in Oregon pay the 6 percent employer share, as well as the 6 percent employee share, into the worker’s retirement plan. The "employee pickup" infuriates Republicans and others who say public employee retirement benefits in Oregon are too generous and put other public services at risk. The analysis: We shot off an email to the Portland Schools spokesman. He returned with this response: "Per Resolution #5745, board meeting held on 11/21/1994, contributions would be paid by employee effective for any wage payment made on or after 1/1/1995," wrote Matt Shelby. "So, prior to 1/1/95 PPS did pick up the 6 percent PERS contribution. After that, it was on the employee." Now, we should note that in November 1994, voters narrowly approved Ballot Measure 8, which required public employees pay their share into retirement. The proposal was later invalidated by the Oregon Supreme Court, but in response some government bodies made plans to increase workers’ pay to offset the pension pickup. That’s what happened in Portland schools. Employees started paying their own retirement contributions in 1995; in exchange they received a 6 percent salary increase. The district continues to pick up the 6 percent employer share. Portland Public Schools is in the minority when it comes to the pickup. According to a 2010 PERS report, about 70 percent of active workers have their share of the pickup paid by the employer. State government does that for 100 percent of its employees. Cities and counties for 85 percent of workers. School districts pick up the employee share for only 55 percent of its workers -- the lowest of any employer group. The ruling: Portland schools employees have paid the employee share of PERS pickup for years. They received a salary increase in order to do so. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07918	Says Texas ranks 44th nationally in education funding per pupil.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/31/wendy-davis/state-sen-wendy-davis-says-texas-ranks-44th-educat/	In a Jan. 19 press release objecting to possible state budget cuts, state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, said "education funding should be our highest priority." "Under current funding levels, Texas is already near the bottom in education funding per pupil (Texas ranks 44th nationally), " she said. Responding to our request for backup, Davis spokesman Anthony Spangler pointed us to "Texas on the Brink," a 2009 compilation of Texas statistics prepared by then-state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso. One entry, citing the National Education Association, ranked Texas 44th in per-student education expenditures. The Legislative Budget Board’s 2010 "Texas Fact Book" similarly quotes the analysis placing Texas 44th. According to a December report from the association, which describes itself as the nation’s largest teachers union, in 2009-10 Texas ranked 37th among the states and the District of Columbia in state and local funds spent per student in public school, averaging $9,227. But the state ranked 44th in 2008-09, according to the report, averaging $8,610. That year, the top-spending state, New Jersey, averaged $16,253, and the lowest-spending state, Arizona, averaged $5,932. The national average: $10,313. Spangler told us Davis wasn’t aware of the 2009-10 ranking when she made her statement. According to NEA’s report, it bases its rankings on analyzing expenditure and fall enrollment data gathered from each state’s education department. The report, "Rankings & Estimates," has this caveat: "Each state’s department of education has its own system of accounting and reporting. ... As a result, it is not always possible to obtain completely comparable data for every state." To adjust for such differences, the report says, NEA solicits clarifications from the departments. Texas’ clarification: The number of elementary students includes sixth-graders, while secondary school covers upper grades. Next, we looked for other estimates of per-pupil spending. The Federal Education Budget Project, part of the Washington-based New America Foundation, a nonpartisan public policy institute, ranked Texas 43rd in public education spending per student for the 2007-08 school year, averaging $8,350. Jennifer Cohen, an education analyst for the foundation, told us the project tapped data from the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Education, to build its rankings. Among the states, according to the foundation, Utah spent the least per pupil in 2007-08 — $5,978 — while New Jersey spent the most, $17,620, New York was second, followed by Alaska and Connecticut. Such rankings fail to reflect all school spending, according to David Guenthner, a spokesman at the conservative Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation. He told us the rankings typically exclude school expenses such as debt service and capital costs, such asconstruction projects, which would drive up per-student expenditures. Guenthner pointed us to a March 2010 report by the Washington-based Cato Institute, a Libertarian research foundation. The report reviewed 2008-09 budgets for districts in the nation’s five largest cities, including Houston, concluding that average per-pupil spending was 44 percent higher than is otherwise reported by public schools. Separately, Frank Johnson, an NCES statistician, told us the center doesn’t take into account capital outlays in estimating per-pupil spending because such costs can create false assumptions about what’s spent on instructional programs, school supplies and teachers. At our request, though, Cohen created a table ranking states by their spending both on school operations and capital costs. In 2007-08, her table shows, Texas spent an average of $10,662 per pupil, ranking 36th nationally. In 2006-07, Texas ranked 39th, spending an average of $9,825. All told, it’s clear that rankings vary by year and methodology. Yet Texas has consistently trailed most states in per-pupil education spending. According to the approach cited by the senator, Texas ranked 37th in 2009-10, improving from 44th place the year before. By other measures for recent years, Texas has placed as low as 43rd and, rolling in capital costs, as high as 36th. We rate the senator’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-02917	"The insurance companies are making that choice (to cancel or change policies), not the president."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/03/ezekiel-emanuel/ezekiel-emanuel-says-insurance-companies-canceling/	"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it," is an oft-repeated claim from Affordable Care Act proponents. Most recently, the point sparked a lively debate on Fox News Sunday between Ezekiel Emanuel, a former health care adviser to President Barack Obama, and James Capretta, a conservative health policy expert. "The president said you could keep your plan," Capretta said, arguing that Obama hasn’t been upfront about cancellation notices. Pressed by Capretta and host Chris Wallace, Emanuel offered a counterpoint designed to shift blame from the law to insurance companies themselves. "No, the insurance companies are making that choice, not the president," he said. "The law does not require that." Capretta and Emanuel reiterated different versions of their opposing points for the entire 15-minute segment. The debate got so heated that Wallace quipped, "Maybe I’ll stop calling you gentlemen." At PunditFact, we wanted to spell out how the law affects existing plans. As we’ve noted before, the Affordable Care Act has certain standards for what qualifies as comprehensive health care coverage. Outlined in section 1302(a) of the document on page 163, these 10 "essential health benefits" include emergency services, maternity care and mental health care. If policyholders bought plans before Obama signed his reform into law on March 23, 2010, they’re considered "grandfathered in." They can keep their plans, so long as those plans don’t change much. However, insurance companies that don’t provide people with all of the benefits listed cannot market those plans to new consumers. That’s leading to insurance companies ending a lot of their grandfathered plans, which won’t be as profitable long-term without the potential attraction of new buyers. Many of the roughly 14 million people who buy their insurance individually (which means not through an employer) are receiving cancellation notices as insurers end those grandfathered plans. Emanuel’s claim indicates that blame for these plan cancellations technically falls on insurance companies, not Obama and legislators. In an email we received from him after we initially published our report, he emphasized that it's the insurers who are taking action to end the policies. How often do these types of cancellations happen? The fact is, there’s not good data available on the number of individual, non-employer cancellations, so it’s impossible to say how many health policies are canceled in a normal year versus in 2013, said Alan Sager, a Boston University public health professor who favors Obamacare. "Some of them may be doing that because they know it’s good business to get into compliance with the law’s requirements earlier," Sager said. "They may believe that offering better benefits gives them a competitive advantage." That said, it’s hard to argue that a sweeping health care reform law has no impact on changing behaviors of insurance companies in the absence of data. One of the law’s intentions is to raise the bar for basic health benefits offered to consumers, so it’s no surprise that individual policyholders with less comprehensive plans are finding themselves with cancellation notices. Our ruling Ezekiel’s assertion that the law doesn’t require insurance companies to cancel plans hinges on a technicality. It is up to insurers how they comply with the law, which mandates that policyholders be covered for 10 "essential health benefits," except for plans that are grandfathered in. But there’s little doubt the new law is influencing their changes in coverage. The law was designed to eventually do away with insurance that doesn't meet minimum coverage standards. We rate Ezekiel’s claim Mostly False. Editor's note: This report has been updated to include a response we got from Emanuel after our initial publication.

pomt-10652	"Sen. McCain says it was not a mistake to vote against the Bush tax cuts ... but now says the tax cuts need to be made permanent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/03/mitt-romney/yes-mccain-switched/	Invoking an issue that strikes a chord with many New Hampshire voters, Mitt Romney is charging John McCain flip-flopped on tax cuts. He says McCain broke with conservative orthodoxy by voting against President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax changes. He has made the charge in news releases, speeches and, most recently, in a new ad on his Web site. You can see it here. Romney's charge, designed to raise questions with the GOP base about McCain's conservative credentials at a time when he is moving up in the polls, might resonate in the antitax state, which has neither a general sales tax nor a personal income tax. We find Romney is accurately summarizing McCain's record, though he is omitting some important details. McCain has long cultivated a reputation as a "straight talk" fiscal conservative, saying that tax cuts must be matched by spending cuts. In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package that marked Bush's first big legislative achievement after initially supporting an alternative plan that had tighter spending limits. Two years later, McCain opposed $350-billion in additional tax cuts, saying he couldn't support cutting taxes in the face of unknown war costs. "No one can be expected to make an informed decision about fiscal policy at this time," McCain said. "Let us wait until we have succeeded in Iraq." McCain also said he wouldn't support any spending increases that weren't related to defense or homeland security. But in 2006, McCain voted to extend the Bush tax cuts for five years, saying not to do so would be tantamount to raising taxes at a time when the economy was sputtering. At the time, McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because "American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect." In an interview on Fox News on Dec. 28, 2007, he expressed no regrets about his tax votes against Bush. He said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts, but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent. "I had significant tax cuts, and there was restraint of spending included in my proposal," McCain said during the appearance on Hannity & Colmes. "I saw no restraint in spending. We presided over the greatest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. Spending went completely out of control. It's still out of control. Wasteful earmark spending is a disgrace, and it caused us to alienate our Republican base. So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases. But, look, if we had gotten spending under control, we'd be talking about more tax cuts today." Romney's charges must be giving McCain an uneasy sense of deja vu. The veteran senator is eager to avoid a repeat of the 2000 presidential race, when conservative interest groups questioned his loyalty to their causes and barraged him with negative ads. McCain has frequently played up his fiscal conservative credentials, particularly his crusades against earmarks in spending bills and his opposition to the expensive Medicare prescription drug benefit. He has responded by calling Romney a flip-flopper on taxes and other issues, but the fact remains: McCain voted the way Romney says. We find Romney's claim to be True.

pomt-01879	"Expanding Medicaid would create 63k jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/09/charlie-crist/not-expanding-medicaid-florida-missing-out-63800-j/	The White House has new ammunition for those fighting for Medicaid expansion: It would create jobs. The study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers — titled "Missed Opportunities" — provides a state-by-state analysis of how many jobs would be created by expanding Medicaid. The number for Florida: 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017. The study is part of the Obama administration’s promotion of the Affordable Care Act, which includes the federal government picking up the initial tab for Medicaid expansion. Democrats including former Gov. Charlie Crist are using the study to attack Scott for Florida’s decision not to expand Medicaid. Crist is expected to win his primary and face Scott in November. "Expanding Medicaid would create 63k jobs -- but Rick Scott still won’t do it," Crist said on Twitter July 2. Florida’s Republican-led Legislature opposes expanding Medicaid. Scott once opposed it, too, but switched positions in 2013 and now supports it. Supporters of the expansion say Scott hasn’t done enough to turn the Legislature around. Here, though, we wanted to focus on jobs. Would expanding Medicaid create 63,000 jobs? White House study Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility and agreed to pay 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The expansion would have covered an additional 848,000 Floridians. Studies predicting job growth are based on the idea that as states expand Medicaid, new patients will access medical services they haven’t in the past. Extra revenue will allow health care facilities to hire new workers. The new study relies on previous studies, including one about the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which some residents got Medicaid through a lottery. Research showed people in Medicaid got preventative tests such as mammograms, cholesterol screening and pap smears compared to the control group. The White House predicts that Medicaid expansion would allow tens of thousands of Floridians to get those preventative tests. If Florida expanded Medicaid, it would get $15 billion from the federal government between 2014 and 2016. That would lead to 63,800 cumulative "job years" between 2014-17. It defines a "job year" as one person employed for one year. The study focuses on short-term job growth -- not what would happen to jobs over the long-term. The report briefly touches on the possibility that access to Medicaid could cause some people to work less or not at all -- while healthier, less financially stressed people might work more. It cites one study that found Medicaid enrollment had a statistically insignificant impact on labor supply, while other research found reductions in labor supply. Other studies on expanding Medicaid in Florida have arrived at different numbers. The Florida Hospital Association’s most recent analysis in 2013 predicts 120,000 jobs each year over about a decade -- the association supports expansion. Moody’s, a financial analysis firm that doesn’t have a position on the health care law, last year predicted Medicaid expansion would create 10,000 to 30,000 jobs in Florida. Kaiser Family Foundation summarized 32 studies Medicaid expansion in various states including Florida and predicted that it will have a positive effect on jobs over the next decade. Experts offer caveats or criticisms of report Many experts we interviewed generally agreed that the federal government pumping more money into the state to expand Medicaid would lead to new jobs, though they cautioned it’s difficult to pinpoint a number. "It is next to impossible to know exactly how many jobs (or which jobs) are created by a policy like this, given the many other changes in the landscape," said Harvard professor of health economics Katherine Baicker. While the federal government picks up the initial expansion costs, in later years the states will have to contribute. That will "wreak havoc" on long-term state budgets because state spending on Medicaid is forecasted to outpace state tax revenues, said Dan White, who authored the Moody’s report. Ultimately it’s a judgment call by elected officials if the cost of expansion 10 years down the line is worth the number of jobs it will provide, he said. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, says the report ignores one side of the equation. "What about tax money Floridians have to pay into the system because we are spending more money on Medicaid? What about jobs lost because of that?" We asked Scott’s campaign for his opinion about the jobs’ report and got back a statement that didn’t address our question. Our ruling Crist said, "Expanding Medicaid would create 63k jobs." A study released by the White House said federal dollars that Florida would have gotten to expand Medicaid would create 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017. Most of the health care experts we interviewed agreed that injecting billions of federal dollars into Florida for Medicaid would spark some job growth, but it’s difficult to pinpoint a number, particularly as there are other changes in the health care landscape. Other studies have found numbers as high as 120,000 and as low as 10,000. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-07-09T12:42:02	2014-07-02	['None']

pomt-05342	The salaries of Wisconsin’s best-educated public school teachers were "slashed" by Gov. Scott Walker through a recent administrative rule change.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/13/chain-email/email-says-rule-change-gov-scott-walker-slashed-sa/	Under Gov. Scott Walker’s 2011 changes to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees, teachers and many other public workers are now paying more for pensions and health care. But a chain email making the rounds alleges that Walker quietly -- and drastically -- cut salaries even more for the best-educated teachers in April 2012 with the stroke of a pen that changed an administrative rule. The claim made the rounds after a highly confusing episode in which Walker reshaped a rule, thereby lowering by some 30 percent the inflation-based raises that public unions can negotiate under Act 10, which included Walker’s limits on unions. The rule change would not use an individual's actual salary as a "base salary" to calculate raises and would exclude factors such as whether a teacher has a graduate degree, the Journal Sentinel reported on April 20, 2012. Days later, the chain email began -- subject line: Scott Walker and Max teacher Pay -- making the rounds. It echoed allegations by a top labor leader, Marty Beil, that Walker’s rule went even further -- actually drastically cutting the base salaries in question. Readers asked us to get to the bottom of the email, which began: "I have some heart-stopping news that I believe has devastating consequences for all active and retired public employees." The email said the rule would prohibit school districts from including add-on pay for advanced degrees in the wage scales written into any of its labor contracts. It claimed teachers would be hit the hardest, even providing an example -- Sarah Teacher. "Let’s say Sarah Teacher has a Masters degree, 24 hours of college credit and 12 years experience. The most Sarah can be paid under her current contract is $52,927. "Under the new rule, the maximum Sarah will be able to earn in future contracts is $38,167, the maximum for a teacher who has the minimum educational requirements but many years of experience." The email claimed Sarah Teacher's salary will be "slashed by a third" -- perhaps even more as cash-strapped districts squeeze staff even tighter. What’s really going on? Walker’s union legislation blocks school districts from including educational add-on pay in labor contracts. So it wasn’t the more recent rule change that did that. In addition, there is no dispute the rule change limits the size of the pool for wage increases that school districts and unions will negotiate over. So, in this item, we’ll focus on the heart of the email’s claim -- that Walker’s action mandated big pay cuts for teachers. We talked to lawyers with the employment relations commission, which approved Walker’s modification of the rule. We also consulted with a labor lawyer and examined statements by labor officials. They all agreed: The rule does not cut the current wages of teachers -- or require or direct that to happen. The power to set salaries lies with local school districts, not Walker or the employment relations commission. Some argue the rule makes it much easier for local districts to make big cuts. This comes down to where the starting point is set for public employees. Act 10 prohibited bargaining over pay schedules -- those grids that award teachers additional pay based on higher education and seniority. It left intact bargaining over inflationary increases to base wages -- the salary level not including educational bonuses and other add-ons. The first version of the rule -- before Walker’s changes -- made clear that a teacher’s current total salary would be the starting point. Walker’s changes in the rule put that in doubt, with experts disagreeing on how this will play out. Some say the new rule makes it easier for school officials to cut into existing salaries without any collective bargaining. But they say districts also will be free -- outside of narrow labor talks on inflationary raises -- to give teachers additional pay for higher education outside any labor contract. That could make teachers "whole" if districts chose on their own, outside of labor talks, to honor previous pay for higher education. The other camp says the new rule does not mean current salaries can be ignored when unions sit down with management to discuss wages. Eventually, the employment relations commission or a court will likely have to settle that issue, which also affects technical college teachers. Our conclusion A chain email says an administrative rule modified by Gov. Scott Walker amounted to him slashing teacher salaries. We can’t predict the future, so there is no way to know how individual districts will approach teacher pay in the years ahead under this rule and Act 10. But it’s clear that the rule Walker reshaped does not give him authority over base pay, and does not mandate pay cuts for teachers. We rate that claim False.

pomt-05335	Says Marcy Kaptur has attacked his military service and training in the Air Force, showing disrespect for veterans.	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/may/15/samuel-wurzelbacher/samuel-joe-plumber-wurzelbacher-says-marcy-kaptur-/	Soon after his 2008 televised tax policy confrontation with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama made Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher a focus of presidential campaign rhetoric, Wurzelbacher made the wrenching discovery that notoriety can bring scrutiny. Not a week passed before media across the country were reporting that Wurzelbacher lacks a plumbing license. Wurzelbacher told his hometown newspaper, the Toledo Blade, that he was working under the plumbing license of his employer, A. W. Newell Corp., and was allowed to do so as long as the licensed contractor was working on the same site. The newspaper said that Wurzelbacher is "not registered to operate as a plumber in Ohio, which means he is not a plumber." Now Wurzelbacher is the GOP candidate for a congressional seat currently occupied by Toledo Democrat Marcy Kaptur, and Kaptur’s campaign has flushed out the old reports about Wurzelbacher’s lack of plumbing credentials. For months, Kaptur’s team has told reporters that Wurzelbacher isn’t a plumber, a charge that doesn’t sit well with Wurzelbacher. That has prompted Wurzelbacher to claim that Kaptur is disrespecting his military service and training in the Air Force, showing disrespect for veterans. Wurzelbacher plunged forward with that line of attack in a news release May 3 in which his campaign urged Kaptur to support a bill sponsored by Columbus-area GOP Rep. Steve Stivers, which would require states to consider military training when certifying truck drivers, registered nurses and emergency medical technicians. Stivers’ bill would not affect plumbers. The news release charged that "Marcy has recently been attacking Joe’s military service and his training in the Air Force." In April 2012 RedState.com published a column by Wurzelbacher titled "Why Doesn’t Marcy Kaptur Respect Veterans?" In his essay, Wurzelbacher said that Kaptur’s proposal for a Veterans Jobs Corps to employ 20,000 veterans in projects to restore public lands, would reject their military training and instead "turn them into federally employed landscapers and groundskeepers." "Kaptur and her campaign staff certainly don’t respect my own military training," Wurzelbacher’s column continued. "That’s obvious from the way they call me a ‘faux’ plumber. Are all our other veterans ‘fake’ in their jobs, too? Marcy’s campaign has denied my military experience several times before, each time proving that she and her staff don’t respect veterans and our military experience." Wurzelbacher’s campaign put out a news release in October 2011 titled "Marcy Kaptur Disrespects Service of Military Veteran." Although Kaptur and her campaign spokesman Steve Fought hadn’t ever mentioned Wurzelbacher’s military record in questioning his lack of plumbing credentials, the news release accused the pair of "maligning" Wurzelbacher’s "record of military service and hard work." It said Wurzelbacher learned to be a plumber during a four year Air Force stint, and that he "legally worked as a plumber for numerous plumbing companies in the Toledo area" after leaving the military. In a series of email exchanges, Wurzelbacher’s campaign did not provide instances in which Kaptur and Fought specifically maligned their candidate’s military service, apart from claiming that he isn’t actually a plumber. They contend that by saying Wurzelbacher isn’t a plumber, Fought and Kaptur are saying that his training is non-existent or inadequate. And because Wurzelbacher got that training in the Air Force, Wurzelbacher’s camp contends that claiming Wurzelbacher isn’t a plumber constitutes an attack on his military training. Although Kaptur and Fought have repeatedly denied that Wurzelbacher’ is a plumber, they haven’t alluded to his military service or training in any interviews with The Plain Dealer since Wurzelbacher announced his candidacy last year. We did not find that they’d issued comments of that nature to other media outlets. "I never said anything about military service not qualifying him to be a plumber," said Fought. "It has to do with his licensure. A plumber is someone who has a license. Otherwise, he is just an average homeowner trying to get that snake down there. He says he learned how to do it in the military, but this has nothing to do with the military. It has everything to do with the fact that he doesn’t have a plumber’s license." Ohio’s Department of Commerce confirmed that Wurzelbacher does not have a state plumbing contractor’s license. Toledo’s chief plumbing inspector, Joe Romp, said his city hasn’t issued a plumbing license, either. Becoming a plumber in Ohio, Romp said, requires completion of a three to five year apprenticeship, which includes classroom training and passing a rigorous test. Romp said Wurzelbacher would not be permitted to do plumbing work in Toledo itself because he is not officially a plumbing apprentice, journeyman or contractor. "You could get a handyman to install a water heater or change out a toilet, but is he going to call himself a plumber based on that?" asked Romp. "Hardly." In parts of Lucas County such as Holland Township, where Wurzelbacher resides, people without plumbing licenses are allowed to work on plumbing jobs as long as they are supervised by a state-licensed contractor, said Lucas County permit specialist Gail Nix. Wurzelbacher worked in that capacity while employed by A. W. Newell Corp. We’re not making the final call on whether Wurzelbacher should call himself "Joe the Plumber." Wurzelbacher’s campaign cites his work as an Air Force plumber from 1992 to 1996. But since leaving the military he has not secured a civilian plumbing license. Plenty of other professions - such as commercial truck driving - require people with military training to secure a civilian license before they can ply their trade. That’s the basis for the Kaptur campaign’s criticism. But questioning his licensure credentials is a far cry from impugning Wurzelbacher’s military service. Training in the military aside, Ohio requires a plumber to have a license, which Wurzelbacher does not have. Given that is the case, we think it’s beyond False to say that claiming he is not a plumber somehow diminishes his military experience and shows disrespect for veterans, as Wurzelbacher claimed.

pomt-11902	"The KKK was founded as the military arm of the Democratic Party."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/23/dane-county-republican-party/debunking-claim-kkk-was-founded-military-arm-democ/	The Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacy group, has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the most infamous — and oldest — of American hate groups. The group’s heyday may be over, but controversy over Confederate monuments has brought the group back into the spotlight. The debate over Confederate symbols and monuments was reignited in June 2015, after Dylann Roof killed nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church in an attempt to "start a race war." There are numerous photos on the Internet showing Roof’s car with an ornamental Confederate license plate and Roof holding the Confederate flag. One month after the shooting, the Confederate flag was removed from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds and the issue receded. It escalated again Aug. 12, 2017, when a group of about 50 Ku Klux Klan members and other white nationalists rallied to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park in Charlottesville, Va. The white nationalists were met by a crowd of about 1,000 counter-protesters. After the rally dispersed, a car plowed into a group near the city’s downtown mall, killing a 32-year-old woman. Two weeks later, on Aug. 26, 2017, a Baltimore man identified as a Klan imperial wizard was arrested and charged with firing a gun during the rally. It was in this atmosphere that Madison Mayor Paul Soglin announced the removal of two Confederate memorials from the city’s Forest Hill Cemetery. A total of 140 Confederate soldiers -- prisoners of war who died at Camp Randall -- are buried in the cemetery. After the announcement, a ground-level "Confederate Rest" plaque installed in 1981 was removed. The fate of a larger, 4-foot tall monument installed in 1931 has been referred to the Common Council, while the debate over what to do with it continues. Soglin’s initial order prompted a news release from the Republican Party of Dane County, in which Chairman Scott Grabins scolded Soglin for an "antiseptic wipe to the memory of American voters." The Aug. 25, 2017 release went on to cite various historical instances where Democrats opposed civil rights initiatives, ending the list with this assertion: "The KKK was founded as the military arm of the Democratic Party." When asked to back up the party’s claim, Grabins said the history of the Klan is well-known and cited the History.com website’s entry on the KKK. Let’s go to the history books. Klan history According to a History.com entry on the Klan: Founded in 1866, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) extended into almost every southern state by 1870 and became a vehicle for white southern resistance to the Republican Party’s Reconstruction-era policies aimed at establishing political and economic equality for blacks. Its members waged an underground campaign of intimidation and violence directed at white and black Republican leaders. Though Congress passed legislation designed to curb Klan terrorism, the organization saw its primary goal – the reestablishment of white supremacy – fulfilled through Democratic victories in state legislatures across the South in the 1870s. Historians weigh in James Marten, an author and chairman of the history department at Marquette University, disputed the Dane County GOP claim the Klan was "founded" as the military arm of the Democratic party. "It was at its simplest a secret fraternal organization, but it very quickly became an organization dedicated to preserving white supremacy and intimidating African Americans," he said. "They and other groups like them broke up schools, torched houses, and interfered with black social and church gatherings. "And, along with those other groups as well as individuals and gangs, committed thousands of acts of terror, violence, and murder throughout the South. However, the early Klan — the founding generation of the Klan — really only lasted into the 1870s before it was driven underground, and it was not an overtly political organization." Eric Foner, a Columbia University history professor, noted the Klan was a "military force." "In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party, the planter class, and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy," he said. "Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society." But serving the interests of the party is not the same as being part of the party. Consider the political landscape today, where super PACs and other entities work outside the formal party structure. In a June 10, 2013, PolitiFact Virginia article, Carole Emberton, associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo, noted that the "party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today." "Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964," she said. "By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century." Our rating The Republican Party of Dane County claimed "the KKK was founded as the military arm of the Democratic Party." There is little doubt that the political interests of the Klan and the Democratic Party, at least in the early years, intersected. But there is no evidence that it was founded as part of the Democratic Party, or that the party ever even had an official "military arm." If a Democrat today claimed the KKK is the military arm of the Republican Party, we’d have a similar point of view. We rate the claim False.

pomt-13878	"Cincinnati is already one of the biggest cities in the country to run 100 percent on clean energy."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/jul/01/hillary-clinton/clinton-cincinnati-runs-100-percent-clean-power/	Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had a lot of nice things to say about Cincinnati during their first campaign appearance together in the Ohio city. Clinton gave props to Cincinnati’s mayor and applauded one city achievement in particular. "Cincinnati is already one of the biggest cities in the country to run 100 percent on clean energy," she said. "Congratulations." But what does it mean to say that Cincy "runs" on clean energy? Buses powered by photosynthesis? City government meets by candlelight? We popped the hood for a closer look. It’s more complicated than the city no longer using "dirty" power. In 2011, Cincinnati voters approved a ballot initiative allowing the city to bargain for electricity on behalf of its residents. The following year, the City Council accepted a bid from FirstEnergy Solutions to offer a 100 percent Renewable Energy Credit option to the city’s 53,000 residential and commercial electric customers. One renewable energy credit represents one megawatt-hour of renewable electricity produced by facilities like wind farms, solar canopies or hydro-electric dams. People in Cincinnati still get their power over the wires owned by Duke Energy, the traditional, coal-burning electric utility for the area. But FirstEnergy Solutions, as Cincinnati’s "aggregation provider," buys a mix of both locally produced renewable electricity and renewable energy credits on the city’s behalf. Renewable energy credits are coded and retired, once purchased, and are used to track the ownership of environmental and social benefits of the renewable energy, not the electricity itself. It's complicated stuff, but we'll guide you through it. Say you're part of Cincinnati's FirstEnergy program, which you would be by default unless you opted-out. (Residents got a letter saying they could.) Your lights turn on using the same electricity as someone who opted to stick with conventional, coal-fed electricity, because once electricity is placed on the electrical grid, it becomes indistinguishable from the electricity generated by other sources. But when you pay your bill, you're paying for an equivalent supply of power from renewable sources being fed into the grid, be it locally or elsewhere. Larry Falkin, the director of Cincinnati’s Office of Environment and Sustainability, confirmed that 43,090 electric customers in the city and 1,287 small businesses participated in the renewable energy credit program in 2015, for a total of 405,737 megawatt hours. That's about 81 percent of the 53,000 households in Cincinnati. In past years, FirstEnergy’s renewable electricity sources have included the power generated from captured coal mine methane gas at the University of Cincinnati’s Central Utility Plant, and solar power generated at a solar canopy at the Cincinnati Zoo. FirstEnergy has also tapped wind farms in Iowa and Texas, and hydro-electric power from facilities in Virginia and Pennsylvania. There is a hitch. Critics of renewable energy credits argue that it’s almost impossible to confirm that a renewable credit actually displaces a megawatt-hour from a dirty source, like coal. "It would be great if the purchase of certificates made up the difference between conventional and renewable power, but at best this is a token subsidy for renewable energy," Daniel Press, an environmental studies professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, wrote in an editorial for the San Jose Mercury Press. Some large corporations that once embraced the renewable-credit model for greening up their profiles have since ditched the credits. Johnson & Johnson is one such company that enthusiastically purchased voluntary clean-energy credits in 2000, but has since backed off that strategy. Jed Richardson, J&J’s global energy director, said, "We decided we were better off investing in renewable generation on our own properties." The Cincinnati City Council defended the renewable credit system from a challenge in 2014, when the interim city manager recommended returning to Duke Energy for power. The clean-powered households saved as much as 28 percent off their utility bills when the program began. But because of market fluctuations, the savings in the green program had dropped to 8 percent. The city manager reversed his stance when the majority of the council defended the clean energy program. City Councilman Chris Seelbach told PolitiFact Ohio, "I successfully led efforts in 2014 to continue having 100 percent of our electricity backed by renewable credits after our administration recommended against it. Fortunately, the administration recommended renewable energy this year, so we didn’t have to fight them." Other cities that have gone 100 percent renewable include Burlington, Vt. (population 42,452), Greensburg, Kan. (population 798), and Aspen, Colo. (population 6,882). With a population of 297,517, Cincinnati is one of the biggest cities to use this program. Our ruling Clinton congratulated Cincinnati for being "one of the biggest cities in the country to run 100 percent on clean energy." Clinton's phrasing makes it sound like Cincinnati is free of coal-fed power. The reality — the city's 100 percent Renewable Energy Credit option — is more complicated. While there are critics of the renewable energy credit system, it is currently the only way to ensure the purchase of power from green sources. The most recent reports show that 43,090 Cincinnati households and 1,287 small businesses participate in the city’s Electricity Aggregation Program. That’s not 100 percent of Cincinnati’s energy consumers — it’s about 81 percent of households. But those who are enrolled in the Electricity Aggregation Program can claim that they’re running on 100 percent renewable sources — or as close to it as anyone can get, while staying on the grid.

pomt-11484	"Probably one out of every two households in Oklahoma has a gun."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/02/tom-cole/tom-cole-half-oklahoma-homes-have-gun/	One of the least-studied pieces of the gun violence puzzle is how many households own a firearm in each state. There are reasonable estimates at the national and regional levels, but not beyond that. In a recent interview, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., took a stab at putting a number on ownership in his state. He was talking about being at ease among people with conceal carry permits. "Probably one out of every two households in Oklahoma has a gun," Cole said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe Feb. 28. "I move in that world every day." We asked Cole’s staff where he got that ballpark figure and didn’t hear back. There is a federal government survey from 2004 that asked people, "Are any firearms now kept in or around your home?" In Oklahoma, 42.9 percent said yes. Nationally, the figure was 31.7 percent. A 2015 article in a peer-reviewed journal, based on a 2013 poll, said that 31.2 percent of Oklahomans reported that they owned a firearm. However, the lead author of the study distanced herself from such a precise estimate. "Considering that our sample size was modest, please exercise caution," said Bindu Kalesan, assistant professor of Medicine and Community Health Science at Boston University. The study was about social gun culture nationally, and "everything else is secondary or exploratory," Kalesan said. Kalesan said so far as she knows, no study has looked at household gun ownership at the state level. The General Social Survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago found that in 2014, 43 percent of people in the West South Central region, which includes Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, said there was some sort of firearm in their home. Nationally, 31 percent reported the presence of a gun in the home. Our ruling Cole said half the households in Oklahoma have a gun. In reality, there’s no fresh and reliable data for household gun ownership in the state. A survey from nearly 15 years ago reported that 42 percent of Oklahomans said there was a firearm in their house. A 2014 survey gave an ownership rate of 43 percent of households within a cluster of four states that included Oklahoma. Both the old and the more recent surveys estimated a national ownership rate of about 31 percent. While we can’t say for sure that the older study still holds true for Oklahoma proper, based on its national numbers, it is at least in the same neighborhood as the more recent regional and national estimates. Cole’s figure seems a bit high, but there’s a reasonable chance that the actual number is close to 40 percent. Better data is always a good thing, but we’ll give Cole the benefit of the doubt and rate this Mostly True.

John McCain revived a claim against Barack Obama that Obama voted to raise taxes on people making $42,000 a year. “He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year,” McCain said in the presidential debate Oct. 15, 2008, at Hofstra University. This time, McCain correctly noted the tax votes came on budget resolutions. But we’ve reviewed this charge before and found that McCain was stretching the truth. He does again this time, though not as badly. Obama voted in March 2008 and June 2008 for budget resolutions. They are blueprints for the federal budget. The resolutions set targets for the committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. The resolutions, approved on mostly party-line votes, expressed support for rolling back tax cuts enacted under President Bush for people making $42,000 a year and higher. So the McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted for the measures, which expressed approval for tax increases. But it’s inaccurate to suggest that votes on nonbinding budget resolutions, which don’t have the force of law and don’t include precise details on taxes or spending, are the same as votes on legislation that actually increases taxes. The resolutions would not change the tax code. Moreover, Obama as a candidate has proposed tax increases for couples earning $250,000 or more a year, or singles earning $200,000 or more. We rated previous versions of McCain’s charge as Barely True. Although McCain added context to his charge, it doesn’t change the fact that the votes were never expected to raise taxes.

pomt-12616	"New regulation requires motorcycle owners to install 75 MPH governor by January 2017"	pants on fire!	/new-hampshire/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/will-federal-government-require-devices-slow-down-/	Springtime in New Hampshire means motorcyclists are itching to hit the state’s scenic, winding roads. But if they trusted a widely distributed news article last year, they might think they need to install a device that limits their motorcycle to 75 mph – per a federal government regulation – before they can ride. Since the Granite State has the second-highest motorcycle ownership rate nationwide – one bike for every 17 people – a mechanical requirement imposed by the federal Department of Transportation would hit the state especially hard. An estimated $35 price tag for the speed governors would cost New Hampshire’s motorcycle riders more than $2.5 million to bring all 73,000 bikes registered statewide into compliance. It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the 8 million-plus motorcycles across the United States into compliance, based on the article published by Associated Media Coverage. Despite the alarm, there was never any such rule proposed, much less mandated. The apparent news story with the headline ""New regulation requires motorcycle owners to install 75 MPH governor by January 2017," wasn’t true. There was no requirement to install speed governors, and the article’s lone quoted source, James Littleton, a purported representative of the DOT, doesn’t appear to exist. Nevertheless, it reached nearly 10,000 people – perhaps more though social media – within a matter of days, according to a cached version of the article, which was subsequently removed. Maybe those readers – 5,500 of whom clicked the like button on the Associated Media Coverage website – should have slowed down. In addition to removing the article, the website Associated Media Coverage appears to have rebranded itself. Its old URL now redirects to a page called The Seattle Tribune. It also adopted a marginally less-confident tagline: its old motto "News You Can Trust" is now simply "Informing the Nation." The Seattle Tribune describes itself as "a news and entertainment satire web publication … Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental." It has no association to the 126-year-old newspaper, The Seattle Times. PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to examine this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life." The motorcycle claim – and its apparent intent to irritate motorcyclists – is the type of story that made up this fake news outlet’s bread and butter. The hoax-debunking website Snopes, which found the claim to be false, made this comment about the "fake news" Associated Media Coverage article: "The sensational claim was one of several hoaxes recently promulgated by the Associated Media Coverage fake news site, the most popular of which pertained to purported laws that would affect specific subsets of the population (such as motorcyclists or e-cigarette users)," Snopes wrote. If its goal was to rile up one of those subsets – and thereby drive clicks to the website – it worked on at least one motorcycling forum, DungBeetleBikers.com. A user called Prickle posted the verbatim article two days after it first appeared July 31, 2016. An Australian user called Roo promptly responded to the made-up spokesman’s reasoning that the speed limits would promote safety: "Per capita exposure to road trauma on a motorcycle is always going to be much higher than say that of cage drivers," Roo wrote, referring to non-biker motorists as "cage drivers" and continuing indignantly, "So, cages are exempt? That makes sense, dunnit?" It turns out speed limiters, or governors, are a real thing. You can buy them online for cars, motorcycles and ATVs, but the cost is usually a few hundred dollars, not the "subsidized cost" of $35 as the article states. The article goes on to make a couple of other assertions that are easily disproved. The first tries to peg the number of annual motorcycle fatalities: "... each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States." Actually, 4,693 motorcyclists died in the U.S. last year, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System.The peak years for motorcycle fatalities in 1980 and 2008 never topped 5,112. The second assertion is that 73 percent of motorcycle fatalities "are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds." Wrong again. Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that only 33 percent of all motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were speeding, according to an analysis by the Insurance Information Institute. In both cases, the figures cited in the article are nearly double the numbers put forth by authorities. When Snopes assessed this claim last August, it noted that Associated Media Coverage, unlike the Seattle Tribune, didn’t identify itself as "fake news" or a satirical website. "While many fake news sites include disclaimer notices informing readers that their content is not credible, Associated Media Coverage does not. As such, many of the less ostentatious claims (such as the 75 MPH motorcycle speed governor one) spread on social media amid a targeted audience," Snopes wrote. Bottom line: The only thing bikers need to worry about if they go over 75 mph is a speeding ticket. Our ruling The website Associated Media Coverage claimed the federal Department of Transportation was forcing motorcycle owners to install speed governors on their motorcycles that would limit their max speeds to 75 mph. That assertion was never true and was sourced to a made-up federal government official. Supporting statistics that the phony spokesman cited also exaggerated the number of motorcycle fatalities each year and the propensity for speeding among people killed in those crashes. The website did not identify itself as a purveyor of fake news, and some motorcyclists took the bait. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05713	Ronald Reagan’s philosophy of "peace through strength" is why "the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/07/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-iran-released-hostages-1981-becau/	During a March 6, 2012, video address to a conference of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, Mitt Romney seized the tough foreign policy mantle of President Ronald Reagan. "I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength," Romney told the pro-Israel group. "There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in. As president, I'll offer that kind of clarity, strength and resolve." But was Reagan’s "peace through strength" philosophy really responsible for freeing the 52 Americans who were taken hostage by Islamic militants and held for 444 days? First, a reminder of what the hostage crisis was all about. In 1979, the Shah of Iran -- who had been installed and supported by successive United States administrations -- was overthrown by Islamic revolutionaries. Militants took over the American embassy and held hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day President Jimmy Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of the incumbent’s handling of the crisis. "Iran contacted the Carter administration in September 1980 with a proposal to end the hostage crisis," said Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor who has written two books about the Iran hostage crisis. "The U.S. made a proposal. Iran responded with an unacceptable offer just a day or two before the election. Afterwards, they nominated the Algerians to act as intermediaries. Those valuable discussions went on until literally the day or two before the inauguration, and they were settled by the Iranians caving in on a number of issues that were extremely costly to them. By my calculations, the Iranians ended up paying about $300,000 per hostage per day of incarceration." The agreement that led to the release, as described by the New York Times 11 days after it occured, revolved around $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. It had been negotiated over the course of several months before Reagan's inauguration. The Times, in its account of the inauguration, reported that "no one on the speaker's stand knew of the latest developments in Iran. Word quickly spread among the governors, Congressmen and Reagan friends, family and aides as they left the platform." Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, "but the onetime bitter rivals for the presidency told reporters as they entered the speaker's area separately, to the flourish of trumpets, that the hostages had not yet taken off from Tehran. The President got his first chance to announce the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with Congressional leaders in Statuary Hall in the Capitol." So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages’ safe return. However, we contacted seven scholars of the period, and their consensus was that neither Reagan nor his philosophy played any significant role in freeing the hostages. "Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats," said David Farber, a Temple University historian and author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam. "No Reagan administration officials participated in the successful negotiations," Farber added. "The Iranian government waited to officially release the Americans until Carter had left the presidency as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised. They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages." "By doing this, Iran thought they were showing the world that they could meddle in our affairs, just as we had done to them in 1953," added Dave Houghton, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis. Houghton suggested that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and said he thinks it’s possible that the Iranians "didn’t even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail." "I don't think they were scared into the release," Houghton said. "In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq." The one scholar who entertained the possibility that Iran was taking heed of the future president’s philosophy was Michael Gunter, a political scientist at Tennessee Tech University and the author of several papers about the crisis. Still, Gunter added, the "main reason for the release" was that "the mileage the Iranians had gained by holding the hostages had been used for everything it was worth and there was no further advantage in continuing." Several other experts agreed that the Iranians’ focus was on Carter, not Reagan. "If it was related to the occupant of the White House, it certainly had more to do with Carter than Reagan," said Stephen Kinzer, a former New York Times reporter who now teaches at Boston University and authored the book, Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America’s Future. "My guess is that the hostages would have been released even if someone else had been inaugurated -- anyone but Carter. The Iranians had come to hate Carter and didn't want to give him a triumph. Giving it to someone else was fine with them." Sick, the Columbia University professor, said that "those who wish to believe that the final flurry of activity was out of fear of Reagan have a right to their opinion. Those closer to the events believed that the Iranians, who had clearly decided months earlier that the hostages were a wasting asset, feared that they would have to start the whole laborious process of negotiation over from scratch with a new administration, which obviously had no great appeal." The Romney campaign did not return an inquiry seeking backup for the candidate’s claim. Our ruling We can’t read the Iranians’ minds, but seven scholars of the period told us that Reagan’s foreign policy approach was either a minor factor in the release of the hostages or not a factor at all. The fact that the deal was negotiated entirely by the Carter administration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team, seems to support the expert consensus. Romney made a claim that flies in the face of history and offered no evidence to support it. We rate the statement Pants On Fire.

pomt-08788	"Mr. Caprio is a career politician who has never worked in the private sector."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/20/john-robitaille/robitaille-says-caprio-never-worked-private-sector/	Candidate biographies have long been fertile ground for political foes in search of a quick hit. And it's true that many politicians have gotten in trouble for inflating their resumes. So when a candidate attacks his opponent's CV, we sit up and take note. In a news release emailed Aug. 11 and posted on his campaign website, Republican gubernatorial candidate John Robitaille slammed Democratic opponent Frank Caprio for statements he made about a $75-million loan guarantee for former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling's video-game company, 38 Studios. Specifically, he faulted Caprio for suggesting the state should have an equity interest in the company, a stance Robitaille said was "anti-business" and would torpedo efforts to attract new employers to the state. Robitaille didn't stop there. "Mr. Caprio is a career politician who has never worked in the private sector, and so it’s no surprise that he thinks the state government should own and run our businesses," he said. Robitaille went on to tout his own experience owning a small business and employing workers. Could it be true that Caprio, whose campaign mantra is putting the "wind at the back of small business," hasn't ever actually worked for a private company? A quick search proved Robitaille's accusation is just plain wrong. Caprio's resume, provided to us by his campaign, and stories in the Providence Journal archives, show that Caprio graduated from Suffolk University Law School in 1991 and then worked briefly at the Providence law firm Adler Pollock & Sheehan before turning to his own law practice, which he ran out of the same office as his father, Providence Municipal Court Chief Judge Frank Caprio, and his brother, David Caprio. By 1995 -- in an only in Rhode Island scenario -- Caprio took a job as an in-house legal counsel at Cookson America, the electronics and precious metals conglomerate, where he worked under its then-CEO, Donald Carcieri, now Rhode Island's governor. We contacted Adler Pollock & Sheehan and confirmed that Caprio worked there. We also called Cookson, where a human resources manager confirmed that he indeed worked there from 1995 to 1998. The irony, of course, is that Carcieri, once Caprio's boss, went on to be Robitaille's boss. Robitaille worked as his communications director, a job he left last winter to focus on his own run for governor. When a Journal reporter asked about Robitaille's claim the day he made it, the Robitaille team acknowledged its error in saying Caprio "never worked in the private sector." But it didn't correct its website until PolitiFact inquired about it nearly a week later. The campaign stood by the first part of its statement, that Caprio is a career politician who puts his political interests, and not those of small business, first. Robitaille is correct that Caprio has worked in politics for nearly his entire career. He took office in the state's part-time House of Representatives in 1991, the same year he graduated from law school. And he served in the House and later in the state Senate until he won the treasurer's seat in 2006. But to call someone "a career politician" suggests that's all he did. And the fact remains that Caprio had a legal career that spanned 15 years. Not only that, in working for himself as a private practice lawyer, he ran precisely the kind of small business that Robitaille says Caprio has no experience with. It's clear the Robitaille team issued this statement without doing even the smallest bit of research, so it's tempting to award him a Pants on Fire. But since the campaign corrected the mistake, we'll leave the lighter fluid alone and call his claim exactly what they acknowledged it to be: False.

pomt-03396	Says President Obama has cracked down "on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jul/03/debbie-wasserman-schultz/obama-holds-record-cracking-down-employers-who-hir/	President Barack Obama is the boss-buster in chief when it comes to going after employers who hire undocumented workers, according to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. "President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president," said Wasserman Schultz, in a June 20 interview on MSNBC. Obama "has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president." In a related fact-check, we gave Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as the Democratic National Committee chair, a Mostly True for her claim about border patrol and security. Here, we will explore if Obama holds the record for cracking down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants. Workplace raids vs. paperwork raids For some background, we turned to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies worldwide migration. Their 2013 paper about the history of immigration enforcement includes a chapter on workplace enforcement. We also found some background in a 2010 investigation from the Orange County Register. After multiple efforts, Congress passed the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which stated that employers couldn’t knowingly hire unauthorized workers. Employers must attest that they made a good faith effort to verify the eligibility of workers by completing an I-9 form. The documents are easy to counterfeit, so the federal government developed an online employer verification system in the 1990s under President Bill Clinton, and the use of it soared after 2007. That system, now known as E-Verify, is currently voluntary, though some states mandate it for certain employers. (The Corker-Hoeven amendment to the Senate immigration bill would make it mandatory.) E-Verify spending dramatically increased under President George W. Bush and Obama. Still, immigration rules have proved difficult to enforce. As of 2010, about 8 million unauthorized immigrants worked in the United States. The federal government’s worksite enforcement strategy has changed over time as well, making it difficult to compare data and declare any president the leader in cracking down on employers, experts across the political spectrum told us. At times, members in Congress have called for stiffer workplace enforcement. But when the reality hit home in their districts and led to complaints from business owners, politicians urged the federal government to ease up, according to border expert and University at Albany professor Rey Koslowski. That’s why border security has been more politically popular to fund than worksite enforcement. (We should note that a significant percentage of people working illegally don't cross the border; they simply overstay their visas.) Doris Meissner, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Clinton, called worksite enforcement "a bit of a third rail." (She is one of the authors of the Migration Policy Institute paper. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is now called Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.) Under Bush, workplace raids on factories and meatpacking plants received much attention. But after Obama took office, the Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new strategy and ditched the workplace raids, which also tended to punish employees, in favor of "paper raids" -- I-9 paperwork audits of employers to determine if they complied with employment eligibility verification laws. "ICE will focus its resources within the worksite enforcement program on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly hire illegal workers in order to target the root cause of illegal immigration," Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said in April 2009. The change was dramatic: the number of I-9 audits soared from 503 in 2008 to more than 8,000 in 2009. Under Obama, ICE announced sanctions against major employers. That included a $1 million fine gainst Abercrombie and Fitch that grew out of an I-9 inspection in November 2008 while Bush was president, and the termination of hundreds of workers at Chipotle restaurants. In 2007, ICE arrested 92 employers, while in 2012 it arrested 240, according to ICE. Final orders -- rulings at the end of the case which show employers violated hiring rules -- also increased under Obama. In 2007, there were two final orders, while in 2012 there were 495. But Obama doesn’t hold a record on final orders against employers. The numbers of final orders hit higher numbers in the 1990s. Those 495 final orders under Obama were consistently exceeded between 1992 and 1998, with a peak 1,063 final orders in 1992, according to data from the government’s Immigration Statistics yearbook. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton sent us news reports showing an increase in I-9 audits and fines under Obama compared to Bush. (We were unable to obtain I-9 audit statistics from the 1990s, so we don’t know if Obama holds the record merely over Bush.) Still, I-9 audits aren’t the only way to measure immigration enforcement. While audits have soared under Obama, other metrics have fallen, including arrests of employees, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restricting immigration. That’s not a surprise, since Obama turned the focus away from the workers and toward employers. However, by ignoring the workers, "they are choosing to cut off a line of inquiry to nail employers," Vaughan told PolitiFact in an interview. We asked Vaughan if she thinks Wasserman Schultz was correct to state that Obama holds the record on enforcement of employers. "It depends on which metric you choose," she said. "If your metric is the number of audits, yes. If your metric is bringing cases to prosecution that seriously punish employers, to the point where I would say there would be a deterrent effect, I would strongly disagree with her statement." Additionally, I-9 audits are not a complete or perfect measurement of worksite enforcement against employers who hired illegal workers, said former U.S. Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who chaired the immigration subcommittee from 1989 to 1991. Morrison now lobbies on immigration matters and has informally advised hospitals and other businesses that have faced I-9 audits. He described some of the I-9 audits as paperwork snafus -- for example an employer who didn’t check the right box. "If there are no illegals, you are more likely to be cut a break on penalties than if you hired a lot of illegals, but you get fined anyhow..." he said. "Trying to say who is being tougher on this aspect of enforcement I think is kind of a silly discussion, because what were people fined for? And did that help prevent unauthorized employment or not?" We also interviewed Carl Hampe, an attorney at Baker McKenzie who has represented employees in immigration cases since the 1990s and was an attorney for the Senate committee that drafted the 1986 law. Hampe said that Wasserman Schultz’s claim "is not inaccurate, but given the changing enforcement strategies, it’s not quite that black and white." In the 1990s, INS handled a higher number of civil cases, while Bush focused on criminal investigations against employers and workers. Obama has pursued civil audits and criminal investigations against employers. "It’s hard to say whether Bush 43 or (Obama) is the hands-down winner," he said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Obama has cracked down "on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president." She used the word "employers" and not "employees" here for a reason: Obama shifted away from Bush’s strategy of workplace raids and turned the focus on employers. Between 2008 and 2009, immigration audits soared from 503 to more than 8,000. But other metric tell a more nuanced story. Final orders against employers, for example, were higher in the 1990s than they are now. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04728	President Barack Obama has "weakened the respect for America abroad."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/30/callista-gingrich/callista-gingrich-says-barack-obama-has-weakened-r/	During a joint speech with her husband, Newt Gingrich, at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Callista Gingrich criticized several aspects of Barack Obama’s presidency, including his global leadership. Newt Gingrich said, "It's striking how President (Jimmy) Carter and President Obama both took our nation down a path that in four years weakened America's confidence in itself and our hope for a better future." Callista Gingrich continued, "Both weakened the respect for America abroad." We wondered whether that was correct. So we turned to international polling data from the Pew Global Attitudes Project. The surveys were based on telephone and face-to-face interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International. We didn’t find any data that went back to the Carter administration, but we did find surveys that allowed us to assess global views before and after Obama became president. While surveys are currently being undertaken in 20 nations, only 14 of those have been done for long enough to shed light on Callista Gingrich’s claim. The question asked is, "Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of ... the United States." While favorability isn’t exactly identical to respect, we think it’s very close and a good approximation. A crucial issue in analyzing Callista Gingrich’s claim is determining the right timing. The polls are typically taken in the spring or early summer, so the 2008 numbers refer to the nation’s standing under President George W. Bush, while the 2009 numbers refer to attitudes in the early days of the Obama administration. The 2012 numbers give us a snapshot of the current moment Let’s look at each of them. Comparing 2008 to 2012 Looking at the 14 nations in question, 10 gave the U.S. higher favorability rankings in 2012 than under Bush in 2008, compared to four that recorded declines. The nations that gave improved favorability ratings were primarily in Europe (Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Poland and Russia) and Asia (China and Japan). Turkey and Mexico also recorded increases. The declines were primarily in the Middle East -- Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon -- as well as Pakistan. Lumping together all of the increases with all of the decreases, America’s favorability went up an average of 7.4 points among the countries polled. So by this measure, Obama has made views of America around the world more favorable than under Bush. Comparing 2009 to 2012 While this measurement is less relevant for the issue Callista Gingrich raised, it still provides some useful context. In 2009 -- when Obama was a fresh face -- approval ratings of America in many countries were unusually high. Since then, they’ve fallen. Since 2009, America’s favorability has risen in four countries, fallen in nine and remained constant in one. The only countries to see a rise were Poland, Russia, Turkey and Japan. On average, America’s favorability declined 3.7 points among the countries polled. So the view of America in the world has declined from its unusually high peaks at the beginning of the Obama administration. Our ruling Callista Gingrich stated that Obama has "weakened the respect for America abroad." Using the most reasonable yardstick -- comparing Bush’s last number to Obama’s most recent number -- the United States on average has higher favorability ratings in most countries Pew surveyed. However, America’s favorability has eroded somewhat since Obama’s first year in office, though it’s still above the final levels of the Bush administration. On balance, we rate Callista Gingrich’s statement Mostly False.	None	Callista Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-08-30T20:11:27	2012-08-30	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-06928	Says the new Dodd-Frank financial law requires a 20 percent down payment to buy a house.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-dodd-frank-law-requires-20-perc/	With the 2012 election in their sights, Republican candidates spend most of their time trying to prove that President Barack Obama and the Democrats will make the economy worse. Presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich recently used this tactic in discussing housing and the new law to regulate the financial industry known as the Dodd-Frank Act. In a June 13, 2011, appearance in Concord, N.H., Gingrich said that Dodd-Frank "establishes a mandatory 20 percent down payment to buy a house. So at a time when housing prices have dropped worse than the Great Depression, we’re now going to have a law that guarantees there’s no housing market for a generation?" Gingrich said this was just one of many reasons to scrap Dodd-Frank entirely. Not too long ago, a 10 percent down payment was generally the industry standard. So we thought it would be important to know if Dodd-Frank in fact "establishes a mandatory 20 percent down payment." Some quick background on the Dodd-Frank Act., which is named after Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut who retired last year, and Rep. Barney Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts. It changes many of the rules the financial sector must live by, from credit cards to derivatives trading. One of its targets is a practice that lies at the heart of the sub-prime mortgage disaster. When a bank gives someone a loan to buy a house, it almost never holds the loan. Instead, it bundles it with other mortgages and sells it to another financial institution or group of investors. Before the meltdown, banks could sell the entire mortgage. If the loan went bad, the new owner of the mortgage was on the hook. Selling the loan allowed banks to make bad loans and not suffer the consequences. Dodd-Frank tries to put an end to that by saying that banks, and other kinds of lenders, must hold on to at least 5 percent of the value of the mortgage so they are "keeping some skin in the game." But the new law gave regulators the option to cut lenders some slack so they could sell 100 percent of certain mortgages if they were less risky. That provision is the source of Gingrich’s statement about a mandatory 20 percent down payment. But we find he is not characterizing the law accurately. We went to the law (page 519 is where you’ll find the topic addressed) and found nothing about a requirement for a 20 percent down payment. Asked to back up the claim, the Gingrich campaign cited this item in the Housing Wire, a news service for the mortgage market. The June 22 article describes a bipartisan furor over a proposed rule from housing and finance agencies to implement Dodd-Frank. The regulators did say the safest loans were those where the borrower put down 20 percent, and they proposed waiving the 5 percent requirement only for such highly rated mortgages. But that was just a proposal -- and an unpopular one. Groups from the Mortgage Bankers Association to the National Association of Colored People to the Independent Community Bankers of America registered strong objections. The president of the National Association of Realtors, Ron Phipps, said "as written, the proposed rule violates congressional intent, makes homeownership more expensive for millions of responsible consumers and jeopardizes the fragile housing recovery." Lawmakers also weighed in against the proposal, with 44 senators and 282 House members of both parties signing letters opposing it. The authors of the law said the proposal was not consistent with their intent for the legislation. An expert on the real estate industry told us Gingrich was wrong. "It's totally incorrect to say that Dodd-Frank came up with the 20 percent down payment standard," said Ken Harney, a real estate columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. "It just could not be further from the truth. So whoever says that is just misinformed." Harney notes that after the firestorm of protest, regulators extended the comment period for rule making. Harney’s assessment? This is "a proposal that I think has no chance of becoming reality." Two final points. By June 22, Gingrich himself had backed off, acknowledging that the 20 percent rule was just a proposal. And even the proposed rule would not make a large down payment mandatory. Our ruling: Gingrich is not correct that the law mandates a 20 percent down payment. There is no such requirement. The only element of the law that even comes close to that is a provision that requires banks to hold on to 5 percent of the value of their mortgages so they will retain a stake in mortgages. There's also been a proposal by regulators to waive that requirement for highly rated mortgages, which would include those with a 20 percent down payment.

pomt-04062	The tax penalty that the government imposes if you don't buy health insurance "is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/24/ron-desantis/desantis-says-obamacare-tax-cheaper-insurance/	Following President Barack Obama’s second inaugural address, three freshmen Republican members of Congress appeared on Greta Van Susteren’s Fox News show to offer their reactions. The panel focused on the need to address the nation’s debt problem, but the discussion also turned to a favorite Republican point of attack: Obamacare. Ron DeSantis, who represents northeast Florida including St. Augustine, Daytona Beach, and areas near Jacksonville, predicted that the health care law will put negative pressure on the insurance market. "It's structured in a way I think is going to end up failing," DeSantis said. "The tax that they put on you to buy insurance is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance, so I think a lot of people are going to pay the tax and that's going to destabilize the insurance market. And I think you will see problems with increased costs." We can’t fact-check DeSantis’ prediction, but we were interested in DeSantis’ claim that the tax penalty imposed by the law is less than the cost of insurance. We decided to check it out. What’s in the law The law’s individual mandate requires most adults in the U.S. to carry insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty. The tax is either a specific amount or a percentage of income, whichever is greater, and it’s phased in over time. Here is how the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation summarizes it: "Those without coverage pay a tax penalty of the greater of $695 per year up to a maximum of three times that amount ($2,085) per family or 2.5 percent of household income. The penalty will be phased-in according to the following schedule: $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, and $695 in 2016 for the flat fee or 1 percent of taxable income in 2014, 2 percent of taxable income in 2015, and 2.5 percent of taxable income in 2016. Beginning after 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment." At most middle-income levels, the percentage of income is greater than the flat fee. Here are a few examples of what the tax would cost: An individual with $30,000 annual income would pay a $300 penalty in 2014, $600 in 2015 and $750 in 2016. An individual with $50,000 annual income would pay a $500 penalty in 2014, $1,000 in 2015 and $1,250 in 2016. An individual earning $100,000 a year would pay a $1,000 penalty in 2014, $2,000 in 2015 and $2,500 in 2016. Married couples would pay double those amounts since the penalties are assessed per person. Families will eventually pay up to $2,085, or 2.5 percent of household income, by 2016. After 2016, the penalty will be increased annually by the cost-of-living adjustment. The cost of insurance The health care law also establishes insurance exchanges, essentially marketplaces in each state where people can purchase health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the national average annual premium in an Exchange in 2016 would be about $5,000 for an individual and about $12,000 for a family for the lowest-cost coverage that will be available. DeSantis’ office pointed us to another survey which said employer-sponsored insurance premiums rose to an average of $5,615 in 2012 for individuals and $15,745 for family coverage, though those figures do not represent what employees themselves paid toward their plans in the form of premiums. So it’s clear that even for those making high incomes -- the penalty in 2016 on a $200,000 income would be $4,500 -- the overall cost of insurance is greater than the tax. "The point Congressman DeSantis was making is that under Obamacare the penalty intended to force you to buy health insurance is less expensive than the average annual premium. In which case, many individuals may opt to pay the penalty instead of purchasing insurance in the marketplace," DeSantis’ communications director, Amy Graham, told PolitiFact in an email. Other views We talked to two experts for their take on DeSantis’ claim. They agreed that dollar-for-dollar, the tax is less than the cost of insurance. But the matter is about more than just the math. "People buy health insurance for stability, making sure they aren’t bankrupted by a car accident or heart attack," said Timothy Jost, a law professor who studies health policy at Washington and Lee School of Law who supports the law. "For a lot of those people they’re going to decide they’d rather pay a bit more for insurance and have something than pay the penalty and be uninsured." Clint Stretch, a tax attorney in Washington, also pointed out that the penalty is not meant to be a better deal than health insurance. It’s meant to nudge the uninsured toward buying coverage. "Assume an individual could get coverage for $3,000 or not get it and suffer a $1,000 penalty. All else being equal, the law has made the decision to buy insurance a $2,000 decision rather than a $3,000 decision," Stretch said in an email. "In effect the taxpayer’s choice is pay the Treasury or pay the insurance company – if they pay the Treasury they get no benefit." Jost added that many people who are subject to the penalty will benefit from other functions of the health care law, such as Medicaid, the health program for the poor that is expanded under Obamacare. There are also tax credits to help people pay for premiums and existing employer-sponsored plans. "If it were just a question of do I pay $2,000 (or insurance) or $700 (in a tax penalty), yeah that’s pretty much a no brainer," Jost said. "But on the other hand if I can get insurance through my employer for $200 a month and the alternative is not to do that and pay the penalty, it becomes a closer calculation." Our ruling DeSantis said that the tax penalty in the health reform law "is lower than it would have cost to buy insurance." Desantis is correct that health insurance premiums far exceed the penalties Obamacare imposes for not carrying insurance, even on high incomes. We think it’s valid to note that several provisions in the health law bring the dollar amounts closer together to give people an incentive to buy coverage. That’s also the purpose of the tax penalty -- to urge people to get insurance. But DeSantis is right in the straightforward cost comparison. We rate his statement True.

pomt-13233	Says Sen. Rob Portman said, "It would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/19/ted-strickland/debate-portman-and-strickland-spar-over-medicare-q/	The first debate between incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman and former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland got a little chippy over the future of entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. Responding to a question about the threat of Social Security funds being depleted by the year 2034, Portman said that he was in favor of "means testing," a method of adjusting benefits according to a taxpayer’s wealth. "And that’s part of the answer," Portman said. "I have supported that also, with Medicare." The question then went to Strickland, who leapt at the chance to repeat a talking point he’s used before in his campaign. "Since Sen. Portman brought up Medicare," Strickland said, "on the Neil Cavuto show, he said that it would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare. Those are his words." Portman interrupted, "Irresponsible not to save it." "Senator," Strickland said, "your words were it would be irresponsible not to cut it." Portman shook his head in disagreement. We decided to go to the tape — and Portman’s YouTube channel took us right to it. Here’s the exchange from June 2011 in which Portman, on Fox News, criticized Obama’s "Summer of Recovery," and discussed methods of addressing the national debt and deficit (emphasis ours): Cavuto: "So what are some of the things you want to cut, right now?" Portman: "Everything has to be on the table. So we have to deal with the entitlement programs, because they’re not sustainable in their current form -- they’re not going to be there for future generations." Cavuto: "So when Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid say, ‘not Medicare,’ what do you say?" Portman: "That they’re being irresponsible and they know it. They’re playing politics. If we don’t deal with these programs that are now 60 percent of our budget, think about that. When you add up interest on the debt and the mandatory spending, and the entitlement programs -- very important programs -- that’s 60 percent of the budget now, it’s the fastest-growing part of the budget. For them to take that off the table means they’re not serious about dealing with our deficit and debt." We see from this exchange that Portman didn’t talk about saving Medicare, as he stated in the debate, but proposed that all entitlements including Medicare needed to be considered in terms of cost-cutting. However, Portman’s statement was a hypothetical one, part of a discussion about Portman’s disagreement with his colleagues in the Senate about managing entitlements. It was not an official policy statement or part of proposed legislation on Portman’s part, as Strickland’s debate statement suggested. Our ruling Strickland said Portman went on television and said "it would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare. Those are his words." Those were not Portman's exact words on Cavuto's show. Portman said it would be irresponsible of any fellow senators to argue that Medicare would be off the table when discussing cutting entitlements. Strickland made it sound as if Portman was singling out Medicare by itself. Strickland's statement is partially accurate but imprecise, so we it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/439c351d-8c4c-468f-95c4-6399df46f007	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2016-10-19T20:11:45	2016-10-14	['None']

pomt-05688	"Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/13/kathleen-clyde/kathleen-clyde-says-ohio-not-compliance-federal-vo/	The non-partisan Pew Center on the States issued a report last month that the nation's voter registration rolls are plagued with problems. About one record in eight is inaccurate or invalid, the report said, and about 1.8 million registered voters are dead. No evidence of voter fraud was found -- just record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. State Rep. Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat from Kent, raised a similar issue at a news conference focused on provisional voting. She pointed to flaws in maintaining Ohio's voter database as a prime reason for the state's high number of provisional ballots, one of the highest rates in the country. Provisional ballots -- many of which go uncounted -- are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at a polling station, which happens most often because of a change of address. The problem is partly the result of another one, she said: "Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV." Clyde wasn’t raising the issue as a policy matter. Rather, she said Ohio is not meeting a legal obligation. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look and asked Clyde to back up her statement. She cited the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which is also known as the Motor Voter Act and NVRA. Congress enacted it "to enhance voting opportunities for every American," according to the Justice Department. "The act has made it easier for all Americans to register to vote and to maintain their registration." Among its provisions, the act requires states to keep voter registration lists accurate and current -- by, for example, identifying persons who have become ineligible due to having died or moved outside the jurisdiction. It says that any change of address submitted for driver's license purposes must also serve as notification of an address change for voter registration purposes, unless the license-holder indicates specifically that the change of address is not for voter registration purposes. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission last year produced a report on the effects of the voting act on voter registration. "It strongly suggests that Ohio is not meeting the requirements of federal law," Clyde said. "Ohio's rate of registrations and registration updates from BMV transactions is far lower than the national average -- 16.4 percent compared with 37.1 percent." We confirmed those numbers in the EAC report. But, Clyde added, "My statement was not completely based on this report, because this report merely suggests that Ohio is not in compliance." Instead, she said, the statement was based on the proof that voter registration updating is not offered during online BMV transactions. Our examination of the BMV's website, and specifically the "change of address" pages in online services, turned up no reference to voter records. So while an individual can use the website to submit a change in a driver’s address data, there is no mechanism for using that data as the NVRA-required notice of a change in the voter registration address. And, the site offered no opt-out option, as the NVRA also requires. We looked at the study of voter records from the Pew Center on the States. It notes that Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted last summer requested better compliance with the voting act from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. "From 2007-2008," Husted said in his request, "only 9.6 percent of all driver license transactions resulted in a voter registration transaction. ... While driver license transactions increased, voter registration transactions fell to only 6.5 percent of all driver license transactions from 2009-2010." We asked BMV for a response. A spokeswoman said: "When customers change their address by calling in, email or via written forms, they have the option of choosing to have that information sent on to update their voter registration or choosing not to update their voter registration. Currently we don't have our online vehicle registration database, OPLATES, set up that way and are working to add the ‘opt in’ and ‘opt out’ options to that by July 1, 2012." Our conclusions: The BMV’s website, where annual vehicle registration can be done and address changes are noted, does not now provide the updated information to voter registration records. Regardless of what options may be offered during offline transactions, Ohio has a significantly lower rate of voter updates from BMV transactions than the national average. Despite an increase overall in transactions, the Ohio rate has declined. The secretary of state, Ohio’s chief elections official, cited the low and declining rate in requesting a better level of compliance with the 1993 voting act. Ohio, clearly in some cases, is using address updates to its driver license database to update voter registration addresses. But considering that the state’s rate is less than half the national avearge, and that the option isn’t even available for online transactions, the BMV is falling short of compliance with the nearly 20-year-old Motor Voter Act. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Clyde’s statement as True.	None	Kathleen Clyde	None	None	None	2012-03-13T06:00:00	2012-01-27	['Ohio']

pomt-03560	Says Hillary Clinton "was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions, including direct cables."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/22/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-hillary-clinton-was-asked-repeatedl/	Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says Hillary Clinton is to blame for inadequate security in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans died on Sept. 11, 2012. She was asked repeatedly as secretary of state to provide security, Paul told CNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley on May 19, 2013, including in "direct cables." Crowley asked Paul about his recent comments in Iowa and New Hampshire that Clinton’s failure should disqualify her from the presidency. "It's that you did it in Iowa or New Hampshire which gives it a political patina, and I'm asking you if you think that's helpful," she said. Paul replied, "You know, I've done it in every state and every stop because I think it's pretty important that she accept blame for not providing security. She was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions including direct cables, and she says she never read the cables on security. I find that inexcusable and a dereliction of duty. "Whether it has political overtones or not, it really goes to the heart of who you are as secretary of state if you do not provide security for an embassy that's begging for it, that's absolutely a dereliction of duty and she should have resigned and accepted blame for it." Did Clinton herself get repeated requests for security before armed terrorists attacked, including in "direct cables"? Cables 101 Paul’s office said Clinton’s name on diplomatic cables demonstrates she was involved in security decisions — or that she should have been. "It may be even more damning an indictment of Clinton if she is correct, because her disinterest in her job may have cost the lives of U.S. citizens overseas," said Moira Bagley, a Paul spokeswoman. She pointed to a claim from House Republicans, reported by the Los Angeles Times in April, that a cable signed by Clinton proposed security reductions in Benghazi before the attack. "Clinton's signature is on this cable and others," Bagley said. "If Secretary Clinton signed a cable to reduce security, then her signature is strong evidence that she read cables." (Bagley didn’t offer evidence that Clinton "was asked repeatedly to provide security" including "direct cables." But we’ll get there in a minute.) First, is Clinton’s "signature" strong evidence of her personal involvement? Let’s talk for a second about diplomatic cables. Think of them as messages sent via a new-fangled email system — dubbed "CableExpress" — that draws on some old-school customs. How old-school? The messages are also called "telegrams." The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual has all kinds of rules and instructions for drafting, formatting, addressing and sending these things. We browsed through several sections of the manual’s "Correspondence Handbook," learning interesting tidbits such as, "If you are sending a telegram from a Post to the Department or to another Post, enter respectively "SECSTATE WASHDC"; or the telegraphic form of the other post (e.g. AMEMBASSY BERLIN, AMCONSUL CHIANG MAI) in the addressee field." Here’s what we learned. If you’re sending a telegram "to a post from the department" — so, say, to a particular embassy from Washington, D.C. — you address it to the post, and it carries the name of the secretary of state. That’s right: The State Department’s communications center puts the secretary’s name "on all telegrams to posts." When Clinton was in charge, that meant the "signature" on telegrams was hers. That doesn’t mean she signed them — just that her name was printed at the bottom. That’s why, when Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., argued on TV in April that Clinton had personally signed a cable about reducing U.S. security staff in Benghazi, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, who covered the State Department for nine years, called it a "whopper." Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., confirmed that assessment in May, saying, "We have now seen this cable and she did not sign it. Her name is printed at the bottom just like tens of thousands of cables sent every year from the department." But as we mentioned previously, Paul’s claim was about messages sent the other way, from a U.S. embassy to Washington. How are those addressed? To "SECSTATE" in "WASHDC." While a cable addressed to "SECSTATE" may look like a "direct cable" to the secretary of state, the reality is somewhat less exciting. "SECSTATE," according to another part of the Foreign Affairs Manual, is the "location indicator" for the entire State Department, including the Peace Corps. About 1.4 million cables a year are addressed that way. Here’s how Clinton explained it to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January: "They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy." She said security requests from Libya never came to her attention. "I was not aware of that going on," she said. "It was not brought to my attention, but obviously it’s something we’re fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn’t happen again." Security requests So, Clinton’s name or title on millions of diplomatic cables doesn’t say much of anything about whether she personally knew of their contents. In the case of Benghazi security, she testified under oath that she didn’t. But it’s clear repeated requests were made to Washington. A report from the State Department’s Accountability Review Board in December 2012 noted that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi the day of the attack was inadequate despite "repeated requests … for additional staffing." The board focused attention below the secretary of state, finding that "certain senior State Department officials within two bureaus demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in their responses to security concerns posed by Special Mission Benghazi, given the deteriorating threat environment and the lack of reliable host government protection." But it didn’t find reasonable cause to determine that anyone breached his or her duty. House Republicans, critical of the review board’s focus on lower-level officials, released their own interim report in April. It says that in the months before the attack, officials from the U.S. mission in Libya stressed inadequate security and a need for more staff in "numerous communications." The Republicans' report mentions two cables and two email messages in particular, from March, April, June and July 2012, that reflect a back-and-forth in which diplomats requested more U.S. security personnel, but Washington officials said no. They preferred trained Libyan security staff. None of the messages involve Clinton — except that one of them bears her "signature," as any cable out of Washington would. Still, some recent testimony before the House Oversight Committee suggested there’s some expectation she should have been familiar with the discussion. Eric Nordstrom, the State Department’s former regional security officer in Libya, drafted some of the cables from the embassy requesting additional security, including the one from March cited by Republicans. He testified before lawmakers on May 8, 2013, that he would have expected Clinton to have read or been briefed on that cable. "I certainly expected (that) given the fact that she had an involvement in the security process," he said. She would have had to personally approve Defense Department security teams that had been deployed, Nordstrom testified — teams that he requested in the March cable to keep. "She also came out to post, toured our facilities and toured the facilities and saw the lack of security there — that was something that her country team — or she was briefed by the country team as she visited the site," he said. Still, when lawmakers asked him if the State Department’s review board let anyone off the hook, he pointed to the undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy, rather than Clinton. "I think she has a very reasonable assertion some of these issues weren't brought to her attention," Nordstrom said. "Well, how do we fix that so they are brought to the attention of the secretary of state? It is not lost on me that as the unheeded messenger this time around, I look at where those messages seem to stop, the undersecretary for management. ..." "There is something apparently wrong with the process of how those security recommendations are raised to the secretary," he said. Our ruling Paul blamed Clinton for Benghazi security failures, saying she "was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions, including direct cables." The State Department was asked repeatedly for additional U.S. security staff in Libya. But we see no evidence that Clinton herself was made aware of those requests. For example, there’s no "direct cable" that automatically appears on the secretary of state’s desk. Instead, all cables would have carried her name, and only those passed up the chain by staff would have reached her. She says these ones didn’t. Meanwhile, the same security officer who testified that he would have expected her to be briefed on his request for more staff also said, "there is something apparently wrong with the process of how those security recommendations are raised to the secretary." Paul’s office didn’t provide evidence linking requests for security directly to Clinton. We found only evidence that requests were made of her department. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-03998	Says Texas ranks first in executions among the states.	true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/08/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-ranks-first-ex/	In an editorial poking at Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch for California businesses to consider moving to Texas, the Sacramento Bee's editorial board said Texas ranks poorly in several ways. "Come check out a state that ranks first in the number of executions, first in the number of uninsured, first in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted and first in the amount of toxic chemicals released into water," the Feb. 6, 2013, editorial says. We’ll take up the reference to executions in this fact check. Click here to read the rest. Texas has executed more convicts than any other state since the legality of the death penalty was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse that has written reports critical of the death penalty. From 1977 through early February 2012, Texas executed 492 prisoners, the center says. No other state came close. Virginia ranked a distant second, with 110 executions, Oklahoma fell third with 102. California, incidentally, ranked first among the states in Death Row inmates, with 724 of 3,146 nationally as of Oct. 1, 2012. Florida was next, at 411, and Texas was third, with 304. The center’s executive director, Richard Dieter, said by email that in 2012, Texas was third in the number of new death sentences (9), behind Florida (22) and California (13). The same year, according to the center, Texas executed 15 inmates, tops among the states, while Oklahoma, Mississippi and Arizona each put six individuals to death. Dieter also said Oklahoma has bested Texas in executions compared to the state’s population. A center chart indicates that through Aug. 2, 2011, Oklahoma had a rate of 0.26 executions per 10,000 residents. The Texas rate was nearly 0.19, which was higher than rates for any of the other states. Our ruling The editorial said Texas ranks first in the number of executions. That’s correct both over the decades and for the latest full year. We rate this claim as True.	None	Sacramento Bee Editorial Board	None	None	None	2013-02-08T14:06:00	2013-02-06	['None']

pomt-11785	"Wisconsin's driver licenses and identification (ID) cards are currently the most secure in the nation."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/24/wisconsin-department-transportation/are-wisconsins-driver-licenses-most-secure-nation-/	When it comes to driver’s licenses and state-issued ID cards across the nation, one size fits all. The cards all follow what is known as the ID-1 format, which specifies a size of 85.60 × 53.98 mm ( 3 3⁄8 inch ×  2 1⁄8 inch) and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88–3.48 mm (roughly the same size as a bank card). But size is the only equalizer. Each state uses its own design, colors, data and text font. They also differ in their level of security. How secure are licenses in the Badger State? "Wisconsin’s driver licenses and identification (ID) cards are currently the most secure in the nation," said Corey Kleist, Department of Motor Vehicles section chief, in a news release a while back. To be sure, all licenses and ID cards must be in compliance with federal standards established under the REAL ID Act of 2005. So, is the "most-secure" claim from the state Department of Transportation correct? Enhanced security The statement by Kleist came after the state DOT added what is known as the eNotify security feature to the system. It sends an email and/or text notification whenever certain activities happen, such as a request for a duplicate driver license or a change of address. If the license-holder doesn’t recognize the transaction, DMV staff can help to identify the origin of the transaction and offer guidance to help resolve any issues, according to the DOT. When asked to provide backup for the most-secure claim, DOT public affairs director Rebecca Kikkert noted the department has been making the "most secure in the nation" claim since switching to new cards in 2015. As part of the department's compliance with the REAL ID Act, all employees with access to key systems are fingerprinted and subject to federal background checks. Additionally, their work is subject to audits to determine whether applications are processed according to DMV procedures and state laws. Other changes included moving from having the cards printed at each DMV Customer Service Center, where they were laminated, to a centralized printing facility which uses a different technique -- polycarbonate cards. The new cards, made by CBN Secure Technologies, feature black-and-white laser-engraved photos and ultraviolet ink on intricate images of the Capitol and state flag. Other features include a raised signature, date of birth, expiration date, driver's license and ID numbers and U21 (under 21). Those pieces of information can be felt when holding the cards, which makes them harder to copy. The new cards are expected to be completely phased in by 2023, as old licenses expire. "We were the first in the nation to deploy many of the security features our current cards carry; some of which have since been adopted by other states," said Kikkert. Brian Zimmer of Keeping IDentities Safe, an expert on security of ID cards, said Wisconsin was among the first 10 states determined to be REAL ID compliant. In the 10 years since, photo copying technology and photo-manipulation tools have become more sophisticated. So the bar for prevent counterfeiting of driver’s licenses has gotten much higher. "Wisconsin DMV officials aimed at exceeding that bar in designing the current driver’s license, benchmarking the most recent designs and security features of other states, and coming up with superior card stock composition and advanced security features," Zimmer said. "At this date, it is the most advanced among those issued in the United States." He also gave Wisconsin high marks for adding the eNotify feature, calling it "a very useful identity theft prevention service." Keeping IDentities Safe, according to its website, is a non-partisan, not for profit crime prevention and education organization based in Washington, D.C. Its primary purpose is to raise public awareness about the importance of ID security. Our rating A DMV official said "Wisconsin's drivers licenses and identification (ID) cards are currently the most secure in the nation." The state's new polycarbonate cards, featuring black and white laser-engraved photos, ultraviolet ink and intricate artwork along with its eNotify security feature makes the Badger State's cards security "the most advanced among those issued in the United States," according to an expert on identity security.

pomt-05781	Says private-sector job growth in 2011 "places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/27/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-private-sector-job-growth-20/	Pushing his "New Jersey Comeback" theme, Gov. Chris Christie returned last week to the subject of private-sector job growth as evidence of the state’s improving economic condition. With the addition of nearly 40,000 private-sector jobs in 2011, New Jersey saw the best private-sector job growth since 2000 and ranked among the top third of states for such growth last year, according to Christie. "Since I took office, we as a state have added nearly 60,000 private-sector jobs," Christie said during his Feb. 21 speech introducing the fiscal year 2013 budget. "And 2011 was the best year of job growth since the year 2000 and places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states." State officials have made it clear that "the best year of job growth since the year 2000" refers to private-sector jobs. In a recent ruling, PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that New Jersey’s private-sector job growth in 2011 was the largest in 11 years. But we were wondering whether Christie’s right that such growth "places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states." The short answer: not exactly. When you compare states based on the net increase in private-sector jobs last year, Christie’s statement is accurate. But if you compare states according to the percentage increase in jobs, New Jersey isn’t performing as well as the governor makes it sound. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak argued that the net increase in jobs supports the governor’s statement, adding "you are going out of your way to add something to the mix for the purpose of finding fault with it." First, let’s explain New Jersey’s private-sector job growth in 2011. Between December 2010 and December 2011, New Jersey gained 39,400 private-sector jobs for a 1.2 percent increase, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The December 2011 figures are preliminary. In Christie’s fiscal year 2013 budget summary, the governor’s staff reiterates the significance of that private-sector job growth: "The increase in private jobs was the largest in both absolute and percentage terms since 2000." So, the administration cited two measures -- "absolute and percentage terms" -- to demonstrate that New Jersey’s private-sector job growth in 2011 was the best since 2000. In that case, let’s see how those measures determine where New Jersey ranks nationally for private-sector job growth last year. In terms of net jobs gained, New Jersey’s private-sector job growth stands at 12th place among the 50 states. That backs up Christie’s statement, because he said New Jersey ranks "in the top third among all of the states." But in percentage terms, Christie’s claim is off. Based on the percentage increase in jobs, New Jersey ranks 31. It’s worth noting that analyzing the net increase in jobs -- the measure that supports Christie’s statement -- typically favors big states. Ranking by percentage changes accounts for states’ different population sizes. For a different fact-check on New Jersey’s job growth, Edward Montgomery, an economist and dean of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, had this to say a few weeks ago: "If the question is which state created the most jobs you would use change in net employment. If the question is in which state is employment growing fastest you would use percentage change. Ranking states by net job creation will almost always favor big states." Our ruling During his budget speech, Christie pointed to New Jersey’s private-sector job growth in 2011, claiming that it "places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states." In 2011, New Jersey gained 39,400 private-sector jobs for a 1.2 percent increase. In terms of net jobs gained, Christie is right. By that measure, New Jersey ranks in 12th place out of the 50 states. But the 1.2 percent increase in private-sector jobs does not support the governor’s claim. By that measure, the state ranks 31. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-11932	The Republican tax reform proposal is focused on tax breaks for the middle class "and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/13/paul-ryan/gop-tax-reform-framework-aimed-giving-break-middle/	Undaunted by his party’s failure to repeal Obamacare, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has fixed his sights on the next Republican priority -- tax reform. He says the plan is squarely aimed at helping the middle class. On Sept. 27, 2017, the day President Donald Trump announced the framework of the GOP tax reform proposal, Ryan did a an interview on the Fox News Channel with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity. In it, Ryan stated: People who are low- and middle-income, they’re the ones who are literally living paycheck to paycheck, who are worried about losing their job or they haven’t gotten a raise in years. This is about them and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a break. Ryan made similar statements about the middle class earlier in the interview, as well as the same day at his weekly briefing with reporters and, repeatedly, several days later on CBS’ "Face the Nation." So, is the Republican tax reform framework focused on tax breaks for the middle class "and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break"? What we found are some benefits for the middle class -- but, more clearly, breaks for the rich, as well. Ryan’s argument When Trump unveiled the framework, the New York Times reported that he offered "scant detail about how working people would benefit from a proposal that has explicit and substantial rewards for wealthy people and corporations." The Times story added: "Without more details, it is difficult to show how middle-income families will see the most benefit from the tax overhaul — or if it will favor the richest Americans." One reason there are questions is that what has been proposed is a framework -- not all of the details have been worked out. Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana argued that while the plan "reduces rates for everyone, the wealthiest individuals "will continue to pay at least the same proportion of the country’s taxes." He also criticized an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, saying its assumptions about the plan make the analysis "deeply flawed." Tax Policy Center director Mark Mazur told us he believes the assumptions are reasonable, given that they are based on previous tax proposals outlined by Ryan and Trump. Key analysis of the framework The Tax Policy Center analysis found: The framework would collapse the seven individual income tax rates -- which range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent -- to three: 12, 25 and 35 percent. The higher percentages are applied to those who make more money. Ryan says the current 10 percent rate is reduced to 0 percent. The framework would also, among other things, increase the standard deduction, eliminate personal exemptions, increase the child tax credit and eliminate most itemized deductions. So, depending on the details, the provisions could all increase or decrease an individual’s federal income tax bill. One bottom line, according to the analysis: The top 1 percent of earners would receive about 80 percent of the tax benefit. This income group would see its after-tax income increase 8.5 percent, whereas the bottom 95 percent of earners would see an average 1.2 percent increase in their after-tax income. Other details from the analysis: In 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts. In 2027, taxpayers in the 80th to 95th income percentiles would, on average, experience a tax increase. Looking ahead, in 2027, some higher-income taxpayers would pay more in taxes, but the richest would still get breaks. Taxpayer groups in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution — those making less than about $150,000 — would receive average tax cuts of 0.5 percent or less of after-tax income. Taxpayers making between about $150,000 and $300,000 would on average pay about $800 more in taxes than under current law. About 80 percent of the total benefit would accrue to taxpayers in the top 1 percent, whose after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent. The analysis also included this important caveat: The framework does not specify the income brackets to which the individual tax rates would apply, nor the maximum size and phase-out parameters of the increased child tax credit. So, to some extent, projections are hard to make. But while some in the middle class are projected to see tax cuts, the better-off do even better, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. Other analyses Other think tanks have also had to make assumptions about the framework, given its lack of details. Here is what some of them concluded: Tax Foundation, a right-leaning group: It’s projected the plan "would, on average, lower the tax burden on the bottom 80 percent of households, while slightly raising the tax burden on the top 20 percent of households. The group with the largest gains is households between the 60th and 80th percentile." New York Times: The proposal "is a potentially huge windfall for the wealthiest Americans, would not directly benefit the bottom third of the population (and) as for the middle class, the benefits appear to be modest." Washington Post: "Most people will pay lower taxes, although it's unclear if the rich get a bigger break than the middle class." PolitiFact National: "The framework appears to favor cuts for wealthier individuals and could increase taxes on some middle class groups." Our colleagues reached that conclusion in rating Stalled this campaign promise from Trump: "Everybody is getting a tax cut, especially the middle class." National Review: "If they want to avoid raising taxes on a lot of middle-class families while sticking with their framework, Republicans are going to have to plug in the remaining numbers very carefully — and probably going to have to expand the child credit by more than $500 per child." Cato Institute, a libertarian-oriented group: "The problem is that ‘middle-class’ Americans pay little in federal income taxes, while ‘lower-income’ Americans pay virtually nothing. So Republican leaders are making promises that will be difficult to keep, and they are distracting themselves from the better message of growth and prosperity for all." Again, these analyses emphasized that many details have yet to be filled in. Finally, it’s worth noting that some provisions in the framework specifically benefit the well-to-do, as PolitiFact National found in rating False a claim by Trump that the plan has "very little benefit for people of wealth." The plan would: Eliminate the alternative minimum tax. This is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax. Eliminate the estate tax. Currently, for estates worth more than $5.49 million, the estate is generally 40 percent. Reduce from 39.6 percent to 25 percent the tax rate for "small and family-owned businesses conducted as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations" -- collectively, these are referred to as "passthrough" income. (Ryan argues that most small-business owners in Wisconsin, after business expenses are considered, are middle-class.) It’s worth noting, as PolitiFact New York found, that the framework would increase the number of people who don’t have to pay federal income tax, although that’s not something that helps the middle class. Our rating Ryan says the Republican tax reform proposal is focused on tax breaks for the middle class "and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break." Missing details in the framework for the tax reform make it difficult to tease out exactly how various taxpayers would fare, so it’s possible there will be more for middle-class taxpayers. But based on the framework, while there are some benefits for the middle class, what’s more clear is there are specific provisions benefiting the wealthy. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-01502	Greg Abbott "heads up a party whose platform calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/sep/24/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-republican-party-texas-platform-c/	State Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth opposed the mandate adopted by the 2011 Legislature requiring most Texas voters to present a photo ID at the polls. She was among Democrats who argued that the hurdle attacked non-existent fraud and would disproportionately affect lower-income and minority populations. In a Sept. 19, 2014, gubernatorial debate, Davis broadened her criticism of voter ID -- and her opponent Greg Abbott’s support for it — by saying that Abbott’s party fully objects to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was signed into law when Texan Lyndon B. Johnson was president. At the time, the law took aim at methods used to prevent African Americans from voting. The act specified that no "tests or devices" could be placed between citizens and their ballots, spelling out examples such as literacy tests. Section 5 required certain jurisdictions -- states or smaller political entities that had recently employed such methods and had less than 50 percent voter participation or registration in the last presidential election -- to get federal approval before changing election laws. But this element was invalidated in 2013 by the U.S. Supreme Court with Abbott among state attorneys general urging the decision. In the debate, Davis said Abbott "heads up a party whose platform calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act." Is all that so? Davis is right about the platform adopted by delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in June 2014, which says: "We urge that the Voter Rights Act of 1965, codified and updated in 1973, be repealed and not reauthorized." That provision appears, though, after another entry: "We support equal suffrage for all United States citizens of voting age who are not felons." Similar declarations -- favoring voting rights for non-felons and repeal of the Voting Rights Act -- appeared in the party’s 2012 platform. But the platform adopted by delegates to the party’s 2010 convention didn’t have the call to repeal. We see how a governor could be viewed as helming her or his political party. But the Republican Party in Texas is chaired by Steve Munisteri, a lawyer repeatedly elected by convention delegates to the post. And while we found no news reports on Abbott backing or opposing the 2014 repeal plank, a June 2014 news story in the San Antonio Express-News, quoted Munisteri saying generally: "It's not the Greg Abbott platform. He has his own platform." Abbott campaign spokesman Avdiel Huerta then said Abbott’s platform stresses jobs, education, roads, water and securing the border. Abbott’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries about whether Abbott personally favors repeal. Our ruling Davis said Abbott "heads up a party whose platform calls for the repeal of the Voting Rights Act." This claim is accurate about the state party platform. But Abbott may or may not support repeal; he also isn’t his party’s chief, though it’s fair to suggest any governor has a role in guiding his or her state party.

pomt-09731	The proposed excise tax on "Cadillac" health plans will hit "those making less than $200,000" the hardest.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/21/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-health-care-reform-taxes-middle-class/	Sarah Palin likes communicating directly with her fans via Facebook, where she's posted several notes about health care reform. In her latest note, titled "Good Intentions Aren't Enough with Health Care Reform," Palin criticized a proposal from the Senate Finance Committee as misguided and too expensive. Her note includes several criticisms of the Democratic proposal. We wanted to look specifically at what she had to say about excise taxes on high-dollar health plans. "Supposedly the Senate Finance bill will be paid for by cutting Medicare by nearly half a trillion dollars and by taxing the so-called 'Cadillac' health care plans enjoyed by many union members," Palin wrote. Those taxes and others will ultimately be passed on to consumers, she said. "The Senate Finance bill is effectively a middle class tax increase, and as (economist Douglas) Holtz-Eakin points out, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation those making less than $200,000 will be hit hardest," she said. Palin was referring to an op-ed Holtz-Eakin wrote for the Wall Street Journal ; you may remember he was the chief economic adviser to John McCain during the presidential campaign. We wanted to know if she was right that the taxes on 'Cadillac' plans would hit people who make less than $200,000 the hardest. The excise tax works in a roundabout way. Under the Senate Finance proposal from Sen. Max Baucus, insurance companies would have to pay a 40 percent excise tax on health insurance policies that exceed $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families; they would pay taxes on the amount that exceeds those thresholds. We spoke with three economists on both the left and the right, and they all agreed that insurance companies will not simply absorb the new tax; they will pass it along in the form of even higher premiums. Employers will then try to avoid the new higher costs by buying cheaper health plans. Finally, the economists agreed that if employers have to scale back on health plans, they will eventually pay higher wages as they seek to retain workers. At this point, disgruntled workers may say "Yeah, right," but the economists were adamant that it is the case. There are data that we won't get into now that back up their point. Here's where the analysis that Palin mentioned by the Joint Committee, which is nonpartisan and advises Congress on tax policy, comes in: At the Senate's request, it tried to figure out the effect of the excise tax on federal taxes collected. Like the economists we talked to, the Joint Committee also believes that wages will rise if employers select lower-priced health insurance, and the government gets to tax those higher wages. So the Joint Committee created a series of tables projecting how much additional income tax would be collected over the next 10 years. By 2019, about 87 percent of those people paying higher taxes would make less than $200,000, according to an analysis of the preliminary Senate Finance proposal. So here's what that means: If workers end up getting paid more, they'll also be taxed more. We have to point out that this analysis counts tax filers who would see any tax increase due to the excise tax proposal, and it doesn't give details on how much they would pay on average. And the excise tax only has the effect of increasing taxes for those who have high-dollar plans, roughly 25 percent or less of all tax filers in 2019. These are plans that generally have very low co-pays and lots of extras. A Boston Globe report described one plan as offering free surgery, free rehab for alcoholism, and reimbursements for yoga classes. CEOs have these types of plans, but so do some unionized workers. One of the economists we spoke with said they are usually offered by state and local governments and universities, the types of jobs known for great benefits. The plan the Boston Globe described was for state workers in New Hampshire. Still, the economists we talked to agreed that the excise tax would affect many people who make less than $200,000. And other parts of the bill wouldn't offset that. • "You would expect that over time the number of people who are exposed to this would grow," said Stephen Zuckerman, a health economist at the left-leaning Urban Institute. He still thinks it's a good idea. "If you really want to do health care reform, and expand Medicaid and provide subsidies for low-income people, you have to provide some way to pay for it. Putting a limit on the amount of insurance that can be tax-free is not unreasonable." • "The tax is not simply going to affect millionaires, it's going to affect some people who are middle income," said Paul Van de Water of the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Van de Water has nevertheless written a lengthy defense of the excise tax . • "Clearly a number of these provisions, this one included, will increase taxes on people below the $200,000 income level," said Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. "The idea that this is just for senior managers is actually quite wrong." Back to Palin: She said that according to the Joint Committee's report "those making less than $200,000 will be hit hardest" by the excise tax. We want to emphasize that the tax will affect only a minority of taxpayers. But Palin is right that of the taxpayers it does affect, a majority make less than $200,000, according to the Joint Committee analysis. It turns out a lot of regular Joes and Janes have those 'Cadillac' plans. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2009-10-21T18:08:06	2009-10-17	['None']

pomt-15144	The Obama administration is "proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/01/credo-action/obamas-words-and-actions-climate-dont-match-activi/	President Barack Obama is playing an environmental joke on us, according to a video by progressive activist group Credo Action. This week, Obama traveled to Alaska to promote his climate change agenda. But some environmental activists see the visit as hypocritical, considering some of his other policy decisions, such as permitting oil drilling in the Arctic. To highlight what it sees as contradictory policies, Credo Action released an annotated version of a White House video promoting the Alaska trip. Credo’s video says Obama’s trip is antithetical to some of his own policies, including "proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030." Credo is right that mining 10 billion tons of coal in quick order would more than negate any carbon reductions from Obama’s EPA plan. There’s just one problem: There’s no proposal to mine 10 billion tons of coal. What proposal? Credo’s source is a 2015 report by Greenpeace, another progressive environmental activist group. The report references the federal coal lease program, by which the government leases public lands to private companies for coal mining. The report said that a field office of the Bureau of Land Management in Buffalo, Wy., is proposing several new leases that would amount to 10.2 billion tons of coal. Greenpeace estimated that burning all 10.2 billion tons would result in almost 17 billion tons of carbon pollution. That dwarfs what the Environmental Protection Agency says Obama's Clean Power Plan will cut in carbon emissions. According to the EPA, the Clean Power Plan will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by about 870 million tons annually by 2030. Greenpeace used a National Resources Defense Council estimate of the cumulative emission reductions through 2030 -- 5.3 billion tons. Greenpeace’s carbon pollution calculation is reasonable, said Michael Mann, executive director of the Institute for Energy Studies at the University of North Dakota. Roughly 2.4 pounds of carbon are produced per pound of subbituminous coal (found in Wyoming) burned. The problem is that this 10.2 billion new tons of coal proposal is nonexistent. Greenpeace -- and others who have quoted this figure -- are distorting a single line buried in a 3,000-page report. In May 2015, the Wyoming field office released a resource management plan, which says the bureau "has estimated that it would issue 28 coal leases encompassing 106,400 acres with approximately 10.2 billion tons of coal...over the next 20 years." But this is not a proposal or prediction. This is an outer-bounds estimate generated solely for the purposes of analysis, bureau spokeswoman Kristen Lenhardt told PolitiFact. The figures refer to the maximum amount of development possible within the 20-year lifespan of the resource management plan. The many regulatory steps that happen before land is offered for a coal lease, as well as shifts in market demand, would affect the actual amount of land available. "It was not a plan for how much coal may, or may not be, leased in future years," she said. "It is highly unlikely that actual development during the period of the plan will be anywhere close to this number of leases or acres." Also noteworthy is the fact that the resource management plan did not designate any new lands for coal lease consideration. These 106,400 acres identified by the report were already categorized as lands that could be available for mining. Even if this were a real proposal, Credo’s timeline is unrealistic. It assumes that all 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal would be burned by 2030, which would require a staggering increase in coal use. The country has consumed around 1 billion tons of coal annually in recent years, and that’s including coal produced all over the country, not just Wyoming. There are not nearly enough power plants in the country for this to work, Mann said. The United States has fewer than 520 coal-fired plants, and that number is on the decline. "If we replaced all of the coal that is currently burned with this new coal from Wyoming, we still would not use that much coal," Mann said. Our ruling A video by Credo Action said the Obama administration is "proposing to mine another 10 billion tons of Wyoming coal, which would unleash three times more carbon pollution than Obama's Clean Power Plan would even save through 2030." Burning 10 billion tons of coal over the next 15 years would unleash more carbon pollution than the federal clean energy regulations expect to save in the same period of time. However, burning that much coal in that timeframe is unrealistic, and, more importantly, the government has not made such a proposal. Rather, the 10 billion tons figure refers to an estimate -- developed solely for analysis -- of the maximum amount of coal that could be available for mining in a particular region of Wyoming over the next 20 years. Credo’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. Correction, Sept. 8, 2015: We revised the explanation of Greenpeace's estimate of the Clean Power Plan's emission reductions by 2030 to reflect that the organization's estimate is cumulative over 15 years, while the EPA's estimate is annual.

pomt-15311	"It’s commercial vehicles, 18 wheelers and above … that cause 90 plus percent of the damages on our highways and bridges."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jul/19/gina-raimondo/raimondo-says-heavy-trucks-cause-over-90-percent-d/	The state’s bridges and highways need repair and part of Governor Raimondo’s proposed solution is to make the owners of big trucks pay the tab for bridge projects. On May 27, Raimondo announced that she hoped to raise $700 million for the "RhodeWorks" program by establishing tolls specifically for certain trucks. "Eighteen wheelers and above" was how she put it. Why was Rhode Island’s governor so focused on those types of trucks? "It’s commercial vehicles 18 wheelers and above and the fact of the matter is, those are the trucks that cause 90 plus percent of the damages on our highways and bridges. They're also the ones that benefit the most from high quality well-maintained roads," Raimondo said. Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed echoed Raimondo’s statement, saying the toll proposal would focus the "burden of bridge maintenance squarely and fairly on the large commercial trucks." That seemed like a lot of damage to pin on a small number of vehicles,18 wheelers and above. PolitiFact went to Marie Aberger, the governor’s spokeswoman, for an explanation. It turns out the governor had misspoken during her news conference that day under the rusting connector for Route 6 and Route 10. Soon after the governor made the statement, Aberger clarified it for reporters, telling them that the toll proposal wasn’t just for 18 wheelers and above. It was for large commercial trucks including 18 wheelers. At the time, Aberger also distributed a PowerPoint presentation that identified trucks subject to the toll — and ostensibly responsible for the damage. That group of vehicles included all tractor trailers, including some with more than 18 wheels as well as some big trucks with three or more axles, such as certain types of dump trucks. And what’s the evidence that this broader group of trucks causes 90 plus percent of damage to roads and bridges? The answer is complicated, but for decades, engineers have agreed that heavy trucks cause far more damage than other lighter vehicles. The damage caused by a single heavy truck can be 9,600 times the damage caused by a single car, according to a U.S. General Accounting Office report cited by the governor’s office. Finally, six separate damage calculations given to PolitiFact by the administration show, in all but one case, that the damage caused by heavy trucks appears to exceed 90 percent of all vehicle-related damage. But what about ice and salt, snow and flooding? Or maintenance? Or the age of the highway? The governor didn’t say anything about other important factors — including weather damage, leaving the impression that those 18-wheelers were almost entirely to blame. On that point, Aberger said that the administration’s damage calculations were only for damage caused by vehicles. That, she said, was the governor’s focus when she said heavy trucks were responsible for "for 90 plus percent of the damages on our highways and bridges." A spokesman at the Department of Transportation had a similar explanation. Interestingly, the GAO report that the administration cited prominently as a source for its calculations on vehicle-related road and bridge damage lists weather as one of four principal factors in the deterioration of roads and bridges. "There are several reasons why highways deteriorate," says the report. "Principal among these are weather, deferred maintenance, highway age, and increased traffic." Our ruling Raimondo’s claim that "18 wheelers and above cause 90 plus percent of the damages to our highways and bridges" was quickly corrected by her spokeswoman. Fine. But neither Raimondo nor the state’s PowerPoint discussed damage from weather — or from deferred maintenance for that matter — leaving the impression that those heavy trucks were the only problem. For those reasons, we rate her statement, Half True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-08936	"We caught (the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) lying to us about the results of air quality studies in the Barnett Shale."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/25/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-commission-environmental-qu/	Speaking at the Texas Democratic convention last month, Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, lambasted the state agency responsible for approving permits to pollute the air. "The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality — what a joke," she said during a speech to delegates June 26. "In my district, we caught them lying to us about the results of air quality studies in the Barnett Shale. They are playing with the health and safety of our communities, and we are going to tell them that is not acceptable." First, the basics: When we contacted Davis to elaborate on her statement, Davis said that "we" meant the public. But was TCEQ lying? The answer to that question is more complicated. From Dec. 15-17, TCEQ tested air samples collected at 126 natural gas production sites in Fort Worth for toxic pollutants. Natural gas drilling creates pollution from a couple sources, according to the Star-Telegram: the tank batteries that store wastewater and condensate — a light form of crude oil that often vents into the atmosphere — and the motors that drive pipeline compressors. Plus, drillers vent natural gas into the atmosphere when they complete a well. Fort Worth covers about 6 percent of the Barnett Shale, a natural gas field that covers more than 20 counties, according to the Star-Telegram. On Jan. 12, John Sadlier, deputy director of the office of compliance and enforcement at TCEQ, presented the results to the Fort Worth City Council. "Based on this study, the air is safe," he said, reporting that the agency didn't find pollutants at levels that could cause health problems. Eight slides accompanying the presentation had a red disclaimer noting that the samples had not been collected, analyzed or reviewed following specific protocol for quality control. TCEQ spokesman Terry Clawson told us that the city had asked TCEQ to perform tests "as quickly as possible" using the agency's mobile laboratory. (The request came on the heels of testing in DISH, a nearby town, that revealed high levels of benzene and other compounds.) While the mobile lab enables results to be produced within hours after samples are taken, Clawson said, the testing didn't meet national standards. Davis pointed out that the slides shown to the city council clearly said that benzene didn't exceed the levels considered safe for both short-term and long-term health, instead of noting that the data to prove that wasn't available. On Feb. 3, someone filed a fraud complaint with the TCEQ chief auditor's office, alleging the agency's monitoring operation had knowingly reported "inaccurate and misleading" information based on inadequate testing methods for butadiene, isoprene and benzene. The office initiated an audit, reporting the results on March 25. According to the audit memo, shortly after the council presentation, Sadlier questioned the validity of the data and ordered further tests. TCEQ sent the air samples to its lab using a more sensitive analysis. On Jan. 22, those tests showed that several samples measured benzene, a byproduct of gas drilling known to cause cancer in humans, at levels that exceeded those considered safe for people's long-term health. TCEQ did not report the new results to council members. The memo said Sadlier ordered more tests in February. Once more, TCEQ detected benzene, but not at levels that exceeded state standards. Clawson told us those results were published in a report dated April 26. The report was shared with the city of Fort Worth and posted on the agency's website on May 21. Davis said that it was "buried," so that someone visiting the site wouldn't know it was there unless they were looking for it. Still with us? On June 1, TCEQ released results from samples taken at two sites in late April — that would be the fourth round of tests — that again showed levels of benzene exceeding the state's long-term health standard. "State officials have said the level is not enough to cause immediate health problems, but it could make people sick if they were exposed continually for several years. It also serves as an indication that more testing in the area is needed," according to a June 2 Star-Telegram article. Clawson told us that TCEQ later collected more samples at the two facilities and did not find benzene that exceeded short-term or long-term exposure levels. That report was published and distributed to the City of Fort Worth on July 7, he said. Clawson told us that the agency regrets "the failure to communicate the results to the city in a more timely fashion." However, he also said that during presentation to the Fort Worth City Council, "we stated that tests found 'no cause for concern.' This statement was true then, and it is true today." As for the fraud complaint against the agency, the March 25 auditor's report concluded that the information provided to Sadlier from the first round of tests "while technically correct, could be considered to be misleading." It did not find evidence that Monitoring Operation's management knew the information was misleading. Sadlier said he didn't know the equipment couldn't detect lower levels of benzene when he talked to city officials, according to a May 28 Dallas Morning News article. Just a few days after TCEQ posted the toxicology report online May 21, the Texas Observer broke the story about the fraud complaint and audit, prompting Davis to issue a press release blasting the agency for waiting "four months to reveal these disturbing test results. The agency had determined the public had been exposed to elevated levels of benzene, and yet the public and their elected officials were not made aware of these exposures." On May 28 Davis filed a 30-point open-records request, asking for all TCEQ documents and communications related to benzene and other potentially harmful chemicals that may, could be, or are found in the air above the Barnett Shale. In our conversation with Davis last week, she said that Mark Vickery, executive director of the TCEQ, had called her to apologize. "He was very contrite, expressed great apology for not having revealed to me the information before," she said, adding that Vickery told her TCEQ didn't think the January test results posed "a serious health risk and therefore did not disclose it." Where does that leave us? First, TCEQ reported data that backed up the agency's claim that emissions from the Barnett Shale sites in Fort Worth were safe, but those tests could not measure lower levels of toxic chemicals. Subsequently, more sensitive tests have gone back and forth: some showed benzene levels exceeding the standard for long-term health effects and some did not. Until recently, the agency has not reported the results promptly. To Davis' point: TCEQ waited four months to alert officials of the January tests that detected elevated levels of benzene. Did the agency lie, as Davis claimed? Or simply fail to disclose — by TCEQ's own admission — in a timely fashion? "Hiding the truth is lying," Davis said. However, absent proof of an intent to deceive, we rate her statement Half True. Should her open-records request yield new information that shows the TCEQ knowingly lied to the public, we'll reconsider our rating.

pomt-06496	"The IRS is already planning on 19,500 new employees to administer" Obama’s health care mandate.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/13/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-irs-will-hire-19500-new-workers-/	During the Bloomberg-Washington Post debate at Dartmouth College Oct. 11, 2011, presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman took his turn taking shots at President Barack Obama’s health care bill along with the other seven GOP front runners. When Rick Santorum declared that repealing Obamacare would boost job creation, Herman Cain, Mitt Romney and Huntsman each shared ways to get the federal mandate off the table. Cain and Huntsman joined Santorum’s attack against Romney’s suggested waivers, which they said, would not do the trick. "It's disingenuous to -- to just say that you can -- you can waive it all away," Huntsman said. "The mandate will be in place. The IRS is already planning on 19,500 new employees to administer that mandate. That will stay, and that's the ruinous part of Obamacare." Huntsman's claim that the Internal Revenue Service planned to hire 19,500 new employees caught our attention, and his logic seemed similar to claims we’ve checked before. We decided to look into Huntsman’s interpretation to see how his figures compared. First, we contacted Huntsman’s campaign to find out where he got his numbers, but spokesman Tim Miller said the campaign researcher could not be reached by our deadline. Fortunately, both PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Georgia had reviewed similar claims. FactCheck.org, a nonprofit fact-checking team, has also done similar checks. PolitiFact National first checked U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill.,who was involved in early fights over the health care legislation. Kirk said at the time, "according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people ... to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates" of the health care bill. Kirk’s attribution was misleading, PolitiFact ruled, as the 16,500 Kirk cited actually came from an estimation made by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation. The CBO, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, actually offered a cost estimate of $5 billion to $10 billion over 10 years but did not suggest how those costs would translate into IRS jobs. Republicans picked the high end of the CBO estimate and then estimated the numbers of employees from there in order to favor their case, PolitiFact found. Republicans on Ways and Means even acknowledged that their figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs if factoring in overhead costs including desks and office supplies in addition to salaries. Kirk got a Mostly False from PolitiFact National. A similar assertion about hiring new agents came up when Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas said it would take "16,500 armed bureaucrats to make this program work." FactCheck.org, who researched Paul’s statement, noted Paul had mischaracterized what the Ways and Means Republicans had said about number of potential IRS employees. IRS agents actually make up a small percentage of the total IRS workforce, while clerks, accountants, administrators, attorneys, help-line workers and other non-enforcement employees, make up the bulk. Only a minor portion of IRS agents are armed law enforcement officers who work on criminal cases. FactCheck.org called Paul’s statement a "wildly inaccurate claim." PolitiFact National again ruled on a similar IRS agent claim made by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, but gave her a better Truth-O-Meter rating than Kirk. Bachmann chose to say the health care bill "may" put those agents in charge of policing the bill--not that they would--which earned her a Half True. Since Bachmann’s statement, the IRS submitted a budget request to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for fiscal year 2012 that includes estimates for workers needed to begin implementing the health care bill. PolitiFact read the 159-page budget request and found requests for 1,269 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes, at a cost of $473.4 million. But most of the requests were made for IRS support roles such as information technology or customer service. Few were for agents. So when PolitiFact Georgia joined the party to rule on a statement made by Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., -- that the IRS estimated it must hire "16,500 agents at a cost of $10 billion to the taxpayer" to enforce the federal health care overhaul - -Chambliss got a False. No, not an IRS estimate. No, not agents. And no, not 16,500. Finally, if we turn to Huntsman’s assertion during the debate that 19,500 employees will be needed to administer Obama’s health care mandate, we find it contains problems similar to previous claims we checked. Huntsman started a little more on target than some of his Truth-O-Meter predecessors, but his claim recycles misinterpreted numbers once again. Huntsman’s claim estimates the IRS employees, rather than IRS agents, that will be tied to the health care bill. But Huntsman exaggerates when he says the IRS plans for almost 20,000 employees to administer the mandate. Really it was Ways and Means Committee Republicans, taking only the high end of the CBO's cost predictions, which floated the 16,500 employee number, while admitting they didn’t calculate overhead costs to offset those numbers. And since the IRS’ own budget request estimates about 1,300 new employees in 2012 to administer the health care bill, mostly in non-enforcement roles, Huntsman’s 19,500 employee estimate is a new extreme for this claim. Not only does Huntsman repeat it wrongly, attributing it to the IRS, he kicks up figures that have been repeatedly debunked.	None	Jon Huntsman	None	None	None	2011-10-13T17:03:24	2011-10-11	['None']

pomt-14570	Says Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele "once proposed a plan to end county funding to homeless shelters."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/09/chris-larson/chris-larson-says-chris-abele-tried-end-funding-ho/	As the first bitter cold snap of the winter struck Milwaukee, state Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) used the weather as a backdrop for a jab at Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele. Larson, who is among three challengers facing Abele in the Feb. 16, 2016 primary election, has made care for the homeless a cornerstone of his campaign. Milwaukee County government and Abele, he says, have not done enough. Larson has criticized Abele over how the county handled funding for programs for the homeless, especially after the loss of a federal grant that helped pay some of the costs for such programs. At one point, he held a news conference in the bitter cold out in front of Abele’s downtown luxury condo to drive home his point, arguing Abele ignored the less fortunate. In a Jan. 7, 2016 Facebook post, Larson claimed: "Abele once proposed a plan to end county funding to homeless shelters." Is Larson right? Did Abele propose a plan to end all county funding for the homeless? While we waited for Larson’s campaign to provide backup for the claim, we noticed the Facebook posting had been removed. That’s never a good sign. Larson campaign manager Josh Kilroy then emailed several times about the scrubbed statement. "Like many social media posts, it was written in haste (by me, I might add) and not as nuanced as it should have been," Kilroy wrote. "The post should have noted that Abele has been trying to end supplemental funding that has been used in recent years to replace money that used to come from the federal government." That elaborated on what the post said, but didn’t explain the statement. We asked again. Kilroy said the Facebook post simply was missing a word -- supplemental. The post, he said, "not only inaccurately described Abele's policy, it inaccurately states Larson's own position, which has always been to criticize Abele's repeated attempts to remove the additional $300,000 from the budget. He added: "As the author of the Facebook post you inquired about, I apologize for any misrepresentation of Abele’s record." Well OK, then. Before we go any further, let’s look at Abele’s record on funding for the homeless. It’s been the subject of budget disputes between the county executive and the board for several years. In 2012, the first budget under Abele, and for 2013, the county included $718,000 in such funding. Of that, $300,000 came from federal money. However, that federal funding ended for the 2014 budget year. And in that year and in the two subsequent budgets, Abele’s budget included the $418,000 the county had been paying for the homeless programs. The County Board then added $300,000 in county funding to replace the federal money. For the 2014 budget, Abele did not veto the amendment providing the additional funding, but said he viewed it as a one-time allocation. The homeless shelters, he said, should seek new sources of revenue. The following year, Abele did not add the money in his budget, but the board did. He vetoed it, but that veto was overridden. In the fall of 2015 for the 2016 budget, the board added the funds, but this time around Abele did not veto the amendment. One thing is clear from this back-and-forth: at no point did Abele ever proposed ending all county funding to homeless shelters. Rather, the debate has been over whether or not the county should pick up the costs that were previously covered by the feds. So for the five years Abele has been county executive, he’s included at least $418,000 for homeless shelters. Abele’s administration argues that funding for county programs to help the homeless has increased under his leadership. Housing administrator James Mathy said those increases included $750,000 in the 2016 budget for case management, staffing and other services to end chronic homelessness; $1.37 million to develop "new supportive housing units for the homeless used to cover case management services and rental subsidies" from 2013 to 2015 and $500,000 for development of an apartment project to support the chronically homeless who have severe alcohol additions. In a statement issued at a news conference outside Abele’s condo, Larson was quoted as saying: "Homelessness remains a problem for many Milwaukee families, and Abele's recurring pattern of ignoring the needs of Milwaukee's homeless citizens is inexcusable." The news release added: "As County Executive, Larson will maintain the increased funding for emergency shelters." Our rating Larson said on Facebook that Abele "once proposed a plan to end county funding to homeless shelters." After we asked about the claim, the post disappeared, Larson’s campaign manager said it was wrong and apologized. We rate Larson’s claim False.

pomt-05557	Says gubernatorial recall candidate Tom Barrett supported passage of Gov. Scott Walker’s bill stripping collective bargaining of state employees.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/06/afscme/state-employees-union-says-barrett-supported-law-g/	With Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett jumping into the Democratic primary in the recall election against Republican Gov. Scott Walker, his opponents are digging in against him. One of the first salvos came from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME, the largest state employees union. The union is supporting former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk in the race. The recall, of course, was prompted by the 2011 passage of Act 10, Walker’s contentious changes that eliminated many collective bargaining provisions for most public employee unions and required workers to pay more for health insurance and pensions. In an April 3, 2012 message to members, AFSCME described its qualms with Barrett under this headline: "Barrett enters race for governor with some baggage." The message -- posted by an AFSCME arm that serves unions representing state and local government and school district employees all over the state -- said, in part: "While hundreds of thousands rallied outside the Capitol in the cold of winter, and 14 brave senators stood their ground to block the law, Barrett — two days before the vote, and on right-wing radio — actually advocated for the strategy Walker eventually used to ram through the bill." It added: "Simply put, when Scott Walker came for our rights and 14 Democratic heroes made huge personal sacrifice at huge political risk, Tom Barrett wasn’t standing in solidarity, he was on right-wing talk radio pontificating about how to undermine their efforts." The claim traces back to a video that was posted on YouTube on March 30, 2012, the same day Barrett announced his candidacy. The video heading: "Barrett: How to ram through Act. 10... ‘The bill should pass.’ " The video is based on audio segments of a March 7, 2011 radio interview Barrett did as part of WTMJ-AM (620) host Charlie Sykes’ annual issues show, "Insight 2011," which features various newsmakers. In the video, Barrett is presented as offering his solution to the standoff between Walker and the 14 Senate Democrats who had left the state to block action on the measure. "I honestly think there is a pretty clear path as to how we work our way out of this," Barrett says. "Collective bargaining changes are not fiscal ... the Fiscal Bureau and others have said they are not fiscal. You could vote on those without those missing senators. You could vote on those tomorrow morning." Then the video adds this Barrett statement: "And the bill would pass. And the bill should pass." We asked AFSCME for its back-up about its claim. "We did not create the video," said AFSCME spokesman Robert Allen, "but it does comport with our criticism of Barrett's behavior during the standoff over Act 10, which is why we passed it along to members." Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak countered: "The assertion in this video is pure fantasy. This is a hack and stitch job that would make Frankenstein proud." So which is it? Was Barrett really in cahoots with Walker in supporting the collective bargaining changes of Act 10? Let’s rewind the tape. The whole tape. And let’s add the context. On Feb. 11, 2011 Walker introduced his budget repair bill. In addition to calling for public employees to pay more for their pensions and health care, the bill contained the provision to end most collective bargaining provisions. That aspect surprised even top Republicans and left Democrats and unions howling in protest. (We rated as False a claim from Walker that he campaigned on the changes.) The 14 Senate Democrats left the state to block consideration of the bill. And labor leaders soon stated they could agree to the higher payments for pensions and health care -- so long as the other collective bargaining changes were not part of it. Barrett took a similar view at the time. Indeed, we previously rated his position as a No Flip, since from the start he advocated workers paying more for pensions and health care. In fact, Barrett -- a former state legislator -- had suggested a way to end the stalemate even before appearing on the Sykes show: Break the bill in two. That is, separate the collective bargaining changes from the changes to pension and health insurance, and vote on the second piece -- the part the unions said they would support. The collective bargaining piece, he said, should be set aside for future debate. In the same Feb. 24, 2011 news conference Barrett said Walker was focused on busting unions. "It's now clear to us that this is an ideological war, and it's a national ideological war, and the purpose of it is to take away the rights of people who work for the government" to bargain collectively, Barrett said. "It is time we return to our Wisconsin, the Wisconsin where we can sit down at the table and work out our differences," he said. "Let's end the circus. Let's solve the problem." Barrett made the same point on the Sykes show. Only the video creatively edits out a critical part of the statement. On the radio, Barrett went on to say: "I would vote for the changes in the health care and the pension. I would vote no on the changes in collective bargaining." So his position against the collective bargaining changes was clear. Also on the radio show, it was clear that when Barrett said "this bill should pass" he had switched the topic to voting on a bill that would include the pension and health insurance givebacks, not the limits on collective bargaining. Here it is in context. "Again, I think the vast majority of people in the state agree that public employees should pay more towards their health care and their pensions. The bill will do that, and the bill will pass. And the bill should pass." AFSCME spokesman Allen said he did not know why the video did not include the full quote from Barrett. But he also said it does not matter in relation to the union’s position and statement. Allen said the union felt Barrett undercut its leverage at a key moment. It was still trying to get Walker to sit down and negotiate a bill that would have locked in the employee health and pension contributions without limiting bargaining rights. Allen added: "And Barrett offered that non-existent hypothetical on voting against half the bill only after he said ‘the bill should pass.’ " But that misstates Barrett’s position and what was said. Our conclusion The largest state employee union says Barrett supported Walker’s bill to strip most collective bargaining rights from public employees. The group cites a video that includes a snippet of a radio interview in which Barrett suggests a way to break the stalemate. Barrett did say it was important to separate the higher pension and health care payments from the collective bargaining changes. But he made it clear this was so the piece with broad support -- even from the unions -- could move forward. In the part cut from the video, Barrett clearly states: "I would vote no on the changes in collective bargaining." We rate the union’s claim False.

pomt-04483	Says Tennessee is providing "millions of dollars" to virtual school company for "results at the bottom of the bottom."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/07/andy-berke/chattanooga-senator-slaps-virtual-school-company-r/	As Tennessee continues to grow its reputation as one of the nation’s most aggressive states when it comes to implementing the latest wave of education reforms, some lawmakers remain skeptical about new laws designed to provide what proponents like to describe as "school choice." Perhaps the state’s most vocal challenger to the assumptions of reformers is Andy Berke, a Democratic state senator from Chattanooga. He has penned editorial pieces opposing so-called state-funded voucher programs for students. More recently, Berke has led the charge against the state law allowing for "virtual schools" to set up shop in Tennessee counties. As the 2012-13 school year began, Berke brought attention to what he described as dismal results by the K12 Inc., the publicly traded online education company that is under contract with Union County Public Schools. In a letter to Senate education committee chairwoman Dolores Gresham, R-Somerville, Berke assailed K12’s performance and asked for an inquiry. In the statement we are examining, Berke said "millions of dollars are flowing to K12 and all we're getting from them are results at the bottom of the bottom." First, some background on how virtual schools work in Tennessee, courtesy of an article from The Commercial Appeal’s education reporters, Jane Roberts: "The K-8 academy is run by K12 Inc., the largest publicly traded online learning company. It has more than 100,000 full-time students in 30-plus states. In fiscal year 2011, revenue increased 36 percent to $522.4 million, according to the company's most recent 10K, filed in October. "K12 contracted with Union County Schools, a tiny rural district in East Tennessee, to manage the Tennessee effort. After a heavy advertising campaign last summer, the academy opened in fall of 2011, serving about 1,800 elementary-age children who go to school sitting at home in front of their computers. "This year, enrollment jumped to 3,000 students, including a total of 439 students from Memphis City Schools (243) and Shelby County Schools (196). The virtual academy gets the state portion of education tax revenue, which averages about $4,500 per child. As the fiscal agent, Union County schools gets about 4 percent." We asked Berke, a lawyer, to provide some proof to back up his statement. He passed along state documents showing budget allocations and performances in the two key metrics measured by the state’s department of education, achievement test results and value-added teaching results that measure student growth. Budget documents and press reports show that Union County paid $5.04 million in state funds to K12 for 2011-12, and this year Union County’s share of state funding is rising 65 percent, to $8.23 million, because of those big boosts in Tennessee Virtual Academy (TVA) enrollment. In terms of performance, a letter Berke provided from Tennessee Department of Education Commissioner Kevin Huffman shows that, on the value-added front, the TVA run by K12 did indeed land at the bottom of the bottom, with scores of 1 on a scale going to 5 and a negative-index putting student growth at the bottom of the state’s rankings. On achievement tests, TVA showed that among students in grades 3-8, 16.4 percent scored advanced or proficient in math and 39.3 percent scored advanced or proficient in reading. Not good, by any measure, but was it the bottom of the bottom? According to the most recent data (LINK TK), only 16 of Tennessee’s 136 school districts had fewer than 40 percent of their students scoring proficient or advanced in reading, with 13 doing worse than TVA. In math, TVA was dead last, and no other district had fewer than 21 percent of its students scoring proficient or advanced. K12 and TVA have defended themselves in various ways. Josh Williams, TVA head of schools, suggested it was unfair to judge on just its first year of results. "They are not a performance indicator of what we are going to do. … I'd like to have a couple of years' data to see what we can do," he said. Williams also said a late start for TVA last year meant that more than half of the students enrolled after the 20th day of school. However, even Huffman, who is very sympathetic to the "school choice" movement, has criticized K12’s performance, telling the Chattanooga Times-Free Press, "Its performance is demonstrably poor." As Roberts pointed out in her piece, the National Education Policy Center last year released a report that was critical of K12, finding that the on-time graduation rate for K12 was 49.1 percent compared to 79.4 percent average in the states where K12 operates schools. Our ruling One of the state’s leading critics of aggressive "school choice" reforms said the state is sending millions of dollars to a virtual-school company but getting results that are "at the bottom of the bottom." The numbers back him up. We rate this statement True.	None	Andy Berke	None	None	None	2012-10-07T08:34:31	2012-08-31	['None']
pomt-01876	"Justice John Roberts Signed Off On Obama’s Arrest For Treason."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/09/blog-posting/did-john-roberts-issue-arrest-warrant-barack-obama/	In some corners, impeachment talk is running high these days. Sarah Palin, the former Republican nominee for vice president, wrote on her Facebook page on July 8, 2014, that "it’s time" to impeach President Barack Obama. But a claim that’s been making the rounds in the conservative blogosphere over the past few months is even more startling. It says that John Roberts, the chief justice of the United States, has ordered Obama’s arrest for treason. The claim appeared on numerous conservative websites in April and May, including here, here, here, here and here. In this item, we’ll check the version of the claim that appeared on May 1, 2014, in theuspatriot.com, a conservative website. (The website did not respond to a query from PolitiFact.) The headline of the post says, "BREAKING: Report Circulating That Justice John Roberts Signed Off On Obama’s Arrest For Treason." The rest of the post is not exactly transparently sourced, citing "serious speculation" and an unlinked-to "leaked document." "There is some serious speculation that Chief Justice John Roberts has signed off on Interpol, which would mean that Obama is one step closer to being removed from office for multiple counts of treason," the post says. "Charges include infringements of the Second Amendment, and declaring war without consent of Congress, and some other serious violations of Obama’s Oath." It goes on to cite a litany of alleged infractions by Obama, which we’ve archived here. The post on this site alone had received more than 237,000 Facebook likes at the time we looked into it. Is there anything to this post? No, say legal experts, it’s entirely bunk. (The Supreme Court did not comment for this story, as is its general policy.) For starters, the phrase "Chief Justice John Roberts has signed off on Interpol" is not even "coherent English, let alone a statement that makes any constitutional sense," said Stephen Wermiel, a law professor at American University’s Washington College of Law. Moreover, the powers of the chief justice are far more limited than this blog post imagines, Wermiel and other legal experts said. The chief justice "has no authority to sign off on a warrant of any kind," said Paul Finkelman, a law professor at Albany Law School. About the only type of arrest the chief justice could set into motion would be to "direct the sergeant at arms to remove a disruptive member of the audience" at an oral argument in the Supreme Court building, said Kurt T. Lash, director of the program on constitutional theory, history and law at the University of Illinois. "It would be a serious violation of separation of powers for the court as a whole to involve itself" in allegations of treason by the president, Lash said. "In cases where the president might refuse to follow a lawful directive of the court -- say, a failure to turn over Oval Office tapes -- the court would simply report the matter to Congress for their consideration of impeachment. The court itself would take no action against the president." If the House did proceed to impeach the president, the Senate would hold a trial -- and at that point, the chief justice would enter the picture, as the presiding officer over the trial in the Senate chamber. But that’s quite different than the scenario the blog post lays out, since the chief justice would be entering the fray at the final stage of a president’s possible removal, not as the official initiating it. "Given his longtime participation as an advocate before the Supreme Court before joining the bench, John Roberts would know this, as does pretty much everyone else," Lash said. The likelihood that this rumor is false, Lash said, "is 100 percent." Our ruling Bloggers said Roberts "signed off on Obama’s arrest for treason." But even if he wanted to, the Constitution wouldn’t allow it. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2014-07-09T16:32:43	2014-07-01	['None']
pomt-01593	In Georgia, Perdue’s company closed plants and moved jobs to China.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/05/michelle-nunn/claim-about-perdues-former-firm-hits-mark/	Two political newcomers running in a closely watch battle to represent Georgia in the U.S. Senate share the title CEO. Democrat Michelle Nunn characterizes herself as a problem solver and consensus builder from her leadership at Points of Light, a nonprofit volunteer group. Republican David Perdue highlights his tenure as an executive with Fortune 500 firms as the experience needed to tackle free-market problems in Washington. In her first round of ads, Nunn aims to sharpen that distinction by criticizing her opponent’s experience. "In Georgia, Perdue’s company closed plants and moved jobs to China," the ad says. Given the winner of the Senate race will help decide which party will control the Congressional chamber, PolitiFact Georgia decided to drill down on the claim. To do so, we have to jump back to a time of dial-up Internet and grunge music at the top of the charts. It was 1992 when Perdue was named a senior vice president for Sara Lee. He told PolitiFact that he was sent to Hong Kong for two years to increase manufacturing and contracts in Asia for the firm. "I was sent to Asia to open those markets for Sara Lee, and we did," Perdue said. "That was the direction of the company at the time." Perdue’s effort to open the region for Sara Lee was a success, as was the firm for part of that time. Sara Lee was founded in 1939 as a food processing and distribution company. Its iconic name came from the 1956 purchase of the Kitchens of Sara Lee, a Chicago bakery known for its cheesecake. By the early 1990s, though, Sara Lee had expanded worldwide and into other industries with its purchase of Hanes Corporation and Coach leather goods, among others. For the first three years of the decade, the company rapidly splurged even more, focusing on foreign firms and other well-known brands such as undergarment maker Playtex, Investors began to question the company’s broad vision, though. The result was the first of several major restructuring plans and layoffs in 1994, Perdue’s last year with Sara Lee. The 1994 overhaul eliminated 9,900 jobs worldwide, while "realigning production and distribution facilities throughout the world," according to SEC filings. Among the casualties were 540 jobs at apparel plants in Cartersville, Milledgeville and Wrightsville. A fourth Georgia plant, in Midway, was also shut down, though the number of jobs lost was not published. Sara Lee’s annual report from 1994 does not break down how many of its 144,900 employees were domestic or foreign. However, a statement from the company at the time said most of the eliminated jobs were at European operations. The annual report does note the company’s success in manufacturing and sales in Asia, especially in China, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong, now part of China. "David Perdue says he's the better candidate because he's spent his career in the 'real world,' but at too many stops along the way, he seemed to prosper while the people who worked for him saw their livelihoods taken away," said Nunn spokesman Nathan Click. By all indications, the outsourcing effort at Sara Lee did have that effect. The company expanded what it made and sold in Asia, at a time when it was closing facilities elsewhere, including in Georgia. As a senior vice president, Perdue had limited input on that direction. But he did execute Sara Lee’s effort, which the company lauded in its own annual report to federal regulators. Nunn’s claim is carefully worded to say Perdue’s company, not the candidate himself, was shutting Georgia plants at a time it was adding jobs in Asia. News reports and company filings back up the claim. We rate Nunn’s claim True.	None	Michelle Nunn	None	None	None	2014-09-05T00:00:00	2014-08-12	['China', 'Georgia_(U.S._state)']
pomt-01530	"There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/18/facebook-posts/can-someone-afford-apartment-making-minimum-wage/	What kind of apartment can you afford on a minimum-wage salary? Your options may be very limited. "There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment," says a Facebook graphic posted Sept. 11 from OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans. At PolitiFact, we’ve noticed a growing number of Facebook users sharing graphics generated by OurTime.org. Its following on Facebook has grown from 100,000 in February to half a million today, and readers are constantly asking us to verify the information the group posts in catchy shareables. The posts tend to highlight progressive issues, like income inequality and the cost of higher education. This particular post had just over 9,000 shares on Sept. 17. Given its reach — and the focus from Democrats on the minimum wage this election cycle — we wanted to give it a look. OurTime.org cited the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a group that advocates for policies that improve housing for the poor, as a source on the graphic. Each year, the National Low Income Housing Coalition publishes a report that calculates what they call the "housing wage," or the hourly wage a full-time worker must earn to afford a decent two-bedroom rental home. The findings of the study are summed up in the introduction: "The 2014 two-bedroom Housing Wage is $18.92. This national average is more than two-and-a-half times the federal minimum wage, and 52 percent higher than it was in 2000. In no state can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom rental unit at Fair Market Rent." Four important words are included in the report that aren’t in the Facebook graphic: "at Fair Market Rent." That’s a critical distinction. What is Fair Market Rent? It’s an official number calculated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that helps in determining subsidy levels for low-income renters. The department surveys rent prices in 530 metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan counties, and on a scale of all the rents being charged in a metro area, establishes a unique Fair Market Rent at the 40th percentile. This means that 40 percent of the rental properties in that area are at or below that threshold. So the Fair Market Rent is set just a bit below average rents in a given area. For example, in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area of Florida, the Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $951. Sixty percent of two-bedroom apartments in the area are more expensive than this, but 40 percent of them are at or below $951. The federal government does not create a state-based average for Fair Market Rent, but the National Low Income Housing Coalition created one by weighting government data with U.S. Census data on rental populations. The Fair Market Rent of a two-bedroom apartment in Florida costs $1,008 a month, or $12,096 a year. How much would someone need to make to afford that? Get out your calculators and scratch paper because it takes some math. The standard used by the federal government is that housing shouldn’t cost more than 30 percent of an individual’s income. That leaves people with enough money for other necessities like food, transportation, a phone, etc. For low-income individuals and families, anything more than 30 percent is teetering on homelessness, said Megan Bolton, research director for the National Low Income Housing Coalition. So if someone is making the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, they can afford rent of $377 a month. Obviously, that’s a good bit less than Florida’s Fair Market Rent of $1,008 for a two-bedroom apartment. For a person to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Florida would require a gross income of $40,355, or $19.39 an hour. That’s well above the minimum wage in Florida of $7.93, which is actually set a touch higher than the federal minimum wage. This does not factor in any housing assistance an individual might receive through the federal government. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s largest program assists 1.2 million households, a spokesman said. Of course, there are cheaper places to live than Florida. At $653 a month, Arkansas has the lowest Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment. Even at that price, it would take a wage of $12.56 an hour to afford the rent, according to the government’s definition. Let’s break it down further, though. According to the federal government, in rural Arkansas, the Fair Market Rent is $561. That would require an hourly wage of $10.79. Arkansas’ minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. What about states and cities that have much higher minimum wages than the federal standard? Washington state has a minimum wage of $9.32, and Seattle recently raised its to $15 an hour. But there, the Fair Market Rent of a two-bedroom apartment is higher and still outpaces the minimum wage, the study found. In most states, it would actually take the equivalent of two or more minimum wage salaries to afford a Fair Market Rent. The National Low Income Housing Coalition found this to be true of one-bedroom apartments, too. This isn’t to say that there aren’t apartments for much cheaper than the Fair Market Rate. At the 40th percentile, by definition, means 40 percent of rental properties in that area are at that price or cheaper — which is why it was important that the National Low Income Housing Coalition included that qualifier, and why it is somewhat misleading that OurTime.org did not. "Absolutely, certainly there are places with rents at $377, especially if you’re in smaller areas, and they may be of okay quality," Bolton said. "If a minimum wage earner can get an apartment at that price, it would be affordable for them." However, cheaper might also have other tradeoffs, like being in an area with higher crime rates or low-performing schools, or it might just be a crummy apartment. Our ruling The Facebook graphic by OurTime.org claimed, "There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment." The group left out a key distinction from the study they cite: Minimum wage workers can’t afford a two-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent, a number determined by the federal government for each region set at the 40th percentile of all rents in that area. That means that in some areas, minimum wage earners would be able to find and afford housing that is cheaper than the Fair Market Rent. Though, in states where rent is more expensive, minimum wage earners would not be able to afford apartments even well below the Fair Market Rent. The point is reasonably on target and applies to the vast majority of minimum wage workers looking for quality rental housing. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-15280	Says under his leadership "Wisconsin median household income" is up 2.7%, while it is down 1.3% nationally under President Obama.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-under-his-leadership-incomes-are/	As he pursues his 2016 presidential bid, Republican Gov. Scott Walker is trying to show Americans they would be better off under his leadership than under President Barack Obama. In a July 21, 2015 tweet, Walker argued that by at least one measure, people in Wisconsin are better off than nationally. "Under Walker, Wisconsin’s median household income +2.7% - Under Obama: -1.3%. RT if you prefer #Walker16" At the end of the tweet, Walker linked to a New York Post article titled, "How workers are winning in Scott Walker’s Wisconsin," written by Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock. The article cites the "latest Census statistics" that show even after adjusting for inflation, the average household income in Wisconsin has grown since Walker took office, while across the nation incomes fell in the same time frame. In October 2014, we fact checked a claim from Democrat Mary Burke -- Walker’s gubernatorial opponent -- that under Walker’s policies, "the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years." At that time, we found that median household income in Wisconsin had fallen $2,743 from 2009 to 2013. But most of the drop in income occurred before Walker took office -- in the last year of Democrat Jim Doyle’s term -- while Burke attributed the decrease solely to the Walker’s policies We rated the claim Mostly False. So, what about Walker’s claim that median household income is on the rise? Behind the numbers Walker and the New York Post article are both citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, a primary source of labor force statistics. Once a year, that monthly survey includes more detailed questions about income. From 2010 to 2013 the average household income in Wisconsin increased from $53,795 to $55,258 -- a 2.7 percent change -- and fell across the nation 1.3 percent. That mirrors what Walker tweeted. But there is more to the story. Census Bureau officials say that while the Current Population Survey is fine for the national picture, a separate survey with a larger sample size -- the American Community Survey -- provides the best picture of what is happening at the state level. The larger sample size means a smaller sampling error. These results paint a different picture for the average Wisconsin household, showing incomes falling, even after accounting for inflation. (Note: In the chart below, we use the American Community Survey for both the state and national numbers. The national ones generally track with the Current Population Survey, the measuring stick Walker cited.) Wisconsin median income (in 2013 dollars) % change National median income (in 2013 dollars) % change 2010 $52,317 $53,163 2011 $52,111 -.39% $52,190 -1.83% 2012 $51,649 -.89% $51,915 -.53% 2013 $51,467 -.35% $52,250 .64% 2010-13 -1.62% -1.72% This time, incomes in Wisconsin and nationally faced a similar fate, falling 1.62 percent and 1.72 percent, respectively. Both the drops were noted as statistically significant by the Census Bureau. In any case, they point to a far different outcome than what Walker touted. Our rating Walker said under his leadership, "Wisconsin median household income" is up 2.7 percent and down 1.3 percent nationally under Obama. He pointed to data from the Current Population Survey. But the data considered more accurate -- from the American Community Survey -- showed the opposite. We rate statements that contain some element of truth but ignore critical facts that would give a different impression as Mostly False. That fits here.

pomt-01262	New Jersey has had "seven credit downgrades" since Chris Christie became governor.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/09/greta-van-susteren/claim-new-jersey-has-had-7-credit-downgrades-chris/	Not surprisingly, the Sunday morning pundits were already forecasting what Republicans’ midterm election gains mean for the 2016 presidential race. Republicans considering a run for the presidency need to prove they are adept money-managers, and that might be a problem for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, said Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on ABC’s This Week. Christie had a great week of election-night wins as head of the Republican Governors Association, but she said that won’t matter as much when the 2016 conversation picks up and voters "actually dig in and look at the numbers" of how governors managed their states. "Two years from now, though, we’re going to be looking at the economy in New Jersey," Van Susteren said. "And so far they’ve had seven credit downgrades since the time he’s been governor. That doesn’t look good." Sure, credit downgrades sound like a bummer, but what do they actually say about a governor’s performance as state CEO? Did Christie really have that many? Bond rating basics A state’s credit rating is an expert, independent analysis of a state’s ability to meet its debt obligations, not unlike a regular person’s credit score. Here, we’re specifically looking at a state’s general obligation bond rating. Its full faith and credit has been pledged to repay the debt, said Lisa Washburn, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, an independent research firm. Generally, the better the rating, the lower the borrowing cost. Other types of state-backed bonds, such as transportation trust fund bonds and others secured by an appropriation commitment by the Legislature, are weaker because their repayment depends on legislative action. Appropriation ratings are usually rated below general obligation bonds due to the risk that money is not appropriated. The rating for New Jersey’s general obligation bonds has been docked eight times, not seven, we found, by the three major ratings agencies of Wall Street: Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings. The following chart details the instances in which a major credit rating agency has lowered New Jersey’s general obligation debt. Date Rating service Rating change 1 Feb. 9, 2011 Standard & Poor’s AA to AA- 2 April 27, 2011 Moody’s Aa2 to Aa3 3 Aug. 17, 2011 Fitch Ratings AA to AA- 4 April 9, 2014 Standard & Poor’s AA- to A+ 5 May 1, 2014 Fitch Ratings AA- to A+ 6 May 13, 2014 Moody’s Aa3 to A1 7 Sept. 5, 2014 Fitch Ratings A+ to A 8 Sept. 10, 2014 Standard & Poor’s A+ to A An important note lost in Van Susteren’s claim. New Jersey’s credit rating hasn’t dropped eight notches. Instead, it’s been adjusted downward a total of eight times by the three major ratings agencies. "It’s not wrong, but it also makes it sound like the state’s credit rating itself was downgraded by itself by seven places," Washburn said. The agencies’ ratings tend to be similar, so it’s not surprising that over three years, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch have both decreased the credit rating from AA, the third-highest level, gradually to A, the sixth-highest rating. The Moody’s system is slightly different but tracks similarly. The rating agencies’ reasons Now let’s get into why the credit rating dropped. As the chart shows, the first drop came in February 2011, the start of Christie’s second year in office. In announcing the first credit-rating downgrade of Christie’s governorship, Standard & Poor’s mentioned long-running problems with the state’s pension and health care obligations, as well as a slow economic recovery. Christie called the public employee pension and health care system a ticking time bomb and engineered a bipartisan pension law in 2010 that called for shoring up the state’s unfunded pension liability, recently estimated at $40 billion. The full pension contributions haven’t happened, and the economy remains sluggish, so the outlooks have been generally negative. Ratings services emphasize ongoing concerns about the state’s "structural imbalance." Translation: As long as the state continues to rely on one-time, short-term fixes and only partially funds its pension obligations, the budget outlook and ratings won’t be getting any better. In its Sept. 5 letter, Fitch outlined how the state lacked a long-term plan to close its budget gaps in the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years amid lingering low revenues, and the "repudiation" of promised pension contributions set in the 2011 law that Christie did not fulfill. Christie vetoed temporary tax increases on millionaires and businesses set by Democratic legislators in effort to pay for the pension contribution. "New Jersey’s economic performance continues to lag that of the nation, and a multitude of long-term spending demands are expected to prolong the achievement of sound financial operations," the Fitch report said. Just days later on Sept. 10, Christie earned an unenviable distinction among Garden State governors with another downgrade from S&P: He has overseen the most downgrades of any governor, at eight. We did not hear back from Christie’s staff in time for our fact-check. In a September story about the latest S&P downgrade, a spokesman for the state Department of Treasury told The Star-Ledger that it did not come as a shock "given the tendency of rating agencies to follow one another closely in all actions -- as they did leading up to the financial crisis of the late 2000s." Christie himself said the ratings agencies were "being significantly over-aggressive because they were such bums back in ’08 and ’09 and they left everybody hanging out to dry." In fact, an S&P analyst had cautioned Christie months earlier that another downgrade was likely to come if revenue remained stagnant and the state kept "deferring pressures into future budgets." The frequent downgrades do not mean the state is falling to financial pieces. Yes, the state’s credit rating is the second-worst among states in the nation, behind only Illinois. But states generally have solid credit, and New Jersey’s is rated higher than most corporations and is nowhere near the junk-bond status of Detroit or Puerto Rico, Washburn said. "An A rating isn’t a bad rating," Washburn said. "It’s still solidly within the investment grade. It’s just well below its peers." Our ruling Van Susteren said New Jersey has had "seven credit downgrades" since Chris Christie became governor in 2010. We counted eight instances in which the three major credit rating agencies of Wall Street lowered the state’s general obligation bond rating. It’s important to note that does not mean the state’s credit rating has dropped eight places. Not all of the downgrades can be blamed squarely on Christie, as he inherited a large pension obligation that only grew. But the downgrades are a well-documented vulnerability in a potential presidential run, and several analysts have criticized Christie’s more recent budget moves for perpetuating an unstable budget climate. Van Susteren’s claim is close but slightly misses the mark. We rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Greta Van Susteren	None	None	None	2014-11-09T18:05:04	2014-11-09	['Chris_Christie']
pomt-11108	Says that people "went out in their boats to watch" Hurricane Harvey.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2018/jun/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-people-went-out-their-boats-watc/	President Donald Trump paused from extolling the Coast Guard for rescues accomplished when hurricanes battered the U.S. in 2017 to suggest that people had foolishly gotten in boats to watch Hurricane Harvey. Did people do that? We didn’t recall that happening and the next day, we failed to draw elaboration on Trump’s claim from the White House nor did other agencies respond with information showing that people took boats out to watch the powerful hurricane that swept ashore at Rockport, Texas before touching off days of heavy rain and flooding in Houston and southeast Texas. According to a White House transcript, Trump said during a June 6, 2018 briefing involving FEMA and cabinet secretaries including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Ben Carson, secretary of Housing and Urban Development: "I also want to recognize the Coast Guard, our other military services. I have to tell you, the Coast Guard saved 16,000 people. What do you think of that, Ben? Sixteen-thousand people. (Applause.) And I think — you know, honestly, they don’t get enough credit in many ways. "Mike made the commencement address this year at the Coast Guard Academy. I did it the year before. I don’t think the Coast Guard gets enough credit. And I’ve said it, and I even say it to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. I said, I think this year the Coast Guard, maybe in terms of increased branding — the brand of the Coast Guard has been something incredible what’s happened. Saved 16,000 people, many of them in Texas, for whatever reason that is. People went out in their boats to watch the hurricane. That didn’t work out too well. That didn’t work out too well." The Houston Chronicle said in a news story posted later the same day that law enforcement "first responders" were baffled by Trump’s boating claim which, the story said, nobody could explain. The story quoted Harris County’s sheriff, Ed Gonzalez, crediting civilians with making an "extraordinary effort" with their own boats to rescue neighbors, relatives and pets as Hurricane Harvey flooded the Texas coast with 52 inches of rain. "I didn't see anyone taking the approach that would reflect his comments," Gonzalez said. Separately, Gov. Greg Abbott said he had "no information one way or another about" what Trump described and Coast Guard Petty Officer Edward Wargo told the Chronicle: "I don’t know how we would go about confirming that." No confirmations Our search of the Nexis news database turned up a September 2017 Tampa Bay Times news story on a man rescued from a Florida shrimping boat overtaken by Hurricane Irma yet no news accounts on people taking boats out to watch hurricanes. We later connected with Chad Saylor, a spokesman for the Coast Guard at its Washington, D.C., headquarters. Saylor had no comment on the president’s boating claim, referring us to the White House, which offered no on-the-record response to our inquiry. Saylor otherwise advised by email that the Coast Guard, teaming with multiple law agencies, rescued nearly 12,000 people during the nation’s 2017 hurricanes, mostly from rooftops in urban areas, Saylor said by phone. Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the Coast Guard’s commandant, said in a March 2018 speech that the agency responded to the year’s hurricanes by dispatching nearly 3,000 first responders and more than 200 helicopters, cutters, small boats and fixed-wing aircraft. Of its rescues, Zukunft said: "Most of those men, women, and children were rescued from the roofs and flooded streets of Houston, Beaumont, and Port Arthur, Texas… areas not generally accustomed to seeing Coast Guard helicopters circling overhead, dangling rescue swimmers into urban settings, as water engulfed their homes." A Sept. 7, 2017, Coast Guard news release says that in response to Hurricane Harvey, Coast Guard members helped rescue 11,022 people and 1,384 pets. Christopher Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also had no comment on Trump’s claim. Vaccaro suggested by email that we contact the Coast Guard and local law enforcement agencies. We also reached Bill Read, a resident of League City, outside Houston, and a former director of the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. By phone, Read commented that he was unaware of anyone ever going out on a boat to watch a hurricane. "Absolutely not," Read said. "It’s dangerous." Read said it’d be "insane" to take a boat into the ocean to watch a hurricane because of tremendous storm-related currents and waves. Inland in 2017, Read said, "the people I know who were out on boats were trying to rescue people" from Harvey-caused flooding. Our ruling Trump, saluting Coast Guard rescues accomplished when hurricanes battered the U.S., also said: "People went out in their boats to watch" Hurricane Harvey. The White House didn’t provide nor did we find confirmation of people venturing out on boats to watch the hurricane. The boats we saw people using in Houston and elsewhere were to evacuate flooded homes and neighborhoods. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12910	Thirteen Democratic senators "voted against cheaper medicines" and took millions from "big pharma since 2011."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/18/other-98/viral-image-about-democratic-senators-and-big-phar/	A viral post circulating recently in some of the more liberal corners of social media accuses 13 Democratic senators of allegedly voting against lower drug prices because they were recipients of big money from drugmakers. The post included the names and photographs of 13 Democratic senators — Cory Booker and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Jon Tester of Montana, Mark Warner of Virginia, and Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania. It also listed dollar amounts the senators were said to have received from "big pharma." Several readers asked us to check the post’s accuracy, so we did. (We’ll set aside the misspelling of Booker’s first name.) The viral image was created by a group called The Other 98, which says it fights "economic injustice, undue corporate influence and threats to democracy." We were unable to reach a representative of the group. However, we were able to make pretty solid guesses about the underlying reference. It lines up with the voting results for an amendment voted on by the Senate on Jan. 11, 2017. The amendment is filled with legislative jargon, but it would basically create a mechanism to promote "lower prescription drug prices for Americans by importing drugs from Canada." The measure failed, with 46 votes in favor and 52 against. The 13 Democratic senators targeted in the post were among those 52 votes against. As for the dollar figures, they largely align with donations listed on the OpenSecrets.org site run by the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data. In every case, the dollar amounts listed track almost exactly the amounts given to each senator under the category "pharmaceuticals/health products" for the 2016 campaign cycle, notwithstanding a few small deviances. The post, however, includes some errors, and its accuracy is undercut by a significant oversimplification: The image gives no indication that the senators also voted for a separate amendment that explicitly sought to lower drug prices. The vote wouldn’t actually implement ‘cheaper medicines’ There are a couple of issues with considering action against the measure to import drugs from Canada as a vote "against cheaper medicines." The vote was more symbolic than substantive. It was an amendment to a Senate budget resolution, which is a non-binding measure that doesn’t get signed by the president or become law. Rather, they set a framework for committee chairs to work within when deciding how to spend money. So the measures shouldn’t be oversold as direct action. "Simply put, if adopted by the Senate, the amendment would not have required the United States to begin importing drugs from Canada -- period, full stop," said Jeff Giertz, communications director for Booker. "It would have added language into the budget resolution that would have advised the Senate to spend money in a way that would result in this." "Giertz said that Booker supported the same goals, but wanted to see a framework for ensuring the safety of imported drugs included in the amendment." Don’t overlook another vote to amend the same bill It’s important to know that every one of the 13 senators listed in the meme voted in favor of a separate amendment that did urge lower drug prices. This other amendment effectively prevented the Senate from considering legislation that did not "as promised by (President-elect Donald Trump), lower drug prices, as certified by the Congressional Budget Office." Like the other amendment, this did not pass -- it won only 47 votes in favor, with 51 against. But the fact that all 13 senators listed on the meme voted to support this amendment muddies the conclusion of the meme that they all "voted against cheaper medicines." The senators offered varied reasons for opposing the amendment the viral image refers to. For instance: • Booker: "I support the importation of prescription drugs as a key part of a strategy to help control the skyrocketing cost of medications. Any plan to allow the importation of prescription medications should also include consumer protections that ensure foreign drugs meet American safety standards. I opposed an amendment put forward last night that didn’t meet this test." • Coons: The amendment "didn’t meet the safety standards he believes are necessary," a spokesman Sean Coit told PolitiFact. • Donnelly: "I do not believe the best way to address the problem of rising prescription drug prices or to advance an importation policy is through legislation that is designed specifically to take health care away from the people who need it" -- that is, the Republican-backed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. • Casey: "Sen. Casey had concerns about whether existing safety standards would apply to wholesalers," spokesman John Rizzo told PolitiFact. "Sen. Casey has spoken with (Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., an amendment sponsor) about this, and the two of them are actively working on legislation that will allow importation." The numbers shown don’t only represent money from 'big pharma' The assertion that these senators took millions from "big pharma since 2011" is also imprecise. We’ll start with what looks like a typo. The dollar amounts shown are generally accurate for the 2016 campaign cycle, but if you were to include the totals going all the way back to 2011, as the meme states, then the amount would be substantially larger than what is shown. Because the point would have been stronger with larger dollar figures, this looks to us like an unintended mistake. However, the "pharmaceuticals/health products" category as defined by the Center for Responsive Politics is actually broader than what most reasonable people would consider "big pharma." For this purpose, a more accurate subcategory for "big pharma" would be the Center for Responsive Politics category "pharmaceutical manufacturing." Several of the senators listed on the post rank in the group’s top 20 recipients of "pharmaceutical manufacturing money" during recent election cycles, but not all of them do -- and the amounts for each are smaller than what the meme reflects. Murray made the top 20 list in 2014 and 2016, for a cumulative $265,406. (You can investigate the numbers at the Center for Responsive Politics site here.) Coons made it in 2012 and 2014 for a cumulative $138,450. Casey made the list in 2012 and 2016, for a combined $231,380. Carper made the list in 2012 and 2016, for a combined $171,300. Menendez and Tester made the top 20 in 2012 ($153,800 and $54,750, respectively), Booker and Warner made it in 2014 ($233,750 and $71,050), and Bennet made it in 2016 ($135,127). These dollar amounts, which are admittedly incomplete, are lower than what the post shows for each senator’s "big pharma" contributions. Then there’s another caveat we always mention in articles like this one. The industry donation breakdowns tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics doesn’t just include donations by fat-cat executives and company political action committees. It also includes donations made by any individual employed by a company in a given industry sector. This can include rank-and-file employees -- and in states with a heavy pharmaceutical presence in the workforce, this can be a significant factor. These states include Delaware, represented by Carper and Coons, and New Jersey, represented by Booker and Menendez. Our ruling The viral image says that 13 Democratic senators "voted against cheaper medicines" and took millions from "big pharma since 2011." The 13 Democrats did vote against one amendment that was intended to lower drug prices through reimportation of medicines from Canada, and they have each taken money from drugmakers. However, the image leaves a misleading impression that the senators have voted against lowering drug prices. In reality, all 13 senators voted in favor of a different amendment that specifically advocated "lower drug prices." In addition, the dollar amounts listed for the senators use an overly broad definition of "big pharma," inflating the amount of money they have taken from the industry. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06388	Says "Clackamas County has more urban renewal debt than all the other Oregon counties combined."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/01/john-lee/does-clackamas-county-have-more-urban-renewal-debt/	Under the state constitution, cities and counties have the ability to set up urban renewal districts to combat blight. The financing works like this: The city or county authorizes a blighted area and "freezes" the amount of property tax going to public services, such as schools,fire, police and other city or county services. The property owner doesn’t pay any less. But as the value of the property goes up, the difference between the "frozen" amount and the new value is diverted to pay for future development within the blighted area, for a period of 20 or 25 or 30 years. Think of South Waterfront in Portland or Clackamas Town Center. In Clackamas County there’s a fierce battle on the Nov. 8 ballot over who gets to designate new urban renewal areas and change the ones that exist. Currently, the five-member county board decides, upsetting critics who like neither the board nor the concept of urban renewal. (They think urban renewal development sucks money from other public services; fans of urban renewal say those services will eventually benefit from increased property values brought about by the development.) A citizen group supported by the Clackamas County Republican Party worked to put Measure 3-386 on the ballot. This would require a majority vote countywide to create future urban renewal districts or to substantially change one. In response, the county board put competing measure 3-388 on the ballot, requiring approval only from people who live within the boundaries of a proposed urban renewal district. Neither measure affects the ability of cities within the county to form renewal areas. "Urban renewal debt hurts Police, Fire, Schools and other services by diverting taxes that fund these critical functions across the county," reads a statement by the Clackamas County Republican Party. "Measure 3-386 requires approval from Clackamas voters to determine when and where to support urban renewal. This is especially important since Clackamas County has more urban renewal debt than ALL the other Oregon counties combined. ‘A county debt deserves a county wide vote,’ stated John Lee, Chairman of the Clackamas County Republican Party." We were surprised by the statement. How could Clackamas County have more urban renewal development than all the other counties in Oregon combined, including Multnomah County, whose boundaries include the Portland Development Commission? Lee challenged PolitiFact Oregon to check it out. We obliged. We contacted the Oregon Department of Revenue, which collects property tax statistics. It turns out there are more than 70 government entities that operate more than 100 urban renewal plan areas in Oregon. In 2010-11, there was nearly $180 million in "revenue from excess value" collected to pay the debt on the bonds and other expenses of urban renewal projects. But of those more than 70 entities in 2010-11, all but four are cities. In other words, very few counties have urban renewal programs. Clackamas County’s two plans generated about $9.5 million that year to pay for urban renewal. Columbia County was next with $482,000; Coos County with roughly $115,000; and Hood River County with $75,000. So yes, if you count county to county, Clackamas County collected more revenue than the other three counties combined. Clackamas County is on par with the City of Salem, at $9 million. Wilsonville, a city within Clackamas County, is at $6.5 million. All government entities pale next to Portland, at $96 million. Most counties do not create urban renewal areas because blight is in cities. Portland, Troutdale and Gresham -- all in Multnomah County --all use urban renewal financing to develop parts of their cities. Clackamas County, on the other hand, has more unincorporated areas. We called Lee of the GOP. He says the statement clearly refers to the county as a government body, separate from any cities. In his defense, he does say in the statement that "a county debt deserves a county wide vote." That line reminds us that both ballot measures are about county-issued debt, and have nothing to do with city urban renewal projects. But when we read the statement, we thought of Clackamas County as a geographic region, not as a government entity. Read that way, the idea that Clackamas County and all the cities inside the county would have more money tied up in urban renewal projects than Portland and Multnomah County was ridiculous. We think most people would agree with our interpretation. We rate the statement Half True: Partially accurate, but leaving out a pretty important detail.

pomt-08526	"A majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care. But Russ Feingold voted for it anyway."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/05/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-russ-feingold-went-against-wishes/	U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold loves to remind Wisconsin voters he visits every county every year, with those "listening sessions" giving him the pulse of residents from Superior to Sturtevant. So it’s noteworthy when Republican challenger Ron Johnson attacks the three-term Democrat for not following the will of the people. In a new TV ad, Johnson charges that Feingold ignored public opinion by voting in March for sweeping health care changes backed by President Barack Obama and Democrats. The topic is a rallying point in many GOP campaigns across the country. "A majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care," the ad says, as statistics from an opinion poll pop up. "But Russ Feingold voted for it anyway. Feingold had a choice to make. The official Congressional Record shows Feingold toed the party line, instead of listening to us." So did Feingold’s vote fly in the face of majority opinion on the matter? The poll cited in the Johnson ad was done by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank based in Hartland, Wis., and released 12 days before the March 25 congressional action on the landmark legislation. The poll was directed by political scientist Ken Goldstein of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and surveyed 600 likely state voters. On the health care question, it found opponents (55 percent) outnumbered supporters (37 percent), with 8 percent undecided. The margin of error was four percentage points. When we asked the Johnson campaign for any backup, they pointed us to a second poll: a June 2010 Rasmussen Reports poll -- three months after the Feingold vote -- that found 58 percent of likely state voters favored repealing the health care law. We found two other polls that preceded the vote: One from Rasmussen Reports looked at 500 likely voters, with 54 percent opposed and 43 percent in favor. That was released on March 18, 2010. The margin of error was 4.5 percentage points. The other one we found was further removed from the vote, dating to November 2009, but is notable because it sampled a broader base -- adults in Wisconsin -- than the "likely voters" surveyed in the other two. That was the UW Badger Poll conducted by the University of Wisconsin Survey Center, which found a virtual split: 46 percent opposed and 44 percent in favor, in a poll with a four percentage point margin of error. The findings in the polls were in line with national tracking polls at the time, which consistently showed opponents outnumbering supporters, though the gap was narrowing in March 2010. In this case, however, the polls don’t end the argument. A closer look at the language shows Johnson frames the issue around a question the polls did not ask. The pre-vote polls used straightforward references to the "health care reform plan" or "proposed changes to the health care system." That is in contrast to the Johnson ad, which says a majority of Wisconsinites opposed -- and Feingold voted for -- a "government takeover of health care." Goldstein, who ran the poll cited in the Johnson ad, said the campaign’s language did not accurately summarize the question he posed. He noted the wide disagreement among policy experts over whether the Democrats’ legislation was a "government takeover." That two-word phrase -- government takeover -- became Republican shorthand in opposing the legislation, even though Democrats dropped the "public option" approach under which the feds would have run a plan to compete with private health insurance. Our PolitiFact colleagues have repeatedly probed the truth of the government takeover charge, and found it ridiculously false -- a Pants on Fire. In truth, the health care law creates a market-based system that relies on private health insurance companies. The Johnson mischaracterization of the poll language creates another wrinkle. If you opposed the bill, it does not automatically follow that you also opposed a "government takeover of health care" (the phrase in Johnson’s ad), according to two national polls. One was by the Associated Press/Stanford University, and the other by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Those polls found that a significant chunk of the opposition is people who felt the federal government did not go far enough on making changes -- as opposed to going too far. In the AP poll released in September, 2010, nearly one-quarter -- 23 percent -- of those who were opposed or neutral on the health care law reported that they liked most or all of it but thought it didn’t "do enough to improve the health care system." Notably, 32 percent of opponents who described themselves as independents felt that way, and 8 percent of Republicans. The widely cited Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll asked a question in February 2010 that tried to measure whether opponents thought there was too little or too much reform in the package. They were asked a series of questions, including whether they were motivated by concerns the legislation "doesn’t go far enough in expanding coverage or controlling costs." In response, 49 percent called that a major reason. Still, given another option, a whopping 80 percent of opponents said government getting too big a role was also a major reason they didn’t like it. We could find no Wisconsin-specific polling on the nature of opponents’ complaints. But the UW Badger poll last fall asked a specific question about the federal government’s direct role in insurance. Nearly six in 10 of all respondents -- 58 percent -- favored a government run "public option" plan. To be sure, Feingold did come under fire at many of his listening sessions for his support of the measure. But Johnson’s ad suggests there was hard-line certainty among state residents when the reality is much fuzzier. What does Feingold say? He told PolitiFact Wisconsin that in his vote he was following the wishes of people in Wisconsin, based on his overall experience at listening sessions and his re-election in 2004 on a health-care reform platform. He said polls during the long health care debate were all over the map. "I saw polls that said that a certain percentage of people didn’t want any bill, a certain percentage of people wanted a stronger bill, and a certain percentage wanted this bill," Feingold said. "This bill is right in the middle of what Wisconsin people want in terms of when it comes to control over the insurance industry." Let’s sort all this out. Johnson turns to polling data for support of his claim but uses loaded language to mischaracterize the question in the poll -- and what Feingold voted for. The pollster himself said the description in the ad does not match the question that was asked. What’s more, Johnson’s ad says a "majority of Wisconsinites" were opposed. But the more timely state polls measured only likely voters, not the entire adult population. The broadest poll we found -- measuring the view of Wisconsin adults -- was older, but it did not find a majority in opposition. We rate the statement False.

pomt-09123	"I've issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/16/barack-obama/obama-says-he-issued-six-month-moratorium-deepwate/	In his June 15, 2010, Oval Office address on the Gulf oil spill, President Barack Obama defended his decision to temporarily halt new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy. "Already, I’ve issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling," Obama said. "I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs, but for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue." On May 27, Obama did announce a 6-month moratorium on exploratory drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. But if you think that means there's no more oil production going on in the Gulf, you'd be mistaken. Wells that are currently producing oil will continue to produce. There are 72 active platforms in water depths of 500 feet or greater (the definition of deepwater) in the Gulf of Mexico that will be allowed to continue to operate. At issue here is the term "oil drilling." Many people use the term broadly to refer to the entire process of extracting oil from the ground, not just drilling the holes looking for oil. But once a well starts producing oil, it's not being "drilled" anymore. According to the moratorium notice, the U.S. Minerals Management Service will not consider drilling permits for deepwater wells for six months. In addition, operators that are currently drilling any well "must proceed at the next safe opportunity to secure the well and take all necessary steps to cease operations and temporarily abandon or close the well until they receive further guidance from the Regional Supervisor for Field Operations." There are 33 drilling operations in water deeper than 500 feet that fit that bill, which means that they needed to get to a safe place and then stop drilling. For the record, Deepwater Horizon was among the wells in the exploratory drilling phase. When the Department of the Interior issued the moratorium directive on May 30, Secretary Ken Salazar published a statement saying, "Deepwater production from the Gulf of Mexico will continue subject to close oversight and safety requirements, but deepwater drilling operations must safely come to a halt. With the BP oil spill still growing in the Gulf, and investigations and reviews still underway, a six-month pause in drilling is needed, appropriate, and prudent." We think a lot of people probably assumed Obama's statement meant that all oil operations in the Gulf of Mexico were put on a six-month hiatus. That's not the case. The moratorium relates to exploratory oil drilling, not to existing, oil-producing deepwater platforms, which will continue to produce. So Obama's words were technically accurate, though due to the common use of the phrase oil drilling to refer to all oil operations, we think it may have confused some people. And so we rule his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-06-16T18:56:39	2010-06-15	['None']
pomt-04153	"Faculty salaries at UW System institutions have now fallen more than 18 percent below the national average."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/26/kevin-reilly/uw-system-president-says-salaries-are-18-percent-b/	The head of the University of Wisconsin System says it’s high time for employee pay raises after several years of freezes, cuts and furloughs. "We will all pay the price in lost talent and sliding reputation" unless UW starts closing a pay gap between it and peer institutions nationally, System President Kevin Reilly told the Board of Regents on Dec. 7, 2012. "No operation – public or private – can keep its talent if compensation languishes for too long." Reilly, president since 2004, said the "gap between our UW employees’ compensation and that of their peers has widened in recent years, and that gap continues to grow." He added: "Indeed, faculty salaries at UW System institutions have now fallen more than 18 percent below the national average." We suspect, with the state budget season fast approaching, that we’ll hear that 18 percent figure again. So let’s test it. There are many ways to compare salaries at schools. Reilly chose to roll all the UW campuses into one, which as we shall see has limitations. That said, Reilly made clear that his figure was system-wide, so ultimately we’ll focus on that. We turned to salary figures collected annually by the American Association of University Professors, a member organization established "to advance academic freedom and shared governance, to define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education, and to ensure higher education's contribution to the common good." The group’s figures for instructional faculty pay, gleaned from its surveys of institutions for 2011-’12, are widely quoted, notably in salary comparisons compiled and analyzed by the Chronicle of Higher Education. Reilly didn’t make clear whether UW’s "peers" include competing private schools, or just public, so we’ll examine both. For 11 of the UW System’s four-year campuses, the AAUP peer group is master’s-granting schools. The Madison and Milwaukee campuses are compared to a more select group, doctoral institutions. The Chronicle of Higher Education site shows that all but one of the UW System’s 13 four-year campuses pay professor salaries that are "far below" the national median for full professors at public, private and independent institutions of similar type. Madison is the lone exception; average pay for full professors there ($114,690) is merely "below" the median for doctoral institutions. Figures are for full-time professors. Pay at 11 of the 13 schools for another group of faculty -- assistant professors, which is considered the entry level -- was "below" or "far below" the national median. At the other two, it was above the national median -- Madison ($75,860) and Whitewater ($62,178). At the UW System’s 13 two-year campuses, professors of all types collectively are paid "far below" the national median, the salary figures show. The two-year campuses include schools such as such as Rock County, Fox Valley, Waukesha and Barron County. Let’s quantify the size of the gap. At the flagship Madison campus, full professors collectively would need a 4 percent to 5 percent raise to reach national averages, depending on whether independent and private schools are included in the comparison, according to calculations we did using the AAUP data. Assistant professors at Madison, by contrast, are 4 percent to 6 percent above the national averages. But Madison stands alone as coming close to the national averages in both categories. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the state’s only other public doctoral institution, runs 24 percent to 27 percent below national levels for full professors, with average pay of $95,570. Assistant-professor pay there runs 6 percent to 8 percent behind. The other 11 four-year campuses range from 15 percent to 33 percent below average for full professors. Full professor pay at the four-year campuses (not including Madison and Milwaukee) ranged from $67,008 to $75,857. Assistant professor pay at 10 of the 11 fell short by 5 percent to 19 percent (with Whitewater the only school above the median). Those two positions -- full professor and assistant -- don’t comprise the entire faculty. Reilly’s specific claim was not about individual schools, or groups of schools, but that system-wide faculty pay has fallen 18 percent below the national average. We asked AAUP’s research director, John Curtis, to calculate a system-wide figure, one that rolls up all the campuses into one amount, and includes all types of full-time faculty, including associate professors, instructors and lecturers. Based on his figures, we found a collective 20 percent faculty pay gap between UW System salaries and those at similar public, private and independent schools. The gap is 18 percent for just the four-year, public Wisconsin campuses (leaving aside the two-year schools). Reilly’s office told us he, too, relied on the AAUP figures to reach his conclusion. His spokesman, David Giroux, provided detailed comparisons that also factored in a cost-of-living adjustment based on geography. In addition, Reilly’s approach compared schools with a select peer group rather than all schools of the same general type. The bottom line from the UW-provided data: It reaches very similar conclusions to the analysis by Curtis. There was one major exception. Reilly’s analysis put UW-Madison professor salaries much further below the median. Our bottom line: Reilly’s math appears to be on target. Curtis cautioned that a system-wide number may signal a disparity in a broad sense, but really is not very meaningful for addressing pay institution-by-institution because the overall figure combines a wide range of institutions of different types. A system-wide look does not shed light on pay differences by field, either -- history professors vs. engineering professors, etc. Our rating Reilly said "faculty salaries at UW System institutions have now fallen more than 18 percent below the national average." The aggregate figure has its limitations as a precise guide for future action, but Reilly scores with this broad comparison, which suggests a significant disparity. We rate his claim True.

pomt-13619	Says "employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/12/tom-harkin/can-employers-actually-pay-disabled-americans-belo/	Many speakers at this year’s Democratic National Convention focused on Hillary Clinton’s desire to help all people, including women, the gay and lesbian community, and racial minorities. Former Sen. Tom Harkin used his speech to focus on Americans with disabilities. "Twenty-six years ago today, our nation won a hard-fought battle to end discrimination for over 50 million people when we signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA," Harkin stated. However, he continued, "when, 26 years later, employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage, it is time to change that law. Hillary Clinton will fight to eliminate the subminimum wage, and ensure that a fair day’s work earns a fair day’s pay." Are employers actually able to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage? We took a look. The Americans with Disabilities Act The Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, of 1990 is the most comprehensive piece of legislation that safeguards the rights and interests of disabled Americans. Title I of the ADA protects qualified individuals from employment discrimination. It applies to private-sector employers employing more than 15 individuals, as well as to employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor/management committees. Employers are also required to make reasonable accommodation, which means making any change or adjustment that allows disabled people to partake in all functions of the job process. The ADA also protects disabled individuals from discrimination in pay. Employers cannot make up the cost of reasonable accommodation by reducing a disabled individual’s pay lower than the pay of others in the same position. Subminimum wage provisions While the ADA does protect individuals from pay discrimination, the protection is qualified. Under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employers are able to pay a wage below the federal minimum wage to workers whose work is affected by a mental or physical deficiency. (The ADA does not change this provision.) The reduction in wage corresponds to the reduction in productivity as compared with a worker without a disability. This means that some disabled workers can make significantly less than the minimum wage, in some cases even less than a dollar per hour. Employers must obtain a certificate from the Wage and Hour Division to set a wage below the federal minimum. According to the U.S. Labor Department, the certificate program has been implemented in the employment of over 420,000 disabled Americans. This reduced wage, known as the subminimum wage, has been in effect since the 1930s, with several changes over the years. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933-1935 set the first productivity-based subminimum wage, which was adopted again with the passing of the FLSA in 1938. The subminimum wage had a wage floor until 1986. Since then, the subminimum wage has been commensurate with productivity. Executive Order 13658 In 2014, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13658, which established a minimum wage for workers working on or under a contract with the federal government. The order specifically included disabled workers under purview of section 14(c) of the FLSA. While the executive order requires that all workers working on or under contracts of the federal government be paid a minimum of $10.15 per hour, the order did not inhibit the use of commensurate wages. Employers are still able to pay disabled individuals less than other workers as long as the wage remains at or above the $10.15 minimum. Furthermore, the executive order only applies to work in association with the federal government. The order’s limited scope and qualification of commensurate pay has made many disability advocates call for more far-reaching reform. Calls for more reform Many disability advocates claim that the subminimum wage is antiquated and fosters systemic inequities. In an article for the Huffington Post in 2015, Curtis Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, wrote that the subminimum wage was an incentive for businesses to hire physically disabled individuals in the competitive manufacturing industries of the time. However, the provision is exploited today because "unscrupulous employers eager to profit off the cheap labor … portray their business as a ‘job training’ program." Disabled Americans enter these programs under the assumption that they will gain valuable skills that will lead to real-world jobs and financial independence. However, Decker said this rarely happens because "as soon as the worker becomes proficient in one area and ready to graduate, they change that person’s task." Many never graduate from the program and are stuck making subminimum wages while employers benefit from the cheap labor. We reached out to the Clinton and Trump campaigns for insight on their respective plans regarding disability policy. The Clinton campaign directed us to a March 25, 2016, speech in which she discussed the subminimum wage. "I want us to take a hard look at raising the minimum wage and ending the tiered minimum wages, whether it's for people with disabilities or the tipped wage," Clinton said. (Another group of people who can be paid below the minimum wage are those, such as restaurant servers, whose income comes to a significant degree from customer tips.) The Trump campaign did not respond to our inquiries, and there is no disability policy agenda detailed on the official campaign website. While there has been limited action at the federal level, three states -- Vermont, New Hampshire and Maryland -- have passed legislation that phase out use of the subminimum wage in their respective states. Our ruling Harkin said, "Employers are still allowed to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage." He’s right that employers have been able to pay a subminimum wage to disabled workers since the 1930s. There’s one significant exception today, created by Obama’s executive order: Federal contractors must pay all workers a $10.15 minimum wage. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cf683287-e597-4fcc-9926-102ddec70249	None	Tom Harkin	None	None	None	2016-08-12T13:58:59	2016-07-26	['None']
pomt-08427	Said U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, D-Macon, sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China	false	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/19/austin-scott/us-house-hopeful-said-stimulus-funds-went-china/	Your stimulus money is being shanghaied, Republicans are saying. Literally, it's going to China. And credit belongs in part to Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall, according to a recent TV commercial by his Republican opponent, Austin Scott. The attack claims Marshall, from Macon, voted for the stimulus bill, which "sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build wind turbines and create jobs, mostly in China." U.S. stimulus money went to China? To create jobs there? AJC PolitiFact Georgia took a look. Marshall spokesman Doug Moore said the claim is wrong. "There is just no evidence to support the claim that jobs were created in China," Moore said. Marshall and Scott are in one of the state's toughest races. Marshall, the incumbent since 2002, has a record of fending off serious challenges. But this season, Democrats are struggling and victory is far from assured. Similar accusations about China and wind power are haunting Democratic congressmen in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia. They, like Marshall, voted for the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, otherwise known as the stimulus bill. Republicans are attacking the stimulus because they think it was squandered. And that's where China comes in. PolitiFact National assessed a similar claim in February on wind turbines and China by former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. She said the stimulus bill was supposed to help create U.S. jobs, but 80 percent of the $2 billion in stimulus dollars spent on alternative energy went to buy wind turbines built in China. The stimulus did include tax credits and grants to help investors develop wind and other alternative-energy projects in the U.S. But beyond that, Palin's claim fell apart. Before the stimulus, the federal government gave tax credits to investors in U.S. alternative-energy projects. A program created by the stimulus bill lets the investors get that money up front if they meet certain conditions. But there was no requirement that equipment used in those projects be made in the U.S. or that the investment companies be American-owned. In October 2009, American University's nonprofit Investigative Reporting Workshop published stories that said much of this program's stimulus money for wind projects ended up in the hands of foreign firms. Although the projects were located in the U.S., many were being built by American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies, reported Russ Choma, a reporter at the workshop. In February, the workshop ran additional stories in partnership with ABC News and the Watchdog Institute at San Diego State University. By that time, about 79 percent of the $2.1 billion given to wind-energy companies had gone to foreign ones. So Palin's claim did address a real controversy, but she misrepresented it. Some of the stimulus money supports jobs abroad because turbine parts are often made overseas. But many are made by U.S. companies or made by foreign companies in the U.S. Not a single recipient of program money is owned by a Chinese company. Back to Scott's commercial, which makes a claim that's slightly different from Palin's. It said that the stimulus sent nearly $2 billion overseas to build turbines and create jobs, mostly in China. There are a few problems with this accusation. The first is that it uses the $2 billion figure incorrectly. The amount, which is from the February stories, was the total for wind grants -- including domestic ones. About 79 percent of that money went to foreign-owned companies. Secondly, the $2 billion number is outdated. Because claims about jobs in China and wind turbines began to re-emerge recently, Choma posted updated stimulus figures Sept. 27. on the workshop website. Major wind farm projects in the U.S. received $4.4 billion worth of grants under the program, according to more recent calculations based on U.S. Department of Energy numbers. About $2.38 billion, or 54 percent, has gone to foreign-owned developers. Third, the commercial's claim that the $2 billion got sent "overseas" is well short of correct. Although equipment was made overseas and foreign companies were involved, much of the money was also spent domestically. Every one of the projects was located in the U.S., and some of the turbines were manufactured here. How much money stayed here? Experts said it's difficult to tell. But the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California used Energy Department funds to study the grant program's impact, including its effect on jobs. The lab's calculations were rough, early estimates based on limited information and do not take into account nonwind-energy jobs lost because of the program. But its economic model showed wind projects funded by the grant program created or retained more than 55,400 domestic jobs, most of them short-term. If the project were entirely domestic, it would have created more than 87,000 jobs, the report said. However, this was not possible. The U.S. does not have the capability to manufacture enough wind turbines, it noted. Another estimate based on research from the Renewable Energy Policy Project, which has been critical of how the Obama administration handled the stimulus grants, indicates the projects created a total of 35,000 jobs. But it's not clear how many jobs would be overseas. Too few are domestic, the group said, and the program doesn't do enough to foster the development of U.S. wind turbine manufacturing. Unlike the lab's calculations, the REPP number does not include "induced" jobs, or jobs supported when workers and firms spend the money they make. Regardless, these job estimates indicate money did stay in the U.S. Although turbine manufacturing does take place overseas, some takes place domestically, and the construction and operation of the sites take place in the U.S. And finally, the most important problem with Scott's claim is China. It's barely a factor in this debate. A wind industry trade group that's been critical of how Choma and others portray the issue confirmed that only three turbines were purchased outright from China. Not a single company that received these funds is owned by a Chinese company. "When we talk about money going overseas, it's going to Europe," Choma said. So while the green-energy grants did end up in the hands of foreign companies, the situation is far from what Scott's commercial claimed. The $2 billion figure is old and incorrect. Even critics agree that money is staying in the country in the form of domestic construction and manufacturing jobs, though the amount is unclear and most jobs are short-term. It's not possible for domestic manufacturers to produce all the wind turbines because they don't have enough capacity. And the overseas jobs in question are mostly in Europe, not China. We rule Scott's statement False.	None	Austin Scott	None	None	None	2010-10-19T06:00:00	2010-10-05	['None']

pomt-04908	In 2010, Betty Sutton "voted to destroy Medicare."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/03/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-targets-betty-suttons-support-health-care-ref/	Senior citizens, you are dupes and rubes. That seems to be what too many politicians and the political groups think of you, anyway (we disagree vehemently), the way they try to scare you. Both parties are guilty, as PolitiFact has noted repeatedly, but today, it’s the National Republican Congressional Committee’s turn. Consider what the NRCC said on July 30, in an apparent attempt to gain senior votes: Congresswoman Betty Sutton "voted to destroy Medicare." No, Sutton did not. This is a bit like the earth-is-flat argument, put to rest hundreds of years ago. PolitiFact has been through several iterations of the Medicare claim, voiced in variations by both parties, but here’s the thing: People are still using it. The NRCC claim is based on Sutton’s 2010 vote to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which you might know as "Obamacare." The act, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, aims to make health care readily available to uninsured Americans. But it also slows the rate at which Medicare will grow over the next decade. Medicare is the government program that provides health insurance to seniors, and a number of experts say its growth rate is unsustainable. So here is what will happen to spending on Medicare because of the Affordable Care Act. Its cost will grow $7.1 trillion over a decade, according to Congressional Budget Office projections previously reviewed by PolitiFact. You read that right. It will grow. Without the Affordable Care Act, Medicare spending would grow even more, by an additional $500 billion. The difference means the rate of growth will be slowed by about 7 percent. With $500 billion less, you’d think that Medicare might have to scale back its ambitions or services. President Barack Obama’s administration says the savings will come from eliminating waste and duplication. Savings also will come from a program called Medicare Advantage, which provided extra money to private insurers in hopes that they would expand their coverage to more rural areas. That didn’t happen, so the government says it wants to stop giving them extra money and will grade Advantage programs -- and give or withhold bonuses -- based on effectiveness. Reasonable people can be suspicious as to how, exactly, this will play out. Some Medicare Advantage patients have enjoyed a generous level of government benefits, and they fear they will lose some. But the CBO has been clear: Medicare spending will grow. The Affordable Care Act has extra money for prevention services, and seniors are getting a break on out-of-pocket expenses for their prescription drugs. OK, don’t believe the government. Skepticism is healthy and sometimes deserved. Now consider that Sutton, a Democratic congresswoman from Copley Township, voted for the Affordable Care Act. Does that mean that she "voted to destroy Medicare," as the NRCC said in its news release July 30? We asked NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill about the claim, since Prill sent the email to reporters. Prill cited, among other things, a Washington Post articlein 2010 that described $500 billion worth of "cuts" to Medicare under the health law. But the Washington Post’s own Fact Checker column has been over this repeatedly, and has saidthe characterization of "cuts" is an "oldie but goodie." (The Post also said, "Someone must be falling for this stuff, however, or else it would not keep getting repeated.") Prill also cited a Wall Street Journal opinion piece in 2011 that referred to health care "rationing" from an unelected 15-member Medicare advisory panel. The piece said that this Independent Payment Advisory Board, to be appointed by the president by 2014 to make recommendations on controlling Medicare costs, could "throw granny over the cliff" if Medicare isn’t reformed. Granny doesn’t want to go over the cliff, assuredly. But Prill’s third piece of backup seems to soften that likelihood. Prill cited a story last March from Bloomberg BNAabout a House of Representatives committee hearing in which health experts discussed the Medicare advisory panel’s power. They said the panel’s real power will be limited, leaving members few choices other than to recommend cutting fees that doctors earn by treating Medicare patients. Doctors in turn will limit the number of Medicare patients they see, stop taking new ones or quit practicing, one witness said. We’re not sure if that’s the same as throwing granny over the cliff. But that very argument -- that doctors will stop taking Medicare patients or quit -- is voiced every year right now, because of what has been a regular failure by Congress to assure physician reimbursements. Granny’s doctor is tired of this annual game, and says so regularly. Yet this plays out as often as the buzzards return to Hinckley, Ohio. Might Medicare change? It’s possible. If you are in an Advantage plan, you might want to ask your insurer a lot of questions or look at other coverage options. But destroying Medicare is strong medicine, and it goes far beyond the inconvenience of changing coverage. Sutton did not prescribe it. In fairness, both parties play this game. Sutton falsely accused her Republican opponent, Rep. Jim Renacci, of voting to "end Medicare" because he supported Republican budgets that would privatize the program and provide vouchers. PolitiFact Ohio gave Sutton a Falseon the Truth-O-Meter for making the claim. That doesn’t make the GOP claim against her any more accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, the NRCC claim rates False.

pomt-02542	"According to (Barack) Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government," which is "then used as justification for gun confiscation."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/06/mr-conservative/conservative-website-says-barack-obama-signed-law-/	Three of the biggest hot buttons in politics these days are health care, privacy and guns. Put all three of them together and you get an explosive claim. A reader recently asked us to look into a blog post at the website Mr. Conservative, with the provocative headline, "Obama Quietly Uses Executive Orders For Two New Gun Control Laws." "Just a few weeks ago," the post said, President Barack Obama "quietly used executive action — one of his new favorite pastimes — that has got gun owners’ feathers in a ruffle. According to Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government. The illegally obtained data is then used as justification for gun confiscation by the federal government." Mr. Conservative’s claims don’t have to do with Obama’s health care law. Obamacare explicitly bars the collection of information about "the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition" or the maintenance of "records of individual ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition." Rather, at issue is a proposed rule that would clarify some currently murky interpretations of privacy restrictions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which set limits on who can share and receive private health information about individuals. The provision cited in the blog post is designed to make clear that state authorities are allowed to share certain information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is used to screen potential gun purchasers. Under existing federal law, several factors can prevent someone from buying a gun. Most of these have to do with law-enforcement issues, such as a prior felony conviction or a record of domestic abuse. Another one -- the one that’s important for this discussion because it intersects with the health care system -- is involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The instant background check system is supposed to streamline the process of gun purchasing by quickly weeding out those who cannot legally buy a gun. But such a system is only as good as the databases it’s linked to. If someone is ineligible to purchase a gun but their information didn’t get into the right database, then the background check won’t stop the purchase. Several analyses have shown that these databases are far from complete. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, privacy is a key reason cited by states that haven’t provided data about involuntary commitments. The federal government’s argument is that these states are being needlessly cautious. The government says the kind of data being sought for background checks isn’t subject to HIPAA’s privacy restrictions. The HHS proposal would explicitly clarify that point. Let’s take a look at the claim phrase by phrase. • It’s an "unconstitutionally enacted law." Like the old-timey drink known as an egg cream -- which includes neither egg nor cream -- this provision isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted yet and it’s not unconstitutional. A law is a bill passed by Congress and signed by the president; that doesn’t describe this provision. Nor is it an "executive order," the term used in the headline. Executive orders are directives written and personally signed by the president. Instead, it’s an administrative regulation. Specifically, it’s a notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the Department of Health and Human Services. In other words, it’s a policy proposal emerging from a federal agency, with a specified public comment period before the agency decides whether to enact it -- or scrap it. So while it’s fair to say the Obama administration is behind it, it would be incorrect to say it’s already "enacted." It’s currently in the comment phase, and it may not ever be enacted. As for "unconstitutional," the Supreme Court, for one, doesn’t consider the regulatory process to be problematic constitutionally. "Some people do question the constitutionality of the administrative state, but as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, it's been settled law for almost 100 years that Congress can delegate rulemaking authority to federal agencies," said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. • "Health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws to submit medical data to the government" The information reportable to NICS doesn’t concern physicians’ medical records about diagnoses of mental illness, prescriptions, or treatment recommendations. Rather, the relevant information for gun-buying purposes -- and thus for providing data to NICS -- are decisions by "a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority." As HHS put it when it released the proposed rule, "Seeking help for mental health problems or getting treatment does not make someone legally prohibited from having a firearm, and nothing in this proposed rule changes that. Furthermore, nothing in this proposed rule would require reporting on general mental health visits or other routine mental health care, or exempt providers solely performing these treatment services from existing privacy rules." Importantly, HHS added that "the proposed modifications would merely permit, and not require, covered entities to report to the NICS." That directly conflicts with the blog post’s claim. So, let’s recap: "Health care professionals" is misleading -- it’s courts, boards and commissions, not doctors, who would be submitting to NICS. "Are now" is wrong because, as we noted, this is a proposal and is not in force yet. "Required" is wrong because state entities would be able to submit to NICS, but would not be required to do so. "To violate HIPAA privacy laws" is at best misleading because HIPAA already didn’t block the transfer of this kind of data; the proposed rule simply makes that point extra clear. And "to submit medical data to the government" is misleading because only involuntary commitment data is sought by NICS, not detailed treatment records. • It’s "justification for gun confiscation" The idea that Obama wants to take away Americans’ guns is a durable one among his critics. But it’s unclear the extent to which the HHS proposal would make this scenario more likely. On the surface, all NICS does is prevent ineligible people from newly purchasing a gun. It says nothing about taking away the guns they already own. But if someone is unable to purchase a gun, it also means they’re unable to own a gun. The question is how aggressively this is enforced. Critics of the proposal say that increasing the flow of mental-health information to NICS could promote rise in confiscation. If enacted, the proposal "would make it clear that the ATF and other federal agencies could troll this database for persons with Alzheimer's, PTSD, ADHD, etc.," said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, a group that has been critical of the HHS proposal. In the group’s official comments to HHS on the proposal, it cited a letter from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that says that 140,000 veterans have been added to the NICS list over the years. Coburn and Gun Owners of America say too many of these veterans are being caught up in the dragnet. In addition, California in 2013 passed a law that allocated $24 million to enforce the confiscation of firearms from people who are not allowed to own them, using a variety of databases; about 30 percent of these people were mentally ill. While NICS only accepts into its database the official determinations of mental incompetency, Hammond warned that there’s no universal standard for incompetency determinations. They may be "made with little more than a psychiatric diagnosis and perhaps a star-chamber proceeding, in which a supposedly incompetent person is deemed competent to have waived all of his or her rights," Hammond said. "This would mean that the names of persons who had received little due process" might find their information newly added to NICS, leaving them open to confiscation. But even if these are legitimate concerns, others don’t see the HIPAA proposal as a harbinger of massive gun confiscations. Mark Heyrman, professor at the University of Chicago Law School, called any kind of large-scale gun confiscation effort based on the HHS action "implausible." Jay Corzine, a sociologist who studies gun policy at the University of Central Florida, agreed, saying the proposal strikes a "reasonable" balance. Federal law "proscribes possession of a firearm by persons in these groups and could conceivably lead to seizure of firearms owned prior to their change in status," he said. "This currently occurs in selected situations -- domestic violence cases in some states for example. Not very many people would be impacted, however, and the idea that this is the opening move in a planned campaign for large-scale gun confiscation is far-fetched at best." Our ruling The post we’re checking said that, "according to (Barack) Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government," which is "then used as justification for gun confiscation." The elements of this claim range from misleading to flat-out wrong. The one area of reasonable concern is that some jurisdictions may lack full due process for declaring someone mentally incompetent, potentially putting some people at risk of seeing their guns confiscated. But this depends on how proactively the authorities enforce gun laws. Experts say widespread gun confiscation is implausible. The rule isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted and it isn’t unconstitutional according to Supreme Court jurisprudence.

pomt-03185	Because of Gov. Scott Walker’s budgeting, a greater percentage of general fund tax dollars is "going to pay off debt than ever before in our history."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/01/kathleen-vinehout/gov-scott-walker-responsible-record-debt-payments-/	Could Gov. Scott Walker, preparing for a 2014 re-election campaign and a possible presidential bid, be credibly branded as a big-time debtor? We know Walker helped balance his first state budget, for 2011-'13, by pushing off some payments on the state’s debt further into the future. Now, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout (D-Alma), who is considering her own run for governor, contends Walker’s move means this for the 2013-’15 budget: General fund tax dollars -- money used for schools and colleges, BadgerCare, local governments, prisons and more -- are being used to make debt payments at the highest rate in state history. Vinehout, who ran for the Democratic nomination to challenge Walker in the 2012 recall election, blasted the budgeting done by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature in an Aug. 24, 2013 opinion column in The Capital Times of Madison and in an earlier blog post. In a section of the column about debt, Vinehout criticized the amount of borrowing and the restructuring of debt payments done by Walker. "In the depths of the recession, Gov. Jim Doyle delayed debt payments to gain cash and keep government going. In the 2011-’13 legislative session, Gov. Scott Walker did not pay an even larger amount of debt payments coming due. Because debt payments were not made, more money goes to pay off debt in (the 2013-’15) budget than ever before," Vinehout wrote. Walker’s 2013-’15 budget, she added, "pays that price in a greater percent of tax dollars going to pay off debt than ever before in our history." Is Vinehout right that because Walker pushed principal payments on the state’s debt into future years, a higher percentage of general tax dollars is going to debt payments than ever before? Walker’s first budget The rationale for borrowing for capital projects is well understood. Costs can be spread out over years, so that future users of a new highway, for example, help pay the tab for building it. Borrowing, instead of paying cash for a major project, can also alleviate the need for a tax increase. But as any borrower knows, repaying debt -- or bonds, as they’re known in the state’s case -- can take a bite out of your operating budget. Like Vinehout, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker’s Democratic opponent in the recall election, criticized the debt payment restructuring Walker did. We rated Mostly True Barrett’s claim that Walker "pushed over $500 million in debt onto our children and grandchildren" to help balance the 2011-’13 state budget. What the Republican governor did was issue new debt in order to make $558 million in debt payments that were due in 2011 and 2012. That freed up more general fund money to help balance the 2011-’13 budget. But pushing more principal payments some 20 years into the future also meant accumulating more interest costs. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau -- cited by both political parties as the best neutral source on state financial matters -- estimates that Walker’s debt will add $156 million in interest costs. Vinehout’s evidence As for Vinehout’s claim, there are essentially two parts. She says the percentage of general tax dollars -- as opposed to gas tax money, for example -- that are being used toward debt payments is the highest ever, and that Walker’s debt restructuring is largely responsible for it. Vinehout provided us a June 2013 memo she requested from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau which estimates that for the current budget year -- 2013-’14 -- 5.26 percent of general fund revenues will be used to pay off bonds. The fiscal bureau confirmed to us that 5.26 percent is the highest such figure on record, based on figures dating back to 1970. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson didn’t dispute the figure, but pointed out that Vinehout voted for debt restructuring under Doyle. The 5.26 percent translates into $738 million in general fund tax dollars that are being used in the 2013-’14 budget period on debt payments. That exceeds the state’s historical target, which is to allocate no more than 4 percent of general fund revenues to debt payments. So, the best available data support Vinehout’s statistical claim. Debt restructuring As for assigning responsibility, Vinehout conceded in her column that, like Walker, Doyle also stretched out debt payments in order to manage the state budget. But she suggested Walker's restructuring is what led to the record rate of general fund spending on debt payments. Experts from the fiscal bureau, the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project and the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, however, told us that factors other than Walker's debt payment restructuring also play a role. Doyle and Walker, and governors before them, have done long-term borrowing that is still being repaid. In other words, much of the debt, and debt payments, were inherited by Walker from previous governors -- something Vinehout acknowledged to us in an interview. Another factor that occurred under both Doyle and Walker is an increase in bond issues that are repaid with general fund dollars, rather than simply gas taxes and related funds, to do major transportation projects. Our rating Vinehout said that because of Walker’s budgeting, a greater percentage of general tax dollars is "going to pay off debt than ever before in our history." The 5.26 percent of general fund revenues being used for debt payments in the 2013-’14 budget period is the highest on record. It's reached that level partly because of the borrowing and debt restructuring under Walker, but also because of similar actions by previous governors. For a partially accurate statement that leaves out important information, we rate Vinehout’s statement Half True.	None	Kathleen Vinehout	None	None	None	2013-09-01T20:00:00	2013-08-24	['None']
pomt-08687	"For every dollar a county gets in taxes from new development, it costs us 40 to 50 percent more to provide services."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/09/florida-hometown-democracy/development-doesnt-pay-itself-pro-amendment-4-grou/	The group pushing a constitutional amendment that would give voters more direct control over development projects is trying to debunk what is says is a well-told myth about development -- that it pays for itself. Florida Hometown Democracy, the organized group supporting the passage of Amendment 4, says in a new web ad that development ends up costing taxpayers, not benefiting them. "Politicians keep telling us that new development brings tax money to our community," the group says in a web ad available on the group's website. "What they don't tell is that for every dollar a county gets in taxes from new development, it costs us 40 to 50 percent more to provide services." Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes. The measure, which needs 60 percent of the vote to pass, is being opposed by most local governments and the development industry. A group of mainly grass-roots activists -- led by environmental attorney Leslie Blackner of Palm Beach -- is supporting the proposed amendment. We've rated three statements about Amendment 4 previously, which you can read here. In this item, we're going to examine Hometown Democracy's claim that for every $1 in new tax revenue coming in from development, $1.40 to $1.50 is spent servicing that new development. Hometown Democracy spokesman Wayne Garcia pointed PolitiFact Florida to four studies to support the group's claim. A 2006 study by Jeffrey H. Dorfman at the University of Georgia found that in Leon County in Florida, for instance, for every $1 generated by new residential development, the government would spend $1.39. The study focuses on replacing farmland with development, and concludes that commercial, industrial and farm uses will save taxpayers money in the long run. The Dorfman study also measured the cost in 14 Georgia counties and found that for $1 of tax revenue, governments would spend anywhere from $1.13 to $2.27. An earlier study from 2002 and 2003, commissioned by the 1000 Friends of Florida, The Conservation Fund, The Georgia Conservancy and Tall Timbers Research Stations, focused on Leon County in Florida and two Georgia counties. It found that for every $1 in revenue generated by the residential development of farm and forest land, taxpayers pay $1.38. A third study, commissioned for a specific development in Jacksonville in 2000, found that developing the undeveloped land would create $157 million in property taxes over 15 years but cost Duval County taxpayers $250 million. The fourth study was commissioned for Sarasota County in 2002. It found that the typical Sarasota subdivision costs the county $1.53 for every $1 of revenue it generates. After seeing the findings referenced in the four studies, we noticed a trend. Each seemed to be focusing on the development of residential subdivisions, or taking undeveloped farm or forest land and turning it into single family homes. That's certainly a prominent form of development in Florida. Probably the one most people think of when they think about development. But it's not the only kind. Some development does more than pay for itself All the studies Garcia provided found that commercial and industrial development did more than pay for itself. The Dorfman study found that in Leon County, for every tax dollar generated by commercial and industrial development, taxpayers would have to pay $0.46 for services. The Sarasota study found that expensive 5-acre ranches cost $0.57 for every $1 generated. The ad makes no claim about one specific type of development or another. It just says development. And still, those studies don't account for the disproportionate share of taxes the people in new homes are paying, said David Denslow, research economist for the Bureau of Economic and Business Research and Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Florida. "New houses are on average more expensive than existing ones, and therefore pay more than their average share of residential property taxes," Denslow said. "In addition, except for Florida residents with portability, the new houses don't get an initial break from Save Our Homes." The studies, Denslow said, also ignore the fact that Floridians create property tax revenue where they live, where they shop, and where they work. The development creates spin-off tax benefits. (For the record, Denslow opposes Amendment 4, saying he doesn't believe it will result in good land planning). Other experts we talked to said that the cost of a development to taxpayers very much depends on the specifics of the development. Take a 3,000-acre farm in eastern Hillsborough County. In order to add 1,000 homes there, the county government would need to upgrade county roads and extend utility lines. Then, once the homes are built, the government would have to provide fire and police service, and the school district would have to provide school options. Through impact fees, developers would pay some of those costs. Through property taxes, homeowners would foot another part of the bill. But very likely, not all of it. Now take an empty square block in downtown St. Petersburg. And say someone wants to build a 10-story hotel. Roads are in place. So are the utilities. No new residents means no real impact to the school district. In that scenario, property and sales taxes generated by the property very likely would more than cover the cost to the city. Now say you're a beach community tearing down an old hotel and replacing it with condominiums. In that scenario, you're potentially increasing the cost on the school system, but you're also increasing the tax dollars generated by the property. How does that all shake out? Maybe a net positive. Or say you're building low-value residential developments in a bedroom community Polk or St. Lucie County. That's going to most likely cost taxpayers. The bottom line is "it very much depends on the type of development what kind of ratio you get between the tax revenues received and the cost of public services," said Lance deHaven-Smith, a professor in the Reubin O'D. Askew School of Public Administration and Policy at Florida State University. "For a long time, we just wanted growth in Florida ... the thinking being we were going to bring in this growth and make a bountiful Florida. "But now we know that not just any growth will do it," deHaven-Smith said. "It requires a mix that includes commercial and industrial and unless you actively plan for that, you don't get it." And as we searched, we even found at least one study that contradicts the studies provided by Hometown Democracy. The study isn't from Florida, but found a net positive impact for taxpayers by the development of five St. Louis area residential subdivisions. The study, which was paid for by a St. Louis business group, said that "annual revenues from the five subdivisions for local taxing districts exceeded the costs of providing services to the subdivisions by $13.9 million." Our ruling What's the net effect of all the development happening in Florida? No one was able to direct us to an authoritative study to provide a clear answer. There is evidence, however, that growth isn't completely paying for itself. Back in Hillsborough, the county Metropolitan Planning Organization has identified more than $3.2 billion worth of unfunded, but needed road projects. Here's a list of the top 20 unfunded projects from 2008. Pinellas County in 2009 had at least $1.1 billion in unfunded road projects. But when Hometown Democracy says in an ad that taxpayers are paying a 40 to 50 percent premium for development, they're failing to tell the entire story. The group is able to find specific examples of developments that cost taxpayers 40 to 50 percent more than what they're generating in new tax income, but the math doesn't work as a generalization. The cost, or benefit, of a development to taxpayers matters very much on the specific details about the development. Generally, studies suggest that new large single family developments do not pay for themselves. But infill development (taking an empty lot in an urban area) or redevelopment is much more likely to pay for itself. So are commercial and industrial development projects. As such, we rate Hometown Democracy's claim Half True.	None	Florida Hometown Democracy	None	None	None	2010-09-09T19:15:30	2010-09-09	['None']

pomt-09828	"It's costing every American who is insured $1,100 to pick up the cost of uncompensated care that goes on at the emergency room."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/28/barbara-boxer/boxer-claims-it-costs-1100-person-cover-uninsured/	In an effort to sell their health insurance overhaul, Democrats are focusing their pitch on how reform will help the average person. Their latest claim: Health care will actually be cheaper if everyone is insured. To illustrate their point, Democrats are contending that insurance policies are more expensive than they should be because they include a "hidden health tax" — an extra charge used to cover the millions of uninsured patients who are treated in the costly emergency room. Barbara Boxer, a Democratic senator from California, talked about that cost on the Rachel Maddow Show on Aug. 10, 2009. "They say we have the greatest health care in the world," Boxer said. "Well, the fact is, we pay twice as much and our outcomes aren't as good. We have 48 million people with no health care. As a result, they walk into emergency rooms. It's costing every American who is insured $1,100 to pick up the cost of uncompensated care that goes on at the emergency room." This is not a new claim. Back on the campaign trail, former candidate Hillary Clinton said each "family policy has a $900 hidden tax" because of the cost of the uninsured. We found that her estimate was right, but that was over a year ago. So we thought the claim was worth revisiting. And note the wording difference. Clinton said each "family policy" had the hidden cost. But Boxer said "every American who's insured" is paying it. We'll explain the significance of that in a minute. When we checked Clinton's claim, we relied on a report from consumer health care advocate Families USA that was published in June 2005. The group revisited the issue in May 2009 in a report called "Hidden Health Tax: Americans Pay a Premium." The group found that about 86.7 million people were uninsured for some period of time between 2007 and 2008, with about a fourth of those people uninsured for the entire year. The report notes that these estimates were before the recession caused many people to lose their jobs and their health coverage, so the actual numbers are likely to be higher. The report says doctors and hospitals still provide treatment to the uninsured and have to compensate by charging more to insurers. "In turn, the costs that are shifted to insurers are passed on in the form of higher premiums to consumers and businesses that purchase health coverage." The practice is otherwise known as cost-shifting. For the insured, that translates to an extra $1,017 for family health care coverage and about $368 per individual policy, according to Families USA. In 2006, the New America Foundation, a left-leaning think tank, looked at the cost of covering the uninsured in California and came up with similar estimates: "We conservatively estimate that about 10 percent of California health care premiums can be attributed to cost-shifting due to the uninsured," the report said. "This means that cost shifting inflates the average annual premium for a California family by $1,186. Individuals purchasing policies pay an additional $455 annual in higher premiums. But a 2008 Kaiser Family Foundation report puts the number much lower than the 10 percent in the California study. It predicted if all private funding for uncompensated care were paid with private insurance payments, it would only amount to 1.7 percent of private insurance premiums. The Kaiser report did not provide a comparable estimate to the $1,186. Kaiser singles out the Families USA study from 2005 and says it is flawed because it doesn't consider a full picture of how doctors and hospitals absorb the costs of the uninsured. And the Kaiser report questions whether cost-shifting is so strongly related to an increase in the number of uninsured. For example, the paper argues that hospitals and insurers would negotiate the same prices for care regardless of the number of uninsured patients. If uncompensated care was affecting these negotiations, its share of hospital costs would go up with the share of the population that is uninsured. But it has not, the report concludes. That brings us back to Boxer's claim. We find it is flawed in two ways. First, she says the cost for "every American who is insured" is $1,100. If she had said that was per family as Clinton did, she would be in the ballpark according to the Families USA and New America Foundation studies. But those studies say the cost per individual policy was $368 and $468. So she is way off on that count. Secondly, the Kaiser report has raised significant questions about the Families USA study and made a plausible case that much of the cost of the uninsured is absorbed by doctors and hospitals. So in our view that discounts the accuracy of the groups' studies. So we find Boxer's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Barbara Boxer	None	None	None	2009-08-28T15:01:29	2009-08-10	['United_States']

pomt-14331	"During three and a half years of campaigning," Lamar Smith "has never once appeared at a moderated debate to defend his positions on the issues."	true	/texas/statements/2016/mar/28/matt-mccall/matt-mccall-lamar-smith-dodged-primary-debates/	Over a 28-year congressional career, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith has waded into hot topics seemingly without reservation, lately touching off an uproar for seeking internal emails from climate scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But last month, the San Antonio Republican drew criticism for failing to appear at political candidate debates in the 21st Congressional District, which runs from San Antonio north into Austin. On Feb. 11, 2016, Matt McCall, a Boerne, Texas challenger to Smith in the March 2016 Republican primary, issued a press release headlined: "McCall Says Smith Dodging Debates." McCall’s release said: "During three and a half years of campaigning, Smith has never once appeared at a moderated debate to defend his positions on the issues." McCall also unsuccessfully challenged Smith in the GOP primary in 2014. Smith went on in 2016 to whomp McCall (along with two other hopefuls, John Murphy and Todd Phelps) by a wide margin in the March 2016 Republican primary. Smith picked up 60 percent of the vote, McCall got 28.9 percent and other challengers received less than 6 percent. Regardless, we wondered if McCall was right about Smith not debating campaign opponents for three-plus years, which would take in the 2014 elections, as well. To our inquiry, Smith campaign consultant Jordan Berry said by phone that McCall and Smith had appeared together. But it looks like that was no debate. Berry directed us by email to a photo on McCall’s website showing McCall evidently speaking in 2013 with Smith among people looking on. We asked McCall campaign spokesman Andrew Lewis for more information on the photo. By email, Lewis replied that the photo wasn’t taken at anything like a debate. Instead, Lewis said, the photo was taken at a lunch meeting of the Central Texas Republican Assembly where Smith was the guest speaker. Lewis said McCall was allowed to speak at the event because the group allows its members seeking elected office to speak at meetings; McCall is a member, Lewis said. To our inquiry, T.J. Scott, CTRA president, confirmed that explanation, saying by phone that his group had invited Smith to appear at a number of their regular meetings, which occur the third Thursday of every month, but scheduling conflicts prevented Smith from attending. "His office said, ‘We’d love to sit down for lunch with you,’ so I said, ‘Well, how about you have lunch with not just me, but the group?’ and we called a special lunch meeting with our members," Scott said. He also agreed McCall was able to speak because the group gives a speaking opportunity of "two to 10 minutes" to members seeking office. Meanwhile, McCall campaign spokesman Andrew Lewis told us by email that in a "not all-inclusive list from this election cycle, Smith did not attend debates and candidate forums in Real County, Boerne, Comal County and Fredericksburg, as well as forums at the Alamo Pachyderm Club and at Bexar County GOP Headquarters; he sent surrogates to the Real, Comal and Boerne events. Republican Party chairs in Real, Kendall, Comal and Gillespie counties, the president of the Fredericksburg Tea Party, and the coordinator of the Bexar County GOP candidates forum each separately said Smith did not attend the events Lewis listed. Smith also did not appear at a January 2016 forum in Bandera, according to a recap in the Bandera County Courier. We could not find any record of a candidate forum or debate attended by Smith in his district for the 2014 election cycle, either. McCall has been tweeting pleas for a debate with Smith since November 2013. A possible reason for some of the absences: The House was in session on the days of the Boerne, Comal and Fredericksburg events, according to the House majority leader’s calendar. The amount of notice given to candidates in advance of the debates and forums varied widely from event to event, ranging from two weeks to three months, according to emails from event organizers. Berry, Smith’s consultant, otherwise didn’t engage with us about candidate debates Smith has joined or any reasons for not going to them. It’s likely that more debates will be coming up. On the November ballot, Smith faces Democrat Tom Wakely of San Antonio and Green Party nominee. There are also two third party candidates in the congressional race: Green Party hopeful Antonio Diaz, and Mark Loewe, a Libertarian. So, best we can tell, Smith did miss formal candidate forums over the past few years. Smith did speak at forums open to audience questions, including a bipartisan student forum at the University of Texas, San Antonio on April 22, 2014. He spoke at a public forum in Bandera on July 18, 2015, and one in Kerrville on Oct. 3, 2014. He hosted one in San Antonio on October 19, 2015. And as McCall’s camp admits, a surrogate for Lamar Smith was present at at least three debates or candidate forums in 2016. Our ruling McCall said that in the years he’s been challenging Smith, the incumbent "has never once appeared at a moderated debate to defend his positions on the issues." Our search for signs of Smith joining a candidate debate came up empty. Also, given opportunities, Smith didn’t alert us to any such moment; a photo noted by Smith’s consultant wasn’t from a debate.

pomt-04584	Says that in the U.S. House of Representatives "we’ve had bipartisan support for the repeal of Obamacare … for getting rid of cap and trade … for building the Keystone Pipeline."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/24/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-cites-bipartisanship-opposition-s/	On the eve of what should have been the first day of the Republican National Convention in Tampa – delayed a day by Hurricane Isaac – U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., went on CBS’ "Face the Nation" to describe the accomplishments of the much-maligned and unpopular 112th Congress. The Republican Party has had control of the House of Representatives since January 2010 and GOP members have passed a lot of bills. Not many have become law because the U.S. Senate hasn’t taken them up. In some instances, Republican-backed legislation has won the tepid support of a handful of Democrats, and sometimes the full-throated endorsement of large numbers. Either way, that would constitute "bipartisan support." Blackburn’s full statement went like this: "In the House, we've had bipartisan support for the repeal of Obamacare, bipartisan support for moving forward with the budget. We have had bipartisan support for getting rid of cap and trade and stopping that. We've had bipartisan support for building the Keystone Pipeline." We asked Blackburn’s communications director, Mike Reynard, for the supporting evidence that there was, in fact, bipartisan support, reflected in floor votes, for repeal of the Affordable Care Act (so-called "Obamacare"), for "getting rid of cap and trade," and for building the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada to Texas. The House in fact voted to repeal Obamacare on July 11, for the second time. House Republicans have voted to repeal specific parts of the law 30 times. In the July vote, five Democrats — including Mike Ross of Arkansas, who’s not seeking re-election — joined the Republican majority. On cap and trade (an idea that originated with Republicans), back in June of 2009, when the Democrats controlled the House, the American Clean Energy and Security Act passed by a vote of 219-212, with 44 Democrats voting against it. The Senate failed to act, and nothing happened. The House has voted four times in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline, most recently in April when 69 Democrats joined their Republican colleagues passing a federal highway bill that contained Sections 202-204 related to the pipeline project. By the time House and Senate conferees rewrote the measure, the pipeline language was removed. It then passed both houses and was signed by the president. So, technically, there was bipartisan support for building the pipeline in the House, but nothing happened. Our ruling It’s not unusual for a small number of members of Congress to defy their party’s leadership and vote the way they think is best. Blackburn’s larger point was that, even with bipartisanship on some significant measures, the bills passed in the House aren’t being signed into law because they aren’t being taken up by the Senate, where the various 60-vote requirements for a bill to proceed make passage much more difficult. But we’re not fact-checking whether U.S. federal government’s structure leads to gridlock. Blackburn’s statement that some measures received some level of bipartisan support is True.

pomt-03733	Says PETA "is using this really fancy drone to follow hunters around in some places in other countries."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/apr/12/joe-negron/joe-negron-says-peta-flying-drones-spy-hunters-ove/	Drones are not just a tool of the United States military. Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, says they are being used right now to monitor the movements of hunters overseas. Negron's pet project of the legislative session aims to curtail the use of nonmilitary drones by state and local law enforcement. Even though Negron's story about hunters doesn't directly impact his proposal, SB 92, he shared it recently to help explain the growing drone market. "I don’t know how many of you saw the story about, and this is in another country so it’s beyond the jurisdiction of the Florida Legislature, but I think it’s PETA is using this really fancy drone to follow hunters around in some places in other countries to watch their hunting activities," Negron told reporters on April 10. "You're going to see more and more creative uses of drones because the technology has become so affordable." Is PETA, or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, really taking their war against animal cruelty to the skies? It's planning on it. PETA announced in an April 8 press release titled "PETA to acquire drones to stalk hunters" that it is seeking drone technology to use in the United States. PETA said it wants to "monitor those who are out in the woods with death on their minds." The group said it wants to capture video footage of "slob hunters" who drink while in possession of a firearm, fail to pursue maimed animals and use spotlights and hunting lures that are banned in some places. The group said it also intends to use drones over factory farms, fishing holes and other places "where animals routinely suffer and die." "The talk is usually about drones being used as killing machines, but PETA drones will be used to save lives," PETA President Ingrid E. Newkirk said in a statement. "Slob hunters may need to rethink the idea that they can get away with murder, alone out there in the woods with no one watching." Newkirk later told CNN that PETA was also planning to fly drones overseas where the group is active. A blogger at AmmoLand.com reacted to the announcement with expected snark: "Sounds to me like this will create a whole new shooting sport. ‘PETA Drone Target Shooting.’ " So PETA says it is planning to use drones both domestically and abroad, but it hasn't yet. Negron got that mixed up. But other wildlife protection groups, such as the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, have used drones to target illegal hunters in other countries. The World Wildlife Fund received a $5 million grant from Google to deploy technology, such as sensors, tags and "conservation drones," that would help protect elephants, rhinos and tigers from wildlife traffickers and poachers. The group has already tested conservation drones over national parks in Nepal. Negron sent us a U.S. News and World Report story about a Belgian research team conducting unmanned aerial surveys in Burkina Faso. Drones are better than plane-based surveying because they cost less and can be deployed more easily, a researcher explained. However, drones have a limited flying time and the camera zoom is sometimes not effective. The researchers could not see antelopes or baboons but could count elephants. In this instance, Negron is right that drones are being used overseas, but he referenced hunters -- not illegal poachers -- when describing their target. For the record, Negron’s bill does nothing to prevent private groups from using drones in Florida. SB 92 would ban the use of drones by law enforcement unless they have a warrant or are responding to threat of terrorist attack. It also prevents information obtained by drones from being used in the courts as evidence. Another point: In the United States, flying a drone isn't as simple as buying one and putting it in the air. The Federal Aviation Administration regulates drone use by government entities and corporations. Because PETA is a nonprofit, it might be able to work around the rules by flying under model aircraft rules, which generally limit operations below 400 feet and away from air traffic. "The caveat there is that some of the operations that they have talked about doing would appear to be difficult to do while maintaining sight of the unmanned aircraft," said FAA spokesman Les Dorr, pointing to model aircraft guidelines the group would have to follow. Our ruling Negron said he thought PETA is "using this really fancy drone to follow hunters around in some places in other countries to watch their hunting activities." Negron, to our eye, conflates PETA's plan to use drones to watch hunters in the United States and abroad with other wildlife groups currently tracking poachers overseas with drones. But his main point is largely right. Animal rights groups are using drones to look for animal abuses. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-00135	"Many presidents don’t get the chance to put a Supreme Court justice on."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-said-many-presidents-dont-get-appoint/	One of President Donald Trump’s most significant achievements in office has been the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Trump took a victory lap during an Oct. 24 rally in Mosinee, Wis., reminiscing about the two justices he had nominated for the court, Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. "A lot of people say that's the most important decision a president can make," Trump said (at about the 25-minute mark in this video). "Now, I would say war and peace. ... But it is a very, very important decision. And they are two great people and I'm very honored. You know, many presidents don't get a chance to put a Supreme Court justice on. Here we are less than two years and we put two of them on." We wondered if Trump is right that "many presidents don't get a chance to put a Supreme Court justice on." He’s not. We looked at the full list of Supreme Court justices and found that only four presidents failed to nominate a justice during their tenure in the White House. Put another way, more than 90 percent of presidents have sent at least one justice to the court. And during the last 150 years, there has been only one such unlucky president. Here’s the rundown of presidents who didn’t get one of their nominations on the Supreme Court: • William Henry Harrison, the ninth president. Harrison died after serving only 31 days in office. • Zachary Taylor, the 12th president. Taylor died after serving a year and four months in office. • Andrew Johnson, the 17th president. Johnson succeeded the assassinated Abraham Lincoln and spent less than a full term in office. • Jimmy Carter, the 39th president. Carter served one term before losing reelection. Putting at least one justice on "is not at all uncommon" for a president, said Rutgers University presidential historian David Greenberg. Here’s a list of post-World War II presidents and the number of successful Supreme Court appointments each had. President Number of Supreme Court justices placed Harry Truman 4 Dwight Eisenhower 5 John F. Kennedy 2 Lyndon B. Johnson 2 Richard Nixon 4 Gerald Ford 1 Jimmy Carter 0 Ronald Reagan 3 George H.W. Bush 2 Bill Clinton 2 George W. Bush 2 Barack Obama 2 Donald Trump 2 The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said, "Many presidents don’t get the chance to put a Supreme Court justice on." Only four presidents out of 45 have failed to place a justice on the high court, which doesn’t come close to the description "many." In the past 150 years, only one president has missed a chance, Jimmy Carter. We rate the statement False.

pomt-06409	"You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/oct/27/jim-waldman/rep-waldman-says-you-are-prohibited-walking-capito/	In the old days, before Oct. 1, 2011, when folks headed to the beach or a park in some Florida cities, local laws forbade them from strapping a gun to their bathing suit or bringing it along in the picnic basket. But in the wake of the deadly shooting in Tucson, Florida legislators during the 2011 legislative session took up a slew of pro-gun laws and one -- House Bill 45 -- made it loud and clear that it's up to the state, not each individual city or local government, to set firearm laws. And that means holders of concealed weapons permits are free to bring that gun along with the sunblock and sandwiches to a local or state park. State law doesn't allow permit holders to bring their guns everywhere -- in fact there's a long list that shows everywhere guns aren't allowed including: • "Any meeting of the governing body of a county, public school district, municipality, or special district;" • "Any meeting of the Legislature or a committee thereof;" • "Any school, college, or professional athletic event not related to firearms;" • "Any elementary or secondary school facility or administration building." • "Any place where the carrying of firearms is prohibited by federal law." State Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek, who voted against House Bill 45, wants his home county of Broward essentially carved out of the law, so he plans to file a bill to ban carrying guns in many local government buildings in Broward County. In an Oct. 24 posting on the political blog browardbeat.com, Waldman said: "You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board. It is the height of hypocrisy." Waldman's words drew more than a dozen comments from readers and these caught our eye: "Jimbo is wrong. It’s legal to bring your gun into the Capitol. It’s illegal to bring it into the chamber, hence the 2nd metal detectors before you enter…" "Maybe Jim should file a bill to allow guns into the Capitol, instead. Let’s see how the gun nuts go for that." We wanted to check Waldman's claim: Is it illegal to walk into the Capitol with a gun but visitors can pay a visit to the County Commission or School Board with a loaded weapon? Waldman's bill and House Bill 45 First, a word about Waldman's proposed bill, which was in the process of being drafted as of Oct. 27. Waldman's bill would make it illegal to carry a handgun or concealed weapon or firearm within certain government buildings in Broward including the Broward County Governmental Center, the school district's administration building and one building in each city designated by city commissions. Violators would face a second-degree misdemeanor. Broward County has suggested an even broader ban to include additional county sites and Broward's state legislative delegation will have to decide how to proceed on both proposals. (A political aside: a bill tightening gun restrictions from Broward's mostly Democratic legislative delegation will face an uphill battle in Republican-dominated Tallahassee. But we're checking Waldman's facts here -- not his odds.) House Bill 45, which generally prohibits local governments from regulating firearms, passed the House 85-33 on April 26, 2011, and the Senate 30-8 on April 28 and was approved by Gov. Rick Scott June 2. The law allows judgments of up to $100,000 against local governments that enforce such laws, and local officials could be fired and fined $5,000. As the law was set to take effect Oct. 1, cities began eliminating ordinances that banned guns from parks or other places. Guns at the Capitol Waldman said, "You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun..." In short, he misfired. PolitiFact Florida asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which oversees the Capitol Police, to explain what HB 45 means with respect to gun-toting visitors at the Capitol. "Effective October 1 (as a result of passage of HB 45), concealed weapons permit holders may bring firearms into the Capitol," spokeswoman Heather Smith wrote in an e-mail. "Upon entry, Capitol Police will check that the individual has a permit to carry a concealed firearm. Capitol Police will also provide a written notice that advises them that they are prohibited from entering rooms where the Legislature is in session or in committee. If requested, we do have the ability to temporarily store those firearms (on a limited basis). Prior to HB 45, only sworn law enforcement officers could bring firearms into the Capitol." There are metal detectors to get into the Capitol and the public galleries of the House and Senate but not committee rooms, Smith said. So that means a person with a valid concealed weapons permit can bring a gun to meet with Rep. Waldman in his office -- but not to watch him vote or speak in the House chamber or during a committee meeting. So Waldman was wrong when he said you can't walk into the Capitol with a gun. Guns and the School Board/County Commission What about the rest of Waldman's claim: "...but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board." State statute 790.06 lists where you can't bring a gun including any meeting of a governing body of a county, public school district or city as well as to any school event not related to firearms, or school facility or administration building. So clearly the statute says you can't bring a gun to a county commission or school board meeting. But could you bring a gun to a commissioner's office? Kraig Conn, an attorney with the Florida League of Cities which fought House Bill 45, said he has gotten about 50 phone calls or e-mails from cities and counties as they struggle to interpret the law. Some may interpret the law to mean permit holders are only forbidden from carrying their guns into the actual room where the commissioners are meeting while others may interpret it to mean that guns are forbidden in city hall -- period. "If I'm a city attorney, I'm thinking I really don't want my elected city officials, or administrators, to be charged with a violation, and I would interpret this to mean you can bring your gun if you have a concealed weapons permit but you absolutely cannot have access to the meeting room," Conn said. "If it's a small city hall and there are not a bunch of other offices in it, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you can't bring the gun in the building at all while there’s a meeting." Broward assistant county attorney Tricia Brissett wrote in an e-mail that the statute means visitors can't carry a firearm into a county commission meeting but wouldn't answer if visitors could carry guns into areas of county buildings where commissioners aren't meeting. Broward has taken down signs that announced a gun ban -- a clue that the county isn't interpreting the law to mean a total prohibition on guns at the county's administration building. Miami-Dade County interprets the law to mean permit holders can't bring a gun into the county commission meeting, Miami-Dade assistant county attorney Jess McCarty said. But the gun-holder can bring the gun to meet with the mayor in his office. Any clarification of the law won't occur until the Legislature takes it up again or there are legal challenges, Conn said. Waldman's explanation In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Waldman said his statement was wrong. "I'm not sure if what was quoted was exactly what I said. I probably didn't say it artfully enough. You can't go into chambers or a committee meeting where we are meeting, where legislators are," with a gun, he said. "We protect ourselves but we don't protect our staff. That is the hypocrisy I was talking about. .... You can bring a gun if you have a concealed weapons permit into a Capitol building." We were still confused because Waldman's proposed bill doesn't address protecting staff who work at the Capitol -- it's about gun access at local government buildings such as county hall and the school district. "Administration areas of the school board and county commission are not protected, that's what I was trying to say," Waldman said. "I didn't say it very clearly I have to admit that." But the law does clearly say that guns are prohibited at "any elementary or secondary school facility or administration building." So we asked Waldman, why include Broward's school administration building in his bill? Waldman interpreted the law to mean guns aren't allowed in administration facilities within schools -- not the administration building itself. Buddy Nevins, the reporter who writes browardbeat.com, told PolitiFact that he quoted Waldman accurately. "He did not qualify it himself," Nevins said. Our ruling Waldman said: "You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board." On the first half of the sentence Waldman spoke too broadly -- permit holders can walk into the Capitol with a gun but can't carry that gun into a meeting of the House or Senate. And it's clear that you can't carry a gun into a meeting of the county commission or school board but at least some government attorneys interpret the law to mean you can carry your gun into a commissioner's office at city or county hall. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Jim Waldman	None	None	None	2011-10-27T16:06:38	2011-10-24	['None']

pomt-03714	Says President Barack Obama "has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases (for background check failures) to go down. ... They've declined every year since President Bush left office."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/16/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-says-gun-prosecutions-have-declined-/	As Congress debates whether to enact new restrictions on firearms, one argument often voiced by opponents is that the federal government should enforce existing gun laws rather than passing new ones, such as a bill now pending that would expand background checks to virtually all gun sales, including gun shows and online sales. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., made this argument on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on April 14, 2013. Guest host Jonathan Karl asked, "But very quickly, are you going to be able to defeat the background checks?" Sessions replied, "I don't think it's going to pass. The president of the United States has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. I was a federal prosecutor. I prosecuted those. He needs to prosecute the laws that we have today. They've declined every year since President Bush left office." We wondered whether that was accurate, so we looked at the data. First, we’ll note that we are focusing on the prosecutions arising from background checks, rather than the number of prosecutions of other types of gun crimes, because Sessions’ statement was made in response to a question about background checks. We’ll also ignore prosecutions by state officials, since Sessions’ statement referred to the presidential role, which oversees federal, not state, prosecutorial actions. (Under President Barack Obama, background check denial information has been made available to state and local law enforcement through the National Crime Information Center, the Justice Department said in a statement to PolitiFact.) Now, here’s some background on the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The system, which began operating in 1998, is an automated system that enables a gun seller to instantly check a series of government databases to determine whether a potential purchaser is eligible to buy a gun under federal or state law. In recent years, the Justice Department has published annual reports on how many times this system has flagged an ineligible purchaser and whether they were prosecuted. Looking back at these individual reports makes it possible to chart the number of prosecutions over time. Here’s a summary: 2005: 135 prosecutions 2006: 112 prosecutions 2007: 122 prosecutions 2008: 105 prosecutions 2009: 77 prosecutions 2010: 44 prosecutions So it’s correct for Sessions to say that prosecutions have "declined every year" since President George W. Bush left office. Still, it’s worth pointing out two caveats. First, data has not yet been published for the final two years of Obama’s first term. (If history is any guide, the data for 2011 should be published in August 2013.) So the number of prosecutions might have gone up in 2011 and 2012, but we don’t know yet. Second, it’s worth noting that even though the raw numbers of prosecutions have declined in recent years, prosecutions consistently represented a tiny proportion of all flagged purchasers under both presidents. Here are the year-by-year totals: 2005: prosecutions accounted for 0.20 percent of background check denials 2006: prosecutions accounted for 0.15 percent of background check denials 2007: prosecutions accounted for 0.16 percent of background check denials 2008: prosecutions accounted for 0.13 percent of background check denials 2009: prosecutions accounted for 0.11 percent of background check denials 2010: prosecutions accounted for 0.06 percent of background check denials So the rates have been lower under Obama, but they were already exceedingly low under Bush -- always at or lower than two-tenths of a percent of all denials. When Sessions compared the numbers under Obama and Bush, he was effectively blaming Obama for forgoing prosecutions of these types of crimes. He’s right -- but only up to a point. The president, as the official in charge of the executive branch, does have the authority to order changes in prosecutorial priorities, and in a broad sense, most administrations do shift prosecutorial goals at the Justice Department based on their own assessment of what issues need heightened attention and enforcement. However, while the president can set the tone, any changes need to happen under the direction of the attorney general, and then filter down to the front-line Justice Department attorneys on the case. "The president and his staff can create the momentum and certainly set the agenda for the attorney general to follow," said Joshua Berman, currently a partner at the law firm Katten Muchin and a former federal prosecutor in the southern district of New York and in Washington. "It would not be unheard of or improper for the president or the president’s staff to push the department or the attorney general to increase investigations and prosecutions of a particular kind of crime such as cybercrime or gun crimes. ... That being said, there is no way the president is micromanaging that effort." Our ruling Sessions said that Obama "has allowed, each year he's been here, the prosecutions of gun cases to go down. .. They've declined every year since President Bush left office." That’s true -- but the data covers only the first two years of Obama’s term, and it didn’t nosedive under Obama since it was already a tiny percentage under Bush. Obama could order tougher prosecution of gun-denial cases, but like his predecessors, he or his appointees have determined that other crimes are more urgent and take precedence. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Jeff Sessions	None	None	None	2013-04-16T16:28:53	2013-04-14	['George_W._Bush', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-01590	"Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/sep/05/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-big-oil-gave-scott-brown-45426/	Former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown -- now running to return to the Senate -- hasn’t officially made it through the Republican primary yet, but he’s long been considered the frontrunner to take on incumbent U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., in November’s general election. Brown has been the subject of numerous attack ads by outside groups, including a recent ad by the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic-aligned group, that claimed that he voted to give oil companies huge tax breaks and, in exchange, took more than $400,000 in campaign contributions. PolitFact New Hampshire rated the claim in that ad Half True. Now, Brown finds himself the target of a similar ad, this time directly from the Shaheen campaign. "The big oil companies are the most profitable on the planet," a narrator says at the beginning of the 30-second ad titled "Profitable." "Scott Brown voted to give them more than $20 billion in taxpayer subsidies. Big Oil gave Scott Brown thousands of dollars within days of his votes." Meanwhile, a visual in the ad puts a number on those "thousands of dollars" that Brown received: "Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260," the ad declares. This seemed like something PolitiFact should sort out. Since we’ve already fact-checked Brown’s "big oil" votes, we’ll focus here on the breakdown of contributions to his campaign and the specific number cited in Shaheen’s ad. The Shaheen campaign pointed us to OpenSecrets.org, an independent website run by the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks money in politics. The site tracks donations of at least $200 in congressional and other elections. At the time Shaheen’s ad first aired, OpenSecrets’ website showed $454,260 in campaign contributions from oil- and gas-industry donors for Brown over the course of his career. That was precisely the number cited by Shaheen. By now, that’s actually a little out of date; updated figures show Brown has received $488,010 from donors associated with the oil and gas industry. The total makes the oil and gas industry the 14th most popular sector giving to Brown. The biggest sectors Brown receives money from are retired individuals, securities and investment, lawyers and law firms, and real estate, each of which account for at least $1 million. But these numbers don’t tell the whole story. Calling Brown’s donors "Big Oil" isn’t entirely accurate, since many such donors are not huge corporations or high-powered CEOs. OpenSecrets defines oil and gas companies as "multinational and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, natural gas pipeline companies, gasoline service stations and fuel oil dealers." So while this category includes what would widely be understood as "big oil," it also includes smaller, independent companies, as well as low-level individuals who happen to work for an oil company. In fact, a breakdown of the contributions made to Brown from the oil and gas industry shows that only $52,550 of the total came from "major multinational oil and gas producers." That’s just 11.5 percent. One other quibble: The ad makes it sound like the companies themselves are donating, but that’s true only for a minority of the dollars donated. Overall, $168,000 came from political action committees, which pool employee dollars and make donations in the employer’s name. The other $287,760 came from individuals associated with oil and gas companies. The reasons for an individual’s donation may have everything or nothing to do with the industry’s policy agenda. Our ruling Shaheen’s ad said that "Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260." Independently collected data shows that while Brown received roughly that much from donors categorized under the "oil and gas industry," only about 11.5 percent of that haul came from companies and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what most viewers would consider "Big Oil." The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. So we rate this claim Half True.	None	Jeanne Shaheen	None	None	None	2014-09-05T17:40:27	2014-08-27	['None']
pomt-11342	"The Coast Guard confiscated 200 tons of contraband, heroin, and so forth. At the border they collected 20 tons."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/apr/09/john-garamendi/california-lawmaker-says-coast-guard-confiscates-t/	U.S. Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., said that if President Donald Trump wants to make the country safer, he should focus more on funding the Coast Guard than on his promised border wall. After all, Garamendi claimed, the Coast Guard confiscates tons of contraband. "I'm concerned about border security. I'm concerned about the Coast Guard being underfunded," Garamendi said in an April 2 CNN interview. "Fact of the matter is, the Coast Guard confiscated 200 tons of contraband, heroin, and so forth. At the border they collected 20 tons. So if you want to go where the problem is, fund the Coast Guard." Trump says a southern border wall will stop drugs from coming in and alleviate the nation’s drug overdose epidemic. Drug trade and policy experts are skeptical about that. In his first year, the Trump administration did initially explore a Coast Guard budget cut to offset costs of the southern border wall, prompting bipartisan group of senators to send a letter to the White House against it. The final proposal did not cut the Coast Guard’s budget. The Coast Guard got $12.1 billion in the omnibus spending bill that Trump signed into law in March. So, is Garamendi’s claim about Coast Guard confiscations true? He’s largely accurate about their enforcement efforts, but his remarks omit nuance and need clarification. To start, his office said he meant to highlight interdictions of cocaine, not heroin. The Coast Guard in fiscal year 2017 removed 223.8 metric tons of cocaine from non-commercial vessels in drug transit zones. Removal figures represent cocaine physically seized by the Coast Guard and cocaine discarded or destroyed by criminal organizations due to Coast Guard action. The 223.8 metric tons removed represents about 8 percent of all the cocaine estimated to have flowed toward the United States in 2017. The amount lost is "at times, an intelligence-based estimate of the quantity of cocaine onboard a given vessel that is burned, jettisoned, or scuttled in an attempt to destroy evidence when Coast Guard presence is detected," said a January 2018 report from the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Homeland Security. In addition to the cocaine removed, the Coast Guard told PolitiFact that in 2017 it also removed 31,190 pounds of marijuana, 6 kilograms of heroin and other opiates, and 168 kilograms of methamphetamines. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in September 2017 commended the Coast Guard for setting a new record. "This record-breaking year by our Coast Guard saw the arrest of more than 500 suspected drug traffickers and kept nearly half a million pounds of dangerous drugs from getting to our streets — and ultimately to our neighbors, friends, and families," Sessions said. The Coast Guard in an October 2017 blog post also said its crews and interagency partners’ 2017 record stopped over 455,000 pounds of cocaine worth over $6 billion wholesale. "Annually, the Coast Guard interdicts more than three times the amount of cocaine seized at our borders and within the U.S. combined," the blog post said. Now let’s look at the border. Garamendi’s remark that "at the border they collected 20 tons" also made it sound as if "they" still referred to the Coast Guard. While the Coast Guard is not responsible for land border interdictions, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that in fiscal year 2017, its field officers and Border Patrol agents seized about 66,000 pounds of cocaine (about 30 metric tons). "Interdictions at the land border average around 20 metric tons with another 20 metric tons by law enforcement inside our borders," said Eric Olsen, Garamendi’s press secretary. In a story about the Coast Guard’s record year, the Washington Post quoted Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the Coast Guard commandant, as saying that he looks at a border wall "as a goal-line defense." "The fact is that we have awareness of these drug movements and actually are attacking because we know where they’re at, and just don’t have enough attackers," Zukunft said, according to the newspaper. "The border really is your last-stop measure." Our ruling Garamendi in a CNN interview said, "The Coast Guard confiscated 200 tons of contraband, heroin, and so forth.

pomt-06708	On Milwaukee County government’s debt burden	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/02/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-chris-abele-says-county/	Chris Abele bolstered his leadership credentials in the 2011 county executive’s race by boasting of his support for a plan to borrow millions of dollars to pay off Milwaukee County’s burgeoning pension costs. Now in office, Abele is publicly lamenting the amount of debt the county is facing, using terms like "reckless" to describe the level of borrowing. So, did Abele change his tune once he changed his title from philanthropist to Milwaukee County executive? At least one member of the Milwaukee County Board thinks so. Supervisor Theo Lipscomb Sr. says it is unfair for Abele to attack the county's debt level when he has supported and even touted his role in promoting the pension obligation bond financing of 2009. "Politically, you can't have it both ways," Lipscomb said. Sounds like a job for the Flip-O-Meter. As we roll it out, we do so with our standard disclaimer: We are not evaluating whether it is good politics or good policy to change a position. You can decide that. We’re measuring whether the position has changed. Let’s start at the beginning. Abele led a coalition of prominent community figures that studied and endorsed the pension-debt idea in 2006 and again in 2008 as then-County Executive Scott Walker sought state permission to issue the bonds. "It was hard work, but it was the fiscally responsible thing to do," Abele wrote on his campaign website about the successful lobbying campaign. In 2009, the county borrowed nearly $400 million to help pay off unfunded pension liabilities over 25 years. That move, along with accelerated borrowing under the federal stimulus program, effectively doubled the county’s outstanding debt by 2010. (Walker was elected governor in November 2010, leaving the seat open in early 2011.) The long-term pension borrowing deal carries potential risks and rewards. Borrowed proceeds are invested in hopes of growing a pot that could shrink the eventual tab for taxpayers. But it puts the county on the hook for regular payments with no guarantee the investment will pan out as planned. Abele made his support for the pension-borrowing deal clear in the 2011 campaign. He claimed a lot of credit for making it happen and contended it would be a big money saver. In a campaign ad, he said the bonds will save over $200 million. He went further in a campaign fundraising letter, saying the approach already "saved" $237 million. PolitiFact Wisconsin gave a False to the TV ad claim: Nobody knows how much, if anything they will save over 25 years. Flash forward to August 2011. Abele drew attention to the issue -- and his own position on it -- with comments to a reporter the day after an Aug. 25, 2011, hearing on the 2012 budget. The headline on a subsequent article in Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: "Abele blames high county debt on ‘reckless’ borrowing." At a listening session conducted as he seeks public input on cuts to balance his first budget, Abele had declared that "by accumulating this much debt, we have deeply diminished our ability to use tax dollars for what they were meant for," such as transit, parks, health services for the poor and other county services. Team Abele’s presentation included a slide outlining the steep increase in annual debt service payments from Walker’s second budget (2004) to the projected 2012 figure. Bottom line: the payments more than double, from $52 million to $108 million. Here’s what the Journal Sentinel said on Aug. 28, 2011, based on coverage of the listening session and an interview with Abele: "Abele said the extent of past borrowing, which rose under Gov. Scott Walker's tenure as county executive, was unwise despite worthy projects for which the money was borrowed. "I do think it's been reckless," Abele said Friday. "Every decision to incur debt should have been made with the knowledge of what that would mean." We asked Abele about the new remarks. He argued they do not represent a shift: Borrowing for pensions, he said, "was a good idea then, and it’s a good idea now." What was irresponsible, Abele told us, was accumulating that much debt -- specifically the reckless decision to "incur expenses without the ability to pay." He singled out spending millions on generous lump-sum pension payouts. He was referring to one of the many pension sweeteners that drew public ire during the pension scandal that drove former Executive F. Thomas Ament from office. Ament was replaced by Walker in 2002. Abele says he also was referring to the $470 million in non-pension debt as "reckless" -- though various outside studies have said the county actually had prudent and strong debt policies in place. Abele made clear during the campaign he strongly wanted to accelerate debt payments. And he argues that it’s not exactly "new debt" because the pension liability had to be paid off one way or another. Our conclusion: This situation reminds us of statements by Jeff Stone, the Republican who lost to Abele in the 2011 exec’s race. Stone backed Walker’s controversial curbs on collective bargaining for most public employees, but then when running for county office said he would have taken a different approach if he’d been in charge. Still, he didn’t renounce his vote. We gave Stone a Half Flip, which is defined as "a partial change of position or inconsistent statements." Now, it is Abele who is muddying the waters. As an outsider before he ran for office, he advocated taking on more debt and downplayed concerns about kicking the can down the road. Now that it’s his problem as county executive, he leaves the impression -- without an explicit reversal of his position on borrowing for pensions -- that all this debt is hurting the county and was ill-advised. Indeed, he includes all of the pension borrowing in his chart highlighting the debt problem. But, in fact, so far the investment returns on the pension bonds have allowed the county to put less toward annual payments to the pension fund -- in effect helping free up more money for parks and other departments. On this issue, Abele has certainly made inconsistent statements. That rates as a Half Flip.	None	Chris Abele	None	None	None	2011-09-02T09:00:00	2011-08-26	['None']

pomt-03349	"Georgia is nearly 50 percent Democratic and (the Republican majority) diminished our voting strength to 32 percent through gerrymandered maps."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/19/nikema-williams/georgia-democrats-blame-their-numbers-gerrymanderi/	This week, Georgia’s revered civil rights icon and congressman U.S. Rep. John Lewis testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the first congressional hearing after the Supreme Court’s decision last month striking down a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In late June, the court voted 5 to 4 to abolish a requirement that all or parts of 15 states with a history of racial discrimination get Justice Department approval before changing election laws. The court ruled that the 40-year-old demographic data used to determine which states fall under the preclearance requirement was outdated and not reflective of societal changes. The court’s decision drew criticism from many civil rights and Democratic groups. The Georgia Democratic Party leader called the decision "unfathomable." "The Republican Majority in Georgia drew maps in 2012 that reduced Democratic voting performance," interim party Chairwoman Nikema Williams said in a news release. "Georgia is nearly 50 percent Democratic and they diminished our voting strength to 32 percent through gerrymandered maps. However, the Supreme Court ruling may backfire when Democrats across the state rally." Had Georgia’s Democratic numbers in the state decreased by nearly a third? And if so, were gerrymandered maps to blame? We decided to follow the numbers. We started by checking the 50 percent figure. PolitiFact Georgia has previously examined a similar claim. Tracking R’s and D’s in the Peach State is difficult because Georgia does not have partisan voter registration. Primaries are open to everyone regardless of party affiliation. In the 2012 general election, about 53.3 percent of voters cast ballots for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, versus 45.5 percent for Democrat Barack Obama (a difference of 7.8 points). The point spread increased to 10 points in the 2010 gubernatorial race, but it narrowed to 5.2 points for the presidential race in the 2008 general election. In a 2011 poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 38 percent of voters said they were Republicans, and 35 percent identified as Democrats. A 2008 Pew Research Center poll reported similar voter statistics for Georgia: 32 percent identified as Republicans, and 31 percent as Democrats. A 2008 Gallup poll leaned more to the left with 45.4 percent of voters labeled Democrat or leaning Democratic, compared to 41.8 percent Republican or leaning that way. So, polling data supports that part of Williams’ claim, but actual voting numbers differ. We contacted the state Democratic Party’s spokeswoman, Liz Flowers, about the other parts of her boss’ statement. Flowers said Williams’ 32 percent figure is based on the Democratic representation in the Georgia Legislature. By our count, there are 77 Democrats in the 236-member state General Assembly. Doing the math on those numbers works out to a 32 percent Democratic showing. But is the 32 percent representation a product of "gerrymandered maps" as Williams claimed? Georgia’s most recent redistricting was completed two years ago. Democrats argued that the Republican-controlled state Legislature had redrawn the districts to give the GOP an advantage, which is the definition of gerrymandering. The redrawn maps pitted Democrat against Democrat in the 2012 elections, particularly in the metro Atlanta area, which substantially reduced Democratic representation, Flowers said. But a review of legislative members in the session prior to redistricting showed about a 35 percent Democratic representation. So the 2011 redistricting seems to have caused a targeted, but not necessarily substantial, reduction in party counts. And the Democratic numbers are probably not all due to redistricting, said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, who has long studied Georgia’s voting trends. "In our system where (a candidate) wins or loses a district outright, usually the majority party will get a bonus, more than its proportionate share of seats," he said. "This tends to be true no matter which party is in the majority. "Even if you had an independent master draw up the (redistricting) plan, the majority party would still get more seats because of the way our system is set up," Bullock said. And, when it comes to gerrymandering election maps, experts say the Democrats have done it too. To sum up, Williams said that although Georgia is nearly 50 percent Democratic, the Republican majority reduced Democratic voting strength in the state Legislature to 32 percent through gerrymandered maps. Polling data in which voters self-identify their party affiliation seems to support Williams’ 50 percent claim, although some actual voting numbers show large advantages in votes for Republican candidates. The Democratic representation, taken at face value, is 32 percent, but placing the blame for that low representation on Republican-led redistricting is not totally fair. And besides, when Democrats are in control, they do it too, experts said. Williams’ claim contains some truth, but it leaves out significant context that might give the reader a different impression. We rated the claim Half True.	None	Nikema Williams	None	None	None	2013-07-19T00:00:00	2013-06-25	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03708	Says Texas "school systems" lose 45 days a year on testing.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/apr/17/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-texas-school-systems-lose-45-d/	Talking about education reform on a Dallas-area talk show April 8, 2013, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst aired a number that PolitiFact Texas has studied before. Dewhurst said during the program, hosted by Mark Davis on KSKY-AM 660, that he wants to "reduce this excessive number of days that our school systems lose every year, some 45 days on testing." When Dewhurst spoke, the Texas Legislature was working on measures to reduce from 15 tests to five tests the number of end-of-course exams high school students must pass to graduate. The House passed such a proposal March 26, 2013; the Senate had yet to act. The 15 end-of-course tests were first administered in spring 2012. Students in elementary school and middle school also take tests under the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness program, which is gradually replacing the less rigorous Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills. Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine emailed us news and opinion articles from three Texas newspapers that gave the 45-day figure but did not explain its basis. We spoke to the authors of two items and a source from the third; nothing conclusive emerged. Last year, we examined a statement similar to Dewhurst’s when former state Sen. Ted Lyon said, "Most schools spend 45 days out of the 180 days in a school year in some form of mandated testing." In that Aug. 29, 2012, fact-check, we found that the state’s 2011-12 testing calendar showed 25 days plus flexible test periods for TAKS and STAAR, and we estimated that district-level "benchmark" tests might fall on another four to nine days. Not every school would take part in each test, though; elementaries, for example, would not be administering high-school exit tests. Overall, we concluded there was no evidence that most schools gave mandatory tests on 45 days, and rated Lyon’s statement False. Dewhurst referred to "school systems," which we took to mean districts rather than individual schools. So we set out to check the current levels of state- and district-mandated testing. Our count of state-mandated exams on Texas’ 2012-13 and 2013-14 testing calendars, with assistance and explanations from Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe, suggests there are a minimum of 22 STAAR/TAKS test days and a maximum of 36 (if a district uses all the dates in the flexible "windows," which are two-week spans during which districts schedule up to nine STAAR exams). At the district level, we had bits of evidence but no complete picture. In our 2012 fact-check, we learned that the Mesquite district, just east of Dallas, gave four "benchmark" tests in a year. Another 2012 fact-check had shown that the Austin school district gave (depending on grade level) four to nine benchmark tests. Do schools systems "lose" a day per test? STAAR exams take four hours, so one test wouldn’t occupy a whole school day, but two tests would take either a whole day or, of course, half of two days. Testing, however, can cause campus disruption outside of the exams themselves. Some campuses delay the start of school on test days, so the staff can focus on giving exams in the mornings. From readers, educators’ associations and others, we heard anecdotal reports of time spent on test preparation; regular classes moved, hushed or halted during tests; and teachers pulled from classes to help administer tests. So: What have we learned? Districts are required to conduct STAAR/TAKS testing on at least 22 days and at most 36 days. Adding in our guess of four to nine district-mandated test days brings that to a minimum of 26 days and a maximum of 46. If a district uses all 18 district-level test days permitted by state law, the maximum goes up to 54. Again, it’s important to note that no individual school is likely to conduct tests on all of those days, because only certain grades take certain tests. Similarly, individual students would not take every test. Ratcliffe helped us calculate that a student might face as few as two STAAR days -- a third-grader, who’s only tested in two subjects -- or, at the most, 15, in the unlikely event a 10th-grader failed five STAAR subjects last year, then fails five more this year and has to retake all 10. (About 70 percent of Texas high schoolers passed all five tests last year, Ratcliffe said.) On the other hand, STAAR and TAKS aren’t the only tests given, not by a long chalk. Exams that can be administered to cross-sections of the student body include the NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress), which is given to enable national comparisons of student performance in certain grades, and TELPAS (Texas English Language Proficiency Assessment System), given to chosen students to determine their knowledge of English. Our ruling Dewhurst said that "our school systems lose every year, some 45 days on testing." The precise 45-day figure is widely cited without explanation or proof. Meantime, testing calendars and state law suggest that state-mandated plus district-required tests could -- might -- occupy parts of 22 to 54 days. School-level tests could affect more days, but Dewhurst (unlike Lyons) was speaking to districts, not individual schools. If a number is floated without direct factual backup, it’s hard for us to buy. Still, we see an element of truth to this statement: It’s inside the range of 22 to 54 days supported by test calendars and the law. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-13918	"People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/24/paul-ryan/second-amendment-right-semiautomatic-rifles/	Meet the Press host Chuck Todd did a double-take after House Speaker Paul Ryan made a claim about semiautomatic rifles, which was the type of gun used in the mass shooting in Orlando days earlier. "I grew up hunting with Remington 7400s, which are semiautomatic rifles. Cosmetically they look different, they function exactly the same," the Wisconsin Republican said on the June 19, 2016 edition of the show. "So, look, we can go into all of these issues other than to say, people have a constitutional right to bear arms. People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles." Todd then interrupted Ryan, saying: "There’s nothing in the Second Amendment that says you have a right for a semiautomatic. You can regulate." Ryan agreed that the government can put restrictions on guns. But what about his statement? Do Americans have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles? Five experts we consulted agreed that Ryan was generally on target -- though, as University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck put it, "there’s a ton of nuance behind" his statement. 2008 case key Automatic rifles, which fire continuously when the trigger is pressed, are essentially banned by federal law. Semiautomatics -- which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed -- are not banned, though some states do impose restrictions on them. To check Ryan’s claim, we spoke with four law professors who are experts on gun law: Vladeck; Nicholas Johnson of Fordham University; Robert Spitzer of State University of New York-Cortland; and Adam Winkler at UCLA in Los Angeles. We also spoke to Adam Bates, a criminal justice policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution -- "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" -- was passed by Congress in 1789 and ratified two years later. So, it does not, of course, explicitly declare a right to have a semiautomatic rifle, a version of which wasn’t invented until about a century later. The U.S. Supreme Court also has not explicitly declared a constitutional right to semiautomatic rifles. But semiautomatic rifles, as Ryan suggested with his reference to a hunting rifle, have been widely owned and commonly used for generations. The courts have allowed states to put restrictions on such rifles, but they have long been a legal firearm. All of the experts cited a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision in what is known as the Heller case, the high court’s first decision interpreting the Second Amendment since 1939. In a 5-4 ruling, the court said the Second Amendment confers an individual right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense. Key excerpts of the decision, which was written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia: The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home .... it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. Heller was a handgun case. But each of the experts told us that the decision has been read to includes semiautomatic rifles as being among guns protected by the Second Amendment -- and that any attempt to ban them (not restrict them) would very likely be ruled unconstitutional. Our rating Ryan said: "People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles." The U.S. Supreme Court decision has not explicitly declared that Americans have a constitutional right to semiautomatic rifles. And states can, within certain parameters, put restrictions on those guns. But generally speaking, experts told us, semiautomatic rifles are a legal weapon that fall under the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

pomt-03513	"Republicans actually doctored emails between administration officials about Benghazi. Then, they released them to the press, trying to pass them off as real."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/04/democratic-national-committee/democrats-say-republicans-doctored-emails-about-be/	The president’s political opponents have "been caught red-handed" making up "so-called ‘scandals,’" Democrats recently told supporters in an email blast. Congressional Republicans have stirred up "false rumors of vast ‘cover-ups’ happening in the White House" about attacks in Benghazi, Libya — and even altered the evidence, Democrats claimed. "Republicans actually doctored emails between administration officials about Benghazi," said the message from Brad Woodhouse, communications director for the Democratic National Committee. "Then, they released them to the press, trying to pass them off as real in order to create their scandal." Partisans creating counterfeit White House emails seemed like a serious charge to us. It also struck us as an exaggeration. We wanted to know: What’s the evidence for their claim that Republicans doctored the evidence? Tale of the talking points The emails in question trace the back-and-forth between the CIA, FBI, State Department and White House that resulted in controversial talking points used to explain the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi. Those talking points were used most infamously by Susan Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, on Sunday talk shows several days after the attacks. (In the resulting Republican uproar, she gave up her bid to be the next secretary of state.) Early drafts of the CIA talking points made references to terrorist groups, saying "we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qaida participated in the attack." But in 12 rounds of edits of the talking points, that reference disappeared. Instead, Rice told CBS’ Face the Nation on Sept. 16, 2012: "I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine." Republicans argued this was evidence the White House interfered, attempting to downplay a terrorist attack before the election. The White House said the gap between early and late versions of the talking points could be chalked up entirely to the best assessment of the "intelligence community" — in other words, political concerns of the State Department or White House had nothing to do with it. White House press secretary Jay Carney went so far as to claim in November that the "single adjustment" by the White House and State Department was to change the word "consulate" to "diplomatic facility." Republican Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte wanted to see the evidence. In January, they asked: Why had the administration refused to provide the full text of emails that would explain the deletion of references to al-Qaida and terrorism? Lawmakers got a peek at the messages. But the email exchange otherwise generally stayed under wraps — until some details appeared in an April 2013 report from House Republicans, then in May articles from the Weekly Standard, ABC News and others. They made Carney’s comments look entirely misleading: It turned out a State Department spokeswoman had raised "serious concerns" about the CIA talking points, and the White House had to play mediator — a bigger role for either of them than he had suggested. Shortly after the news reports, which relied on leaks of messages that weren’t yet public, the White House released 100 pages of back-and-forth between officials. And something else interesting emerged. While a State Department spokeswoman had weighed in on the CIA talking points, contrary to Carney’s suggestion, the early news reports that relied on leaks had inaccurately characterized a message from the White House. ABC News, for example, used a direct quote from a White House adviser that differed from the actual email text. The difference mattered: In the early reports, it looked like the White House was piping up in support of the State Department, which better served Republicans’ arguments that the White House was involved in a political coverup. The actual email looked like an even-handed attempt to resolve issues between the agencies. In news reports, the message from Ben Rhodes, then a deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, included a direct mention of the State Department. "We must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities, including those of the State Department, and we don’t want to undermine the FBI investigation," ABC News reported he had written, according to CNN. But Rhodes’ email had actually said to the group, "We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, particularly the investigation." He didn’t, in fact, single out the State Department. What happened? The Democrats’ explanation: Republicans doctored the emails! But explanations from ABC News and the author of the Weekly Standard piece, Stephen Hayes, tell a somewhat different story. Hayes explained to the Washington Post’s Fact Checker that someone provided him with "summaries" of email messages — not altered versions of emails. "I didn’t speak to anyone who represented the email summaries as direct quotes," Hayes told the Post. ABC News added an editor’s note to its story that it "should have been more precise in its sourcing of those quotes, attributing them to handwritten copies of the emails taken by a congressional source. We regret that error." Reporter Jonathan Karl said in an update that his source took notes on a long chain of emails that included references to the State Department, so the notes reflected that. "Summaries" and "handwritten copies of emails" are a bit different from "doctored" emails — wording that creates the impression of electronic fakery. Meanwhile, one detailed account of the email leak, from TPMDC, says that whomever shared the notes was "presumably a Republican." In other words, the leaker hasn’t been named. Woodhouse didn’t share evidence with us — or claim to know — exactly who leaked details from the emails. Nor could he prove that the source deliberately altered his or her notes to create a false impression, then lied to reporters. Our ruling The Democratic National Committee claimed to its supporters that "Republicans actually doctored emails between administration officials about Benghazi. Then, they released them to the press, trying to pass them off as real." But when we asked, Democrats didn’t provide evidence that discrepancies resulted from anything more than sloppy note-taking, or that journalists had been snookered into believing they had seen the original messages. ABC News, in fact, took responsibility for imprecision in its story. Hayes of the Weekly Standard says no one tried to misrepresent summaries that were leaked to him as actual emails. It’s certainly possible the leaker’s inaccurate notes were intended to deceive. But Democrats have failed to prove that’s the case. Their claim about doctoring evidence could use some evidence. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2013-06-04T15:04:24	2013-05-24	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Benghazi']
pomt-02579	"For the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s No. 1 place to invest; America is."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/business-leaders-declared-china-no-longer-worlds-n/	President Barack Obama made multiple claims about the improving U.S. economy during his 2014 State of the Union address, touting the nation’s resilience. After making claims about jobs, energy and the deficit, Obama had this to say about international business: "And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s No. 1 place to invest; America is." It was one of only two times during the speech the president mentioned China, long considered the ascendant rival of the U.S., and the second-largest economy in the world. (The other mention was about using export partnerships to create jobs.) Considering the breakneck growth of China’s economy, the claim piqued our curiosity. A White House spokesman said the comment referred to the 2013 A.T. Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, a survey of corporate executives from 302 companies in 28 countries that measured where companies are looking to make global investments. The top highlight: The United States took the No. 1 spot for the first time since 2001. Country Index value (0-3) 2013 rank 2012 rank 2010 rank United States 2.09 1 4 2 China 2.02 2 1 1 Brazil 1.97 3 3 4 Canada 1.86 4 20 9 India 1.85 5 2 3 Australia 1.83 6 6 7 Germany 1.83 7 5 5 United Kingdom 1.81 8 8 10 Mexico 1.77 9 - 8 Singapore 1.77 10 7 - Note: A.T. Kearney did not conduct a survey in 2011 This index -- in its 13th edition since 1998 -- is not a measure of actual dollars being brought in, but rather the confidence global companies have investing in certain nations in the future. A.T. Kearney, a global management consulting firm, said in its June 2013 report that foreign direct investment -- injecting money into a country’s economy by either buying a company or expanding an existing company -- in the United States is still down from the 2008 high of $306 billion, bringing in $167.7 billion in 2012. The index’s outlook is based on business leaders’ attitudes toward political, economic and regulatory changes and their potential effects on foreign investments. Corporate, regional and local business managers responding to the survey said China’s rising labor costs and focus on shifting to a consumer economy took some of the shine off the economic powerhouse, although 73 percent of the respondents said they would maintain holdings in the country. Meanwhile, partisan brinksmanship in the U.S. government made investors wary, but they were optimistic thanks to a favorable dollar, a slow but steady recovery and increasing U.S. manufacturing productivity. In all, 63 percent of respondents expected some growth in America’s economy. Even as the survey was taken amid the 2012 elections and budget fight, the U.S. was considered "a bedrock of stability among developed nations," the 2013 index report said. Is saying the U.S. is now the "No. 1 place to invest" an accurate portrayal of the results? A.T. Kearney director of communications Doug MacDonald said yes. "In terms of our index, it does," he told PolitiFact. "Ours actually asks business leaders what markets they’re looking forward to investing in." But what about other indices? A comparable study -- albeit with different measurement criteria -- is the Milken Institute’s Global Opportunity Index, which lists the United States as 22nd among 98 countries. That study tracked nations’ abilities to attract foreign direct investment by measuring factors across "economic fundamentals, regulatory barriers, ease of doing business, regulatory quality, and the rule of law." Released in March 2013, the Milken Institute’s report was created with 2011 data, and lists China as No. 1. There are also similar rankings from business media outlets. In December, Forbes ranked the United States 14th out of 145 nations in its "Best Countries for Business" list. The annual rating placed Hong Kong at No. 3 and Ireland at No. 1, based on "11 different metrics including property rights, innovation, taxes, technology, corruption, freedom (personal, trade and monetary), red tape, investor protection and stock market performance." Bloomberg rated the United States second, behind leader Hong Kong, in its own "Best Countries for Business 2013." That ranking, based on "six broad criteria that included the cost of starting a business, the cost of labor and materials and the cost of moving goods," placed China a distant 24th. Our ruling Obama said that "for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s No. 1 one place to invest; America is." He was referring to the 2013 A.T. Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, which surveys global business leaders to determine their investment attitudes toward nations across the world. The United States did top the list this year, for the first time since 2001, knocking China out of the top slot. The president is accurate by citing one particular study, and that study did ask business leaders what they thought about investing in the United States. A broader look at other rankings doesn’t make the United States seem like such a powerhouse, even if it does still best China in some lists. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-00615	"ISIS didn't exist when my brother was president. Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/may/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-isis-didnt-exist-when-my-brother-was/	After former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush faced a tough couple of weeks related to his comments about whether he would have invaded Iraq even if he had known about faulty intelligence, he used a new tactic in New Hampshire: Blame President Barack Obama. "The world is radically different, and so the focus ought to be on ‘knowing what you know now, Mr. President, would you, should you have kept 10,000 troops in Iraq?’ " Bush said at a roundtable event in Portsmouth May 20. Bush noted that the Iraqi city of Ramadi had been taken over by ISIS the day before his roundtable. He then continued: "ISIS didn’t exist when my brother was president. Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president. There were mistakes made in Iraq for sure, but the surge created a fragile but stable Iraq that the president could have built on....." He then criticized how Obama has handled Iraq. We decided to fact-check Bush’s claims that ISIS did not exist under President George W. Bush and that al-Qaida was wiped out in Iraq. (The Washington Post’s The Fact-Checker examined this issue as well.) ‘ISIS didn't exist when my brother was president’ A spokesman for Bush’s political action committee pointed to a 2014 op-ed by Ali Khedery, who served as senior adviser to three heads of US Central Command from 2003-10. It starts by saying, "Three years ago, the Islamic State (ISIS) did not exist; now it controls vast swaths of Syria and Iraq." Technically, yes, a group with the name "ISIS" did not exist under President Bush. The group’s roots, however, trace back to 2004. "There were evolutions that took place with some of the name changes," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. In 2004, long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established Al-Qa‘ida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After he was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2006, the group was renamed the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014, Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism expert at the New America Foundation, told PolitiFact Florida. "Al-Sham just refers to the Levant and reflects the group's increased focus on Syria," he said. "It reflects a geographic shift rather than change in political focus. It's the same group throughout." ‘Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president’ Al-Qaida’s power waxed and waned over the years, but was it "wiped out," as Jeb Bush said? The group’s targeting of Sunni civilians, which led to a backlash, combined with operations by Coalition forces and the Iraqi government, weakened the group in 2007. The Congressional Research Service wrote in August 2008 that U.S. officials concluded that al-Qaida in Iraq was "weakened almost to the point of outright defeat in Iraq, although they say it remains lethal and has the potential to revive in Iraq." The surge under Bush was successful -- the attacks al-Qaida was carrying out had significantly declined by January 2009 when Bush left office. "Literally everybody viewed this as a defeat for ISIS," Gartenstein-Ross said. "When I say everybody I mean al-Qaida included. They viewed this as a major defeat to its brand." A spokesman for Jeb Bush pointed to several articles that noted how the group was weakened, including a Washington Post article that stated that in 2009 "the power of the Islamist militancy in Iraq was at its lowest ebb, and the number of killings had plunged." In 2010, Vice President Joe Biden declared success in Iraq. When the combat mission ends, he said the administration "will be able to point to it and say, ‘We told you what we’re going to do, and we did it.’" But three factors led the group to a comeback: the Syrian war, the Iraqi government ruled in a sectarian way that alienated Sunnis, and the U.S. withdrew troops. Two experts we interviewed disagreed with each other on the extent that al-Qaida was "wiped out" under Bush. "There is no doubt that the surge hurt AQI/ISI deeply," Fishman told PolitiFact Florida. "The group was much weaker as a result. But it remained vibrant by the standards of any other AQ-linked jihadi group in the world." Derek Harvey, a retired U.S. Army colonel who provided counsel to the U.S. on Iraq during Bush’s presidency and is now a professor at the University of South Florida, told PolitiFact that he disagreed with Fishman’s statement about the strength of ISI. "The fact is that the few remnants of the organization found refuge in Syria, and it was there that they found the space and time to rebuild in 2009-11, and by summer 2012 they were strong enough to reemerge in Sunni Arab provinces in Iraq," he said. "Although there will always be remnants of terror groups, I say that Jeb Bush is accurate that AQI was wiped out." But al-Qaida did have a rebirth, Harvey said. "Both al-Qaida as a larger organization, and the Islamic State are far more powerful, diffused into more lands and among more distant peoples than at any time during the Bush years," Harvey said. In 2014, Obama was criticized for underestimating the Islamic State when he referred to it as a "JV" team in a January article in the New Yorker. In February 2014, the leadership of al-Qaida disowned the Islamic State of Iraq stating online that its former affiliate "is not a branch of the al-Qaida group (and al-Qaida) does not have an organizational relationship with it and is not the group responsible for their actions," Time wrote. We will turn to Michael O’Hanlon, an expert on defense policy at the Brookings Institute, to summarize a critique of both of Bush’s claims: "ISIL is a relatively new creation, but its roots are in al-Qaida in Iraq. Al-Qaida was significantly weakened by President Bush and company, but it was not wiped out. Moreover, the dynamics that the Iraq war set in motion contributed to the rise of ISIL, because Syria facilitated movement of many foreign fighters in and out of Iraq, and some of them resettled in Syria after the Iraq surge. "Also, al-Qaida in Iraq didn’t really exist before the 2003 invasion," O’Hanlon said. "So it’s too clean and neat for Gov. Bush to make the statement he did; there are kernels of truth in his claim but it misses a broader reality." Our ruling Bush said, "ISIS didn't exist when my brother was President. Al-Qaida in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was president." There are problems with both pieces of Bush’s claim. Yes, a group called ISIS didn’t exist while Bush was president, but the roots of the organization were indeed present and operating under a different banner. As far as claiming al-Qaida was "wiped out," most experts consider that a stretch. The group’s power certainly diminished under Bush but it wasn’t wiped out. Bush’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12787	"Eleven individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million credit" from Wisconsin's manufacturing and agriculture tax credit.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/17/gordon-hintz/11-people-get-22-million-wisconsins-gop-backed-man/	Wisconsin Democrats have been ripping a tax break they say unfairly benefits the rich. Their target: A manufacturing and agriculture tax credit put in place by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature. This was the criticism leveled Jan. 30, 2017 by state Rep. Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, on "Capital City Sunday," a public affairs show on WKOW-TV in Madison: "The credit disproportionately benefits people who are the wealthiest in our population: 75 percent of the credit goes to those who make over $1 million. In fact, 11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million (in) credit. " Similar attacks about 11 wealthy individuals were made in TV interviews earlier in the month by other Democratic state lawmakers, including Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca of Kenosha and by state Rep. Dianne Hesselbein of Middleton. Let’s check Hintz’s claim that "11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million" in credits from the program. A note before we dig in: Hintz’s statement could be read to mean 11 individuals who each make over $30 million each got a $22 million credit. But it’s clear from Hintz’s prior statements he meant 11 individuals who each make $30 million got a total of $22 million in credits. Previous attack The manufacturing and agriculture tax credit was inserted by Republican lawmakers into Walker’s first state budget, which was adopted in 2011. The credit didn’t take effect until 2013 and wasn’t fully phased in until 2016. It gradually reduced the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses to nearly nothing -- from 7.9 percent to 0.4 percent. The credit’s benefit to the rich became an issue in the 2014 congressional race between Democrat Mark Harris and Republican Glenn Grothman, which Grothman won. Harris claimed that as a state senator, Grothman pushed through the credit and that once it was phased in, "someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income" will pay "less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage." Our rating was Mostly True. We found that some factory owners who earn up to roughly $2.5 million from production income would owe less in state income tax on that income than a full-time worker who earns minimum wage. But is the tax so tilted that it overwhelmingly benefits 11 people? The evidence Hintz provided us a January 2017 memo he requested from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The memo reported on figures provided by the state Department of Revenue. According to the memo: Based on income tax returns filed for tax year 2015, it’s estimated that in tax year 2017, a total of 10,613 claimants will take manufacturing and agriculture credits worth $227 million. (A claimant can be an individual or a married couple.) Included are 11 claimants who each have an income of $30 million or more. Their total credit is estimated at $22.2 million. (The 11 aren't identified.) Casey Langan, a spokesman for the Department of Revenue, confirmed the accuracy of the figures in Hintz’s claim. But he pointed out they are estimates and added: "Large incomes would reflect large amounts of production activities and therefore attract a sizable credit. These claimants are business owners who are stimulating Wisconsin's economy." A vice president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce has praised the credit, saying it allows manufacturers "to compete effectively by essentially allowing them to operate tax free in Wisconsin." In contrast, the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project says the estimated $299 million in lost income tax revenue in fiscal 2017 from the credit is "giving a higher priority to giving tax cuts for the best-off" rather than making investments in schools and universities. The tax credit earned Walker a Promise Kept on our Walk-O-Meter for his campaign pledge to cut manufacturing taxes. It also helped him get a Promise Kept on a pledge to review all tax policy to lighten burden on farmers and Promise Kept on a promise to reduce taxes on employers. Our rating Hintz said "11 individuals who make over $30 million each got $22 million (in) credit" from Wisconsin's manufacturing and agriculture tax credit. The figures are essentially solid, coming from the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau estimates that 11 claimants (individuals or married couples) who each earn over $30 million will share a total of $22 million in credits. But those are estimates, for 2017, not credits actually received. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-10029	"In just one month, the Democrats have spent more than President Bush spent in seven years on the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina combined."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/03/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-v-math-math-wins/	Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says it took only one month for the Democrats to exceed three of President Bush's big-ticket items in spending. It was red meat for the crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, where the Kentucky Republican spoke on Feb. 27. But cut into it and it starts to look overcooked. McConnell recalled that Democrats had relentlessly criticized Bush's spending. "But now the shoe is on the other foot. And what have we seen?" he said. "Well, in just one month — just one month, the Democrats have spent more than President Bush spent in seven years on the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina combined — in one month." This is quickly becoming a Republican talking point. Rep. John Boehner, the House Minority Leader, used the same line in a statement on March. 4. Asked to back up the claim, McConnell spokesman Josh Holmes pinned the Democrats' spending in one month at $818 billion. That's the $31 billion expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program passed in January plus the $787 billion stimulus bill passed in February. That $818 billion exceeds the $655 billion the Defense Department spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2008, plus the $132 billion the government spent responding to Hurricane Katrina, Holmes said. He cited this Government Accountability Office report as the source of the war-spending figure, and the Congressional Research Service for the Katrina figure. We'll grant that Katrina cost about $132 billion and the SCHIP bill will spend $31 billion (that spending is paid for, mostly with an increase in cigarette taxes). But we take issue with McConnell's calculations of Democratic spending and Bush's war spending. First, about $326 billion of the $787 billion cost of the stimulus is from tax cuts, according to this report by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. That is not generally considered "spending" — certainly not by McConnell's audience at CPAC. And even if it were, it was unfair to say the Democrats "spent" the entire $787 billion in one month; the spending will take place over the next seven years, with the bulk of it coming not the month it was passed, or even this year, but in 2010. If McConnell believes that to schedule spending is effectively to spend, then he'll have to take another look at his war figures. The very report that his spokesman used to justify a war-spending estimate of $655 billion through 2008 said, "As of September 2008, Congress has appropriated a total of about $808 billion" for the global war on terror. The difference is made up of future obligations to which Bush committed, and McConnell did not count those. And even $808 billion does not include all the necessary war spending for fiscal year 2009, which began October 2008. Traditionally all 2009 spending would be included in the budget President Bush drafted in February 2008, but Bush chose to fund the war through emergency supplemental appropriations instead. He did not ask Congress for a 2009 supplemental appropriation before he left office, choosing instead to leave that to the next president. (President Obama asked for another $76 billion for the wars for fiscal 2009.) And the wars will continue beyond 2009. If McConnell is saying the Democrats spent the entire cost of the stimulus in one month, doesn't he have to hold Bush responsible for at least some of the longer term costs of the war? "If you look at the total cost of the stimulus bill it seems to me you also need to look at what the costs of Iraq and Afghanistan will be for the next few years," said Charles Konigsberg, chief budget counsel for the Concord Coalition. Some experts have said that once costs like veterans' benefits are factored in, the war in Iraq will cost several trillion dollars . In any event, the lowest estimate of Bush's war spending through 2008 that is even remotely defensible is $808 billion. Tack that onto the $132 billion cost of Katrina and you get $940 billion for the wars and Katrina. That's well over the expenditures expected from the Democrats' stimulus and children's health insurance bills, which total $686 billion once tax cuts are subtracted. Even if we included the cost of the tax cuts (for a total of $818 billion), he would still be wrong because that's less than the $940 billion that uses a more accurate cost of the war spending. And even that analysis, remember, is generous to McConnell since it includes several years of spending from the stimulus and SCHIP bills, not "one month." McConnell's claim stands up only if you treat tax cuts as spending, accept an incomplete estimate of the wars' costs and group several years of planned spending into a one-month spending spree by the Democrats — but not for Bush. That is, it doesn't stand up at all. We find this claim False.

pomt-13010	"There's been no conclusive or specific report to say" Russia was trying to muddy the election.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/11/reince-priebus/priebus-falsely-claims-no-conclusive-report-whethe/	Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee and President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming chief of staff, tried in an interview on Meet the Press to dismiss news reports that the CIA believes Russia aimed to boost Trump’s election chances. Priebus questioned the credibility of the reports, first published on Dec. 9, 2016, because they relied on unnamed sources and because he says they wrongly claimed that the RNC’s computer system also was hacked. He also tried to cast doubt on the generally accepted idea that it was was the Russians who were behind the hacking. "Let's clear this up. Do you believe -- does the president-elect believe that Russia was trying to muddy up and get involved in the election in 2016?" Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked on Dec. 11, 2016. "No. 1, you don't know it. I don't know it," Priebus said. "There's been no conclusive or specific report to say otherwise." That’s wrong. There is a specific report. It was made public on Oct. 7, 2016, in the form of a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. At the time, the website WikiLeaks was releasing a steady flow of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and top Hillary Clinton adviser John Podesta. "The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations," the statement said. "These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process." Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who focuses on Russia, called that letter, "a pretty strong statement." Herrera said Priebus’ comment represents a "disturbing" denial of facts. "There has been a specific report, and politicians who wish to comment on the issue should read and comment on that report rather than suggest there is no such report or that no work has been done on the topic," Herrera said. Neither Priebus’ office nor the Trump transition team replied to a request for comment. In the Meet the Press interview, Priebus attacked the most recent news reports that the Russian government was interfering with the election to benefit Trump. In particular, Priebus objected to reporting from the New York Times claiming that the CIA believes Russia hacked into the Republican National Committee’s computer system but chose not to release any of that material. However, to bolster that point, he blew past the October findings, not once but twice in the course of the interview. Much does remain uncertain. We happened to catch Herrera while she was meeting with another analyst of Russian politics, University of Chicago economist Konstantin Sonin. The two of them painted a more tangled picture of how the Russians might have been involved. "There are lots of quasi-institutional channels of people who are doing work in one way or another for the government who then do other things, informally, without being asked explicitly," they said. They think it’s unlikely that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the hacking. But at this point, that’s just one theory. Our ruling Priebus said that "there's been no conclusive or specific report to say" Russia was trying to muddy the election. In fact, in early October, the director of national intelligence, representing 17 intelligence agencies, and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security said they were confident that the Russian government had directed the email hacks of the Democratic National Committee and a top Clinton adviser. And that the intent was to "interfere with the U.S. election process." That’s unambiguous language, and Priebus denied its existence twice during his NBC interview. The claim flies in the face of plain words from two of the highest ranking intelligence and security officials. We rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ce3de03a-ebff-45d7-8238-c2a5e77d234a	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2016-12-11T16:36:57	2016-12-11	['Russia']
pomt-12014	"Private insurance companies in this country spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs. The cost of administering the Medicare program, a very popular program that works well for our seniors, is 2 percent. We can save approximately $500 billion a year just in administration costs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/20/bernie-sanders/comparing-administrative-costs-private-insurance-a/	Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said that switching to a single-payer "Medicare for all" health system would save billions of dollars in administrative costs. "Private insurance companies in this country spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs," Sanders said on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sept. 17. "The cost of administering the Medicare program, a very popular program that works well for our seniors, is 2 percent. We can save approximately $500 billion a year just in administration costs." Administrative costs are the expenses incurred by medical insurers that are not strictly medical, such as marketing, customer service, billing, claims review, quality assurance, information technology and profits. Is the gap between private and public health insurance providers’ administrative costs really that high? Most experts agreed the numbers looked about right. But because of key differences between Medicare and private insurance, the trade-off isn’t as simple as Sanders suggests. First, we’ll break down the numbers. To measure the administrative costs for Medicare, we turned to the 2017 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds -- the document prepared by Medicare’s fiscal overseers. The trustees’ summary listed total Medicare expenditures of $678.7 billion for 2016, of which $9.2 billion was characterized as "administrative expenses." That works out to 1.4 percent, which is even lower than what Sanders stated. That covers salaries and expenses, patient outreach, and fraud and abuse control by the Health and Human Services, Justice Department and FBI, among other things. But because much of Medicare piggybacks off Social Security, other administrative costs such as enrollment, payment and keeping track of patients are left to the Social Security system. That’s one of multiple reasons using the current administrative costs for Medicare wouldn’t translate as cleanly if the entire population were to be covered. (Medicare serves those over age 65 currently; Sanders would like to see all Americans covered by a similar program.) Experts told us we could safely assume private insurance costs, on the other hand, are much higher, though actual spending estimates vary. Average insurers’ overhead costs are about 12.4 percent, according to an April 2017 Annals of Internal Medicine article by Steffie Woolhandler and David U. Himmelstein. A February report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research totaled overhead costs for private individual and employer based plans at 12.3 percent in 2015. And America’s Health Insurance Plans found that 17.8 cents of every premium dollar goes to operating costs. But those are averages looking across health care markets. When the Congressional Budget Office broke those costs down, they put administrative costs in the nongroup market at 20 percent, small-group market at 16 percent and the large-group market at 11 percent. Federal caps on administrative costs reflect this range. Group market insurers have a 15 percent cap and individual market insurers have a 20 percent cap. If exceeded, insurers have to pay a rebate to policyholders under the Affordable Care Act. The difference is still pretty substantial, though. Historically, administrative expenses were much higher in the commercial market because insurers did a lot of underwriting, or using the health status of individuals or groups to determine their premiums. The Affordable Care Act was designed to curb that spending. On top of that, experts explained that unlike Medicare, private insurers take on more responsibility than simply paying claims or occasionally going after fraud. Before a claim is even filed, they check its appropriateness, assess whether it is medically necessary, and whether it can be done in a cheaper way (outpatient versus inpatient care, for example). "Medicare has been trying in fits and starts to look a little more closely at how it pays claims but generally speaking, it is passive in processing claims," Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. In addition, private insurers create provider networks, which is where they determine which doctors will offer which services under each plan and negotiate reimbursement rates. They also review which drugs will be most effective and affordable. "Not all carriers are doing this effectively, well or thoughtfully, but when they do, it lowers the overall system costs," Corlette said. But a lot of administrative costs go to marketing, because private health insurers have to compete for clients. That’s something Medicare doesn’t have to deal with, and which wouldn’t be a problem with a similar universal health plan. That also explains why there’s more leeway in the individual market costs, as it’s more expensive to target a new individual customer than groups. Would the U.S. really save $500 billion with a single-payer system? Sanders cited Woolhandler and Himmelstein’s article estimating $504 billion in savings from converting to a single-payer system. But the article’s authors admitted that "any such estimate is imprecise" and cited other research placing the number closer to $383 billion. Experts say a single-payer system would save a substantial amount of administrative costs, but the right kind of administrative expenses may actually lead to cost savings and improved outcomes. Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, said using administrative costs as a share of spending, rarely done in other industries, isn’t a very useful measure of efficiency. Glied pointed out that private Medicare Advantage plans are "pretty competitive with traditional Medicare," but also tend to operate at higher administrative costs. "They bring costs down in other ways but they have to use administrative spending to do that," Glied said. Robert Book, a health economist at the right-leaning American Action Forum, also argued that expressing administrative costs as a percentage of overall spending on health care is misleading in the case of Medicare, as the overall health care costs will be inherently larger when dealing with the disabled and over-65 population, artificially deflating the amount spent on administering that care. Our ruling Sanders said, "Private insurance companies in this country spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs. The cost of administering the Medicare program, a very popular program that works well for our seniors, is 2 percent. We can save approximately $500 billion a year just in administration costs." Government and independent researchers corroborate the percentage figures Sanders cited, but the researchers who came up with the $500 billion savings admitted that "any such estimate is imprecise." Also, the administrative costs of private insurance and Medicare cover different types of costs. Experts told us that a single-payer system for the United States would have lower administrative costs than today’s private insurance, but it likely wouldn’t be able to achieve administrative costs as low as the existing Medicare program. Finally, the figures are misleading because lowering administrative costs wouldn’t necessarily lower overall costs. In fact, administrative costs sometimes help make the delivery of health care more efficient. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-11405	"In one day of fundraising I received more small donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/mar/22/cynthia-nixon/cynthia-nixon-claims-she-had-more-small-donors-one/	Cynthia Nixon says she received more donations from small donors on the first day of her campaign than Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has in seven years. "In one day of fundraising I received more small donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years,’’ Nixon said in an exclusive interview with The Buffalo News. Cuomo has a financial advantage over Nixon going into his third election for governor. He has a campaign war chest of more than $30 million. Nixon is starting from scratch, and she says she will not accept campaign money from corporate political action committees as Cuomo has. Her campaign said she received 2,214 campaign contributions of under $200 in her first 24 hours as a candidate for governor. Cuomo, the campaign said, has received only 1,369 such donations since he took office in 2011. Nixon points to filings at the state Board of Elections to support her claim. We wanted to know if she was right. Since 2011 Nixon’s claim includes an important caveat: She counts only donations given to Cuomo after he first took office in 2011. She does not count donations Cuomo received when he first ran for governor in 2010. If you limit the analysis to her time frame, Nixon is right. Cuomo has received 1,369 donations under $200 since Jan. 1, 2011, according to a query of the Board of Elections database. That count includes only donations through the middle of January 2018, the latest campaign filing available. We don’t know how many donations Cuomo has received since then. It’s possible he has collected 845 small donations that would make Nixon’s claim wrong. But filings show Cuomo has taken only 644 contributions of under $200 since his last inauguration in 2015. Before 2011 Nixon would be wrong if she included donations from Cuomo’s 2010 campaign for governor. Since the start of his first campaign for governor in May 2010, Cuomo has collected 2,898 campaign contributions of under $200, according to campaign finance filings. Cuomo received 1,529 such donations before 2011, filings show. That’s fewer than Nixon received on her campaign’s first day. Our ruling "In one day of fundraising I received more small-donor (contributions) than Andrew Cuomo received in seven years," Nixon said. She’s right. If you include the small-donor contributions he took during his first run for governor, Cuomo’s small-donor contributions have (so far) outpaced Nixon’s. But that's not what she said. So we rate her claim True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Cynthia Nixon	None	None	None	2018-03-22T17:11:29	2018-03-22	['None']
pomt-01703	Del. Ben Chafin "took money away" from Southwest Virginia schools while voting to build a "politician's palace."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/11/mike-hymes/hymes-says-del-ben-chafin-took-money-sw-schools-wh/	In a special state Senate election, Democrat Mike Hymes accuses Republican Del. Ben Chafin of cutting education spending while giving legislators a luxurious office building in Richmond. The Aug. 19 contest between Chafin and Hymes, a Tazewell County supervisor who is also a human resources corporate director for a coal company, will fill the seat of former Sen. Phillip P. Puckett, D-Russell. It will decide control of the chamber. Hymes recently released a television ad that accuses Chafin of putting his own needs before students. Here’s what the ad’s narrator says: "Wonder why Southwest Virginia doesn’t get its fair share from Richmond? Here’s one reason – Del. Ben Chafin, a millionaire lawyer, took money away from public schools here while wasting it over there. Ben Chafin voted to tear down this legislative office building and build a nearly half-billion dollar politician’s palace in its place, putting his luxury before our kids’ education." We looked into Hymes’ claim that Chafin stripped money from his region’s schools while voting for fancy new digs for the General Assembly. Education money We defined Southwest Virginia based on a map from Radford University. The region stretches from Lee County in the corner of the state to Roanoke County. The region includes 19 counties and six cities. Chafin has served only this year in the House of Delegates. The fiscal year 2014, which covers the 2013-14 school year, just ended June 30, so we compared the numbers for this year and the recently approved budget that covers the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years. Here’s the state aid to Southwest Virginia by school year: 2013-14, $606 million 2014-15, $620 million 2015-16, $638 million Meanwhile, public school enrollment is expected to continue to decline, so school divisions will actually receive more aid per student. The Education Department will adjust during the school year based on actual attendance. Here’s the state aid per student for Southwest Virginia: 2013-14, $5,713 2014-15, $5,887 2015-16, $6,133 So, what did the Hymes camp use to explain its claim? Campaign manager Peter Clerkin sent us a link to the Virginia Education Association’s budget wrap that compared spending in each division between the proposed budget from then-Gov. Bob McDonnell to what was actually enacted. The amount ultimately adopted for Tazewell schools, for example, was a bit lower than what was originally proposed, so the Hymes campaign considers that a cut. But it’s not a cut in spending -- the approved level of funding increases in the next couple of years. Tazewell schools received $35.8 million in the 2013-2014 budget year to $37.2 million in 2014-2015 and $36.8 million in 2015-2016. In Russell County, approved spending of $28 million this year is expected to fall to $26.8 million by 2015-2016. Amid falling enrollments, both Tazewell and Russell will see an increase in the amount of state aid spent per pupil, which is a more fair way of tracking education spending. When looking at all Southwest Virginia districts -- not just the two counties Hymes cited -- the amount of state aid rises under the adopted budget. Funding for a year-old compensation grant program was eliminated. We would agree that was a true cut, to the tune of $7.5 million. But only two divisions in Southwest Virginia -- Roanoke City and Salem -- received money through this program. Hymes also cites the budget’s change in funding for the K-3 class size reduction program, but the overall amount for that initiative is still projected to rise under the adopted budget. He also notes the budget eliminated a plan to loan money from the literary fund for school construction, but that hasn’t been done since 2008, so it's hard to say that amounts to a cut. Before we examine Hymes’ legislative office building claim, a key thing to keep in mind is the general fund and lottery sources of money that pay for education programs are not what would have been used for a new General Assembly building. "Politicians’ Palace" Readers of the Richmond Times-Dispatch are well acquainted with the legislators’ office and meeting building, which has been the subject of many articles on its decrepitude. Its issues include asbestos, fire and safety code violations and a crumbling facade. The proposed project to tear it down and build a new office building also includes renovation to Old City Hall and construction of a parking garage, funded by a $300 million bond sale. This project was never considered in a stand-alone vote, but was instead considered as part of the caboose budget bill, which makes final adjustments for the current fiscal year. Chafin voted for that caboose budget bill. It’s not for us to say whether the project is a waste. But the measure was a minute piece of a much larger -- $89 billion -- two-year spending plan. And McAuliffe ordered all work on a $300 million replacement stopped, perhaps in retaliation for the loss of Medicaid expansion in the budget. In a final piece of irony, the Virginia Education Association named Chafin a "legislative champion" -- a recognition that would be unlikely if Chafin had indeed conspired to take money away from schools. He introduced a budget amendment to authorize paying the state’s share of a 6 percent salary increase for public school employees. This was an VEA legislative wish list, but was unfulfilled. Our ruling Hymes suggests there’s a tie between education spending and a new office building for legislators. School aid comes from the general fund, which is supported by sales and income taxes, while the construction project would have been a separate expense covered by borrowing money through bonds. They come from two distinct parts of the budget and a bond sale would not have hurt the amount of general fund money available for schools. That misplaced comparison is compounded by an inaccurate statement regarding funding for Southwest Virginia schools. Chafin did not take money away from schools. Overall, schools in Southwest Virginia will see an increase both in total state aid and state aid per pupil under the recently approved budget. We rate the claim False. CORRECTION: An earlier version was incorrect on teacher pay for the coming school year. Teachers will not receive a pay increase.

pomt-07503	"Over the past decade, the big five oil companies --- BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell -- made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/11/jim-moran/rep-jim-moran-says-top-five-oil-us-companies-raked/	Amid the partisan showdown on Capitol Hill over how to slice the deficit, Democrats want to get rid of some tax breaks for oil companies. U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, a Northern Virginia Democrat, used an eye-catching statistic to justify doing just that. "Over the past decade, the big five oil companies -- BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell -- made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion," Moran said in a Feb. 10 news release. No doubt, oil companies have made big profits. But we wondered if the decade-long profit tally really did approach $1 trillion. Anne Hughes, Moran’s spokeswoman, said the figure came from a report earlier this year by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. The report says the five oil companies made $951 billion, not adjusting for inflation, from 2001 through 2010. Daniel Weiss, the author of the report, said he got the profit data from Google Finance and from the companies themselves. But Weiss acknowledged he made a mistake while adding up the annual profit tallies. Weiss sent us updated figures for the 10-year period. Those numbers, which were adjusted for inflation to reflect 2011 dollars, showed the five companies had a total profit of $901.6 billion for the 10-year-period. We dug around ourselves to see if Weiss’ latest figure was correct, examining profit figures each of the companies listed in their annual reports from 2001 through 2010. We found that British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhilips had a total decade-long profit of roughly $801.7 billion in raw dollars. The total profit for the five companies peaked at $123.4 billion in 2007. Last year it was $77.5 billion. When we adjusted our annual figures for inflation, the five companies’ 10-year total profit was about $884.3 billion. That’s close to the Weiss’ updated number. Still, both his figure and ours are about $100 billion away from $1 trillion. So it’s a stretch to say that the 10-year profit was "nearly $1 trillion." Adam Sieminski, chief energy industry economist at Deutsche Bank, didn’t see much use in putting too much stock in an overall profit number for those oil giants. The profits should be expected to be large because the of the size of the companies, he said. "These are big companies," Sieminksi said. "You would think the real question would be how does it compare to other industries, what are the profit margins in the oil industry relative to profit margins in health care and banking and construction and so on, and the answer is they’re not that much different." We compared the profit margins of oil companies to those of three major Virginia companies: Dominion Virginia Power, Altria and Norfolk Southern. Between 2007 and 2009, profit margins at ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell ranged from a high of 10.0 percent to a low of 4.4 percent. Dominion, a regulated utility company, had an 11.5 percent profit margin in 2008 and an 8.7 percent margin in 2009. Norfolk Southern, one of the nation’s largest railroads, had a profit margin between 13 percent and 16.1 percent each of the three years. Altria, the nation’s largest tobacco company had a profit margin of 52.4 percent in 2007. It’s margin was 25.5 percent in 2008 and 13.6 percent in 2009. So these three companies, each in different industries, consistently out-performed the major oil companies. But because the oil giants all had much higher revenues -- between $285 billion and $470 billion compared to revenues around $10 billion for Norfolk Southern, $15 billion for Dominion and $20 billion for Altria -- the oil profits seem look more grandiose. Let’s review: Moran said BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell took in nearly $1 trillion in profit over the past decade. That statement was based on a report from the Center for American Progress, which initially said profits totaled $951 billion, but then corrected its figure to $901.6 billion. Our math put the inflation-adjusted profits at $884.3 billion. That’s still more than $100 billion away from the $1 trillion figure Moran cited. So to say that the total profits was nearly $1 trillion is a stretch. The overall tally is still sizable though, so we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-06467	Says Romney wrote in the first edition of his book that his health care plan should be expanded nationwide and then, "You took it out of your book."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-has-it-wrong-mitt-romneys-book/	Even though it’s printed in black and white, Mitt Romney keeps getting challenged on just what he said in his book. In a Republican presidential debate on Oct. 11, 2011, Texas Gov. Rick Perry attacked Romney saying that in his book No Apology, Romney called the Massachusetts health care reform he enacted a model for the nation and said that he deleted the passage from the paperback version. During an Oct. 18 debate in Las Vegas, it was Rick Santorum on the attack. "It was in your book that it should be for everybody," the former Pennsylvania senator told Romney. "You took it out of your book," he added. Thus ensued a feisty back-and-forth between Santorum and Romney, who has repeatedly denied the charge, insisting he has never asserted that Massachusetts’ program should be taken to a nationwide level. PolitiFact has checked this charge before. Perry’s accusation arose from the difference between the first, hardcover edition of Romney’s book and the later paperback version. "As a matter of fact, between books, your hard copy book, you said it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them as you had in Massachusetts. Then in your paperback, you took that line out." Here’s the text of each edition: HARDCOVER: "We can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country, and it can be done without letting government take over health care." To: PAPERBACK: "And it was done without government taking over health care." So why the change? The health care debate took a dramatic turn between the publication of the two editions of No Apology. His hardcover was written when the national health care policy supported by President Barack Obama included a public insurance option. So Romney's Massachusetts plan, by comparison, kept "private insurance and personal choice intact," he wrote. Then the Democratic plan passed without the public option, and it very closely resembled Romney's plan. Both left in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They both aimed to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering tax breaks to help moderate income people buy insurance. And both included a requirement to buy insurance or else face a penalty, a provision called the individual mandate. Suddenly, the line in the hardcover edition to "accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country" as Republican Romney had done for Massachusetts was uncomfortably close to what the Democratic president had done nationally. Hence the change to the more declarative, "it was done without government taking over health care." So Perry was right that the words in Romney's book and even the meaning changed somewhat between editions. But he mischaracterized Romney’s words. When PoliltiFact looked at the section of the hardback from which the quote came, we found that Romney was not really saying "it was exactly what the American people needed, to have that Romneycare given to them." He was in fact presenting a defense of state-level choice — not a pitch for a mandatory national approach. We rated Perry's comment Mostly False. Now Santorum has said, "It was in your book that it should be for everybody," and added that Romney took the assertion out in a later edition. That’s an exaggeration. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2011-10-18T23:15:33	2011-10-18	['None']
pomt-06346	The EPA "wants to hire 230,000 new government regulators that will cost the taxpayer $21 billion."	false	/florida/statements/2011/nov/07/allen-west/allen-west-says-epa-wants-hire-230000-workers-cost/	The Environmental Protection Agency has been the source of a series of eye-popping but false claims including that the federal agency intends to regulate dust, that it treats spilled milk the same as oil spills and that it plans to implement what has been dubbed a "cow tax." Here's the latest charge against the EPA: the agency wants to go on the mother of all hiring sprees. U.S. Rep. Allen West, a Republican in South Florida, made the charge in a TV interview on Oct. 21, 2011. "The objective of this administration, truly the objective of the liberal progressives, is to get more people wedded to government either by subsistence check or employment check," West said. "When you hear an EPA that wants to hire 230,000 new government regulators that will cost the taxpayer $21 billion, when you have (U.S. Sen.) Harry Reid coming out and saying that we need to hire more people in the public sector over the private sector that's not how we are going to restore our economy. But that's how they would create a victim class, an entitlement class, a new welfare state that will be totally dependent upon them that will change national level elections hence and forever more." That's quite a want-ad for the EPA, which currently has about 18,000 employees and an annual budget of $8.7 billion. Does it really want to hire 230,000 new employees at a cost of $21 billion? Supreme Court ruled greenhouse gas is a pollutant The claim that the EPA wants to hire 230,000 new employees to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has been hotly debated among bloggers and media outlets. The story begins back in 2007, when the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gas emissions from cars are a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and ordered the EPA to determine whether they endanger human health. In 2009, the EPA determined that greenhouse gas emissions do endanger human health. Under the Clean Air Act approved by Congress in 1970, if the EPA regulates a pollutant under one section of the Clean Air Act -- in this case, auto emissions -- it must regulate that pollutant under the permitting sections of the Clean Air Act. This meant that the EPA would have had to regulate greenhouse gasses from all sources that emit them above the level set in statute: 100 or 250 tons per year. (The threshold is different depending on which Clean Air Act permitting program is involved.) That would mean that millions of small sources not previously regulated under the Clean Air Act permitting programs -- such as restaurants, commercial bakeries and apartment buildings -- would also have to apply for permits from the EPA. Since that would be a massive undertaking, the EPA sought to phase in implementation. In January 2011, the EPA started with the largest businesses such as large power plants and oil refineries. That hasn't required more staff because the applicants are going through the same permitting process they have in the past -- with questions about an additional pollutant, greenhouse gases, tacked on. Businesses that face additional EPA regulation have challenged the agency in court. The Coalition for Responsible Regulation is a plaintiff in the case -- the Los Angeles Times reported that the coalition's officers are the same as Quintana Minerals Resources, a large owner of coal reserves. Media frenzy The Daily Caller, a right-leaning news website, published a Sept. 26 article that pulled quotes from the government's Sept. 16 court brief in the case. The headline of the article was "EPA: regulations would require 230,000 new employees, $21 billion". The article stated: "The Environmental Protection Agency has said new greenhouse gas regulations, as proposed, may be 'absurd' in application and 'impossible to administer' by its self-imposed 2016 deadline. But the agency is still asking for taxpayers to shoulder the burden of up to 230,000 new bureaucrats — at a cost of $21 billion — to attempt to implement the rules." The article quoted part of the court brief which stated: "Hiring the 230,000 full-time employees necessary to produce the 1.4 billion work hours required to address the actual increase in permitting functions would result in an increase in Title V administration costs of $21 billion per year." By the next day, Media Matters for America, a liberal group, disputed The Daily Caller's report and so did POLITICO, which quoted EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan who said that The Daily Caller's report was "comically wrong." Government argues that full implementation would overwhelm system We read portions of the court brief in which the federal government argues that the thresholds Congress established -- 100 or 250 tons per year -- "pose significant implementation difficulties when applied to greenhouse gases...." and "would result in coverage of millions of additional sources, thereby presenting overwhelming regulatory burdens." These "burdens would inundate" the EPA and state permitting authorities resulting in billions of dollars in costs and years of delays for obtaining permits, the U.S. Department of Justice and EPA brief states. The government even calls this "unmanageable burdens," which is why the EPA is using what they call a "tailoring" rule to phase in regulation. The government calculated how many employees it would need -- and at what cost -- if it was required to implement monitoring greenhouse gas emissions without tailoring. "Hiring the 230,000 full-time employees necessary to produce the 1.4 billion work hours required to address the actual increase in permitting functions would result in an increase in Title V administration costs of $21 billion per year." Although The Daily Caller ended its quote here, the court brief continues with a key point: "Based on this analysis, EPA found that applying the literal statutory thresholds (100/250 tpy) on January 2, 2011, would "overwhelm the resources of permitting authorities and severely impair the functioning of the programs...." So the 230,000 employees figure, and the $21 billion cost, is something that the federal government calculated for the purposes of illustrating that it doesn't want to hire that many people or pay that much and instead wants to phase in implementation. That covers the current state of hiring, but what about in the future as the EPA expands its implementation? The EPA states, starting on page 30 of the court brief, that by July 2012 the EPA will address various options to streamline the process. "Thus, the Tailoring Rule is calculated to move toward eventual full compliance with the statutory threshold, unless, notwithstanding EPA’s significant efforts at further reducing the administrative burdens through streamlining and other actions, impossibility of full administrative implementation persists at that time," states the court brief on page 31. We turned to Lisa Heinzerling, now a Georgetown Law professor who was involved in this issue when she worked in high-level positions at the EPA in 2009 and 2010, for an explanation of what the EPA is saying about its intentions by 2016. "The agency recognizes that under the law as currently framed it has a legal obligation at some point to reach those thresholds so it needs be showing progress toward that goal," she said. "'Moving toward' them is different than one day saying 'alright everyone is in and we need 200 and some thousand employees.' The agency is not saying that at all. The agency is saying it recognizes the need to move toward thresholds and also recognizes even with streamlining measures it will come up with in the next five years burdens may still be greater than the agency may be able to tolerably bear, then we will have to see." Kevin Bundy, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, currently one of the interveners on the government's side said: "What EPA is saying -- in the context of the rule the agency is actually defending -- is that they'll continue to explore ways of 'moving toward' the statutory thresholds, while acknowledging that implementing the program at those thresholds may still be impossible. The rule envisions 'moving toward' the statutory thresholds by streamlining the permit process and by considering permanent exemptions for various categories of sources. 'Moving toward' does not mean 'achieving.' What Rep. West is supposedly afraid of -- EPA hiring 200,000+ additional regulators and so forth -- is exactly what the Tailoring Rule was designed to avoid." Bundy points to the EPA's 2010 greenhouse gas tailoring document which states that the EPA plans to propose ways to streamline implementation in future phases including permanently excluding certain small sources. University of Miami law professor Charlton Copeland, who teaches administrative law, read the tailoring section of the court brief at PolitiFact's request. He said the government cites the hiring numbers to articulate why it wants to depart from a literal reading of the provision. "I don't read that and get the sense what the EPA is gearing up for is a public works program on its own...," Copeland said. "They keep saying it's 'absurd' or 'impossible.' When I see 'absurd' or 'impossible' they are referencing both to the amount of personnel it would take and the kind of slow down it would impose on the permitting process." Gilfillan, the EPA spokesman, said that the EPA won't be hiring 230,000 extra workers now or in 2016 even if the court rules that the EPA can't tailor. The 230,000 workers referenced in the court brief would be a combination of state and federal employees since the EPA handles permitting for some states while it delegates it in others. Any such massive expansion of the EPA would require Congress to provide the extra money to the EPA -- a highly unlikely scenario. And the "EPA has no authority to control hiring decisions in state agencies," said Robert Glicksman, an environmental law professor at George Washington University Law School, in an e-mail. West responds and our ruling We asked West's office for an explanation. West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano sent us a link to a conservative blog that posted a Sept. 23 article from the Institute for Energy Research entitled "EPA's absurd defense of its greenhouse gas actions," which includes some of the same points raised later by The Daily Caller. Sachitano also sent us a quote from West: "I am pleased the Environmental Protection Agency has recognized the absurdity of using the Clean Air Act, which was never the intention of Congress, to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide. I'm also pleased that the EPA filed on September 16th a brief with the court that will temporary not require them to hire 230,000 full time employees at a cost to the American Taxpayer of $21 billion." But on TV West said: "When you hear an EPA wants to hire 230,000 new government regulators that will cost the taxpayer $21 billion..." and cited that as an example of getting more people wedded to the government by employment check. West is suggesting that the federal government is bloated and will bloat even more since the EPA "wants" to hire 230,000 new employees at a cost of $21 billion. But the EPA made it clear in its brief that it doesn't want to hire all those folks. It's unclear how the EPA and the states would handle implementation if the courts rule that the EPA can't tailor. But it is clear that the EPA, and the states, wouldn't have the budgets to hire 230,000 more people. We rate this claim False.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2011-11-07T17:54:25	2011-10-21	['None']

pomt-07537	The federal government has "77 different means-tested social welfare programs."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/05/jim-jordan/rep-jim-jordan-presses-reform-numerous-welfare-pro/	Rep. Jim Jordan chairs an influential group, the Republican Study Committee, at an opportune time. The group’s political beliefs generally intersect with those of the Tea Party, and they include a desire to stop wasteful government spending. Among the targets: redundant social welfare programs. You might know these as food stamps and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, but Jordan, of Urbana, Ohio, says there are a whole lot more than that. Jordan counts 77 federal means-tested social welfare programs, citing that number during an interview on the FOX Business Network and in backup materials to support one of his bills. "There are seven -- this is according to Heritage Foundation, we get a list of these -- 77 different means tested social welfare programs -- 77 different ones," Jordan said during a March 22 appearance on Fox. A week earlier he had introduced his Welfare Reform Act of 2011, which would require a full accounting of each social welfare program. It also would require food stamp recipients to work or prepare for a job, much as welfare reform under President Bill Clinton required of cash aid recipients. And it would require federal welfare spending to return to pre-recession levels, with allowance for inflation growth, once the unemployment rate fell to 6.5 percent. The sheer number that Jordan cited -- 77 separate welfare programs -- sounded extraordinary, so PolitiFact Ohio took a look. Jordan’s office had a list with all 77 programs. Space limits our ability to include all here, and Jordan’s list is not online. You can find them in Jordan’s bill, or watch as they scoll across the screen on this Republican Study Committee video. They include Medicaid, food stamps, Section 8 housing assistance; weatherization help for home owners and Pell grants to help students afford college. Jordan’s list also includes low-income home energy assistance, school breakfast for children from low-income families, the Job Corps training program for at-risk teens and young adults, and Head Start for pre-kindergartners. Most of the programs are geared toward people who fall below a certain income level. But Jordan’s list also included at least a dozen programs that don’t give federal money or services directly to the poor. Some examples: the Appalachian Regional Commission; urban development block grants; Title 1 education grants that help schools in low-income areas; empowerment zones, which typically benefit businesses as well as communities, and Americorps, which sends college graduates into low-income neighborhoods for social service work. Is this really welfare spending? Jordan’s office says yes. His bill defines "means-tested welfare spending" as "any federal program that is designed to specifically provide assistance or benefits exclusively to low-income Americans." Each of the 77 programs he cites were designed with that in mind. His bill also states that "community and economic development programs targeted to low-income communities or populations shall be considered means-tested welfare programs" for purposes of the legislation. We asked Mimi Abromovitz, an authority on welfare reform at City University of New York’s Hunter College of Social Work. In an e-mail, she said, "To me, ‘means test’ means you have to be below a specified income level and the level varies by program." She also referred us to a description on LibraryIndex.com, a reference site on social topics. It said: "Means-tested programs provide benefits to those whose income and financial resources meet certain requirements. More than 80 benefit programs provide cash and/or non-cash aid to individuals who meet certain low-income qualifications in the United States." In case you missed that: "More than 80." Finally, Abromovitz noted a 2005 Government Accountability Office study that found that 50 percent to 70 percent of eligible people do not use these programs. But the question here is the number of programs, not their outreach -- and the GAO addressed that, too: "Each year through more than 80 means-tested programs, the federal government provides benefits and services to individuals and families with low incomes — just 12 of which account for as much as $330 billion in annual federal expenditures." The GAO said 80. Jordan said 77. You could say he was just being conservative, but on the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates as True. Comment on this item.

pomt-01659	Texas prosecutor Rosemary Lehmberg purchased "72 bottles of vodka in just one store alone, in just over a year."	true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/21/sarah-palin/palin-recaps-rosemary-lehmbergs-purchase-70-plus-b/	Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin singled out the Democratic district attorney of Travis County after a special grand jury in the county indicted Republican Gov. Rick Perry. In an Aug. 17, 2014, commentary on the Fox News website, Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, noted the local official, Rosemary Lehmberg, previously "was busted for drunk driving with an open bottle of vodka in her car after a 911 call reported her endangering others while swerving erratically on the road. The D.A. was smashed -- three times over the legal limit," Palin wrote. "She was a nut job while in custody," Palin said, "disgracefully threatening law enforcement officials and lashing out violently. The D.A. had to be physically restrained. It was all caught on tape. "The extent of the D.A.'s serious drinking problem was uncovered, evidence included her purchase of 72 bottles of vodka in just one store alone, in just over a year," Palin wrote. "It's reasonable to believe she imbibed elsewhere, too." We separately checked Palin’s claim in her commentary that Perry was indicted by a grand jury convened by the Travis County district attorney’s office under Lehmberg, finding the statement without factual footing. And was Palin right that Lehmberg, who has said she plans to serve out her term through 2016, bought six dozen bottles of vodka in a little over 12 months? That shopping is reflected in documents submitted as part of a proceeding culminating in a judge’s December 2013 ruling that Lehmberg could remain in her position. According to an Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Dec. 7, 2013, the Travis County attorney, David Escamilla, submitted relevant receipts during the civil trial over whether Lehmberg must step down. The receipts, the story said, indicated Lehmberg bought about 75 bottles of vodka in a 15-month period ending in April 2013; no other details about the purchases were available, the story said. Online searching led us to a document titled "Business Records Affidavit," filed by Escamilla on Sept. 24, 2013, and put online by Austin’s Channel 42, KEYE-TV. According to the affidavit, Kyle Baker, chief financial officer of Twin Liquors, which has multiple outlets, swore that provided credit-card receipts were duplicates of original records. By our count, the receipts, many of them listing Lehmberg as the purchaser, indicate 74 bottles of vodka were bought with a credit card in 38 stops at eight Twin Liquors stores from Jan. 11, 2012, through April 2, 2013. According to the receipts, most of the bottles contained 1.75 liters. We let the district attorney’s office know about our look at this claim and fielded no comment. Our ruling Palin said the Travis County district attorney purchased "72 bottles of vodka in just one store alone, in just over a year." Receipts indicate Lehmberg bought 74 bottles of vodka at several stores over about 15 months through April 2, 2013. We rate Palin’s claim, which doesn’t have anything significant missing, True.

pomt-09882	"Four percent of American citizens are black males, but they are 35 percent of murder victims."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/28/bill-bennett/black-men-are-4-percent-americans-35-percent-murde/	Ever since the arrest of black Harvard University scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., and the comments about the controversy by President Barack Obama, pundits have analyzed and reanalyzed what the incident says about crime and race in America. On the July 26, 2009, edition of CNN’s State of the Union with John King , conservative commentator Bill Bennett urged that the Gates case not obscure larger social realities about crime. "Well, I guess they are going to have a beer at the White House, the president has backed off from his ridiculous statement at the press conference. And, of course, Sgt. Crowley [the arresting officer, who is white] has shown himself to be an exemplary police officer. I hope if we get to so-called teachable moments and underlying issues, we'll get to some real problems. There obviously are wayward cops, not in this case, but let's talk about the fact that young black men in this country grow up 75 percent of the them without fathers. And if we talk about crime in America, let's remember that 4 percent of American citizens are black males, but they are 35 percent of murder victims. This doesn't come from the police. These are big and serious problems and I think this whole issue has obscured those more serious problems because of the ego of a Harvard professor." The issue of single parenthood is a good one to investigate further, but for now we'll look at the second part of his assertion — that "4 percent of American citizens are black males, but they are 35 percent of murder victims." On the first part of this claim, Bennett underestimated the black male percentage of the U.S. population by roughly one-third. The Census Bureau’s latest population estimate for the entire country, covering 2008, is 304,059,724. We determined the number of black men in America by taking the 2008 population estimate for African-Americans as a whole and multiplying that number by .477. (For various actuarial reasons, the Census Bureau found that 47.7 percent of African-Americans were male and 52.3 percent were female in 2007.) This left us with 18,631,063, or 6.1 percent of the U.S. population — a number notably higher than Bennett’s estimate. (Because Bennett specifically mentioned "American citizens," we also tried an alternative calculation, subtracting from the total U.S. population the 11.6 million undocumented Americans estimated by the Department of Homeland Security. Calculated this way, the result is 6.4 percent, making little difference in the result.) On the more important statistic of murder victimization rates, Bennett actually understated his own point. According to Crime in the United States, a statistical survey published annually by the FBI, 6,223 black men were murdered nationally in 2007 out of 14,831 total murder victims, or 42 percent. The percentages for the two prior years were consistent — 42 percent in 2006 and 41 percent in 2005. So, Bennett got the numbers wrong on both ends of his assertions, and not by insignificant amounts. But on the general point — that black men are murdered at disproportionately high rates — he is unquestionably correct. For this reason, we give his statement a rating of Mostly True.

pomt-08442	His biography says he was the top ROTC officer in the nation.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/17/john-robitaille/robitailles-bio-says-he-was-top-rotc-officer/	Republican candidate for governor John Robitaille talks a lot about his Army record. His current television advertisement touts his experience as a veteran and he regularly refers to his military service during public appearances. They are mostly passing references, devoid of details. But on his campaign website, Robitaille gets specific, listing his experience as a paratrooper and his service in Germany. He also notes that he "served his country as an Army officer for over five years on active duty and was recognized for distinguished performance as the most outstanding second lieutenant commissioned in the US Army through the ROTC program nationally." The most outstanding in the entire country? It was just unusual enough to make it worth a check, especially in an era when other politicians have gotten into trouble for citing their military records. We began our research in mid-September and that's where the obstacles began. Robitaille told us his documentation of the prize he received four decades ago, known as the Dr. Ralph Mershon Memorial Award, was destroyed in a flood several years ago. We asked Providence College -- where Robitaille was an ROTC cadet -- for documentation of the award, but officials there said all they could find was a page from the school's1970 yearbook listing Robitaille as an ROTC commanding officer. Next we filed a records request with the Army. But the public affairs officers at Fort Knox, where the documents are housed, said it kept only "service records of soldiers who were in service in 2000 and later." They forwarded our request to the Military Personnel Records Center, part of the National Archives and Records Administration in St. Louis. The wait time, they told us, would be at least three months unless the request came from the veteran himself. Robitaille agreed to file a request; the records finally arrived in the second week of October complete with a letter from the Records Center verifying their authenticity. The answer was clear: Robitaille won the Ralph Mershon award for the 1969-1970 school year. The documentation proving his claim includes several letters from then-Secretary of the Army Stanley R. Resor. It reads: "Robitaille attained the highest composite score of all distinguished military graduates who applied for and accepted a commission in the Regular Army." That was 40 years ago, but Robitaille said he recalled that each university with an ROTC program nominated the student with the top combined score in academics, ROTC activities and a summer basic training camp. Robitaille got Providence College's nod and was selected as the top candidate from any school. He said he learned of the award months later, in 1971, when his commander approached him in the officer's club in Germany to extend his congratulations. The way Robitaille remembers it, the commanding general of the 1st Armored Division presented him with the prize that night. The details are hazy, he said, but there was also a check for $400 which for a young soldier, seemed much more exciting than a plaque. A second letter from the secretary of the Army offers a bit more detail where Robitaille's memory leaves off. It orders the commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army to present the award "at an appropriate ceremony and that his personal congratulations be conveyed to Lieutenant Robitaille for his achievements along with best wishes for his continued to success." We give this one a definite True and offer our own congratulations. Albeit 40 years late.	None	John Robitaille	None	None	None	2010-10-17T00:01:00	2010-10-15	['None']
pomt-00598	"Two of the top three (rated) public high schools in Wisconsin — Ronald Reagan College Prep and Rufus King International — are MPS schools."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/04/david-bowen/do-two-milwaukee-public-schools-rank-among-wiscons/	In Madison, debates about education often paint a grim picture for public schools, especially Milwaukee Public Schools. In an effort to show public schools can provide quality education, state Rep. David Bowen (D-Milwaukee) hailed two MPS high schools as being rated among the top three in the state. Bowen’s statement was in response to a Republican proposal to turn low-performing schools in MPS over to operators of public charter or private voucher schools. On the most recent state-issued report cards, 55 of the 157 MPS schools received "fails to meet expectations" rating, the threshold that would make them eligible for the potential takeover. In a May 11, 2015 news release, Bowen called the proposal misguided. "Charter and voucher schools are not a magic bullet that will solve the problems faced by struggling schools in the Milwaukee Public Schools system," he said. "Two of the top three public high schools in Wisconsin — Ronald Reagan College Prep and Rufus King International — are MPS schools." Reagan and King are known as two of the best schools in the Milwaukee area, but do they really fare so well in a statewide ranking? About the ratings When asked for back up, Bowen’s team directed us to the 2014 U.S. News and World Report list of the nation’s best high schools. In the Wisconsin ranking, Reagan and King held the second and thirds spots in the state after Middleton High School. But U.S. News’ algorithm isn’t the only way to rank schools. Many other news organizations — most notably Newsweek and the Washington Post — generate similar lists. Newsweek releases an annual list of the 500 best schools in the country, focusing on participation in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate tests. King and Reagan weren’t mentioned on Newsweek’s 2014 list, though 22 other Wisconsin schools received the distinction. The Washington Post’s Most Challenging Schools list also bases its ranking on the number of college-level tests given at a school and the number of graduates that year. King was ranked third on the Post’s list of Wisconsin schools, while Reagan filled the number 10 spot. U.S. News’ rating system is more thorough than other media-created "best high schools" lists. So how does the magazine decide which schools are best? U.S. News says its methodology seeks to recognize schools that serve all its students well --not just the college bound -- and produce measurable outcomes across its student body. First, reading and math test results from schools across the country are analyzed. Students at a school need to exceed expectations for students in their state to move on to the next round. For 2014, a school’s students needed to be at least in the top third. The second step looks at the performance of disadvantaged students — black, Hispanic and low-income students — in each school. To make it to the next step, this group within a school must outperform statewide results for the same group. The final step examines how well students from a school are prepared for college. Participation and performance on Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate tests are used to calculate a college readiness index for each school. To be numerically ranked, a school needs to pass steps one and two and then have a college readiness index above the benchmark. The same basic formula is used to create the rating each year, but the exact methodology to judge schools changes. Schools bounce around the ratings due to small tweaks in methodology, which makes year-to-year comparisons difficult. For example, on the 2015 ratings released by U.S. News just one day after Bowen made his statement, both schools dropped out of the top three for the state ranking. Reagan fell six places and King fell nine to be ranked 8th and 12th in the state, respectively. Andy Rotherham, co-founder and partner at Bellwether Education Partners and a contributing editor to U.S. News and World Report, said he feels the magazine’s multi-step process makes the list more valid than other measures. "Having a politician say a school is good or bad based on these ratings is not egregious," he said. The ranking is useful, he said, but added it is just one measurement. "There’s so many ways to judge schools," Rotherham said. "You have to say, ‘It’s the best school based on these criteria.’ " Other views Other experts guide against putting too much stock in any such ratings. Matthew Di Carlo, research fellow at the Albert Shanker Institute, which focuses on public education issues, said school ratings require nuanced interpretation. "Due to the measures they use and how they use them, (the rankings) tend to conflate student performance with school performance," Di Carlo said. It’s more fitting, he said, to describe schools featured on such these lists as ones with the highest performing students, rather than the best schools. Di Carlo said growth-oriented measures can give a better sense of a school’s contribution to student success than the data used to create these lists. "Any attempt to portray these rankings as identifying ‘the best schools’ requires serious caution," Di Carlo said. The state-issued school report cards in Wisconsin do assess some schools using growth-oriented measures, though not high schools. Just one year of test results is available for high school students, and multiple points of assessment are needed to show growth. This means the state’s high school report cards use the same student performance measures as the media-generated rankings. So you can’t easily tell what impact a school is having on a student’s test scores. King and Reagan both received "meets expectations" rating for overall accountability from the Department of Public Instruction. The highest rating -- "exceeds expectations"-- was given to 176 high schools. Our rating Bowen said Rufus King International and Ronald Reagan College Prep are two of the top three public high schools in the state. That corresponds to the U.S. News ranking for 2014, which was the most recent at the time he made the claim. But, other ratings painted a different picture and experts are wary about the validity of the methodology to measure school success. We rate Bowen’s claim Half True.

pomt-08063	House Speaker Dean Cannon says that freshmen lawmakers account for one-third of the 120-member House, and that two-thirds of the chamber have two years or less experience.	true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/23/dean-cannon/dean-cannon-says-majority-state-house-has-two-year/	Term limits for Florida's state representatives and senators result in a lot of turnover in Tallahassee after an election. So after the Nov. 2, 2010, election, just how many freshmen House members will there be in 2011? Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon quantified it this way in an interview with the St. Petersburg Times, which was posted on its political blog The Buzz on Dec. 8, 2010. The paragraph starts with a paraphrase: "Cannon pointed out that freshmen lawmakers account for one-third of the 120-member House, and that two-thirds of the chamber have two years or less experience," The Buzz wrote, and then quoted Cannon: "One of the things I'm really focused on is trying to put people where they can best get up to speed and hit the ground running once we start committee meetings in January." If Cannon's math is right, that means the majority of the incoming House would have two years of experience or less -- a high number. Those are the numbers we're checking. First, some background on term limits. A Feb. 7, 2010, article in the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald contains some useful background about milestones in Florida's political history, including the vote in favor of term limits in 1992: "A string of scandals in Congress spurred a national movement known as term limits aimed at driving career politicians from office. The Florida campaign is known as 'Eight is Enough' and limits Cabinet members and legislators to eight years in office; it passed with a whopping 77 percent in favor. (Ironically, it does not apply to members of Congress). The full effect wouldn't be clear until eight years later, when the eight-year clock kicked in and the state House saw rampant turnover -- 63 of its 120 members were freshmen. Term limits are blamed today for an assortment of ills, from myopia among legislators to the exaggerated influence of special interest money, lobbyists and even the media." We should note here some benefits to term limits: fresh faces may provide new ideas and at least initially could be more in touch with constituents back home. For some national perspective on term limits we turn to the National Conference of State Legislatures that provides this background on its website: "Proposals to limit the terms of state legislators have been the subject of public policy debate since 1990, when citizen initiatives limiting the terms of legislators were passed by voters in California, Colorado and Oklahoma. Subsequently, 18 other states adopted term limits, but in four -- Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming -- term limits were thrown out by the state supreme courts, and they have been repealed by the legislatures in Idaho and Utah. That leaves 15 states with term limits for legislators. See our current list of states with term limits for legislators." Now back to the new faces -- and relatively new faces -- in the 2011 Legislature. First we turned to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta on Dec. 20, 2010, who told us she counted 82 freshman or sophomore legislators -- 44 of those freshmen -- among the 120 state representatives. Betta directed us to the state House website to check her figures. We clicked on the page of each of the 120 members of the House. Each page has some basic biographical information -- heck, even an occasional interesting tidbit such as the recreational interest of newly elected Republican member James W. "J.W." Grant of Tampa: "Most sports and anything in the woods or on the water." The pages also state when each member was first elected to the House, including past service. Here are the totals we found that we will explain in more detail below: Elected in 2007: 5 Elected in 2008: 33 Elected in 2009: 1 Elected in 2010: 43 That puts the total elected between 2007 and 2010 at 82, so we're at the same starting point as Betta's number. Of the 43 elected this year, three had served in the House previously: Dennis Baxley (R-Ocala), 2000-2007; Gayle Harrell (R-Stuart), 2000-2008; and Irv Slosberg (D-Boca Raton), 2000-2006. Also, two of the 43 were elected in special elections: Janet Cruz (D-Tampa) on Feb. 23 and Matt Gaetz (R-Fort Walton Beach) on April 13. (Cruz and Gaetz then won re-election to full terms this fall.) We define "freshmen" as "first-year beginners," like high school or college. If we count as freshmen all 43 members elected at any time in 2010, we get a freshmen class that represents about 36 percent of the House. If we don't count Baxley, Harrell and Slosberg as freshmen -- since they've already worked through several sessions each -- then the freshmen class represents 33 percent. But wait, how should we count Cruz, who was elected Feb. 23 just before the regular two-month session started in March? And Gaetz, who was elected April 13 when that regular session only had about two weeks to go? Should they be counted as freshmen in 2011 even though they participated in votes and had their names attached to several bills in 2010? If we omit both of them as freshmen -- as well as the three who had previously served -- that would drop the percentage to about 32 percent. (For the record, Betta says Cannon also counts Mack Bernard (D-West Palm Beach), who won a special election on Sept. 22, 2009, as a freshman, even though he was active in the 2010 session -- bringing her total to 44, or about 37 percent.) Using any of those four figures -- 32 percent, 33 percent, 36 percent or 37 percent -- we are at or very close to the one-third cited by Cannon. Now what about the other part of Cannon’s description, that two-thirds of the members have two years of experience or less? We counted 33 who were elected in 2008, one elected in 2009, and 43 in 2010. That brought our total since 2008 -- two years -- to 77 members, or 64 percent. (Again, if we don’t count the three lawmakers who served previously and easily have more than two years of experience, the percentage drops to 62 percent. Either way, that's close to two-thirds.) Betta wanted us to count five lawmakers who won special elections in 2007 as sophomores because they would be starting their second two-year terms in 2011. But those five have already worked through the legislative sessions of 2008, 2009 and 2010, and we don't see them as sophomores. So is Cannon correct? He was paraphrased as saying that one-third of the 120-member House are freshmen and two-thirds have two years or less experience. We can split hairs on the experience level of a few of them, but not enough to change his math. We rate this claim True.	None	Dean Cannon	None	None	None	2010-12-23T14:20:05	2010-12-08	['None']

pomt-02255	Says restoring Georgia pre-k to a 180-day program was a "real result" of his leadership.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/11/nathan-deal/deal-takes-credit-restoring-pre-k-cuts/	In his re-election bid, Gov. Nathan Deal is taking credit for restoring Georgia’s nationally lauded and lottery-funded pre-kindergarten program to its traditional 180 days a year. He’s billing himself as the candidate in the race who is the "real Deal" and promoting that change to pre-k on his campaign website as one of the "real results" of his administration. And why wouldn’t he? Every year, thousands of Georgia parents who might otherwise be paying for child care are sending their 4-year-olds to free pre-k in 3,800 classes, statewide. About 82,000 children are currently enrolled in Georgia pre-k, and about 6,000 more are on waiting lists. Arguably, only the lottery-funded HOPE college scholarship program is more popular. But can the governor take credit for pre-k being back on track this school year with a traditional 180-day calendar? We decided a deeper look was needed. Deal, a Republican and former congressman, became Georgia’s governor in January 2011 and quickly took on a subject that lawmakers had been discussing but largely sidestepping: With revenue from lottery tickets falling and program expenses rising, could HOPE and pre-k survive for the long term? By 2010, the combined annual expenditures for pre-k and HOPE had started to exceed annual lottery revenue dedicated to the two programs. The Lottery Reserve Fund, which had reached a peak balance of nearly $1 billion, had been tapped to fund deficits generated by HOPE. By 2011, the reserve fund’s balance was under $600 million, according to a 2012 report by the nonprofit, liberal-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. Deal proposed major changes, including converting pre-k from a full-day to a part-day program, but he abandoned that proposal after a public outcry. As an alternative, he asked lawmakers to reduce the pre-k school year from 180 to 160 days, for a savings estimated at $22 million a year. The governor also recommended cutting more than 300 pre-k classes across the state, forcing some teachers out of jobs and requiring the teachers that remained to take on extra students. Lawmakers went along with the governor’s recommendations, which, according to the Budget and Policy Institute, reduced lottery funding for pre-k by about $54 million, to $355 million in fiscal 2012. Teachers who stayed received smaller paychecks, and many of them bolted for jobs in kindergarten, first grade and elsewhere within a year. Deal subsequently recommended -- and lawmakers approved -- restoring 10 days to the 2012-2013 pre-k school year and returning to the traditional 180-day school year for the current school year, which started in August. The larger class sizes, resulting in an estimated $30 million annual savings, remain. Jennifer Talaber, a spokeswoman for Deal’s re-election campaign, said the governor can rightly claim credit. "Governor Deal's reforms stabilized our lottery-funded programs, which were on the brink of bankruptcy," she said. "Those tough changes -- and the strong leadership it took to achieve them -- are why we can afford 180 days now." We asked Talaber to share with us any data that the governor had when he made the decision to recommend cutting the program days, as well as when he recommended restoring them. She referred us to previous reports in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Brian Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, told the newspaper in 2012 that the governor was able to push to restore the pre-k days because the cuts made in 2011 stabilized the program and "yielded more savings than anticipated." Steve Barnett, the director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, said the shortening of the pre-k year did "damage from which there may not be immediate recovery." "Teachers may view these jobs as less secure, and this lowers the quality of teacher that can be attracted," Barnett said. But, he said, "restoring the program is a very good thing to have done. If there were hard choices that had to be made to make that happen, then there is some credit for that." As for the long-term financial prospects for pre-k and HOPE -- both considered education game-changers for Georgia -- there’s not much talk about that these days. Lottery revenue dedicated to education has grown since it plunged 4 percent, or $39 million, in 2011. It was up 7 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013, according to the Georgia Lottery Corp. And the reserve fund had $734 million as of June 30, 2013, records show. Our conclusion: Gov. Nathan Deal was the driving force behind the push to reinstate the days to Georgia pre-k. But he also initiated the cuts, and they had consequences, including the loss of experienced teachers. Those are important details that Deal doesn’t mention when he states that restoring pre-k to 180 days was one of the "real results" of his term as governor. Therefore, we rate his statement as Half True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2014-04-11T00:00:00	2014-04-09	['None']

pomt-14239	"There are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities that have the same type of policies that we just passed," referring to North Carolina’s House Bill 2.	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/13/paul-skip-stam/nc-rep-stam-says-states-controversial-new-law-isnt/	Rep. Paul "Skip" Stam, one of North Carolina’s most powerful Republican legislators, gave an interview Monday addressing the jobs and tourism dollars that North Carolina has lost in the wake of the new state law known as House Bill 2, or HB2. PayPal pulled a planned 400-job expansion in Charlotte, and Wake County tourism officials said the law had already cost the county $732,000 with another $24 million in question due to businesses and conventions expressing concern. Stam said the backlash against North Carolina is hard to understand because most states have similar laws. The next day, Deutsche Bank announced it was freezing plans to bring 250 jobs to Cary. "If they’re not going to go here, there are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities that have the same type of policies that we just passed," Stam said, as The News & Observer quoted him on Monday. Is that right? Our first challenge was figuring out exactly what Stam meant when he said "policies that we just passed," because HB2 covers a lot of ground. Here’s a brief rundown of what’s in the bill: Transgender people may not use the bathroom that matches their gender identity in schools or other public buildings – only the gender that’s on their birth certificates. Private businesses may set their own bathroom rules. Cities and counties may not enact local policies concerning discrimination or minimum wages that apply to private businesses. Whether they can enact stronger discrimination policies for their own employees is still unclear, as we explored in another fact check. The anti-discrimination policy for employment does not include sexual orientation or gender identity, which means businesses may discriminate against gay or transgender employees. The anti-discrimination policy for service in public accommodations also does not include protections for sexual orientation or gender identity. People fired for any discriminatory reason – including race, religion, disability and biological sex – no longer may file a lawsuit in state courts. People denied service for any discriminatory reason – including race, religion, disability and biological sex – no longer may sue in state courts. Stam can’t be totally correct when he says the law is the same as in 31 other states because some of these new policies are rare. Only North Carolina and Mississippi, for instance, do not allow discrimination claims to be filed in state court. And North Carolina is one of only a handful of states that have considered so-called bathroom bills to dictate that people can use only the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificates. And it’s that issue, in which North Carolina stands alone for now, that has received the most attention nationally. A similar proposal was shot down in South Dakota, but several other states are considering bathroom bills. Those include Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality, which tracks such bills nationwide. We double-checked all those state’s bills and found they’re still active; some states are considering multiple bills on the topic. But we digress. Even if Stam isn’t right on some parts of the bill, is he right on any of it? 31 states, 10,000 cities An aide told us Stam was referring only to the lack of discrimination protections for both sexual orientation and gender identity. The District of Columbia and another 20 states do offer such protections; therefore 30 states do not give discrimination protections for both categories. Stam said "31 other states," and really it’s 29 others, but that difference is small. Part of the problem is that Stam was citing an outdated map from the pro-HB2 group Keep NC Safe. The map lists New York as only protecting sexual orientation, but the state added gender identity to its list of protections in January. As of now, two states protect sexual orientation but not gender identity (New Hampshire and Wisconsin), and 28 states protect neither category. Most of those are in the South and Midwest. Stam is right that about 10,000 cities also don't give discrimination protections to gay or lesbian people. An aide told us it was actually just a conservative guess Stam made. We counted and found the guess was on target – it’s safe to say the 30 states in question contain more than 10,000 incorporated places. Because of state-by-state discrepancies in defining places, we counted all incorporated places instead of just cities. Some states divide places into townships, towns, boroughs, villages or cities. Other states call everything a city, even if that city has only four residents — like Ruso, N.D. Some states – looking at you, Michigan – have wildly confusing systems of local governments with overlapping boundaries and differing powers that make it difficult to determine an accurate count. But while we couldn’t find an exact number, we were able to confirm more than 10,000 incorporated places in those states Stam referred to. North Carolina alone has 552. It's worth noting that more than 200 places or counties nationwide have passed anti-discrimination laws that are stricter than their state laws. Still, Stam’s "10,000 cities" estimate remains accurate. Our ruling Stam said there are dozens of states and thousands of cities that businesses should also avoid if they truly oppose North Carolina’s new law. That’s overly broad, since the law does many different things. In some cases, North Carolina is one of two states or the only state with policies that HB2 brought into law. But Stam clarified that he was talking specifically about discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. On that, his claim of "31 other states and 10,000 other cities" is basically true. Technically there are 29 other states, not 31. That doesn’t really detract from the point he was trying to make – but the fact that he glossed over other parts of the bill does. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Paul "Skip" Stam	None	None	None	2016-04-13T18:18:54	2016-04-11	['None']

pomt-14648	Says a Ted Cruz ad has "got me bull-dozing down a house. I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-calls-out-ted-cruz-ad-about-trump-bul/	Donald Trump’s first words Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press were an attack on his biggest rival in the Iowa caucuses, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Before bringing on Trump, host Chuck Todd showed a new Cruz ad criticizing the real estate tycoon’s support for eminent domain, the government’s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects. The ad quotes Trump as saying, "I think eminent domain is wonderful." "It made him rich — like when Trump colluded with Atlantic City insiders to bulldoze the home of an elderly widow for a limousine parking lot at his casino," the ad says. Trump launched into his critique right away. "Good morning," said Trump in the clip, "and I have to tell you his ad is wrong because I never knocked down that house. I wanted to get that house to build a major building that would have employed a tremendous numbers of people, but when the woman didn’t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it. So he’s got me bulldozing down a house, I never bulldozed it down, it’s false advertising." Todd said, "Well, all right, the accusation was that that’s what you wanted to do." Trump stood by his takedown: "No, the accusation was that I did it, and I didn’t do it." It turns out that both Cruz and Trump are stretching the truth about what happened with a widow’s home. In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Trump saying Cruz has "got me bull-dozing down a house. I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising." Donald vs. Vera In a prior fact-check, we found Trump is sort of a poster boy for eminent domain (and he really did call the practice "wonderful" as recently as October.) Eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a government-run project. However, the Supreme Court’s decision in the 2005 case Kelo vs. New London, Conn., said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The court decided the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area. Cruz’s ad references a period in the 1990s, prior to Kelo, when Trump wanted the state of New Jersey to use its eminent domain power to help him with a casino project. Trump planned to build a limousine garage to service the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City but several pieces of private property were in the way, including a home owned since the 1960s by a widow in her late 60s named Vera Coking. Trump has said he offered Coking millions for her property, but she wouldn’t give up her home. In 1994, New Jersey’s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority threatened to use eminent domain to seize the house. The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government in 1998. After losing the case, Trump gave up his plan to buy Coking’s house, telling the New York Daily News that he was "no longer an interested buyer." "The bottom line is it's too bad for Atlantic City, but it's not too bad for me because I'm not interested in the property," Trump said. "Nobody gets under my skin." Coking’s supporters painted Trump as a villainous fat cat. Coking herself called him "a maggot, a cockroach and a crumb." Trump Plaza closed in September 2014 after struggling financially. Trump told the New York Times that ownership of Coking’s property would not have saved it. Back to Cruz’s ad, Trump has a point that it is misleading to imply he got "rich" after bulldozing an elderly widow’s home, given that Coking kept her property, and Trump never got anything out of it. But Trump exaggerated when he said "when the woman didn’t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it." It took several years of failed negotiations and losing a lawsuit for him to decide he was no longer interested. Our ruling Trump says Cruz's ad has "got me bull-dozing down a house. I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising." If you read the ad as Trump does, he is right: The woman’s home was never destroyed as a result of eminent domain. He never got rich off of this deal because the case for eminent domain didn’t pan out. But that reading ignores another interpretation of Cruz’s point: Trump certainly tried to take over the property before the state Superior Court stepped in and ruled in the woman’s favor. Trump didn’t mention the years-long legal battle on Meet the Press. For glossing over some important context, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-02357	The Greenlight Pinellas transportation plan involves a "300% tax increase."	false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/20/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-means-300-tax-increase-no-tax-/	Now that the special election to fill the late U.S. Rep. Bill Young’s open House seat has concluded, Pinellas County can get back to worrying about other issues -- like the fledgling mass transit initiative called Greenlight Pinellas. Not everyone is a fan of the expanded transportation plan, with the activist group No Tax For Tracks being its most vocal opponent. "Greenlight Pinellas is nothing but an attempt to put a Happy Face on a 300 percent Tax increase and Money Grab," the group’s website, RailTaxFacts.com trumpets as a counterpoint to the plan. A 300 percent tax increase sounds like pretty hefty fee to build a light rail line and add more buses. We decided to look into the claim and find out if the county really would be taken for a ride. Taxes vs. revenues Greenlight Pinellas is a countywide transportation initiative that proposes expanding bus service throughout the county -- by adding routes in northern Pinellas and extending hours -- as well as adding a 24-mile light rail line between St. Petersburg and Clearwater. The entire plan hinges on whether Pinellas voters on Nov. 4 approve a sales tax increase from 7 percent to 8 percent, making the county’s sales tax rate the highest in the state. The higher sales tax would replace the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority’s current county funding, a property tax assessed at a 0.7305 millage rate. The sales tax would only go up on items already subject to the sales tax; Florida has a long list of items that are not taxed, such as medicine, groceries, certain agricultural and manufacturing startup equipment. It also would be limited to the first $5,000 of major purchases. The change would take effect Jan. 1, 2016. If it’s adopted, any future changes to the Greenlight plan, such as an extension of the proposed rail line, would be subject to a referendum. The new sales tax is projected to increase the authority’s budget from its current $34 million per year to about $120 million to $130 million, said Bob Lasher, the agency’s external affairs officer. This is the source of No Tax For Tracks’ claim that the tax revenue expansion amounts to "a 300% tax increase." The group argues that not only is the plan’s feasibility suspect, but the increase in the authority’s budget is unconscionable. "What we’re asserting is that their revenue will increase 300 percent," No Tax For Tracks spokeswoman Barb Haselden told PolitiFact Florida. "They’re broadening their budget with a tax increase on the non-homeowner poor. … It’s a regressive tax that is not necessary." How much would the percent increase actually be for individual taxpayers? Greenlight Pinellas illustrates its plan using Census averages from 2008 to 2012, taking as a case study a median-family home in Pinellas County, which costs about $161,000. Under that scenario, the portion of property taxes that goes to the transit authority today is just less than $90. Greenlight also looks at a median-income family with two children earning about $46,000. Using the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, Greenlight concluded that this family will pay about $800 in sales taxes annually at the new 8 percent rate, about $104 more per year than they paid under the 7 percent rate. Under the plan, a family that owns a $161,000 home and makes about $46,000 would stop paying the $90 share of the property tax destined for the transit authority, but it would instead pay $104 in additional sales taxes. Allowing some uncertainty for the exact mix of taxed and tax-exempt purchases, that’s a tax hike of about 15 percent. The increase in dollars in this example is pretty modest -- $14 more per year. Other residents, however, could face heftier impacts. County residents who currently don’t own real estate won’t benefit from the authority’s switch from property tax revenue to sales tax revenue, so if they owe $104 in additional sales taxes, that won’t be offset by tax reductions. Still, on a percentage basis, that’s an increase in sales tax burden of about 14 percent. In other words, it’s not correct to call either of these examples of increases a "300% tax increase." No Tax For Tracks actually gets the talking point correct elsewhere on its website, saying, "Now PSTA wants to 'replace' the property tax by increasing our sales tax from 7 percent to 8 percent. That’s a 14 percent increase! To convince us to vote 'Yes', they are calling it a 'Tax Swap'." The ruling No Tax For Tracks says Greenlight Pinellas will balloon the transit authority’s budget by imposing "a 300% tax increase." That number comes from an estimated increase in the transit authority’s operating budget from $32 million to about $130 million per year. But that’s an increase in revenues to the agency, not an increase in the tax rate to individual taxpayers. In reality, no group would face a 300 percent increase. We rate the statement False.

pomt-13347	Says Senate candidate Katie McGinty "made thousands from companies she previously regulated."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/oct/04/freedom-partners-action-fund/ex-dep-secretary-mcginty-legally-profited-environm/	The attack ads are upon us. It’s difficult to sit through any newscast or sporting event without seeing one, and ads for Senate candidates Katie McGinty and Pat Toomey are filling up the Pennsylvania airwaves like nowhere else. Outside groups have contributed $57.5 million on the Toomey-McGinty race -- more than any other Senate battle in the country. One recent anti-McGinty ad comes from the Freedom Partners Action Fund, a Republican-leaning PAC involved in Senate races in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada and Indiana. The ad, which Freedom Partners Action Fund backed with $1 million, calls her out for taking jobs related to her past government work, stating, "she’s made thousands from companies she previously regulated." McGinty had several jobs and advisory positions after her work as Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection in Governor Ed Rendell’s administration. Were those companies’ business under the purview of the DEP? And did she really make thousands? After leaving Rendell’s administration, according to her LinkedIn profile, McGinty worked as a director for NRG Energy for three years, senior VP and managing director of strategic growth for Weston Solutions for two and chair of Fresh Start PA for five months. She also advised for the solar energy company Plextronics and served as a board member of Iberdrola, a wind-energy and natural gas company. For NRG, she was pulling in six figures annually. According to SEC filings from NRG Energy, McGinty made $200,000 in cash and stock in 2011 and $146,000 in 2009. Penn Live reported Iberdrola paid McGinty $125,000 for her work on the board. Would those firms fall under the DEP’s umbrella? DEP press secretary Neil Shader said the DEP regulates the activities of energy companies, as well as others related to the environment. Asked whether it took issue with the statement about McGinty making thousands "from companies she previously regulated," the McGinty campaign responded with a statement that essentially ignored our question. The campaign said only that "Katie has dedicated her career in both the public and private sector to creating good paying jobs and protecting the environment. She has a long record of accomplishment, including bringing $1 billion renewable energy investments to Pennsylvania and creating 3,000 jobs as Secretary of PA's Department of Environmental Protection." In Pennsylvania, for the most part there are few laws prohibiting the type of work a public official can do after leaving office. One exception is lobbying. Public officials are barred from lobbying the agency at which they worked for a year after they left. It’s not uncommon for Democrats or Republicans to move into private sector jobs related to their past positions in government. Michael Krancer, for instance, joined Blank Rome’s energy, industry team after his tenure as DEP secretary under Tom Corbett. Barry Kauffmann, executive director of the state watchdog group Common Cause, would like to see that prohibition extended for two years and the introduction of regulations for public officials who take private sector jobs closely related to their previous position. "The problem is conflict of interest," he said. "You need to have a buffer or a barrier to make sure the public is protected from the conflict of interest. And there has to be penalties to make sure those disincentives are in place and effectively monitored." Our ruling The pro-Republican PAC Freedom Partners Action Fund attacked Senate candidate Katie McGinty in a recent ad, stating, "she’s made thousands from companies she previously regulated." After McGinty stopped working as DEP secretary in 2008, she worked for or served on the board for energy companies NRG Energy, Iberdrola and Plextronics, among others. NRG Energy and Iberdrola both compensated her with more than $100,000. According to the Department of Environmental Protection, the office is responsible for regulating the activities of energy companies. We rule the claim True.

Barack Obama of Illinois tried to make the point that enforcement against people who hire undocumented workers has to improve. But statistics show the feds at least outpace lightning strikes. Given current data, indictments out of employer investigations happen 4.6 times more often than people get hit by lightning, figured Deborah Rumsey, author of Probability for Dummies and Statistics for Dummies , among other books. Rumsey, a statistics education specialist at Ohio State University, helped PolitiFact.com review the stats. "Neither one of these is a common occurrence, but compared to each other, there's a big difference," Rumsey said. Asked to support his statement, the Obama campaign cited a Washington Post report that showed only three businesses were fined — a more narrow look than prosecutions — for employing illegal immigrants in 2004. Being fined is indeed rarer than lightning hitting someone. But based on figures from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the National Weather Service, we find that the change Obama demanded in Thursday's debate already has happened, at least in meteorological terms. For starters, lightning hits an average of 1,000 to 1,100 people a year, according to the National Weather Service. That would make strikes on people a 1.1-in-303,000 probability, using current U.S. Census population estimates. Now consider indictments in investigations of employers, which numbered 441 in 2006, according to an annual report of the Office of Immigration Statistics at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Based only on indictments, there was a 5.1-in-303,000 chance an employer would be prosecuted to the point of indictment. That's based on a U.S. Census count of nearly 26.3-million businesses from 2004, the most recent year full data is available. It should be noted that the number of employers is tough to determine; officials with the IRS and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said they had no data. The Census count is its largest available, with other surveys showing smaller numbers — and even higher chances of indictments against employers. Given these findings, we rule Obama's statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2007-11-16T00:00:00	2007-11-15	['None']

pomt-13875	Says Hillary Clinton "was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/03/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-hillary-clinton-pushed-reset-russia-mon/	If you want to get a rise from a Republican lawmaker, suggest that he or she shares some common ground with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., bristled when NBC host Chuck Todd suggested Cotton’s foreign policy positions align more closely with Clinton than with Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump. "I can assure you that I am not very close to Hillary Clinton," Cotton responded. "She has been responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administration. She was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia." Cotton’s list of her failings continued, but his comment about Russia invading Georgia caught our eye, and we decided to look a little closer. Russia and Georgia Cotton’s claim focuses on the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the semi-autonomous regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Tensions and violence between ethnic Georgians, South Ossetians and Abkhazians ebbed and flowed after the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1990. Under the USSR, South Ossetia and Abkhazia enjoyed substantial autonomy. Newly independent Georgian nationalists declared a unified nation with no internal borders. In 1991, Georgian forces occupied the South Ossetian capital, but resistance by Russian-backed fighters led to a stalemate. In 1992, all parties agreed to a ceasefire, which included a Russian-led peacekeeping force. There was a similar pattern of hostilities in Abkhazia that resulted in a similar solution. The presence of peacekeepers and international monitors worked for about a decade. Calm unravelled in 2004 with the election of a more nationalist leader in Georgia. There was aggression on both sides. Violence grew and on Aug. 7, 2008, after Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia shelled ethnically Georgian villages, and the Georgian government sent in its army to take control of the region. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Clashes continued for a week, drawing in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Open conflict ended on Aug. 12, 2008. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step. Russian troops largely withdrew from Georgian soil, although some forces remained in several Georgian cities until about October 2008. The reset Jump forward to March 2009 to pick up the other point in Cotton’s statement. Newly elected President Barack Obama had campaigned that he would put relations with Russia on a less confrontational footing. Most of his focus was on scaling back the nuclear arsenals of both nations. (He promised to win Russian agreement to continue the monitoring and verification rules under the START I Treaty that were due to expire in 2009.) As part of that initiative, on March 6, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov a red button. The button was supposed to have word "reset" written on it in Russian. But the Americans got it wrong -- the word translated to "overcharged." Counting the months So Cotton has the basics of the story largely correct, though he’s cutting off the edges. Russian troops did participate in military activities on Georgian soil, but troops were already in place as part of a brokered peace settlement. And the Russians didn’t necessarily initiate hostilities. And while Cotton said the Americans hit the "reset" button "a few months" after the Russian invasion, the reality is it took place almost six months after the week-long conflict had ended. An invasion with a twist Susan Allen, director of the Center for Peacemaking Practice at George Mason University, calls Russia’s action an invasion because in early August 2008, Russia didn't consider South Ossetia to be an independent country. But Allen told us that beyond that legal definition, the details muddy the picture. Georgia made the first large military move. On top of that, Russian soldiers were already on the ground in South Ossetia. "Russia had had a longstanding role as part of a peacekeeping force separating the Georgians and South Ossetians," Allen said. "Yes, Russia invaded Georgia, and, yes, there is a lot more to the story." Law professor Kenneth Anderson at American University put a lot of weight on the rest of the story. Right after the ceasefire, Anderson urged western powers to push back hard against Russian expansionism. But he reminded people of the ethnic cleansing that took place at the hands of Georgian nationalists in the 1990s, saying it was as extreme as anything he had seen in the war in the former Yugoslavia. "The facts of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not simply a narrative of Russia stirring up trouble in an otherwise untroubled corner of the world," Anderson wrote in a 2008 article. "This conflict got started 15 years ago, and although on again and off again, it has never stopped. Neither its existence nor its persistence are due to Russian imperial expansion alone." For Cotton to bring up Russia’s invasion of Georgia might invoke more recent memories of Russia’s clear aggression in Ukraine when it seized control of the Crimean peninsula. But the circumstances were quite different, as was the western reaction. The Crimean seizure produced hard sanctions against Russia, including expulsion from the G-8. In contrast, in 2008, the George W. Bush administration made only cautious moves to register its disapproval of Russia. David L. Phillips, director of Columbia University’s program on peace-building and rights, told PolitFact in 2014 that "there was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that." Regarding the impact of the "reset", some observers say it helped. Political scientist Andrew Kuchins at the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in 2011 that relations between Russia and America "steadily improved." Kuchins credits the diplomatic shift with producing a new START treaty and winning Russian support for stronger sanctions against Iran. Our ruling Cotton said Clinton "pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia." Cotton shrinks the timeframe and oversimplifies the nature of the Russian action. Yet, while imperfect, his words are not necessarily an inaccurate retelling of history.

pomt-15138	Bernie Sanders opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and Hillary Clinton supports it.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/02/viral-image/how-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-differ-trans-pa/	A widespread Internet post claims Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have opposing views on a number of issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade deal involving the United States and 11 other nations. The image says Sanders opposes the deal, but Clinton supports it. As part of a couple of fact-checks on the post, we looked into whether the two candidates differ on support for the deal, which has divided Democratic leaders on the Hill. President Barack Obama, the deal’s primary advocate, has sparred with Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., a longtime ally, and received praise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a frequent opponent, over the deal. So where do the leading Democratic presidential candidates stand on the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Sanders sides with other members of the Senate’s progressive caucus in vehemently opposing the deal. In January 2014, he said he’s against it primarily because it will allow corporations to move jobs overseas. Clinton’s position on the proposal is complicated by her time as secretary of state, and she’s been careful as a presidential candidate not to express a firm position. There’s evidence to suggest Clinton was deeply involved in the deal’s formation and promotion as the country’s lead diplomat. In 2011, she told a congressional committee that even though the State Department was not in charge of the negotiations, "we work closely with the U.S. (Trade Representative)." Leaked diplomatic cables show Clinton’s deputies specifically discussed the TPP with foreign heads of state. Clinton openly pushed for the deal at least 45 times during her tenure as secretary of state, according to CNN’s tally. In 2012, she touted the trade deal, also called TPP, to a group of American and Australian officials as a way to "lower trade barriers, raise labor and environmental standards, and drive growth across the region." But since entering the race for president, Clinton has distanced herself from those remarks. "I did not work on TPP," she told reporters in July, saying the deal was "the responsibility of the United States Trade Representative." At times, Clinton has echoed Sanders’ concerns about outsourcing. "Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security," she told a reporter from MSNBC in April. "We have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive. It's got to be really a partnership between our business, our government, our workforce, the intellectual property that comes out of our universities, and we have to get back to a much more focused effort in my opinion to try to produce those capacities here at home so that we can be competitive in a global economy." Hopeful comments about job creation and increased wages do not signal a clear position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton’s campaign website lists no official position on the deal. Our ruling The graphic claims Bernie Sanders opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and Hillary Clinton supports it. Sanders has said on multiple occasions that he would oppose the trade deal. Clinton supported it as secretary of state, and there’s even evidence to suggest she was an advocate for the deal within the Obama administration. But she has taken a neutral stance on the deal during her campaign for the presidency, voicing some of Sanders’ same concerns yet refusing to explicitly criticize the proposal. Clinton spoke often in support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — until that backing irritated parts of her Democratic base. We rate the post’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-04352	"Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they’re rushing to build a lot more. They’ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the relatively near future."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-pakistan-path-overtake-uk-nuclear/	Pakistan emerged as a source of concern during the third presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., which focused on foreign policy. At one point, Mitt Romney said, "Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they’re rushing to build a lot more. They’ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the relatively near future." We wondered whether Pakistan, a relative newcomer to the nuclear club, was really poised to leapfrog longtime nuclear power Great Britain. First, let’s look at where the nations stand now. Here’s an estimate of the total warheads possessed by today’s nuclear powers, according to the Federation of American Scientists. In most cases, the number of operational warheads -- as opposed to stockpiled and decommissioned weapons -- is smaller: Russia: 10,000 United States 8,000 France: 300 China: 240 United Kingdom: 225 Israel: 80 Pakistan: 90-110 India: 80-100 North Korea: Less than 10 So today, Pakistan’s warhead total is well behind that of the U.K. But Romney said "sometime in the relatively near future." That’s a vague timeframe, but the experts we contacted said it’s a plausible supposition. It involves two trend lines: the United Kingdom’s arsenal is set to drop, and Pakistan’s arsenal is set to increase. In 2010, the British government committed to cap its total arsenal at 180. So to equal the U.K., Pakistan would need to see its arsenal rise from about 100 to 180. Can it do it? Experts say it’s possible. Hans Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists projected earlier this year that Pakistan’s warhead total "might increase to 150-200 within the next decade." Matthew Bunn, a public policy professor at Harvard University who specializes in nuclear weapons, said that "Pakistan has the world's fastest-growing nuclear arsenal, as well as the arsenal most threatened by terrorists -- a worrisome combination." Pakistan is not only continuing to produce highly enriched uranium, Bunn said, but is also ramping up production of plutonium "at an alarming rate." Once its four current and planned plutonium production facilities are all operational, he said, they might be able to produce 10 to 15 bombs a year. "At that rate, it is quite plausible that in the not-too-distant future they might pass the U.K." We should reiterate that these are projections, made without a lot of transparency and lots of uncertainty. And Pakistan may have an incentive to exaggerate its nuclear capacity for strategic reasons. Still, John Pike, a national security specialist with globalsecurity.org, agreed that the Romney scenario is a plausible one. "If by ‘relatively near future’ we mean ‘within a decade,’ I think that is pretty close to the mark," he said. Our ruling Romney said, "Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they’re rushing to build a lot more. They’ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the relatively near future." While there is an enormous amount of uncertainty about how fast Pakistan will expand its nuclear arsenal, experts tell us that there’s a plausible path for Pakistan’s total to match the U.K.’s in roughly a decade. So we rate Romney’s claim Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-23T17:41:33	2012-10-22	['None']
pomt-00787	"Rand Paul supports Obama's negotiations with Iran."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/07/foundation-secure-and-prosperous-america/attack-ad-says-rand-paul-supports-obama-iran-negot/	On the same day Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced his intention to run for president, a political action committee released an ad attacking him for his foreign policy views, claiming that Paul sides with President Barack Obama on Iran. "The Senate is considering tough new sanctions on Iran," the ad’s narrator says. "President Obama says he’ll veto them, and Rand Paul is standing with him. Rand Paul supports Obama’s negotiations with Iran, and he doesn’t understand the threat." The TV ad comes from the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, a Republican political action committee, and will run nationwide. The United States and several other world powers reached an agreement with Iran in late March, expected to set in motion a final deal curbing Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, with a June 30 deadline. In a speech officially announcing his 2016 presidential campaign, Paul distanced himself from President Barack Obama’s position on Iran. "Successful negotiations with untrustworthy adversaries are only achieved from a position of strength," Paul said April 7. "The difference between President Obama and myself, he seems to think you can negotiate from a position of weakness." We wanted to know if Paul really does support the ongoing negotiations. We found that, in short, while Paul supports the idea of negotiating with Iran -- as opposed to say, military action -- it’s misleading to equate his position to Obama’s. The current negotiations Paul’s staff and the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America pointed us to the same interview to support their respective sides -- a March 11 interview with NBC’s Matt Lauer. On the one hand, in the interview, Paul critiqued Obama’s current position. He said Congress should be able to review and approve a deal, which might force a tougher agreement. "In doing so, maybe the president will negotiate a more appropriate deal where we actually get Iran to give up their nuclear ambitions," Paul said. On the other hand, Paul said he is "one of the senators who's in favor of negotiations with Iran. I want there to be a peaceful outcome, but I want to strengthen the president's hand." Paul has expressed support for negotiations instead of military action for keeping Iran from getting nuclear weapons for a while now. "I want the outcome to be one that's not war," he said on Fox News in 2013. "I think we've had quite a bit of war in the last decade. I would like to have an outcome where Iran agrees not to have nuclear weapons, but at the same time we have that without having a war." (David Weigel of Bloomberg compiled a timeline of Paul’s Iran positions.) The spokeswoman for the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, Lisa Booth, noted that Paul hasn’t pushed for the new sanctions that some Republicans have promoted. Obama has said he would veto any such bill because of the possibility that it could derail negotiations. At a January Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Paul seemed to align with Obama on this point. "As we move forward, I've been one who says new sanctions in the middle of negotiations is a huge mistake and may well break up the sanctions coalition, may well drive Iran away from the table," he said. But the fact that Paul and Obama have similar views on this particular point does not mean that Paul supports Obama’s negotiations with Iran as a whole. Another segment from Paul’s remarks at the hearing better outlines his position -- that he’ll wait and see before passing judgment on the substance of the deal, but also that he wants Congress to have some say. "There's several of us on this side who do not blanketly (sic) say, no, we will not vote to approve an agreement," he said. "But we want (the White House) to know that (members of Congress) have the right to vote to it, so you come talk to us." The fact that Paul believes any deal needs to go through Congress is a pretty big difference between his and Obama’s positions. Paul recently signed the letter from 47 Republican senators to Iranian leaders informing them that Congress or a future president could scrap any deal reached this year. It’s hard to argue that a senator who signed that letter supports Obama’s policies, considering the administration and Democrats loudly criticized the letter, saying it was counterproductive to the negotiations. Additionally, Paul is a cosponsor of pending legislation that would require Congress to review any deal with Iran -- legislation opposed by the White House. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the bill, if passed, "could potentially interfere with the ongoing negotiations." "To say that Sen. Paul supports the administration's ‘go at it alone’ effort with the negotiations in Iran is a blatant distortion of his record," said Paul spokeswoman Eleanor May, adding that Paul has "consistently attacked" Obama for executive overreach and "weak and inconsistent foreign policy." Paul hasn’t been especially vocal about his views on the outcome of the most recent negotiations, concluded at the end of March. In fact, his first statement came just on April 6 -- and it shows neither outright support nor criticism. "We don't know the details of the deal yet," Doug Stafford, a spokesman for Paul's PAC, told Bloomberg’s Weigel. "Sen. Paul will be watching closely and believes any deal must make clear Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon, allows for full verification and is approved by Congress. He voted for sanctions both times they were put before Congress and believes only Congress should remove those sanctions." While this isn’t germane to the specific claim we’re checking, we wanted to give some context to a Paul quote included in the ad. The ad has audio of Paul saying, "It’s ridiculous to think that (Iran is) a threat to our national security." This quote came from a 2007 interview with right-wing radio host Alex Jones, where he spoke out against military hawks that he said were interested in invading Iran. Needless to say, Paul has changed up his rhetoric on this point in the last eight years. In 2013, he said the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons was "the most pressing issue of the day." Our ruling An ad attacking Paul said, "Rand Paul supports Obama's negotiations with Iran." The nugget of truth here is that Paul has expressed support for the idea of negotiating with Iran. Additionally, he has not outwardly critiqued nor praised the substance of the Obama administration’s ongoing negotiations. However, Paul believes Congress should play a role in approving any deal, a notable difference from Obama’s position. Paul differs from some other Republicans who unequivocally oppose the ongoing negotiations, but this difference isn’t enough to say he supports Obama. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-14379	"Here in Pennsylvania, the annual cost for infant childcare is over $10,000 per child, which is more than most families pay in rent and almost the same cost as in-state college tuition."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/18/katie-mcginty/child-care-pennsylvania-more-expensive-rent-and-co/	Working class families need more support for child care costs, according to Katie McGinty, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate and Tom Wolf’s former chief of staff. In her recently released "Agenda for Working Women and Working Families," she threw support behind the Sen. Bob Casey-sponsored Child CARE Act, a measure that would beef up tax credits for low-income parents to help with make early childhood programs more affordable. McGinty’s agenda offers figures to back her rationale: "Here in Pennsylvania, the annual cost for infant childcare is over $10,000 per child, which is more than most families pay in rent and almost the same cost as in-state college tuition." The senate candidate’s figures on child care, rent and tuition all hail from a Child Care Aware of America report released this past December. The following are the yearly averages provided in this report for Pennsylvania: Sending a toddler to daycare ($10,640) is 20 percent less expensive than sending a kid off to college to a state four-year institution ($13,246), but indeed costs more than a year of rent ($9,780). But where did Child Care Aware of America, a consumer education network, get their numbers from exactly? The estimates for child care costs they tabulated themselves, culling data from local chapters nationwide, sourcing market surveys from state departments of human services and adjusting for inflation when applicable, in Pennsylvania’s case, for figures from 2012. But with that said, Kait Gillis, press secretary for the state Department of Human Services, said in an email that the department is "comfortable with that number." The report says it pulls its rental estimate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey, and the tuition price from the 2013 College Board "Trends in College Pricing" report. However, these are not where the numbers are from, a Child Care Aware of America researcher confirms. The correct College Board trends report sourced was the 2014 edition. Annualized rent came not from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but a 2013 Census monthly estimate. Cross-referencing with the accurate sources shows that these numbers were recorded exactly in the report. The five-figure expense of early childhood programs may come as a surprise, but according to economics reporter Jordan Weissmann, the enrollment costs have been scaling upward since the ’80s. In a report for Slate last year, Weissmann debunks an earlier inkling of his: That tight government regulations on educator ratios and facility size might be causing costs to rise. Studies prove otherwise, he wrote. "It’s fairly simple. You have to pay human beings to watch over kids. And while child care workers aren’t paid especially well, they do have to be paid," explained Weissmann. "If you look at sample budgets for day care centers, or talk to people in the industry, they’ll tell you that, aside from real estate, most of the costs boil down to labor." Our ruling McGinty said, "Here in Pennsylvania, the annual cost for infant childcare is over $10,000 per child, which is more than most families pay in rent and almost the same cost as in-state college tuition." Average infant childcare costs in Pennsylvania do surpass rent prices, as McGinty accurately states. The questionable portion of this claim is the comparison between child care and college tuition and whether these prices are "almost the same." Average college tuition for public colleges in the Keystone state is 20 percent higher -- not the largest difference, but still significant, especially to lower-income families.

pomt-02029	"Marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco."	true	/oregon/statements/2014/jun/04/earl-blumenauer/marijuana-less-addictive-both-alcohol-and-tobacco/	Marijuana use, both recreationally and medicinally, is a glowing dot on the nation’s political radar screen. Two states, Washington and Colorado, voted to legalize recreational use of the drug last year, and other states are contemplating following. The same is true in Oregon, where as many as three marijuana-related initiatives may be heading toward the November ballot. The claim: U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, on his official website, makes clear where he stands. The Oregon Democrat supports legislation that would allow states to enact marijuana laws without federal interference, remove the ban on industrial hemp and "allow the marijuana industry to operate in a normal business environment." Among the claims tucked under the heading "The Facts about Marijuana" is this: "Marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco." Plenty has been written about all three substances, but with Oregon possibly facing one or more pot measures on the ballot this November, we decided to see if Blumenauer is right about marijuana’s addictive qualities. The analysis: We emailed Blumenauer’s office to ask about its sources for the claim. Spokesman Patrick Malone responded with a statement saying in part, "We certainly always need more research on marijuana and its medicinal properties," but he offered no sourcing. Next we dug into PolitiFact’s database and found several claims that, while not precisely on point, added to our understanding. In one, John Morgan, the high-profile Florida attorney leading an effort to legalize medical marijuana in the Sunshine State, said "nobody’s addicted" to marijuana. When contacted by PolitiFact, Morgan corrected himself, saying, "It was a huge mistake. I’m sorry and I messed up." Experts contacted for that story agreed that marijuana can be addictive. Morgan’s claim was rated False. In another, a pro-pot group, also in Florida, claimed marijuana is "less toxic" than alcohol. The claim was rated Mostly True. Finally, there was a claim in Massachusetts that "today’s marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than the pot of yesteryear." It was rated True. So, yes, marijuana can be addictive; yes, it’s less toxic than alcohol; and, yes, it’s far stronger than previous strains of the drug. We called Dr. J. Wesley Boyd, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and a recognized expert on addiction issues. Narrowly construed, he said, what Blumenauer posted on his website is correct -- marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco. "But like a lot of things," Boyd added, "the question is much more complicated than that. There are a lot of gray areas to all of this." First, there’s the definition of "addictive," since that’s the key to Blumenauer’s claim. "For me," Boyd said, "when someone is addicted to something, they feel a strong compulsion to use that substance even in the face of known harms that the substance causes them." And marijuana is addictive, he said. Boyd cited research from the National Institute on Drug Abuse showing that about 9 percent of those who use marijuana become addicted. (Estimates from research suggest that 32 percent of tobacco users and 15 percent of alcohol users become addicted, according to the NIDA.) However, when it comes to withdrawal, alcohol is by far the worst of the three, he said. If someone is truly addicted to alcohol and tries to stop, Boyd said, the symptoms can be profound: heart and pulse rates through the roof, overwhelming anxiety, seizures and, in rare instances, "a slim but possible chance of dying." What about tobacco? "It’s far closer to marijuana in terms of physical effects," he said. "In both instances, regular users can feel, from a psychological standpoint, remarkably uncomfortable. Cravings, sleep disturbances and depression are common." Other research confirmed what most people already know about the toll tobacco exacts on health. Smoking costs society at least $289 billion annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the lead federal agency for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control. There are no comparable figures for marijuana. We consulted three other sources, all of which agreed that marijuana is the lesser of addictive evils when compared with tobacco. In addition to a 2008 report issued by a British research foundation, both Dr. Neal L. Benowitz of the University of California at San Francisco and Dr. Jack E. Henningfield of the National Institute on Drug Abuse ranked marijuana below nicotine when it comes to withdrawal, dependence, tolerance and intoxication. Both Benowitz and Henningfield, in their rankings, determined that users get hooked on alcohol and tobacco faster than marijuana, and that, when it comes to quitting, marijuana is far easier to put down than either a cigarette or a bottle. The ruling: U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., posts a "drug fact" on his official website asserting that "marijuana is less addictive than both alcohol and tobacco." Though Blumenauer’s office provided no sourcing for the claim, the congressman’s website provides links to a number of studies. A Harvard Medical School psychiatrist agreed that of the three, alcohol is the most addictive in terms of withdrawal. He and other experts we contacted also agreed that alcohol and tobacco are more difficult to give up than marijuana, and said it’s easier to become dependent on alcohol and tobacco in the first place. We rate the claim True. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this article.	None	Earl Blumenauer	None	None	None	2014-06-04T17:44:45	2014-05-15	['None']
pomt-06899	The House passed "cut, cap and balance" with "bipartisan support."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/26/john-boehner/bipartisan-support-cut-cap-and-balance-john-boehne/	During back-to-back primetime addresses on July 25, 2011, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner each made his case on how to proceed on raising the debt ceiling. Each tried to portray himself as the voice of reason in the debate. Boehner, who leads the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, said that he was only trying to carry out the will of the people. "What we told the president in January was this: The American people will not accept an increase in the debt limit without significant spending cuts and reforms," Boehner said. "And over the last six months, we’ve done our best to convince the president to partner with us to do something dramatic to change the fiscal trajectory of our country ... something that will boost confidence in our economy, renew a measure of faith in our government, and help small businesses get back on track. "Last week, the House passed such a plan, and with bipartisan support. It’s called the 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' Act. It cuts and caps government spending and paves the way for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which we believe is the best way to stop Washington from spending money it doesn’t have. Before we even passed the bill in the House, the president said he would veto it." Boehner's description of "Cut, Cap and Balance" passing with "bipartisan support" got the attention of a lot of our readers, who tweeted and e-mailed us to urge us to fact-check the statement. Reader reaction was enhanced by an interview a few hours earlier between Sen. Mike Lee, a tea party supporter and Republican from Utah, and Chris Matthews of MSNBC. When Lee said the bill passed the House in bipartisan fashion, Mathhews forcefully objected. Here's the slightly edited transcript. (Watch the exchange online.) Matthews: "What's this bipartisan thing you're talking about? I didn't see that there. It was overwhelmingly a party-line vote." Lee: "Overwhelmingly, but we had five Democrats who voted with us." Matthews: "It was a party-line vote. Let's call it what it is. It was a party-line vote, sir. Let's not start with nonsense here. It was a party-line vote in the House. Fair enough. Your party controls the House. You passed it. It wasn't a bipartisan vote." Lee: "We have five Democratic votes. Last time I checked, when you have Democrats voting with Republicans, that's bipartisan." Matthews: "You're talking to the American people on my show, and are trying to tell me this horse and rabbit stew of 234, five of whom are Democrats, is a bipartisan vote? Anybody watching now knows that's malarkey." Lee: "Well, look, we can argue about the meaning of bipartisan..." Matthews: "I'm not arguing -- just speak English here. Do you believe it was a bipartisan vote in the House? ..." Lee: "Chris, what I said was, it had bipartisan support. It had the support of five Democrats. We can argue about the significance of that. But my point is, this is the only piece of legislation anyone has proposed that's made it anywhere in Congress to raise the debt limit. What I'm saying is, we are trying to do this. We cannot be accused, we as Republicans, of simply wanting for the debt limit deadline to arrive without us raising the debt limit." So was the vote in the House "bipartisan"? Let's take a closer look at the vote. The measure passed 234 to 190, largely along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats opposed. But five Democrats sided with Republicans to back the bill, and nine Republicans joined the Democrats in opposition to the bill. We should note that two prominent Republicans running for president -- Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, -- opposed "cut, cap and balance" because they said it didn't go far enough. What Boehner said was nothing new. Members of both parties have been using the "bipartisan" line about bills with minimal cross-party support for years. Consider this 2003 account in National Journal, in which a Republican lobbyist bemoaned the possibility that Rep. Ralph Hall -- a very conservative Texas Democrat -- could lose his seat due to redistricting. The lobbyist noted that Hall's willingness to co-sponsor Republican bills, often as the only Democrat to do so, provided lawmakers and lobbyists "with an elusive and highly useful talking point: that their bill is "bipartisan.'" The GOP lobbyist told the magazine that "labeling something 'bipartisan' absolutely helps, no matter who the Democrat is." (Hall survived redistricting, became a Republican and remains in Congress.) Democrats have used exactly the same trick. Back in 2009, Obama said that a Senate committee had approved an early version of health care reform with "both Democratic and Republican support." Because the measure got one Republican vote out of 23 on the committee, we rated that Barely True. When we contacted longtime observers of Congress, they agreed that there's a venerable tradition of attaching the "bipartisan" badge to legislation with only the thinnest support from the opposite party. "To paraphrase Bill Clinton, it all depends on the meaning of 'bipartisan,'" said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "My definition would be healthy numbers, not necessarily majorities, and not necessarily equally drawn, from both parties. To call 'bipartisan' a measure that gets five Democrats -- less than 3 percent of the party in the House -- is a huge stretch, though part of a longstanding tradition." U.S. Senate historian Donald Ritchie said the contemporary usage of the term "bipartisan" reflects long-term transformations in the two parties. "Back in the 1970s, both parties had liberal and conservative wings," he said. "There were as many Eisenhower Republicans as there were Goldwater Republicans. The Democrats had a small but powerful conservative wing, consisting of Southern Democrats who chaired the major committees. No one expected either caucus to vote together. Instead the conservatives in both parties voted together against the moderates and liberals in both parties, so almost all votes were bipartisan, usually with substantial numbers in both camps." This began to change in the 1980s, Ritchie said, with Republicans replacing Democrats in the southern states and Democrats replacing moderate Republicans in northern states. Today, he said, "party-line votes have become common rather than exceptional. As a result, whenever one or more members cross the line either way, it gets called "bipartisan.'" So where does this leave us? Boehner was technically correct that some Democrats voted for the "Cut, Cap and Balance" bill, and, following longstanding Congressional tradition, that enabled him to dub the bill "bipartisan." But in speaking to a wider audience -- a national television address -- we think many viewers would be led to believe that the bill in fact had a significant degree of Democratic support, when in fact it did not. This strikes us as just as misleading as Obama's earlier claim about the health care vote in committee. So we're giving it the same rating: Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15341	"25 percent of federal inmates are noncitizens."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/10/larry-oconnor/conservative-host-noncitizens-are-25-federal-inmat/	Crime by immigrants was brought front and center after a man who had been deported five times was charged with killing a young woman in San Francisco on July 1. The debate reached a fever pitch on the Fox News show Real Story with Gretchen Carlson. Carlson paired former Clinton campaign adviser Simon Rozenberg with conservative talker and IJReview.com editor Larry O’Connor. In the span of two minutes, the two talked over each other about so-called sanctuary cities, border control and the Obama administration track record on deportations. In the middle of this verbal melee -- Carlson interjected with "Let me take control of this" -- O’Connor said "25 percent of federal inmates are noncitizens." Rozenberg insisted O’Connor’s facts were wrong. O’Connor insisted otherwise. We thought we’d see what the data say. O’Connor pointed us to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website and the numbers there fully support his statement. As of the end of May 2015, 23.4 percent of the inmates (a total of 48,470) are not U.S. citizens. The largest share by far, 16 percent are Mexican, as this pie chart from the bureau shows. That would seem to wrap things up neatly, but another division of the Justice Department has quite different numbers. According to the most recent report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, O’Connor overshot by about 100 percent. The Justice Department statisticians reported a total of 25,800 noncitizen inmates as of the end of 2013. With about 216,000 prisoners across the board, the non-Americans make up 12 percent of the total population. The time difference (2013 vs. 2015) doesn’t explain a difference of nearly 23,000 inmates. About the same gap was there in 2013, too. So what’s going on? According to Bureau of Prisons spokesman Ed Ross, when the folks at Justice Statistics (BJS) ask the prison folks to report their inmate numbers, they are told to exclude noncitizens housed in privately contracted facilities. "Most of those who are in those contract facilities are deportable aliens," Ross said. "They are convicted of a federal crime and are serving a federal sentence, and when they complete their sentence, we turn them over to ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)." And how many people are in those facilities? About 24,000. So give or take, that’s where the difference is. And according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, roughly 19,000 federal prisoners are behind bars for having violated U.S. immigration law. The bottom line is that the percentages come out different because both agencies have about the same total head count, but when it comes to noncitizens, the Bureau of Prisons includes the people destined for deportation and the Bureau of Justice Statistics does not. So who’s right? Well, it depends on what question you want to answer. If you want to know how many noncitizens are in prison for breaking a law that all citizens must obey -- like not committing murder as in San Francisco -- then you’d probably prefer the lower number from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. If you want to know how many prisoners broke any kind of law, including sneaking across the border, then you’d find the Bureau of Prisons number more useful. Our ruling O’Connor said 25 percent of federal inmates are noncitizens. According to the Bureau of Prisons, that’s pretty much spot on. But it’s important to know that a hefty fraction of those inmates are only in prison for violating immigration laws and are in facilities more or less created to house them. If you take those people out of the equation, you’re looking at about 12 percent of federal inmates. The claim is correct, but it overlooks a significant wrinkle. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-02293	"Glenn Hegar promised to eliminate the property tax."	false	/texas/statements/2014/apr/03/mike-collier/comptroller-candidate-glenn-hegar-favors-ending-pr/	The Democratic nominee for Texas comptroller says the Republican nominee, state Sen. Glenn Hegar of Katy, made a taxing promise. Mike Collier of Houston said in a March 18, 2014, email blast, "Glenn Hegar promised to eliminate the property tax," a step Collier said would trigger the state’s "most outrageous tax increase" ever. Hegar’s alternative to the property tax, Collier wrote, would require sales taxes "to be at least 20 percent -- and possibly as high as 25 percent" to pay for local needs such as "schools and county roads ... water and sewage treatment" and more. For this article, we’re setting aside what happens should property taxes go away. But did Hegar promise to kill property taxes? Broadly, no single official including the comptroller can abolish property taxes, which are levied by cities, counties, school districts and other taxing units. Abolition would take legislation passed into law and maybe a voter-adopted amendment to the Texas Constitution. Republicans including Debra Medina and Raul Torres, among comptroller candidates defeated by Hegar in the 2014 primary, have voiced support for getting rid of property taxes; Medina pitched replacing property taxes with expanded sales taxes as far back as her 2010 gubernatorial bid. In fact, the Texas GOP party platform, adopted at the party’s 2012 convention, says, "We encourage abolishing property taxes (and) shifting the tax burden to a consumption-based tax," as Dale Craymer, president of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, noted in an email exchange with us. As we embarked on this fact check, we noticed Hegar’s campaign website doesn’t discuss property taxes. We also asked for an interview with Hegar about any promise to wipe out property taxes; campaign manager David White told us by email that Hegar wasn’t available on the couple days we inquired. White also said he was unaware of Hegar directly promising to eliminate property taxes. White emailed us an excerpt from Hegar’s Dec. 31, 2013, response to a questionnaire from the Dallas Morning News in which Hegar referred to "an antiquated system of property tax collection. While I prefer a shift to more of a consumption-based tax system, (I) know that we are many years away from being able to implement such." Collier spokesman Jason Stanford, asked for evidence of such a Hegar promise, emailed us Hegar’s Jan. 20, 2014, answers to a Collin County Conservatives questionnaire and a Feb. 5, 2014, Killeen Daily Herald/Temple Daily Telegram news story on GOP comptroller candidates’ Feb. 4, 2014, debate in Salado. Neither showed Hegar promising to abolish property taxes, but both described his support for gradually reaching that goal. "I support a shift from the property tax toward a consumption tax system. I believe a consumption tax is the fairest, most transparent tax system," Hegar wrote in the questionnaire. (Consumption taxes are those levied when a person spends money on a product or service.) According to the news story on the Salado debate, Hegar, Medina and Torres all "said they were in favor of completely phasing out property taxes." Stanford also pointed us to a video clip the Collier campaign posted online, which it also began using in a video ad that debuted April 1, that comes from the Jan. 6, 2014, meeting of a Longview tea party group. Collier’s website links to a longer video recording of the event, posted to YouTube by the Longview group. Here’s our transcript of two property-tax answers from Hegar, bolding the words Collier included in his video ad: Audience member: I would just like to know your thoughts on ending the property tax and replacing it with something along the lines of a consumption tax or something, so we can finally own our property? Hegar: That -- well, you took the words with your last statement: so you can own your property. Because you really don’t. The government owns it. The question is how much do you pay rent. I tell you, I don’t like the property tax, never have. I think we should replace it. The best thing to replace it with is a consumption-type tax, sales tax per se. I was up -- I was talking to somebody the other day about it, and the question is, is what would that number be. Oh, I know what it was: I got it on a questionnaire, one of the tea party groups. And they said, ‘Well, what steps do you take?’ and I said, ‘Steps? You just do it.’ That’s the only way you get there. You know, I know the votes have not been in the Legislature a few sessions ago in order to try to get rid of it. But the fact is as comptroller, I have said numerous times -- or, running as -- that is the only fair way. Because the question is, who pays? Everybody pays. And you actually, when you buy that loaf of bread or whatever be it, you pay the tax and guess what? You get to walk away with the bread. You don’t have to bring the last four loaves back. And that’s kind of what it is with your property. … Different audience member: … There’s a lot of people my age that aren’t going to own property any time soon, so what kind of -- what do you have to say to them? That they have to pay, we have to pay higher taxes on the things we consume? But we don’t own property. Hegar: Well to me, it’s still a fairness, I mean you’re, you’re here in Texas and so the fact is is you pay sales tax today. You pay a portion of the tax. But you may not pay all of it, and so should we favor one set of folks because they may not own property versus other people? No, the fact is, is the landowners, if you look at local property, as in a school district, they’re paying half of it. Well, why shouldn’t it be distributed among everybody and not just based only on the landowners? And you treat all landowners the same; you don’t pick and choose winners and losers. (Applause.) I mean I -- I just think -- and the reason I said earlier is, you know, business, people, you fill in, Texans should succeed on their own merits and you shouldn’t be picking winners and losers, and that winners and losers, if that means that younger people because they don’t own their home, then that puts a greater burden on them, and compare the current system, maybe it does, but it’s fair. That’d be my personal opinion. Stanford told us that by using the phrase "Just do it," Hegar "may not have said the words ‘I promise,’ but he explained how he would" eliminate property taxes. Another tea party video the Collier campaign is publicizing shows Hegar both describing obstacles and spelling out the role he would take. Collier says on his website the video shows Hegar proposing a sales tax rate of up to 18.5 percent to cover cuts in property taxes. In the full interview, posted online Dec. 31, 2013, by the Montgomery County Tea Party, Hegar said that in replacing the property tax with a sales tax, "the hardest question to answer for the Legislature that puts it into place, No. 1, is obviously getting the votes to do it." After that, "then the biggest question is, is that one (tax) that you broaden the base, as in what is taxable for consumption, or is it the rate? And that’s where the numbers get really hard," he said. "Maybe you’ve heard wild percentages." Starting with the existing state sales tax of 6.25 percent plus local sales tax of up to 2 percent, Hegar said, "does that go up 3 percent, 18 percent? Up to 18.5 percent, some numbers have been out. But the question is how wide and how broad is that. And that’s where the Legislature has seemed to get caught up." Asked how the comptroller could influence legislators, Hegar told the tea-party group, "I think the comptroller’s role should use more of what’s called a dynamic fiscal note," a type of report that he said can be used to show the opportunities presented by a tax cut, such as eliminating property taxes, rather than only presenting its negative effect on state revenues. The note is "something that I would definitely utilize," he said. Our ruling Collier said, "Glenn Hegar promised to eliminate the property tax." Hegar has said that as comptroller, he would "definitely" use a dynamic fiscal note to encourage the policy change, but he also has spoken about the difficulties of reaching an approach that wins legislative favor. We rate Collier’s statement as False.	None	Mike Collier	None	None	None	2014-04-03T14:00:00	2014-03-18	['None']
pomt-05745	"Invested $90 million in traffic fixes without raising taxes."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/02/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-lists-accomplishment-invested-90-m/	Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell, seeking re-election in May, invited residents to the grand opening of his campaign headquarters in a mailer touting accomplishments such as luring jobs to Austin -- and investing "$90 million in traffic fixes without raising taxes." We were curious about Leffingwell’s proclaimed investment in "traffic fixes." His campaign consultant, Mark Littlefield, said Leffingwell’s declaration reflected voter approval in November 2010 of Proposition 1, authorizing $90 million in bonds to be issued to pay for Austin road, sidewalk, trail and bikeway projects. Let’s briefly check the tax part of the claim and then turn to accounting for "traffic fixes." Littlefield told us the approved bonds aren’t expected to require higher taxes because future city revenues for debt are projected to cover their costs. In a telephone interview, Greg Canally, the city’s deputy chief financial officer, confirmed the costs will be covered without changing the city’s debt tax rate of a little under 13 cents per $100 valuation. "Anything above (the approved) $90 million, we would have had to look at a tax rate increase," Canally said. A sampling of the bond amounts and 30 or so projects that voters approved: -- $1 million for new Wild Horse Street in far northeast Austin; -- $2 million for Slaughter Lane extension; -- $2.3 million to reconfigure the Interstate 35/East 51st Street interchange; -- $2.7 million for Waller Creek trail improvements; -- $4.4 million for sidewalks, neighborhood matching funds; -- $10 million for Americans with Disabilities Act sidewalk improvements; -- $14.4 million to build a boardwalk as part of the Lady Bird Lake hike-and-bike trail. And each of the projects is a "traffic fix," as Leffingwell says? Well, not all the projects would improve or build roads. According to an Austin American-Statesman news story published Oct. 24, 2010, before the election, 57 percent of the proposed spending was described as going to road work with 43 percent identified as backing projects related to alternative forms of transportation such as biking and walking. That story quotes Leffingwell as saying: "We have to start thinking about transportation as a system, a system that's connected, compatible, complementary. We can't think strictly in terms of 'We need more roads.'" Even that split was in question, the Statesman said in the story. The 57 percent statistic touted by proposition supporters, the story said, counted one project that could increase congestion on a downtown street. This item reflected $8 million penciled in to make over seven blocks of Third Street by converting three existing one-way lanes with parallel parking often on both sides into two one-way lanes with sidewalks nearly doubled in width, plus bike lanes as part of the Lance Armstrong Bikeway. "One less lane for cars, in other words," the story said, "and perhaps fewer parking spaces." The story said too that the 57 percent calculation folded in $2.7 million in the bond proposal for "traffic calming" -- which slows down cars -- and spending to put in place "quiet zones" at railway crossings so trains don't have to blow their horns. At least $38.7 million of the $90 million was to go to sidewalks, bike lanes and other projects for the benefit of pedestrians and cyclists, the story said. "That's in contrast with transportation lists put before voters between 1992 and 2006," the story continued. "Under those proposals, all approved by voters, the city spent between 87 percent and 100 percent on road projects." Asked if the 57 percent of city-identified road projects adds up to Leffingwell’s touted "traffic fixes," Leffingwell’s consultant, Littlefield, replied by email: "We can fix traffic two ways, right? We can build more lanes or we can get people out of their cars. I think that was the best part about Prop 1 — it attempted to rethink traffic solutions." In a telephone interview, Leffingwell agreed he did not personally invest $90 million in traffic fixes. His mailer was vague on this, listing among his accomplishments: "Invested $90 million in traffic fixes without raising taxes." Leffingwell told us: "Obviously, it was ultimately the voters that invested $90 million," though he pointed out that he led the group that advocated for voter approval after encouraging the Austin City Council to put the proposed bonds on the ballot. "I’m contending the whole thing is traffic fixes," all $90 million worth, Leffingwell said. "A traffic fix is something that in some way or another makes mobility better than it was before." Leffingwell said his Webster’s dictionary defines traffic as the "movement of vehicles and pedestrians." Merriam-Webster.com includes this definition of traffic: "the movement (as of vehicles or pedestrians) through an area or along a route," though the entry also includes this definition: "congestion of vehicles," as in "stuck in traffic." And who in fast-growing Austin hasn’t been stuck in traffic? According to research by the Texas Transportation Institute, based at Texas A&M University, Austin and Orlando in 2010 ranked fourth among 32 large urban areas for annual hours of delay in traffic per auto commuter, at 38. A footnote says this figure reflects extra travel time in an area during the year divided by the number of people who commute in private vehicles. In another institute comparison of the situation in similarly sized areas, Austin ranked No. 1 for its 2010 travel time index of 1.28, meaning the ratio of travel time in the peak period to the travel time at free-flow conditions. A footnote says a value of 1.30 indicates a 20-minute free-flow trip takes 26 minutes in the peak period. We asked Leffingwell if each of the projects referenced in his claim was expected to relieve car traffic congestion. For non-road projects such as bike paths and sidewalks, he said: "It’s intuitive; if people have other options for mobility, then that impacts (car) traffic to some degree." And so how much is each of the projects expected to relieve vehicular congestion? "I don’t think anybody has that number," Leffingwell said. If not, then how does the city know each project would do so? Leffingwell said he’d have to check with city staff. On our own, we asked the city for information on the impact on vehicular traffic congestion of each of the voter-approved projects. One of 11 factors that helped determine which projects were put on the ballot was tied to the "person capacity added" by each project. We learned, though, of no direct assessments of the effect of each project on vehicular traffic congestion. For outside-of-Austin perspective on "traffic fixes," we turned to Tim Lomax, a senior engineer at the transportation institute, who told us in a telephone interview that depending on circumstances including location, a bikeway or sidewalk project can be counted on to alleviate car congestion. "It all comes down to the people who might use that sidewalk," Lomax said. "What are they doing now? Does the sidewalk (or other project) offer what people will choose?" In Texas, he noted, brutal summer heat sways many residents to avoid walks. Lomax said he and other engineers would accept "traffic fixes" as a term that encompasses road and other types of mobility projects — which would be in alignment with Leffingwell’s interpretation. But, Lomax said, "most of my non-Ph.D. traffic-engineer friends would think of (a traffic fix) as a road project." Our ruling We see the hope that every one of the $90 million in voter-approved projects will, one way or another, prove a "traffic fix." That’s almost surely correct by the broad definition of traffic touted by Leffingwell. But it’s also reasonable to assume that "traffic fix" refers to cars and trucks on roads -- and less than 60 percent of the mayor’s cited "fixes" would improve or build roads. Finally, Leffingwell’s mailer can be read as his claiming all credit for the $90 million in projects, when that credit should be spread among many parties including city staff members, City Council members and, especially, voters who supported the 2010 proposition. We rate Leffingwell’s claim Half True.	None	Lee Leffingwell	None	None	None	2012-03-02T11:07:35	2012-02-18	['None']

In the last two weeks, multiple fake news sites have written stories claiming that the FBI has a warrant out for Obama’s arrest stemming from allegations he wiretapped Trump’s phones. "FBI issues Warrant For Obama’s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap," read the headlines on multiple fake news sites. Facebook flagged several claims as part of its efforts to weed out fake news from its news feeds. These stories don’t have a grain of truth. There’s no warrant out for Obama’s arrest, and he’s definitely not getting arrested by the FBI. We’ve also found no evidence to support Trump’s claim that the wiretapping even took place. Most of the stories are all essentially identical, saying that Obama will be "picked up by" the FBI sometime today or be charged with unlawful use of authority for ordering an illegal wiretap on the phones in Trump Tower. The stories also quote a "spokesman" for the FBI, Todd McMartin, who supposedly told Fox News: "The proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton’s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can’t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so." It’s pretty obvious that quote is made up, though. This story about Obama’s arrest is originally from a site full of faux news stories, TheLastLineOfDefense.org. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t identify the warrant story as fake, but the About Us page notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."

pomt-00375	"While we were in harm’s way in uniform, Kyrsten Sinema was protesting us in a pink tutu and denigrating our service."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2018/sep/10/martha-mcsally/did-arizonas-kyrsten-sinema-protest-troops-pink-tu/	Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally in a campaign ad paints herself as a stark contrast with Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, her Democratic opponent in the race for Arizona’s open seat in the U.S. Senate. Side-by-side pictures show McSally in military uniform and Sinema in a pink tutu. The ad highlights McSally’s service as a U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and portrays Sinema as unpatriotic and out-of-touch with global threats. McSally’s Aug. 23 campaign ad said: "Everyone remembers where they were on 9/11. I was deployed to the Middle East. Led airstrikes against the Taliban and was the first woman to fly a fighter jet in combat. I know the price of freedom. "While we were in harm’s way in uniform, Kyrsten Sinema was protesting us in a pink tutu and denigrating our service. The world is a dangerous place. We need strong leaders who understand the threat and respect our troops. Kyrsten Sinema fails the test." PolitiFact wondered about McSally’s claim that Sinema protested troops in a pink tutu, "denigrating our service." McSally retired from the Air Force in 2010 after 26 years of military service that included six deployments to the Middle East and Afghanistan. Sinema was a law student at the time who participated in a series of vigils and anti-war protests in Arizona. In at least one of those instances, she wore what looks like a pink tutu. The 2003 event coincided with Women’s International Day, included live music and dancing, and other attendees also wore pink outfits. Sinema described the event as "an expression of creativity and of self." Sinema’s pink tutu photo has been used against her in previous races for public office, and it’s a real photo. But we didn’t find evidence that Sinema denigrated the service of military members, as McSally’s ad claimed. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Screenshot from McSally for Senate campaign ad. Sinema’s anti-war protests Sinema was a law student at Arizona State University when she was quoted in student newspaper articles as an organizer of protests against the Iraq, which former President George W. Bush ordered March 19, 2003. Six days earlier, an article detailed Sinema’s participation in a Phoenix rally called "No War! A Celebration of Life and Creativity" that coincided with International Women's Day. "Flurries of pink — the color of International Women's Day — highlight the shirts and skirts and socks of demonstrators," the article said. The article said Sinema wore "a neon-pink shirt and something resembling a pink tutu." Sinema told the newspaper, "You protest when you feel like you're not being heard. To make yourself heard, you have to do something out of the ordinary. There, inherently, is this expression of creativity that comes with protests, so you can say, 'I am important. I am a human.'" The articles don’t quote Sinema as saying anything specifically against the troops. Her comments center on Bush’s policy. "Since Bush has taken office, he has rolled back civil liberties and provoked war against Iraq. We couldn't not protest," Sinema said in a September 2002 student newspaper article. Other media reports from early 2000s The Arizona Republic published a story in February 2002 about silent vigils in Phoenix against war and the abuse of women worldwide. Sinema is quoted as saying that the vigils will continue "til there's no more war." The story also quotes an ASU professor as saying that the vigils seek to raise awareness about the victims of war, which included the poor, women and "yes, soldiers." The Arizona Republic included the voice an 18-year-old who was planning to enlist in the Marine Corps. "Everybody has their own opinion," Steve Sullivan told the newspaper. "I'm not offended at all. It's great they come out and protest." Sinema told the Associated Press for a story on anti-war protesters that a lot of people were worried about the future and felt isolated. "We just want people who are sad, upset, devastated or confused about the war to have a place to meet and be comforted by other people who feel the same way," Sinema said in March 2003. Sinema campaign responds Sinema’s campaign today says she also supported U.S. troops. "Kyrsten has always supported our service members," Helen Hare, a spokeswoman for Sinema’s campaign told PolitiFact. "Reporting from the time confirms that while she spoke out against the war, she also voiced her respect for those who serve — like the members of her family." The photo in question is from a 2003 protest, it did not happen on 9/11, contrary to what the ad may imply, her campaign said. Sinema’s campaign also pointed to an Arizona Republic March 2003 article about vigils in opposition to the Iraq war. Sinema told the newspaper that they wanted "to respect and honor those who would be killed. We want those lives to not be sacrificed." Sinema’s campaign said that her older brother enlisted in the Marines in 1991 and left active duty in 1999; and her younger brother enlisted in the Navy in 2005 and is still on active duty. Sinema has also voted in favor of bills authorizing funding for the military and pay raises for troops, and co-sponsored bills to help veterans receive benefits, her campaign said. Sinema’s positions on military force Sinema was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2012. As she campaigned for that seat, she told The Hill in a May 2012 article that while her views had evolved, her approach to dealing with global conflicts had not. "She said she favors aggressive diplomacy, crippling sanctions to combat proliferation, and swift, multilateral intervention as a last resort," the Hill reported. The Hill story said that in April 2006, Sinema in an online social justice group wrote: "I have always and will always continue to oppose war in all its forms." But in her interview with The Hill, she said: "You should never take military intervention off the table. When you do so, you give an out to a rogue nation or rogue actors." For instance, Sinema called for military intervention in places such as Sudan, citing genocide, and wished U.S. troops had intervened earlier in Rwanda and in World War II, The Hill reported. In September 2015, Sinema was among 25 House Democrats who voted against a resolution to approve the Iran nuclear deal. Former President Barack Obama about a month earlier had said that rejection of the deal "leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option — another war in the Middle East." Sinema told The Huffington Post after the September vote that it was "hyperbole" and "not necessarily true" that being against the deal meant choosing war. "I’m frustrated by these false dichotomies," she said. Our ruling McSally in a campaign ad said, "While we were in harm’s way in uniform, Kyrsten Sinema was protesting us in a pink tutu and denigrating our service." McSally retired from the Air Force in 2010 after 26 years of military service. After 9/11, Sinema led protests against the war in Iraq. At a 2003 rally called "No War! A Celebration of Life and Creativity," Sinema wore a pink tutu. Media reports of the rallies in 2002 and 2003 quote Sinema as opposing the war and the Bush administration’s policy, but we found no evidence of her disparaging troops. McSally’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. --- Editor’s note, Sept. 18, 2018: The Senate Leadership Fund and Defend Arizona contacted us after publication to point out that CNN published a story on Sept. 15 saying that a group led by Sinema in the early 2000s distributed anti-war flyers, including one that depicted a soldier as a skeleton. Text in that flyer said, "You can help us push back U.S. terror in Iraq and the Middle East." The Senate Leadership Fund said this was evidence showing the accuracy of McSally’s claim. Sinema’s campaign told CNN, however, that Sinema did not approve or design the flyers. The flyers were not used in McSally's ad claiming that Sinema denigrated troops. McSally's campaign did not send PolitiFact the flyers — or any other material — as evidence for the claim. McSally's ad focused on Sinema wearing a tutu. Contemporaneous reporting of the event in which Sinema wore a tutu did not say that Sinema denigrated troops. Given that the flyer is not evidence that Sinema denigrated troops herself, our rating remains the same.	None	Martha McSally	None	None	None	2018-09-10T10:00:00	2018-08-23	['None']

pomt-11499	"A law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a CWP (concealed weapons permit) holder."	false	/florida/statements/2018/feb/23/matt-caldwell/florida-lawmaker-repeats-dodgy-claim-about-crimes-/	Florida State Rep. Matt Caldwell, R-North Fort Myers, appeared on CNN to explain why he and his colleagues voted not to consider a bill to ban assault-style weapons after the horrific high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. During the interview, Caldwell drew upon a favored talking point. "A law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a CWP (concealed weapons permit) holder," Caldwell said Feb. 21. The comment caught our ear and we were curious about the data behind it. We reached out to Caldwell and got no response. His source is most likely number-crunching by John Lott, head of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a group that has written about what it sees as the media’s anti-gun agenda, the need for parishioners to go to church armed, and similar themes. In 2015, Lott compared the rate of crimes committed by police nationwide to permit revocations in Texas, Florida and Michigan. The numbers on police crime came from a national search of news reports by a team at Bowling Green State University. Lott took the national data and compared it to the fraction of permit holders in Texas who had their permits revoked. Lott worked the data several ways and found a substantial gap. "The rate for police was between 7 to 10 times higher than for permit holders," Lott said. But Lott’s work contains one clear counting flaw. His data on crimes by police came from research by Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University. Stinson told PolitiFact that Lott failed to note that Stimson was reporting the number of cases, not the number of individual officers involved in crimes. "Some officers are arrested more than once, and some arrested officers have more than one arrest case because of multiple victims," Stinson said. "So, the whole analysis is wrong because the rates are mangled by using a different unit of analysis." Lott said he doubts that would make a sufficient difference. "The number of officers committing crimes could be higher or lower, but you’d have to have it be 7 to 10 times lower in order to reverse the ranking." he said. "That doesn’t seem very likely." There’s another counting issue. Two leading researchers questioned Lott’s use of permit revocations to measure crimes by permit holders. "Those data undercount the true number of infractions," said criminologist Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "Think of the process: an infraction occurs, then it must be reported to the police or another legal authority, the police must find it as a crime or infraction that would warrant revocation, and then the revocation must occur." Rosenfeld said instances fall out of the dataset at each step along the way. Lott agreed that national victimization surveys show that relatively small percentages of crimes get reported, even fewer result in an arrest, and a smaller fraction yet lead to conviction. "Revocations won’t capture the full number," he said. "I don’t know how to compare that pattern to police crimes because there are no matching survey data for police. Lott said he believes that police would be less likely than the average permit holder to be caught in a crime, but that is more theory than proven trend. Law professor and statistical analyst John Donohue at Stanford University gave another reason to doubt the link between revocations and crime. In his research, he found a "number of cases where the permit holder was killed while committing a crime and of course those permits are not revoked." Donohue added that much research shows that when the number of police rises, crime goes down. Our ruling Caldwell said that a law enforcement officer is more likely to commit a crime than a concealed weapon permit holder. That is based on shaky numbers. The article behind Caldwell’s statement treated the number of criminal cases involving officers as if it were equal to the number of officers themselves. According to the researcher that looked at those crimes by police, that "mangled" the crime rates of officers. A single officer could be named in many cases. On the flip side of the ledger, other researchers said that using permit revocations undercounts the number of crimes by permit holders. The analyst behind the Caldwell’s statement agreed that it is an imperfect measure. In short, the statement rests on dicey numbers. Those numbers point to the need for more research, but they don’t prove anything. We rate this claim False. Update: After this item published, we heard from John Lott and added his comments.

pomt-10402	When the United States invaded Iraq, Saddam Hussein wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction, and "he said so himself after his capture."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/05/john-mccain/hussein-did-say-he-hoped-to-get-wmd/	Sen. John McCain visited St. Petersburg, Fla., on June 4, 2008, to raise money for his presidential campaign, and sat down with St. Petersburg Times political editor Adam C. Smith for an interview. McCain criticized his opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, as inexperienced, especially in foreign policy. When asked about Obama's early opposition to the Iraq war when others, including McCain, thought it was necessary, McCain defended the invasion, saying the intelligence community believed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Smith pointed out that Florida's Bob Graham, former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, opposed the war, too. "I respect Sen. Graham enormously," McCain said. "But I don't think there's any doubt that Saddam Hussein, who had acquired and used weapons of mass destruction before, had invaded a neighbor, Kuwait, where we had to fight one war with him, that his intent was — and he said so himself after his capture — to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction." Most of what McCain said here has been heavily discussed, but we were intrigued by the very last sentence in McCain's quote, in which he says that Hussein had said after his capture that he intended to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction. True? Among the most definitive records yet produced on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction is a report from the Iraq Survey Group, a group affiliated with the CIA. It released its initial report in 2004 and a concluding addenda in 2005. The report stated that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction during the run-up to the U.S. invasion in 2003. The detailed report, which runs more than 1,000 pages, emphasizes that the story of Iraq's weapons is complex and unfolded over many years. One complicating factor was Hussein's repressive style of leadership, in which he often avoided direct discussion of sensitive military matters. Another was his desire to pursue multiple goals that sometimes conflicted with each other. After the Persian Gulf War of 1991, for example, Hussein very much wanted to present his country as an imposing military presence to avoid invasion by either the United States or Iran. But he also wanted to satisfy weapons inspectors and stop international sanctions that were causing economic problems for his country. The report concluded that Hussein did away with his weapons program in the years after the Persian Gulf War, but deliberately encouraged ambiguity about whether his regime possessed the weapons or not. Hussein believed the threat of weapons would act as a deterrent to Iran and the United States. The report also said that Hussein intended to restart the program after the scrutiny of the international community was off him. Though that prospect could have been years off, Hussein kept weapons experts employed in the country for that purpose. But, what about Hussein's remarks after he was captured? Here's what we know: The Iraq Survey Group interviewed scores of people, including Hussein's top advisers. After his capture in 2003 by the U.S. government, the survey group gained access to information gleaned from Hussein during detention. In 2008, Hussein's interrogator for the group, George Piro of the FBI, gave a lengthy interview to Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes in which he discussed what Hussein said while in custody. Piro, a native Arabic speaker, said that Hussein told him he wanted to pursue weapons of mass destruction again. "What weapons of mass destruction did he intend to pursue again once he had the opportunity?" Pelley asked. "He wanted to pursue all of WMD," Piro said. "So he wanted to reconstitute his entire WMD program." "Chemical, biological, even nuclear?" Pelley asked. "Yes," Piro said. McCain's statement was quite specific: He said Hussein intended to acquire weapons, not that he had them. That's what our review of the evidence shows. Granted, the evidence was compiled by the U.S. intelligence community, the same group that got the weapons question wrong before the invasion. But it's the best record publicly available, and it supports McCain's statement. Hussein told Piro that he did want to pursue weapons of mass destruction someday. So we find McCain's statement to be True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-05T00:00:00	2008-06-04	['United_States', 'Saddam_Hussein', 'Iraq']
pomt-07815	In Texas, "sexting is a felony sex offense for teenagers — that can mean up to 10 years in prison."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/17/whoopi-goldberg/whoopi-goldberg-says-sexting-felony-texas-carrying/	State Sen. Kirk Watson has an ally célèbre in his effort to create a law that would better address "sexting" among teenagers texting nude photos of themselves and others: Whoopi Goldberg, comedian and co-host of ABC’s daytime talk show, The View. "Words I never figured I’d tweet," Watson said on Twitter Feb. 9. "My sexting bill, discussed on The View." Watson linked to video of the previous day’s episode where Goldberg floated his proposal by her co-hosts, Barbara Walters, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd and Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Goldberg said: "There’s a measure on the table in Texas to make teen sexting a Class C misdemeanor, requiring teens to make a court appearance and parents to attend a ‘sext’ education program. Right now, sexting is a felony offense for teenagers — that can mean up to 10 years in prison." Ten years for texting nude photos? ABC spokesman Karl Nilsson pointed us to two news reports on Watson’s measure including a Feb. 7 report by Austin’s KXAN-TV, Channel 36, which appeared on CNN's website Feb. 8. In that report, Watson says prosecutors can either bring sexting cases "under our very strict child pornography laws, or do nothing." Some background: In November, the Austin American-Statesman reported that Watson and Attorney General Greg Abbott were working to allow the prosecution of minors on a Class C misdemeanor charge instead of the third-degree felony charge they now face. In a 2008 survey by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, 22 percent of teenage girls and 18 percent of teenage boys said they had electronically sent or posted online nude or semi-nude photos of themselves. Bill Albert, a spokesman for the Washington-based organization, told us the group hasn’t looked into how often sexting has been prosecuted nationwide. Albert suggested we seek information on the prevalence of prosecutions from Parry Aftab, a New Jersey-based privacy lawyer, who estimated that about 50 sexting cases have cropped up nationally in the last year, but Aftab said the majority were dismissed. Under Watson’s Senate Bill 407, filed Jan. 25, minors could face a year in county jail and up to a $4,000 fine, and judges could order minors and parents to participate in an education program about the social and criminal risks of texting explicit images. No Texas law specifies sexting as a crime. Instead, as Abbott explains on the attorney general’s website, "the owner of a computer or cell phone containing pictures of nude or semi-nude minors can be investigated and prosecuted on felony child pornography charges. Teenagers in possession of sexually suggestive images of classmates or companions under 18 could face up to 10 years in prison." Abbott adds that prosecution is by no means certain: "Of course, investigators and prosecutors consider the circumstances of each case before deciding whether — and which — charges may apply." On Feb. 8, the Statesman reported that Abbott said he was unaware of any Texas teenagers prosecuted under the law. Dayna Blazey, a Travis County assistant district attorney, later echoed Abbott’s rendition of the law; she also had no information on the number of teenage "sexters" who have been prosecuted. Later, Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley told us his office has fielded several sexting claims involving teenagers. He said he couldn’t recall if his office had charged a teenage "sexter" with a felony offense, but said that after working with all parties involved, his office has prosecuted teenage "sexters" with misdemeanor charges that can lead to a fine, sentences of less than a year in jail or both. So, Goldberg is correct that a Texas "sexter" could now end up with a 10-year prison term, but that’s if they’re prosecuted for child pornography — apparently a rare occurrence. Contrary to Goldberg’s declaration, sexting in itself is not a felony in Texas for anyone, including teenagers. We rate Goldberg’s statement as Half True.

pomt-09961	"The Pentagon under the Obama administration has just acknowledged seizing and burning the privately owned Bibles of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/18/pray-jesus-name-project/bibles-sent-soldier-afghanistan-local-distributio/	A video that shows a U.S. soldier at the Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan talking about distributing Bibles to local residents as gifts stirred a great deal of controversy when shown recently as part of a news report by the Arab network Al Jazeera. It rankled a number of Afghan officials in this deeply conservative Islamic community where many already view U.S. forces as Christian crusaders. But it also irked some evangelical Christians in the United States who thought the U.S. military's response unfairly stepped on the religious rights of a Christian soldier. Of particular concern was the fate of the Bibles. Gordon James Klingenschmitt of the Pray in Jesus' Name Project, a former U.S. Navy chaplain, took out an advertisement in Human Events , a conservative publication, with the headline, "BREAKING NEWS: Pentagon Burns Soldiers Bibles - Military Chaplains Attacked." The story begins, "The Pentagon under the Obama administration has just acknowledged seizing and burning the privately owned Bibles of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan." Although the story contains several claims, this is the main one, and the one we are fact-checking here. So let's back up to the beginning. The video in question, shot a year ago by an independent filmmaker, shows a small group of uniformed U.S. soldiers at a prayer service on the base in Bagram. A soldier explains that his local church in the United States collected money and sent him a package of Bibles (which are seen stacked on the floor) printed in the country's main Pashto and Dari languages. The base chaplain quickly notes in the video that the U.S. military policy, U.S. Central Command's General Order No. 1, specifically prohibits active duty troops from "proselytizing any religion, faith, or practice." The soldier then mentions the possibility of distributing the Bibles to locals as gifts. A year later, the video became the centerpiece of a controversial May 4, 2009, story on Al Jazeera that questioned whether some U.S. military had crossed the line into evangelism and proselytizing. The U.S. military claimed the story was misleading. The full edit of the video, said U.S. Defense Department spokesman Lt. Col. Mark Wright, would have shown the chaplain explaining to the soldier that passing out the Bibles to locals was forbidden. "Of course that violates General Order No.1," Wright said. Trying to convert Muslims to another faith is a crime in Afghanistan. So there's the significant matter of the soldier's safety, Wright said. It's also what the military calls a "force protection threat." "There is a very real possibility it could cause a violent backlash," Wright explained. Many in Afghanistan might perceive a soldier handing out Bibles as an organized effort of the U.S. military to try to convert them to Christianity, which would deeply offend the local Muslim people, he said. "It would be a threat to our soldiers and service members' lives. That's the most important reason why proselytizing is forbidden. It's simply too dangerous to our forces." Wright said the Bibles were confiscated and thrown away. And every day, as a matter of course, the garbage on the base is burned. So that's what became of the Bibles. Any impression that there was some sort of formal book-burning is false, he said. Only one copy got out of the room, he said, one given to the independent film crew. "Not one of the Bibles made it off base," Wright said. Asked about the Al Jazeera report in a May 4 Pentagon briefing, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Navy Adm. Mike Mullen said, "It certainly is — from the United States military's perspective — not our position to ever push any specific kind of religion. Period." In his advertisement, Klingenschmitt claimed that statement appeared to "defend the destruction of the soldiers' privately owned Bibles. ... He did not address the possibility that by seizing and burning privately owned Bibles, the Obama administration is now enforcing state atheism upon our troops." We find that last suggestion absurd. Nothing about this episode can be equated to "enforcing" atheism upon our troops. Soldiers are free to practice their religion of choice. And while privately owned, we think it's a stretch to suggest the Bibles were for American troops. They were written in Pashto and Dari languages. And the soldier who received them talked about giving them out in Afghanistan as gifts. But again, we are fact-checking the statement, "The Pentagon under the Obama administration has just acknowledged seizing and burning the privately owned Bibles of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan." The Pentagon under the Obama administration did "just acknowledge" that the Bibles were confiscated. But it's important to note that the prayer meeting video was shot a year ago, and so the Bibles were confiscated and destroyed under the Bush administration. The clear implication of this advertisement is that soldiers aren't allowed to have their own Bibles, but that's not true. The incident in question involved one soldier, not soldiers. The only real issue is when a soldier intends to use his or her Bible to evangalize about Christianity to the local population, a practice that violates a military policy unrelated to who is president. While much of this sentence is technically correct, it clearly is intended to distort. We rate it Half True.

pomt-01769	"We’ve had about 3,000 murders" in connection with lax border security.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/jul/29/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-attributes-3000-murders-immigrants-her/	Greg Abbott, supportive of Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to place up to 1,000 National Guard troops near the Texas-Mexico border, declared the driving issue is public safety. Abbott, the Texas attorney general and 2014 Republican gubernatorial nominee, told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News that some of the "worst of the worst" criminals are coming across the Rio Grande. "We’ve had women and children in the state of Texas who have been sexually assaulted by the people who have come across the border. We’ve had about 3,000 murders," Abbott said in the July 22, 2014 interview. "It is a responsibility of a government to keep their people safe. The federal government has the responsibility of securing our border; they’re not doing it, so the state of Texas will do it." His mention of 3,000 murders, brought to our attention by a reader, aligned with a more specific Perry claim we recently found factually unsupported and ridiculous. But Perry’s source for the figure, the Texas Department of Public Safety, hadn’t said that. By email, Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us the attorney general drew his murder count from the DPS web page, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," separately relied upon by Perry. A criminal alien is a non-citizen convicted of a crime. The DPS page states: "From October 2008 through July 1, 2014, Texas has identified a total of 203,685 unique criminal alien defendants booked into Texas county jails. Over their criminal careers, these defendants are responsible for at least 642,564 individual criminal charges in Texas, mostly consisting of Class B misdemeanors or higher, including 3,070 homicides and 7,964 sexual assaults," the agency says. (After we started looking into Perry’s claim, the entry was tweaked to specify that all the charges occurred in Texas.) Homicide charges account for a sliver of all the criminal charges tabulated by the agency, according to a pie chart on the web page: Source: Web page, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," Texas Department of Public Safety (accessed July 21, 2014) The last line on the page says "these are minimum figures as these numbers include only those aliens whose fingerprints were already in the federal system when they were booked and it does not necessarily include all those who are incarcerated in federal prison." We asked to interview the appropriate agency official about the figures on the web page. By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said: "We don’t have any additional information to add to the website provided." Outside criminologists In checking Perry’s claim, we’d asked criminologists recommended to us by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York how to interpret the DPS-presented information. Notably, the DPS web page doesn’t specify when the 3,070 homicide charges in the criminal histories of all the "alien" individuals arrested in Texas since October 2008 accumulated. By phone, Michael Walker, an adjunct John Jay professor and an expert in how the FBI gathers crime statistics, and Ramiro Martinez, Jr., a Northeastern University professor, each suggested it’s highly unlikely unauthorized residents committed that many homicides in recent years in Texas. Drawing on FBI Uniform Crime Statistics for Texas posted online by the DPS, Walker calculated that from 2008 through 2012, there were 3,903 persons arrested on homicide charges in the state. Walker said it’s not logical that residents in the state without legal permission accounted for most of the same deaths. He conceded, too, he wasn’t able to roll in homicide charges from 2013 and 2014; he didn’t see that data online nor were we successful in eliciting figures from DPS. Martinez offered up his own analysis, which started by averaging the FBI’s tally of a little more than 1,100 homicides in Texas in 2011 and 2012 and extrapolating that over six years to reach an estimated total of nearly 6,700 homicides over most of the period analyzed by DPS. By email, Martinez said that if one assumed unauthorized residents were responsible for 3,000 of all Texas homicides, that would hold them accountable for 46 percent of the estimated total. That, he said, "makes no sense." Martinez said in a follow-up email: "It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed." The criminologists noted another weakness; the DPS presentation mixes recent homicide charges with those that might have been leveled decades ago. Also, they noted, the agency tallied arrests only, not homicide convictions. Martinez also raised an eyebrow at the mingling of criminal charges against legally authorized U.S. residents and individuals in the country without permission, risking conclusions irrelevant to border security today. By the state's approach, he said, it’s possible a homicide charge in the tally involves someone who reached the U.S. from Cuba in 1962 who was later charged with and/or committed a homicide. If so, he said, that charge would bear no relevance to criminal actions by people lately crossing the Rio Grande. Our ruling Abbott told Van Susteren "we’ve had about 3,000 murders" in connection with lax border security. This declaration, it turned out, isn’t substantiated by the cited state presentation which instead indicates 203,000-plus immigrants jailed in Texas in recent years had together accumulated 3,070 homicide charges (not convictions) in their lives. These individuals included people living here with legal permission and people here without authorization. Significantly, the presentation doesn’t show the homicides were committed by non-citizens living here without permission. Also, it’s silent on Abbott’s conclusion the immigrants charged with homicide all entered the country due to the border being easy to cross.

pomt-12890	There has been a "dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/24/sean-spicer/sean-spicers-claim-federal-workforce-has-expanded-/	One of President Donald Trump’s very first acts was to place a hiring freeze on the executive branch, in a promised show of fiscal responsibility. "This memorandum counters (the) dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years," press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in his first-ever daily press briefing Jan. 23. The memorandum, which Trump signed earlier that day, says federal agencies will not fill any vacant positions or create new ones for up to 90 days, or until a plan for reducing the number of federal government employees goes into effect. Military personnel are exempt from the plan, as are any positions deemed necessary for national security and public safety. Several news outlets quickly jumped on Spicer’s assertion that the federal workforce has expanded dramatically in recent years, saying it was incorrect. We looked at the data ourselves and found that Spicer is cherry-picking. The White House press release about the hiring freeze memorandum offered more detail, saying the federal workforce expanded "from approximately 1.8 million federal civilian employees during the (Bill) Clinton administration to approximately 2.1 million as of 2016 (an approximately 17 percent increase)." The news release figures appear to come from the Office of Personnel Management, whose data shows an increase from 1.78 million civilian employees in the executive branch (excluding the postal service) at the end of 2000 to 2.08 million at the end of 2014. That’s an increase of about 17 percent. At an increase of roughly 1 percent a year, it sounds like Spicer is exaggerating when he calls it "dramatic." However, in choosing to compare the end of the Bill Clinton administration to the end of Barack Obama’s, the new White House is pitting the year with the lowest federal employment since 1950 against a relatively normal year — exaggerating the significance of the growth. Counting the employees Federal government employment has hovered around 2 million for decades, as shown in the graph below. In fact, the federal government had more employees for about half of the past 70 years than it did in 2014. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com During the Korean War in the 1950s, the government capped employment in the federal workforce at 2 million employees. Even though the cap was eventually lifted, it has remained politically popular to keep the government around the same size, said Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University. The size of the federal government workforce stayed about the same as the country’s population grew. The size of state and local governments ballooned, however, and so have the number of contractors working for the federal government. The last concerted effort to shrink the federal government workforce happened under former President Bill Clinton. The end of the Cold War enabled his administration to reduce the workforce from 2.2 million in 1992 to 1.78 million in 2000, with most of the drawdown happening among Defense Department civilian employees. "The Clinton administration was an aberration," Light said. When the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began under former President George W. Bush, the number of civilian defense employees increased again, pushing up the total number of executive branch employees. Obama also added positions in other counterterroism positions and in Veterans Affairs, Light said. The number of executive branch employees actually started to come back down, however slightly, in Obama’s second term — from a high of 2.14 million in 2011 to 2.08 million at the end of 2014 — as the country pulled out of Iraq. In short, a lot of the reduction in the federal government workforce in the 1990s and subsequent growth in the 2000s had to do with civilian Defense Department employees — many of whom will be likely be exempt from Trump’s hiring freeze memorandum because it excludes positions crucial to national security. A federal employee count from another official source, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is slightly higher than the OPM figures. That’s because unlike OPM, BLS includes postal service employees in its count of the federal civilian workforce. Those figures show that the number of federal employees grew slightly under Obama, from 2.78 million employees to 2.8 million between January 2009 and December 2016. That is less than 1 percent growth. Going back to the end of the Clinton administration in December 2000, the growth is only slightly more — from 2.75 million to 2.8 million, or just under 2 percent growth. So when postal service workers are included, the federal government has barely grown in recent years. Light said Trump’s hiring freeze would not really have a significant impact on the size of the federal government. The exemptions to the freeze are so broad that Light predicts it will only affect less than half of the federal workforce. "This is more bluster than impact," he said. Our ruling Spicer said there has been a "dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years." A White House news release shows Spicer was referring to the years since the end of the Clinton administration in 2000. The federal civilian workforce has increased at least 17 percent since then, according to OPM data. But choosing this particular time frame is disingenuous, pitting an abnormally low point against a relatively normal point. The average size of the federal workforce between 1944 and 2014 was 2.05 million, not a dramatic departure from 2.08 million in 2014. Further, a broader set of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows just 2 percent growth over the same time period. Spicer’s statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04718	The unemployment rate is declining faster in Tampa "than almost anywhere else."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/31/bob-buckhorn/tampa-mayor-bob-buckhorn-touts-drop-unemployment-r/	Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn eschewed his political views and focused on Tampa’s improving economy during his welcome address at the Republican National Convention. "We are leading Florida out of the recession," he said during his brief remarks. "Unemployment is declining faster here than almost anywhere else." While there are several ways to take the economy’s temperature, Buckhorn is echoing a tactic by Gov. Rick Scott to tout the unemployment rate as a sign of success. Buckhorn later told us he used the unemployment rate as a yardstick because "it shows we are emerging out of this recession. I think it’s progress." We wanted to know if unemployment is declining faster in Tampa than anywhere else in the nation. Buckhorn’s evidence was a short article in the Tampa Bay Times that said that "Tampa Bay tied for the second-largest drop in unemployment over the past year among major metro areas." We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government agency that tracks employment data, for more details. We first looked at the latest data Buckhorn had available to him when he spoke on Tuesday. The agency, it turns out, doesn’t measure unemployment in "Tampa" as Buckhorn described but rather the metro area of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater. The unemployment rate in the Tampa metro area dropped 2.2 percentage points from June 2011 through June 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That tied for thesecond-largest decline among 49 metro areas with a population of at least 1 million people. (New data released Wednesday changed the 12-month decline in unemployment from 11.3 percent to 9.4 percent for the year ending in July. At a difference of 1.9 percentage points, it is the highest of all major metro areas.) Even though construction jobs continued to languish, the area posted notable over-the-year gains in leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services, according to the Tampa Hillsborough Economic Development Corp. So the statistic is largely accurate, though Buckhorn shorthanded the Tampa/St. Petersburg metro area as Tampa and used a figure that only compares major metropolitan areas. There’s another thing to note. The unemployment rate in the Tampa area remains higher than the national and state averages. Also, the unemployment rate does not account for Florida’s contracted labor force, which is smaller now because people have given up on finding work. The Florida Legislature’s economic research agency found that nearly 70 percent of the drop in Florida’s unemployment rate can be attributed to a shrinking workforce, not new jobs. The unemployment rate would be much higher had the workforce held steady, stated the August 2012 report. "I would say nationally and statewide we want the unemployment rate to come down, but not because the labor force is shrinking," said Sean Snaith, a University of Central Florida economist. Economists say an increased unemployment rate actually could be a better economic indicator because it may signal that discouraged workers are coming back to the labor force. Still, Snaith said, "there's some real growth in (the Tampa area), granted we know it's not been everything that it should be or could be." Our ruling Buckhorn said that the unemployment rate is declining faster in Tampa "than almost anywhere else." We have a few quibbles with that. Buckhorn could have more clear that he was referring to a part of the Tampa Bay area and that the statistic only measures metropolitan areas. Also, the real story behind a declining rate isn’t always so cheery. It doesn’t account for discouraged workers, which are the biggest drivers behind Florida’s falling rate. On the flip side, he gives himself some cover with use of the word "almost," and the metro area has seen a significant dip in the unemployment rate. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-13032	We (in Illinois) have the fifth-highest tax burden in the country.	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2016/dec/01/christine-radogno/illinois-tax-burden-among-highest-not-top-5-us/	With Illinois entering its 17th month without a state budget as Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan continue their epic stalemate, Republican legislative leaders repeatedly talk about the need for a property tax freeze. They suggest the freeze, which Rauner has made a prerequisite for any budget negotiation, is particularly necessary, as the state will need to raise other taxes to cover its growing bill backlog when a budget is signed into law. Rauner has called for daily meetings with Madigan and the state’s three other legislative leaders as the state’s stopgap spending authority expires at year’s end. As the legislative leaders began those closed-door meetings in their six-day fall veto session, both Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno and House Republican Leader Jim Durkin again made the case for a property tax freeze by saying Illinois has one of the worst tax burdens nationwide. Radogno said, "People in this state right now are suffering because they don’t have jobs. We have the fifth-highest tax burden in the country. People are moving out of their homes because of the property tax burden. These are issues that have to be addressed and have to be addressed now." This is a claim we’ve often heard for years in Illinois, and it seems various groups are releasing rankings daily. So we decided to check this one out. Patty Schuh, press secretary to the Illinois Senate GOP staff, said the source for the fifth-worst tax burden claim was a January release of rankings by the Tax Foundation. Indeed, the nonpartisan foundation did issue rankings of the 50 states’ tax burdens that showed Illinois at No. 5 for its overall burden. But that’s not the entire picture. Measuring the rankings What does the Foundation’s overall burden measure? And is that the best, most relevant measurement? Jared Walczak, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, noted there are many ways to measure tax systems and rates and burdens. A state’s own tax structure can play a big part in how it ranks compared to others. For instance, he said Alaska derives a lot of its tax revenue from oil sales, but Alaskans pay relatively little of those taxes, which are paid by all of us who use gasoline, Walczak said. The Tax Foundation does measure the overall tax burden of the people paying taxes in a state, but that overall metric includes both taxes that return to Illinois and those that are paid outside of Illinois, Walczak said. Annette Nellen, a professor in and director of San José State University's graduate tax program, agreed, noting that people need to understand how the rankings are calculated and what they mean. "I think it gets to that legislator using that information incorrectly. A legislator should look at what’s paid and what the rates are in Illinois" if she is trying to make the argument that Illinois taxes are too high, she said. They should look at the rate in the state for income and sales and property taxes and how much does the middle quintile of taxpayers pay for various taxes within Illinois, Nellen added. The Tax Foundation’s own website notes, "Tax collections are useful for some purposes and cited frequently. However, dividing total taxes collected by governments in a state by the state’s total income is not an accurate measure of the tax burden on a state’s residents as a whole because it does not accurately reflect the taxes that are actually paid out of that state’s income." Walczak, the Foundation analyst, said Illinois actually ranked seventh-highest in taxes residents paid to their own state and the fifth-most overall when taxes paid outside of Illinois are included. The ranking of taxes paid by residents in their state is a more accurate reflection of the state’s tax structure and burden on residents, experts agreed. But there’s one more thing to consider. The Tax Foundation rankings were released in January but were calculated using census data from 2012, the bureau’s most recent release of that particular data. John Frendreis, a Loyola University political science professor, said the Foundation’s work was sound, but noted the income tax rate in 2012 was higher than it is now. The rate then for individuals was 5 percent but dropped in January 2015 to 3.75 percent. As a point of comparison, during the two fiscal years preceding FY 2012, the total state tax burden was 10.5 percent, which dropped Illinois several places in the ranking, Frendreis noted. Still, he said, "In general, Illinois’ total tax burden puts it into roughly the top quarter of states on a regular basis." Our ruling Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno said Illinois has the fifth-highest tax burden in the country. It’s a statistic she and other Republicans cite often as they argue for a property tax freeze as one of several changes they want made before they will agree to a budget with Madigan and Democrats. While independent experts say the No. 5 rank for Illinois issued by the Tax Foundation for overall tax burden is accurate, the overall burden includes taxes paid outside of Illinois and is not the best metric for the burden taxpayers carry as a result of tax policy and structure and those taxes paid within the state. Illinois actually is No. 7 nationwide by the measure that best reflects in-state tax policy set by lawmakers. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-02795	"The nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/04/robin-vos/vos-says-nine-day-deer-hunt-has-13-billion-impact/	A physicist, an engineer and a statistician are out hunting. Suddenly, a deer appears 50 yards away. The physicist does some ballistic calculations, assuming a vacuum, lifts his rifle to a specific angle, and shoots. The bullet lands 5 yards short. The engineer adds a fudge factor for air resistance, lifts his rifle slightly higher, and shoots. The bullet lands 5 yards long. The statistician yells "We got him!" PolitiFact Wisconsin couldn’t help but recall that chestnut as we started fact-checking a claim by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester). "FYI," Vos posted on Facebook Nov. 22, 2013, the eve of Wisconsin’s biggest hunting season, "the nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin." Did Vos bag one when describing the impact of 615,000 hunters taking to the woods? At least one of our readers heard the claim as a reference to how much state government pulls in from the hunt. That’s a much smaller figure: Deer hunting licenses and permits generated $22.7 million in revenue for the DNR in 2010, the latest year available. Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer told us he meant the broader impact on the economy of hunting-related spending. That’s how we read it, too. The same number was referred to by Gov. Scott Walker and others in their own pre-hunt statements. Walker’s news release cited the state Department of Natural Resources, which pointed to a 2006 study, "Hunting in America," by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. That 2006 study estimated direct spending by deer hunters at $899 million. That means money spent on gas for the pickup truck, food and beverages, firearms, ammo, lodging and other essentials, say, a new trailer, a gun case, land access fees, etc. The figure, gleaned from a large national survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, reflects that direct spending by hunters. But the study also estimates the "ripple effect" of their spending on the broader economy. That’s the $1.39 billion, cited by Vos and the others. The study uses a pretty broad definition of ripple effect. It quantifies such indirect spending "as retailers buy more merchandise from wholesalers and manufacturers who then buy more input, plus the spending by the employees of all these companies," said Rob Southwick of Southwick Associates, which does the estimate. "It is possible to divide and track retail sales as they move through the economy, with each successive round becoming smaller until it’s no longer possible to measure." So it’s a much softer estimate than the direct spending. Such measures always are. It’s worth noting that $1.39 billion figure includes more than the just-concluded nine-day gun hunt mentioned by Vos. There’s a separate bow-hunt season as well. It’s not possible to tease out exactly how much spending is for bow vs. gun, and there is some overlap. But based strictly on licenses for all kinds of deer hunting, 74 percent are for the gun season (615,000 licenses). Applying that ratio, the direct spending for the nine-day gun season would be $665 million, and about $1.03 billion for indirect. That’s lower than Vos said. But because the figure is old, we thought it made sense to apply a simple inflation calculation to the gun deer-hunting numbers we extrapolated from the study’s overall deer hunting figures. The overall impact, including "ripple effect" spending, would be about $1.2 billion -- but given the overlap with spending between gun and bow hunting for deer -- probably somewhat higher. Newer numbers We found a study that updates the 2006 calculation. The 2011 report was by the National Shooting Sports Foundation in partnership with the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. The NSSF is is the trade association for the firearms industry. That 2011 study showed a surge in the number of deer hunters in Wisconsin, and a 146 percent jump in direct and indirect spending, up to $3.4 billion from the earlier $1.39 billion. Similarly, the direct spending by hunters rose from $899 million to $2.17 billion. The study is more recent, and shows a bigger impact, so you might expect the political types to latch onto it, right? Not in this case, due to concerns raised by a Wisconsin DNR official who urged elected officials to use the more conservative figures. The 2011 study showed a big increase in Wisconsin deer hunters when the number of hunters actually went down, based on the number of licenses sold, said Keith Warnke, hunting and shooting sports coordinator at DNR. What’s more, Warnke said, it defies logic that spending by hunters more than doubled during the Great Recession. The 2006 direct spending breaks down to $1,400 per hunter -- a reasonable estimate in Warnke’s view. But the 2011 number works out to double that, about $2,800. As it turns out, even one of the authors of the 2011 study doesn’t stand by the big reported hike in the Wisconsin spending numbers. The Wisconsin sample size was too small in the national survey conducted for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said Southwick. "The 2011 results should be used cautiously. While at the national level the sample is fine, it is screwy for many states like WI," Southwick wrote in an email. So that leaves us with the 2006 numbers. Our rating Vos repeated Walker’s assertion that "The nine-day deer hunt contributes more than $1.3 billion in revenue to the state of Wisconsin." The figure is from the most-recent estimate of deer hunting’s economic impact. Vos misfires a bit because the figure actually applies to all deer hunting, not just the gun season. But it’s hard to say by how much, and accounting for inflation brings his claim in line. The statement needs clarification because he’s talking about more than just direct spending by hunters. But Vos’s claim was stated broadly, so, like the statistician in the old joke, he is close enough to warrant a shout of "We got him!" We rate his claim Mostly True.

A few days after Donald Trump criticized Bush for the Iraq war and Sept. 11 attacks, the 43rd president stumped for his brother Jeb in the state that gave him a key victory when he ran for the nomination in 2000. Bush’s visit coincides with a Web ad attacking Trump from an anti-Trump super PAC called Our Principles. The ad plays clips of Trump’s interviews on CNN and at one point puts on the screen "Trump supported impeachment of President Bush." Along with that text and a photo of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump is heard saying, "It just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing." We checked to see if the ad makers engaged in artful editing. Did Trump really support impeaching Bush? Based on the CNN transcript from Oct. 15, 2008, Our Principles was faithful to the video. In fact, when host Wolf Blitzer pressed Trump, the real estate tycoon doubled down. Here is the exchange: Trump: "I was surprised that she didn't do more in terms of Bush and going after Bush. It was almost -- it just seemed like she was going to really look to impeach Bush and get him out of office, which, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing." Blitzer: "Impeaching him?" Trump: "Absolutely, for the war, for the war." Blitzer: "Because of the conduct of the war." Trump: "Well, he lied. He got us into the war with lies. And, I mean, look at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant. And they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And, yet, Bush got us into this horrible war with lies, by lying, by saying they had weapons of mass destruction, by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true." That was in 2008. In 2016, Trump has been less enthusiastic about impeaching Bush. He was pressed on the point the day after Saturday’s GOP debate in South Carolina. ABC News host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump twice on Feb. 14, 2015, if he still thought impeachment would be a "wonderful thing." The first time, Trump said, "I didn’t endorse anything." The second time, Trump said, "I don’t even think about it. It’s past time. He was — he made a horrible mistake; we all make mistakes. His was a beauty. His was about as big a mistake as you can think of." Trump himself did most of the work to bring George W. Bush and the Iraq War into the closing days before the South Carolina primary. During the Republican debate, he said his stance on the war was proof of his superior judgment "I'm the only one on this stage that said, ‘Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq,’ " Trump said. "Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong." (We rated that claim False.) And when ABC News moderator John Dickerson asked Trump whether he supported impeachment, Trump didn’t answer directly. Instead, he said, "You do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction." At a rally in Greenville, S.C., Monday, Trump refrained from calling George W. Bush a liar, saying only that the war was a "big mistake." Our ruling An ad by the super PAC Our Principles said Trump supported the impeachment of Bush. The evidence was in the ad itself, a video from an interview Trump gave to CNN in 2008. In that interview, Trump was asked if impeachment would have been a wonderful thing and he said "absolutely." Recently, Trump has backed away from his previous support for impeachment, saying "it’s past time" for that action. Still, the ad said he supported impeachment in the past, not that he supports it today. We rate the statement True.	None	Our Principles PAC	None	None	None	2016-02-16T17:36:03	2016-02-14	['None']

pomt-01462	David Perdue "opposes laws that provide equal pay protections for women."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/02/georgians-together/nunn-camp-swings-wide-gender-pay-attack-ad/	In a direct appeal to female voters, a new television ad for Michelle Nunn takes a shot at opponent David Perdue on the issue of equal pay. "David Perdue opposes laws that provide equal-pay protections for women," declares the ad from Georgians Together, a super PAC created to support the Democrat’s campaign for U.S. Senate. The Senate race between Nunn and Republican Perdue is being closely watched here and nationally. A Nunn win would allow Democrats to reclaim a top statewide office. The outcome also could determine majority control in the U.S. Senate, now narrowly held by Democrats. Both candidates need the support of women, who make up about 56 percent of the state’s 5 million likeliest voters. Nunn has already tried to make political hay of the fact that Dollar General was hit with a gender discrimination lawsuit during Perdue’s tenure as its CEO. (The suit was settled for $18.75 million several years after Perdue left the company, with no admission of wrongdoing). The new ad from Georgians Together brings up the Dollar General lawsuit. It also accuses Perdue of opposing laws that "provide equal-pay protections for women," a claim that PolitiFact Georgia decided warranted further investigation. The super PAC’s ad claim is a reference to Perdue’s opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill supported by President Barack Obama and most Capitol Hill Democrats and opposed by congressional Republicans. Supporters say the bill – and it is a bill, and not a law, as the Georgians Together ad states -- contains practical steps for promoting fair pay for women that the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not been able to achieve. They say the act would enhance the remedies available to victims of gender-based discrimination and require employers to show that pay differences are job-related, not sex-based, and are governed not by bias, but by business necessity. Employers would be barred from retaliating against workers who inquire about their employers’ wage practices or disclose their own wages, the bill’s champions say. Obama has already signed an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from retaliating against employees who choose to discuss their compensation, and he continues to urge Congress to pass the bill. Opponents say the legislation misdiagnoses the problem. They question the data cited by its supporters, and they say passage of the bill could lead to more lawsuits and even jobs going overseas. The bill passed the House in January 2009 but stalled in the Senate. Opponents claim it has been brought back up this year as an election-year tactic by Democrats who want to paint Republicans as unsympathetic to women in the workforce. Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s campaign spokesman, told us that Perdue doesn’t support the bill because he believes the Equal Pay Act of 1963 makes clear that women and men are to be paid equal wages for equal work. "They (the Nunn campaign) know David supports equal pay for equal work, which has been the law for over 50 years," Dickey said. "This ad is just another example of Michelle Nunn trying to perpetuate a fraud on the people of Georgia on behalf of (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid and Barack Obama." Nunn is on record as supporting the bill, which Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former chief economist with the U.S. Department of Labor in the George W. Bush administration, told us appears at this point to be "just a talking point." "If it didn’t pass in 2010 (when Democrats were in control), it’s not going to pass now," she said. Furchtgott-Roth, now director of Economics21 at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a New York-based, free-market think tank, said there have been concerns that the bill is "really a full-employment act for trial lawyers." She cited, for example, a provision of the bill that would allow an employer found guilty of "so-called discrimination" to be liable for punitive damages, instead of just back pay. Furchtgott-Roth said three current laws address the issue -- the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Civil Rights Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Democrats from Obama on down have emphasized the "gender wage gap" all this year. There’s always a debate over just how wide that gap is, though most people quote a 2011 U.S. Census Bureau report showing women’s total wages were about 23 percent lower than the total amount of men's wages. But that large discrepancy was due, in part, to the fact that men generally work more hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Some rigorous economic studies have shown that women make about the same as men — 95 cents on a man's dollar when job, experience and hours of work are all comparable. Our Ruling The ad statement implies sweeping opposition by Perdue to laws giving women the right to collect equal pay for equal work. There’s no evidence of that. In fact, Perdue says he supports equal pay for equal work. The only thing the super PAC can point to is he’s against a single proposed law that supporters say would give women more power to fight back against discrimination. We rate the statement as Mostly False.	None	Georgians Together	None	None	None	2014-10-02T00:00:00	2014-09-25	['None']

pomt-01115	Says President Barack Obama has "not proposed one thing that would change" the fact that Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/07/louie-gohmert/louie-gohmert-says-obama-has-not-proposed-one-tax-/	President Barack Obama has identified tax reform as one of the few areas where he thinks he could find some agreement with new Republican congressional leaders in the coming months. Taking it in the opposite direction, Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas -- who just ran a failed attempt to take over as speaker of the House -- said Congress should just do away with the current tax code to put Obama on the defensive. In an appearance on Fox News Jan. 5, he said that would show Republican constituents that members of Congress are standing up for conservative values. "There are people in the party that are willing to stand up and fight for the very things we promised we would do," Gohmert said. "We can put Obama on the defensive just by completing getting rid of the Internal Revenue code. I want a flat tax. Obama has said that, you know, it's a travesty for (billionaire Warren) Buffett to pay less in percentage than his secretary, yet he's not proposed one thing that would change that. We can do that." Gohmert’s comment that Obama hasn’t proposed one measure to address tax inequality struck us as suspect right off the bat, considering Obama’s interest in tax legislation -- not to mention his well-publicized 2012 "Buffett rule" campaign. We asked Gohmert’s office for comment several times but didn’t hear back. The Buffett rule For years, Buffett, the chairman and CEO of holding company Berkshire Hathaway, has said several times he pays a lower percentage of his income in taxes than anyone else in his office -- including his secretary. In 2011, he said that he pays 17.4 percent of his income in taxes, while others in his office (who have much, much lower incomes) -- paid around 36 percent. Buffett, one of the richest people in the country, sees that as unfair and a problem. The discrepancy between Buffett and his secretary became a familiar refrain for other advocates of so-called tax fairness, including Obama. "Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households," Obama said in his 2012 State of the Union address. "Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary." But Obama didn’t just mention the Buffett paradox in passing without offering a solution, as Gohmert implies. In the very same State of the Union speech, Obama made a proposal to change the tax code so that it complies with the "Buffett rule" -- which attempts to ensure that high-income people pay a certain percentage of their income in taxes that is at least higher than what middle-class people pay. "Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule. If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes," he said. "Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense." The Buffett rule proposal came to Congress in the form of the Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012, sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and endorsed publically by Obama. (Procedurally, the president can’t introduce legislation; only members of Congress can.) The bill, which failed in the Senate that April, would have required all people making more than $2 million per year to pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent. People making between $1 million and $2 million would see their minimum tax rates increase on a sliding scale up to 30 percent. Obama has proposed tax reform that involves observing the Buffett rule in his budget proposals for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015. And it was a major point of his 2012 campaign, as he could point to the fact that his Republican challenger Mitt Romney paid an effective tax rate of 14 percent on his $42 million in earnings in 2010 and 2011. Caveats There is some debate over how many people would be impacted by the Paying a Fair Share Act and the Buffett rule. There’s also a lot of debate over whether or not the Buffett rule is good for the economy, or if it would further complicate the tax code, but neither of those are the point at issue here. The bill wouldn’t have affected all wealthy people in one sweeping motion. Most ultra-wealthy households already pay a higher effective tax rate than the average middle-class American, noted Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. According to the 2012 Economic Report of the President, the median average tax rate for the middle 20 percent of Americans, in terms of earnings, was 13.3 percent. The median average tax rate for the top 1 percent of earners, on the other hand was 29.6 percent. Only one-tenth of that top 1 percent had an average tax rate lower than 10 percent. A quick note: Here, we’re talking about effective tax rate, which is the percentage of their income people ultimately paid in taxes. This is different from the marginal tax rate. The federal government designates several brackets of taxable income, which are all taxed at different rates. The marginal tax rate is the rate applied to a person’s last dollar earned above a certain threshold. The marginal and effective tax rates tend not to line up. Buffett and some other super-rich individuals pay lower tax rates than average Americans because they earn much of their living through investments and assets (as Buffett put it in a 2011 New York Times column: they "make money with money"). This distinction comes with a lower tax rate than people who earn their money through wages or salary. At the height of Obama’s Buffett rule campaign in 2012, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center think tank estimated that 217,000 households would have to pay a higher tax rate as a result of the Paying a Fair Share Act. Regardless of the number of those affected, "did the president propose something that would have approximated a Buffett rule? Yes he did," said Roberton Williams, Tax Policy Center fellow. "It does what the Buffett rule would like to do, (though) it’s not perfect." Our ruling Gohmert said Obama has "not proposed one thing that would change" the fact that Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. In fact, Obama has on multiple occasions proposed changing the tax code so that it complies with the "Buffett rule," which attempts to ensure that high-income people pay a certain percentage of their income in taxes that is at least higher than what middle-class people pay. There’s debate over whether or not this is good policy or how many millionaires would be affected. But that doesn’t change the fact that Obama proposed something that addressed this issue.

pomt-02418	"(Mary) Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/05/republican-governors-association/republican-group-ties-wisconsin-job-loss-mary-burk/	The political playbook calls for campaigns to define their opponents before they can introduce themselves to voters. The Republican Governors Association is calling that play in the early downs of the 2014 Wisconsin governor’s race, attacking Democrat Mary Burke in her bid to unseat Republican Scott Walker. In one TV spot entitled "Backward," the RGA asks: "Who’s Mary Burke?" It’s answer: "Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs, and a $3 billion budget shortfall." The ad concludes: "Mary Burke would take Wisconsin backwards." Did Burke, as state Commerce secretary under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, throw Wisconsin for a six-digit jobs loss? As backup for the jobs claim, the RGA spot cites a very familiar source: A September 2013 item from PolitiFact Wisconsin. But in that item, we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that Doyle’s policies cost the state 133,000 jobs in his second term, from 2007 through 2010. Walker, we noted, got the number right. But experts said the national economic crash had far more to do with Wisconsin’s job losses during that period than any state policies. Indeed, Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country. The claim in the RGA ad carries a subtle, but important difference. It does not mention Doyle’s second term as its timeframe. Rather, it makes an open-ended statement that those watching from their couch may likely hear as referring to Doyle’s full tenure in office. Beyond that, Burke worked for Doyle as Commerce secretary over parts of both his terms, but not nearly for the entire eight-year period. She started in February 2005, about halfway through Doyle’s first term, and left in November 2007 -- 10 months into Doyle’s second term. And the private-sector jobs picture changes dramatically if you look at Doyle’s full tenure or narrowly at Burke’s time as Commerce chief. We ran the numbers using US Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly census of employment and wages data, considered the most accurate measurement: -- Burke’s state tenure: Gain of more than 55,000 jobs. -- Doyle’s full eight-year tenure: Loss of 47,413 jobs (gain of 86,530 in term one, loss of 133,943 in term two). To expand our analysis, we looked at two other scenarios: -- Start of Burke’s tenure to end of Doyle’s: loss of 77,267. -- Start of Doyle’s tenure to end of Burke’s: gain of at least 94,000. It’s apparent from these figures that the RGA ad cherrypicks the worst outcome for Burke by ignoring numbers from nearly two years she worked in Doyle’s first term -- even though that represented the majority of her time in state government. Indeed, the state’s private sector employment actually grew during Burke’s specific time as Commerce secretary. (Data note: because of limitations stemming from how the data is reported, we had to slightly adjust the time frames covering Burke’s state tenure. But those adjustments do not alter the trends we found.) There’s something for the RGA to hang on to here, though, in that Burke was a holdover member of Doyle’s administration for a small part of a second term during which more than 130,000 jobs were lost in four years. RGA spokesman Jon Thompson defended the 130,000 figure, saying Burke had a hand in Doyle’s second term, but added that it is a "fair comparison" for others to look at all eight years of Doyle’s record. "Wisconsin is still worse off when all is said and done, and has turned that corner under Walker," he said. Blame game The historical backdrop here is that until mid-2008, employment in Wisconsin was rising, as it had for years. In June 2008, seven months after Burke departed, the total employment count started a big slide that was part of the Great Recession that swept the United States. The slide ended in mid-2010, in Doyle’s final year, and the monthly gains that started then have generally continued under Walker. In reality, neither Walker nor Burke deserve much of the credit or blame for job trends, particularly ones driven by an event as sharp as the Great Recession, economists have told us repeatedly. No governor -- much less a department head -- has much influence on the state jobs picture in the face of strongly negative national economic trends, they said. To be sure, Burke highlights the job gains during her time while skipping over the recession. That omission earned her a Half True when in October of 2013 she picked an entirely different time frame and said her actions as Commerce secretary brought the state 84,000 more jobs than we have today. Our rating The Republican Governors Association charged that "Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs." There’s an element of truth, but the ad ignores the critical fact that Burke also worked in half of Doyle’s first term, when 86,000 jobs were gained. Employment also rose in the narrower time frame when Burke worked for Doyle over parts of his two terms. And in any event, the role of these two officials in those losses and gains is very limited, given national economic realities of the time. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-08465	"One man (New Castle, Del., County Executive, Chris Coons) thought property taxes should be hiked almost 50 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/13/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-ad-accuses-chris-coons-proposin/	The latest ad from Republican Christine O'Donnell is set up like a trailer for a horror or an action movie, complete with a deep-throated voice-over heightening the suspense. The bad guy of this "movie"? "The Taxman," aka O'Donnell's opponent in the Delaware Senate race, Democrat Chris Coons. "In America ... " the voice-over begins as tension-building music swells in the background, "where jobs are being lost and wages cut. In Delaware, where the economy is suffering and families are losing their homes, there is one man who stood against the tide and raised taxes. "One man who thought a 911 call should be taxed...One man thought property taxes should be hiked almost 50 percent ... One man who was county executive and drove New Castle County on the brink of bankruptcy." " ... Chris Coons is The Taxman." We're checking a couple claims in this ad, and in this item, we'll focus on the part, "One man who thought property taxes should be hiked almost 50 percent." Coons was elected County Executive of New Castle County, Del., in 2004 and has served in that position ever since. Records show that three times -- in 2006, 2007 and 2009 -- Coons proposed property tax increases. We'll go through each in order. * In 2006, Coons proposed a 5 percent property tax increase in his 2007 fiscal year budget, raising the average annual tax bill by $16 to $342. Coons' proposal called for a $230 million operating budget, a 7 percent increase over the previous year's spending. The County Council voted 12-1 for the budget and then voted 9-4 to set the higher tax rate. At the time, Coons said the increase was the first of several small tax hikes needed to help close the gap between spending and revenue, according to a story in the News Journal in Wilmington on May 24, 2006. * In 2007, Coons proposed a 17.5 percent increase in property taxes, upping the average annual bill by $60 to $402. Coons' budget also included $14 million in spending cuts, achieved through a variety of measures including the elimination of 61 vacant positions, elimination of non-emergency overtime, a pay freeze for 55 executive-branch employees and a greatly reduced long-term budget for capital projects. The $228 million budget -- $2 million less than the previous year -- was the first negative-growth budget in a decade. "We have made in this budget all the cuts I think we can stand," Coons said at the time. Coons again said the tax increase was needed to help get the county's deficit under control. For several year, the county had been spending down cash reserves. The News Journal noted then that one of the biggest challenges to the budget was a sharp decline in real-estate transfer taxes revenues -- the county's second-largest source of income -- due to a downturn in the housing market. The Council voted 8-5 for the budget and tax rate. * In 2009, Coons unveiled a budget that proposed a 25 percent property tax increase, raising the average tax bill by $100, to about $501. The $228 million budget and tax hike -- approved by Council 8-5 -- also reduced spending by $29 million, the second biggest budget reduction in county history, according to the News Journal. The spending cuts were achieved, in part, by a 5 percent salary rollback for the majority of the county's nearly 1,500 employees; the elimination of 97 unfilled jobs, and the layoff of nine paramedics-in-training. According to March 18, 2009, story in the News Journal, "The overall budget reflects the impact of the recession, particularly in housing. The county has depended heavily for years on a share of the statewide real estate transfer tax to balance its budget. Revenues from that tax have plummeted as home sales swooned." Coons explained the rationale for the budget this way: "Rather than taking an extreme approach that either slashes the county work force or that dramatically raises taxes beyond what our community can fairly bear, I am taking a balanced middle course," he said. "One that asks for shared sacrifice from all who deliver our county services and all who benefit from them." There was no proposed property tax increase for next year's budget. But the three property tax hikes proposed by Coons, and approved by Council, resulted in a net increase of 54 percent. During a debate last month, Coons defended the tax increases, saying that without them he would have been forced to lay off police and close parks and libraries. The recession wreaked havoc with county budgets around the country, and you can agree or disagree with the way Coons proposed to handle things in New Castle County. But the fact is, as County Executive, Coons did propose almost 50 percent worth of property tax increases. He also cut spending during the years with the biggest tax hikes (though overall, the operating budget has gone from $214.5 million in 2006 to $235.5 million in the 2011 budget proposal). Our only beef with the claim in the O'Donnell ad is the whole "one man" theme. "One man who stood against the tide and raised taxes," the ad says. " ... One man thought property taxes should be hiked almost 50 percent." In fact, all of Coons' budget proposals were approved by a majority of the County Council. And so we knock the ad's claim down to a Mostly True.	None	Christine O'Donnell	None	None	None	2010-10-13T18:31:21	2010-10-11	['Delaware', 'New_Castle,_Pennsylvania']
pomt-00881	Says Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed budget "would sell off Wisconsin’s state parks."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/10/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-says-scott-walker-proposed-sellin/	Many aspects of Gov. Scott Walker’s 2015-’17 budget have come under heavy criticism, but this headline on a state Democratic Party news release really caught our attention: "Scott Walker's Iowa Caucus Budget Would Sell Off Wisconsin's State Parks." The Iowa part didn’t surprise us -- it’s just the party’s latest dig at Walker for spending more time out of state as he weighs a potential 2016 presidential bid. That includes Iowa, home to the first voting in that contest. But would Walker’s budget "sell off Wisconsin’s state parks"? As in, to private bidders? No. It wouldn’t. When we asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff for evidence to support the claim, it became evident that there was some false advertising in the news release. "We are referring to the proposals by Walker administration officials at the DNR to sell off naming rights to the state parks to offset his budget cuts to the state park system," Baldauff wrote in an email, adding "the people who do live here aren't likely to want to see our richest natural resources sold off to corporations and campaign donors." OK. But selling naming rights is far, far different than selling any of Wisconsin’s 64 state parks, forests and recreational areas. And even that is not in the budget itself. Rather, naming rights is an idea that came up in questioning during a March 3, 2015, hearing of the Joint Finance Committee. Under Walker’s budget, state parks would have to sustain themselves through higher admission and camping fees. That stirred questions from lawmakers when Department of Natural Resources Secretary Cathy Stepp, a Walker appointee, testified. State Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-Middleton, quizzed Stepp about her plans for keeping the state parks in business. A video of the meeting shows that Stepp said there was sufficient money to run the parks for the next two years, and said officials would use the time to consider ways to best fund parks beyond that. Said Stepp: "We also are going to be engaged in conversations with external partners and opportunities for us to be able to leverage -- I guess for lack of a better word -- more support within our state parks." The senator asked whether that meant Stepp was considering selling state parks. "Well, we’re not talking about that," Stepp responded. Despite her answer, Erpenbach pressed on and asked if sale of parks had been discussed within the agency. "We have not discussed that at this point...it’s very premature. I don’t anticipate that’s going to be a problem," she said. "We’re talking about engaging with external partners for opportunities for, say, concessions, sponsorships, while still maintaining the integrity and the unique state park experience for our users." Stepp declined Erpenbach’s invitation to say what the state might be willing to accept for, say, a sponsorship of Devil’s Lake, the most-visited state park. When we reached out to the department, assistant deputy secretary Michael Bruhn said in an email that Stepp was drawn into the selling of parks discussion by the questions. "Cathy’s testimony did NOT say anything about selling state parks. Senator Erpenbach made the claim," he wrote. "We are NOT considering selling state parks." Our rating The state Democratic Party of Wisconsin said Walker’s budget "would sell off Wisconsin’s state parks." But that is not included in the budget, and Stepp said during testimony it was not under consideration. At best, what is up for discussion is the potential sale of naming rights as a way to derive extra revenue for the parks. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01734	Says U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst signed a pledge that "protects tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/05/next-generation-climate-action-committee/ad-says-joni-ernst-pledged-protect-tax-breaks-comp/	It’s back! A claim out of the Democratic Party that numerous fact-checkers debunked in 2010 has made its way to the 2014 Iowa Senate race. A new ad attacks Republican candidate Joni Ernst, painting her as beholden to special interest groups because she signed a pledge. The ad comes from NextGen Climate Action Committee, a liberal political action committee. The ad shows a dimly lit room, with two men looking at a picture of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on a screen, while laughing in a slow, almost crazed manner. The screen switches to a picture of Ernst. "We got her to pledge? Joni signed on the line," the ad says. "The tax breaks that thing protects are gold. Green light more outsourcing! China, Mexico. All the way." Text on the screen says, "Ernst’s Pledge: Protects Tax Breaks for Companies that Ship Jobs Overseas." Even though the ad is new, this claim -- that a person who signs the Americans for Tax Reform’s pledge is in favor of tax breaks that encourage outsourcing -- is not. In 2010, PolitiFact Virginia checked a similar statement, that a state legislature candidate "supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas." They rated the claim False. The same year, our friends at Factcheck.org found the claim, used against a Republican House candidate from Hawaii, to be false. And they pointed out that pro-Democratic groups that used the attack ads in quite a number of ads. The Associated Press also said the claim was wrong in 2010. It seems like there’s a consensus that the claim is off-target, but because it’s been four years, we decided to look at it again. What’s this pledge? The pledge that the ad is talking about the Taxpayer Protection Pledge -- crafted by Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist’s anti-tax group, in 1986. Lawmakers who sign it pledge to fight tax increases. Ernst signed the federal pledge back in July 2013. Democrats say this means Ernst and other signers pledge to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. That’s a stretch. For one, the text of the pledge is brief and does not take positions on specific issues, like protecting companies with employees in other countries. It says nothing about jobs or changing tax code. It says: I, ______, pledge to the taxpayers of the ______ district of the state of ______ and to the American people that I will: One, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and Two, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates. Democrats have said Americans for Tax Reform has pressured signers to vote in ways that would prevent closing tax benefits for companies that conduct business overseas. NextGen Climate pointed us to Americans for Tax Reform’s stance on a bill that provided $26 billion in aid to states and localities. In August 2010, Americans for Tax Reform said the bill (H.R. 1586, which passed) violated the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The bill included increased spending that would be paid for in part by closing tax loopholes for American companies that do business overseas. The changes didn’t specifically address workers or where employees are located. NextGen Climate is essentially arguing that because Americans for Tax Reform told pledge signers not to vote for this bill all pledge signers support outsourcing protections. We see two primary issues with this evidence. First, Americans for Tax Reform’s main problem with the bill is that it eliminated a tax credit without finding another avenue to reduce taxes by the same amount, which the pledge requires. People who sign the pledge wouldn’t support any tax increase or tax credit elimination, no matter the context, so it is misleading to tie their tax positions to other issues like outsourcing, said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank. "They wouldn’t close a (tax) subsidy to bring jobs home, either," Toder said. In theory, signers could have voted for the 2010 bill if it had eliminated other taxes to make up for closing the loopholes. Second, this particular vote happened in 2010, almost three years before Ernst signed the pledge, and she was not in an elected position at the time -- let alone in a position in which she would have voted on this bill. She has no ties to this legislation. Our ruling An ad by NextGen Climate Action Committee said Ernst signed a pledge that "protects tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas." Ernst signed the Taxpayer Protection pledge, a promise promoted by Americans for Tax Reform, which is a broad vow to oppose all tax increases. It does not specify protecting tax loopholes for companies that have employees overseas. In one instance, Americans for Tax Reform urged signers to vote against a bill that closed one of these loopholes, but the decision was more about stopping a tax increase than protecting outsourcing, and Ernst had yet to sign the pledge then, anyway. We rate this claim False.	None	Next Generation Climate Action Committee	None	None	None	2014-08-05T11:43:34	2014-08-30	['United_States']

pomt-06253	"For the past eight years, Gov. Carcieri and Mrs. Carcieri would host the lighting of the State House Christmas tree."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/30/john-depetro/talk-show-host-john-depetro-says-eight-years-gover/	Thanksgiving is over and you know what that means -- shopping, bright lights, parties and the traditional gnashing of teeth by people who obsess over what to call those evergreens bedecked with lights and baubles. You could hear the molars grinding Nov. 29 when WPRO talk-show host John DePetro complained indignantly that Governor Lincoln Chafee, an independent, had invited everyone to the lighting of the "holiday tree" at the State House. While talking to guest state Rep. Joseph Trillo, a Republican who co-sponsored a House resolution in January urging that such trees always be referred to as Christmas trees, DePetro said the terminology used by Chafee (whom DePetro calls "Governor Grinch") was a break from tradition. "For the past eight years, Gov. Carcieri and Mrs. Carcieri would host the lighting of the State House Christmas tree," he said, referring to Chafee's predecessor, Republican Donald Carcieri. Chafee's office issued a response asserting that "use of the term 'holiday tree' is a continuation of past practice." So who is correct? Credit Ted Nesi of WPRI.com for digging into this one. Nesi found the Carcieris' 2009 invitation to "The Annual Holiday Tree Lighting," which includes a list of "Holiday festivities." The word "Christmas" doesn't appear. One of Nesi’s Twitter followers forwarded an archived 2006 news release from Carcieri that talks about "the annual tree-lighting ceremony." The word "Christmas" never appears. We found another news release, this one from 2003, in which there's no reference to Christmas in the announcement of the "annual tree-lighting ceremony." When we contacted DePetro Tuesday evening, he said he did a Google search and found that in 2010 it was referred to as a Christmas tree. "I just went on last year," he said. "I think I said the eight years, but I didn't have that as a fact." Our ruling Talk-radio host John DePetro stated, "For the past eight years Gov. Carcieri and Mrs. Carcieri would host the lighting of the State House Christmas tree" -- emphasizing the words "Christmas tree" -- to criticize Chafee's reference to "holiday tree." Certainly the Carcieri administration wasn't reluctant to use the term "Christmas tree." But we found more than a few exceptions that used the term "holiday tree" -- just as Chafee has -- and the word "Christmas" was noticeably absent. We rule DePetro's statement False.

pomt-02889	"A million people … could get health insurance right away" if Texas expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.	true	/texas/statements/2013/nov/08/barack-obama/more-million-texans-would-become-medicaid-eligible/	Visiting Dallas on Nov. 6, 2013, President Barack Obama sought to allay worries about his signature health-care law and assert Texans’ need for more health coverage. Texas could have helped many immediately, he said, by accepting the law’s offer of federal dollars to help pay for expanding Medicaid, a key Obamacare initiative. "Across this state, you've got a million people -- because this is a big state -- a million people, citizens, who don’t have health insurance that could get health insurance right away if the state of Texas decided to take advantage of it," Obama said at Temple Emanu-El to volunteers who helped people enroll via the act’s insurance marketplace on Healthcare.gov. Texas consistently has the nation’s highest percentage of residents without health insurance. The Census Bureau estimated 6.4 million Texans in 2012 had no health coverage. The state Health and Human Services Commission estimated that in January 2013, Texas had about 1 million adults on Medicaid. Under the health care law, the federal government offered to pay expansion costs during the first three years for states that extended Medicaid to adults earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Texas Gov. Rick Perry rejected that deal July 19, 2012. Medicaid is a federal-state insurance program that targets children and low-income families, elderly and disabled people, pregnant women and children in foster care. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the state commission, which administers Medicaid in Texas, told us by email, "We estimate that almost 1.4 million Texans would become eligible for Medicaid if the state opted to expand." The Urban Institute, a non-partisan research institute in Washington, D.C., reached a slightly larger figure in a July 2012 report that said, "State decisions regarding whether to expand Medicaid under the ACA will directly affect the 15.1 million uninsured adults with incomes below 138 percent of FPL (federal poverty level) who are not currently eligible for Medicaid. Of these newly eligible uninsured adults ... 1.7 million live in Texas." The institute said its estimates were made using data from the Census Bureau’s 2010 American Community Survey. In a March 18, 2013, report, the state agency contrasted how Texas’ uninsured population might differ in two different Obamacare scenarios using Current Population Survey census data from March 2012. "Current state" populations included 19.5 million insured and 6 million uninsured (24 percent uninsured), the report said. The implementation of Obamacare alone, without Medicaid expansion in Texas, would shift that rate to 16 percent uninsured (4.2 million Texans), the agency estimated. Under Obamacare implementation with full Medicaid expansion, 12 percent (3.1 million Texans) would remain uninsured. Not all the newly eligible adults would be expected to sign up immediately, Goodman said, citing 2012 estimates from the agency that show Medicaid adult enrollment rising by 341,000 in 2014, by 776,000 in 2015 and by just over 1 million in 2016: Our ruling Obama said, "A million people … could get health insurance right away" if Texas expanded Medicaid as encouraged by the Obamacare law. Estimates show some 1.4 million to 1.7 million would be eligible immediately. We rate his statement as True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-11745	Under the House Republican tax plan, in Wisconsin, "the median household of four gets about a $2,000 tax cut, on average."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/dec/08/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-partially-accurate-claim-house-tax-bill/	U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing back against criticism of a GOP tax plan that he hopes will become law before the end of the year. In a Dec. 1, 2017 National Public Radio interview, the Wisconsin Republican repeated his argument that the House version of tax reform is a middle-class tax cut. Then he made a claim about Wisconsin, saying: This is designed to be a middle-class tax cut. I think the people who are concerned the most are some of the big businesses; that's where we hear most of the complaints about. But this is a middle-class tax cut, no two ways about it. I just ran the numbers of Wisconsin. The median family of four -- the median household of four -- gets about a $2,000 tax cut, on average. Ryan’s $2,000 claim is correct -- as far as it goes. But it leaves out some important information. The $2,000 To defend Ryan’s statement, his office referred us to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee. A spokeswoman for the committee provided us these figures, which compare current law to the House bill, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The figures are for a Wisconsin household of four -- a couple with two minor children -- based on 2016 U.S. Census data for median income. The median income -- $91,532 -- means that half of four-person households in the state earned more than that in 2016 and half earned less. Current law House tax plan Adjusted gross income $91,532 $91,532 Standard deduction $13,000 $24,440 Personal exemptions $16,000 0 Taxable income $61,932 $67,132 10% bracket $1,905 --- 12% bracket --- $8,056 15% bracket $6,432 --- Preliminary liability $8,337 $8,056 Child tax credit $2,000 ($1,000 per child) $3,200 ($1,600 per child) Family credits --- $600 ($300 per parent) Tax liability $6,337 $4,256 Tax savings in 2018 --- $2,081 (The House bill would make several changes in the tax brackets, including replacing the 10 percent bracket with a 12 percent bracket.) The $2,081 savings figure is correct, according to experts at four think tanks we contacted: Amir El-Sibaie, an analyst at the Tax Foundation; Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; and Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center senior fellow Frank Sammartino; and Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy deputy director Meg Wiehe. But the experts agreed there are two important caveats: 1. Ryan’s example assumes the typical household he cites claims a standard deduction, rather than itemizing deductions. But many households at the income level Ryan cites itemize their deductions. That initial $2,081 in savings could be hundreds less if that household has claimed certain itemized deductions, such as for medical expenses, that would be eliminated by the House bill. (Other deductions eliminated or pared back in the House bill include the mortgage interest deduction, and the state and local tax deduction.) Marr told us IRS data shows that in 2015, 55 percent of Wisconsin tax filers with an income between $75,000 and $100,000 claimed itemized deductions instead of the standard deduction. 2. Even the household that stand to save $2,081 in 2018 would see that savings decrease each year going forward. According to these figures Marr provided, the annual savings drops to $767 by 2027: Year Tax savings for median income household of four in Wisconsin 2018 $2,081 2019 $1,956 2020 $1,889 2021 $1,819 2022 $1,749 2023 $1,076 2024 $1,018 2025 $903 2026 $827 2027 $767 The savings decline for several reasons, including: The family credit goes away after 2022; there generally aren’t inflation adjustments for the child tax credit; and the personal exemptions would be indexed to a different measure of inflation that increases more slowly. Our rating Ryan says that under the House Republican tax plan, in Wisconsin, "the median household of four gets about a $2,000 tax cut, on average." That’s true if the typical household Ryan describes claims a standard deduction on their taxes rather than itemizing deductions. The savings would be $2,081 -- in 2018. But many Wisconsin households at that income level would see a savings of several hundred dollars less because they would no longer be able to claim deductions such as one for medical expenses, which the House bill eliminates. Moreover, because of the way the House bill is written, even the household that saves $2,081 in 2018 would see that savings drop in each year, down to an estimated $767 in 2027. Ryan’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.

pomt-02993	"Virtually every person across this country has seen premiums going up and up and up" due to Obamacare.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/17/ted-cruz/sen-ted-cruz-says-premiums-have-gone-virtually-eve/	A few hours before the Senate voted to end a 16-day government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling, the lawmaker who played a leading role in precipitating the crisis, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spoke to reporters. Cruz’s mission had been to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law and, as he has from the start, Cruz listed the failings of the health care program. "President Obama promised the American people Obamacare would lower your health insurance premiums," Cruz said. "I would venture to say virtually every person across this country has seen exactly the opposite happen, has seen premiums going up and up and up." We received many requests to check this statement and so we’ll examine whether Obamacare meant that "virtually every person across this country ... has seen premiums going up and up and up." Not for the entire insurance market The new health care law takes a private market system and gives it an overlay of government rules. The private market has two major sectors -- the group market and the non-group, often called the individual market. About 60 percent of Americans under the age of 65 get their insurance through their employers.That’s the group market, where insurance companies write policies that cover a lot of workers all at once. One critic of the new law, Robert Laszewski, a health insurance consultant and head of Health Policy and Strategy Associates, says the new health care law has had little impact on people who currently get their insurance through their work. "In the large employer market where most under-65 folks are, the Obamacare increase is a very few percentage points, like 2 points," Laszewski said. Other experts we talked to echoed that point, without necessarily agreeing to Laszewski’s specific estimate of a 2 percent increase. The former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George W. Bush, Gail Wilensky, noted the health reform law has touched group coverage in certain ways, such as allowing children to stay on their parents' plan. "Some portion — albeit probably a very small portion — of all premiums probably have gone up as a result of these requirements," Wilensky said. So Cruz’s claim about what "virtually every person" has seen runs up against the realities of the marketplace. About two-thirds of Americans buy their insurance in the part of the market where Obamacare has had the least effect. Evidence of premium hikes Where Obamacare has been most active is on the individual side, which accounts for less than 10 percent of Americans with insurance. The health insurance marketplaces that opened with fits and starts this month are all about people buying coverage on their own. Obamacare requires most everyone to have insurance, says no one can be denied coverage for a pre-existing health problem and sets minimum standards for the services that policies must cover. It also offers subsidies to defray the cost of insurance for many people. For some, those changes can translate into higher premiums. From the earliest days of the debate over Obamacare, there has been general agreement that young people in the individual market would see the largest hit on their wallets. If they never had insurance, they would now need to pay for it. If they did have individual coverage, it would be more expensive. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank strongly opposed to Obamacare, did an analysis of the premiums offered through the health care marketplaces that opened this month. It found "the insurance on health exchanges will cost more than existing insurance." According to the Heritage computer simulation, young people in their late 20s and 30s will see the greatest increases. The study cited Vermont where it estimated that rates for a 27-year-old will go up 144 percent, but older adults would also see a hefty increase. This is just one study from a group that advocates conservative policies. Analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent group that enjoys broad credibility, have declined to compare rates before and after Obamacare on the grounds that good data is lacking. They said we don’t know what people in the individual market pay today and we don’t know what they will choose in the Marketplaces. However, the general idea that young people will pay more comes as no surprise to Sabrina Corlette, program director for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. "Young, healthy individuals who buy coverage on their own might see their rates rise, because they'll now be pooled with older sicker individuals," Corelette said. "But remember, these folks' premiums pre-ACA were kept low because plans were able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. We're now moving to a system that doesn't discriminate and that means that yes, some people might have to pay more." Also, there are early signs that some people who already buy on the individual market are vulnerable to the minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare. If their plans fell below that standard, some of them would get letters from their insurance companies telling them that higher premiums are in store. "I am hearing the actuaries talk about baseline increases of 30 percent to 40 percent," said Laszewski. These are the sort of trends that Cruz’s office pointed to when we asked them about his claim. Another important note is that health care premiums generally have been rising for years, regardless of the health care law. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average family premium for employer-sponsored plans rose by an average of 5.8 percent per year from 2008 to 2013. Before that, premiums actually were rising faster. From 1999 to 2008, premiums rose by an average of 13.2 percent a year, Kaiser found. Our ruling Cruz said Obamacare has led to premiums going up and up and up for virtually every person. Cruz was most inaccurate when he spoke sweepingly about most Americans. The fact is, the majority of Americans already have insurance and Obamacare has had little impact on their premiums. The people first in line to see the law’s effects are in the individual market. There, it is true that young adults, along with some older adults, are vulnerable to hefty premiums hikes, but as painful as that might be, their numbers hardly amount to "virtually every person." One final point: Cruz's comments don't take into account the many people who will get subsidies as they shop on the health care marketplaces. People making less than 400 percent of the poverty level will be eligible for subsidies. If these people have been able to afford to buy their own insurance before the law, then they should see substantial decreases in their premiums thanks to the new regulations and subsidies. Cruz is using inflated rhetoric. We rate his claim False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2013-10-17T17:19:44	2013-10-16	['None']

pomt-01300	Says his promise of 250,000 new private sector jobs was a "big goal."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/30/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-his-250000-jobs-promise-was-big-/	In a TV ad that sounds like a closing argument for the Nov. 4, 2014 election, a hoarse Gov. Scott Walker takes on Mary Burke’s criticism over private-sector job growth that has lagged behind the national average on his watch. "Before we took office, the policies my opponent supports cost Wisconsin 133,000 jobs," Walker says in the TV ad, which debuted Oct. 22, 2014. "We set a big goal of creating 250,000 jobs because I know Wisconsin can do great things." With just a couple months left in his term, private-sector employment has increased by 111,000, or about 44 percent of the 250,000 figure the Republican governor promised. The "big goal" statement is part of an effort Walker has made in recent weeks to cast his 250,000-job promise as bold and aggressive, while contrasting it with the dark days of the Great Recession. We’ve previously checked a Walker claim that the policies of his predecessor Jim Doyle (who appointed Burke as his Commerce secretary) caused the loss of 133,000 jobs in the Democratic governor’s second term from 2007 through 2010. We rated that Mostly False. The number is accurate, but the national recession was mainly to blame, not any particular governor. Wisconsin, in fact, fared somewhat better than the rest of the country during that major downturn. And, in any event, Burke left state government before the recession began. But what about Walker’s claim of the 250,000 promise being a "big goal"? "Big," of course, is an imprecise word. But what Walker is talking about has a clear statistical underpinning. That is, we can compare his goal -- and the growth it would have required to meet it -- with job growth in past four-year periods, both in raw numbers and as a share of the private-sector job base at the various times. The goal and the 2010 race In the 2010 race, Walker’s opponents made more modest promises. Republican Mark Neumann, who Walker defeated in the primary, pledged 300,000 jobs in 10 years. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, whom Walker defeated in the general election, promised 180,000 in three years -- a slightly slower pace than Walker’s pledge. Shortly after Walker’s November 2010 election, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Rick Romell found that "most recoveries since World War II have produced the rate of job growth needed to achieve Walker's goal." But "most" is not all, and that November 2010 story pointed out that unusually slow job growth has marked the last two recessions -- the one in the early 1990s and the Great Recession, which officially ran from 2007 to 2009. The recovery after the 2001 recession earned the label "jobless recovery." "But this one," economist John Heywood said at the time, referring to the Great Recession, "is putting that one to shame." A somewhat dissenting view came from retired chief state labor economist Terry Ludeman, who said a standard recovery should restore the recession’s job losses naturally. A closer look We decided to check the recent history ourselves, starting with Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson’s first term in 1986. After all, during the 2010 campaign, Walker cited that term as inspiration for his 250,000 goal. We relied on the quarterly employment data reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that private-sector employment grew by 233,000 in Thompson’s first term. And, significantly, that was the high-water mark in any administration since then -- or in any four-year period since 1986 regardless of whether it corresponded with a governor’s term in office. The next closest was 1991-’95 (232,000). So Walker’s goal topped actual performance over the previous quarter century, at least in raw number of jobs added. For perspective, in only six of the 24 periods we examined since 1990 did job growth top 200,000 over a four-year stretch. Notably, when Walker made his promise in 2010, the previous two periods were in the negative for growth, starting with 2004-2008 (-6,800) and 2005-2009 (-146,000). When he made promise in early 2010, the Great Recession officially was over and massive job losses had stopped, but Wisconsin was still losing jobs on a monthly basis. So reaching the 250,000 goal was far from a lock. But there’s another way to look at the numbers. Economies grow over time, and the employment base was one-third smaller in the 1980s than it was when Walker made his promise. That means that when 233,000 jobs were added in Thompson’s first term, that actually was better growth in percentage terms than what Walker assumed when making his pledge. The liberal Center on Wisconsin Strategy summed up its view this way: "Well, it is certainly a lot of jobs. But let’s keep it in perspective. Population has grown by about 2 percent since the beginning of the recession. To get employment back to its pre-recession level, we would need to create more than 270,000 jobs." Our rating Walker portrayed his 250,000 jobs promise as a "big" goal. The growth rates needed in a post-recessionary period to make that number happen were not uncommon after World War II. But that was not the case during the two most recent recoveries, and at the time Walker made the promise it had been nearly 15 years since the state had seen sustained growth at that pace. In raw terms, the 250,000 hoped-for gain was a bigger figure than the actual gains over any four-year period since at least the mid-1980s. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-03160	"Wind power is the most undependable form of renewable energy."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/sep/08/james-oneil/offshore-wind-power-critic-james-oneil-says-wind-p/	The debate over Deepwater Wind’s plans to build two wind energy projects in the waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts has raised several issues. Critics say the energy from the five turbines the Providence company initially plans off Block Island and the more than 100 turbines to be built farther offshore would be unnecessarily expensive. Former Rhode Island Attorney General James O'Neil, a lawyer who is fighting the projects, also questioned the reliability of wind energy when he appeared on the "10 News Conference" program that aired Sept. 1. "It's not about the green movement. It's about what I call the Green Bucks Movement," O’Neil said. "You have to consider the economic consequences of embarking on a mission which is going into the unknown. We do know a couple of things. We know that wind power is the most undependable form of renewable energy." That claim caught our ear. We know the wind doesn't blow all the time. But, then again, it does blow at night, when renewable solar energy can't produce electricity. So which form is less dependable? When we asked O'Neil for his data, he offered some documents that didn't actually compare the various forms of energy. One unpublished analysis offered no basis for that comparison. He also suggested some people to interview. As we learned, there's a lot of debate over the matter. When you ask the experts about dependability, they talk about several issues, among them the likelihood of mechanical breakdown, the availability of what we will loosely call "fuel" (which includes wind and sun), whether a source can generate power when it is most needed and, from a broader perspective, whether the power grid can quickly tap power from other sources to compensate when one source fails. Fossil fuel plants break down all the time, said Willett Kempton of the University of Delaware and coauthor of a 2012 study on integrating renewable energy into the power grid. When it comes to breaking down, "generally, wind turbines are more reliable than thermal plants" such as those powered by natural gas, coal or nuclear, he said. Solar cells, with few, if any, moving parts, are least prone to mechanical breakdown, giving it an edge over the renewable forms O'Neil was talking about. So a more relevant issue for renewable sources is the availability of fuel, particularly wind and daylight, which vary by location. (That's not a problem with renewable energy such as geothermal because the Earth is always giving off heat.) O'Neil, like other critics, argued that a key problem with wind power is its unpredictability, but Kempton said you can predict when the wind will be blowing. We note that the National Weather Service predicts both the amount of cloud cover and the average sustained wind on an hourly basis six days in advance. That brings us to a third element of dependability: whether the power is produced when you need it. William P. Short III, a New York renewable energy consultant who has testified against Deepwater’s Block Island project, said that's why wind is less dependable than solar. Solar usually produces power when the demand is highest, while winds kick up, at least on land-based wind farms, after dark, when demand is lower. But Michael Womersley, a professor of human ecology at Unity College in Maine, disagreed. "You tend to get more wind during the day than at night." The other experts we consulted said that's not important because other parts of the power grid can ramp production up or down to compensate. The ability of power plants to throttle up or down to respond to demand, and to do it quickly, is a fourth issue surrounding dependability. It's what experts call dispatchability, said Paul Roberti, a commissioner with the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. Fossil fuel plants are much more adept at that than wind or solar. In the end, we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which regularly analyzes various forms of electrical generation to assess cost and capacity. Its latest report, which looks at projects expected to be working by 2018, is billed as "a convenient summary measure of the overall competitiveness of different generating technologies." The report includes a measure of capacity, which spokesman Jonathan Cogan said is a way to gauge the reliability or dependability of the latest technologies. The higher the number, the more you should be able to depend on it for power, although the actual percentage will vary by region when it comes to renewable resources. Nuclear and fossil fuel plants typically have capacity factors ranging from 85 percent to 90 percent. But O'Neil was talking about renewable energy. In the EIA ranking, geothermal comes in at 92 percent, biomass is at 83 percent, hydroelectric power is at 52 percent, offshore wind is 37 percent, onshore wind is 34 percent, solar panels that generate electricity directly are at 25 percent and solar-thermal, where the sun heats a substance to generate power, is at 20 percent. So on a nationwide basis, wind power -- whether it's onshore or offshore -- operates at a higher capacity than solar, according to the EIA. In response, O'Neil said his "statement that wind is the most undependable form of renewable energy remains my opinion" and, in the competition between wind and solar, "it is rather a close call as neither is the most reliable form of renewable energy." Our ruling In terms of energy, dependability can mean different things to different people, and both solar and wind have their strengths and weaknesses. And the actual dependability of each technology is going to rely -- to quote the old real estate joke -- on three things: location, location and location. The only national ranking we found was done by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which takes various dependability measures into account. In that ranking, wind is less dependable than hydro, geothermal or biomass but more dependable than solar cells and solar-thermal. O'Neil made an unequivocal and over-arching assertion, but provided no useful support for it. The most convincing evidence we found says he's wrong. We rate his statement False.

pomt-11220	"Welders are coming out of their tech schools at $28 an hour" and "pipefitters are making six figures."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/may/10/adam-putnam/how-much-do-welders-and-pipefitters-make-according/	It’s no secret that Adam Putnam, Republican candidate for governor, is a fan of technical and vocational training. But what is a secret, according to Putnam, is how much money people make after getting the training. "Nobody is telling our students that welders are coming out of their tech schools at $28 an hour," Putnam said at the Florida Family Policy Council forum in Orlando on May 5. "They're not telling them that pipefitters are making six figures while their friends are getting a degree in European art history with $70,000 in student loan debt." Putnam isn’t the first Florida politician to talk up technical training and throw shade at students majoring in philosophy or anthropology (looking at you, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott). Was Putnam correct about how much welders and pipefitters make after graduating from technical schools? The answer depends on the type of school a student attends and the chosen industry after graduation. The more training you get, the more money you can make. And getting to the $28 an hour and six-figures mark that Putnam references usually applies to people who get additional certifications. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective, factual reporting reporting on issues that matter. Donate now to our Spring Campaign and go on the record as saying facts matter! Burn, baby, burn Putnam said welders coming out of technical school make $28 an hour. Putnam spokeswoman Amanda Bevis pointed to several welder job postings in Florida that offer $17 to $30, or $27 to $35 an hour, depending on experience. Reaching the top end of the salary range, however, requires additional training and certifications. It isn’t the typical salary for someone paid right out of 12 to 15 months or the typical training at trade schools. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for welders, cutters, solderers and brazers is $40,240 — about $19 an hour. The top 10 percent of welders earn $63,170, which is roughly $30.37. Debbie Hoy, program adviser at Erwin Technical College in Hillsborough County, said prospective welders who complete their program can make anywhere between $12 an hour up to $20 an hour right away. And at Manatee Technical College, a person who completed welding school can expect to make $15 to $20 starting out, said Gary Martin, a welding instructor. Once in the field, he said, there is the potential to make $28 an hour after completing additional certifications. For example, a welder can complete an education certification or engineering certification. Jack Jarrell, the business manager of Iron Workers Local 397 Union in Tampa, said if a person completes four years of training with the union, they can make up to $32 an hour. (Benefits not included, the pay is around $24.50 an hour). Going the union route is different than the technical schooling Putnam referred to. Still, Jarrell emphasized that the pay rate really depends on the industry someone enters after training, as some industries can afford to pay people more. "If you are building trailers in Perry, Fla., ($28/an hour) ain’t happening," Jarrell said. "But if you are working for a Tropicana factory, yeah I could see that." What about pipefitters? Are pipefitters making six-figures, as Putnam said? Pipefitters install, assemble and maintain pipes that carry various fluids, solids and/or gases. Welder and pipefitters are two separate careers, though some welders may be pipefitters and vice versa. Like welding, there are a wide range of career options for pipefitters and different avenues to become a professional. Careers include plumber, boilermaker and steamfitter. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters is $52,590, or $25.28 per hour. The top 10 percent of workers earned more than $91,810. While the top-earner estimate is just shy of the six-figure amount Putnam referenced, the industry professionals said they had anecdotal examples of a pipefitter making at least $100,000. Again, it depends on the industry, level of certification and the amount of ovettime a person works. Martin said someone who completes the advanced program at Manatee Technical College, which is geared toward pipefitting, can expect to make $22 an hour starting out. But, it’s possible they can make up to $120,000 a year. Our ruling Putnam said "welders are coming out of their tech schools at $28 an hour" and "pipefitters are making six figures." It’s unlikely someone just starting out as a welder or pipefitter will make as much as Putnam said. That said, people who work in the industry say it’s possible to make that much depending on the industry you choose and the amount of training you get. Putnam's figures are overstated for young workers in those fields. We rate this claim Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Adam Putnam	None	None	None	2018-05-10T09:00:00	2018-05-05	['None']

pomt-01812	76 percent of doctors support the use of medical marijuana	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/22/new-approach-oregon/do-76-percent-doctors-support-use-medical-marijuan/	An initiative proposing to legalize recreational marijuana in Oregon is headed for the November ballot. Signature verification by the Oregon Secretary of State’s office wrapped up Tuesday, with enough valid names turned in on petitions passed by New Approach Oregon to send the proposal to voters. The claim: The pro-pot group, on its Facebook page, recently posted a statistic indicating that physicians back the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. "Did you know...76 percent of doctors support the use of medical marijuana," reads the claim. PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: New Approach Oregon’s claim that more than three out of four doctors "support" medicinal use of marijuana was attributed to a May 2013 survey published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The poll was conducted online. Unlike scientifically designed surveys, those who responded were not chosen at random but rather volunteered to participate. We checked the survey, which asked doctors, hypothetically, whether they would prescribe marijuana to help alleviate the suffering of a 68-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer. The study’s authors, both physicians, wrote they were surprised by the outcome -- 76 percent said yes. Although participation in the survey was global, 1,063 of the 1,446 votes came from the U.S., Canada and Mexico. "Analysis of voting across all regions of North America showed that 76 percent of voters supported medicinal marijuana," the study’s authors wrote. The low end of support came from Utah, where only 1 vote in 76 supported medical pot. Pennsylvania represented the other extreme, with 102 of 107 votes in support. The study’s authors took a fairly specific situation -- the plight of a suffering 68-year-old -- and extrapolated the votes to indicate that 76 percent of physicians generally support medicinal marijuana. That’s a bit of a broad brush. However, the authors, Drs. Jonathan N. Adler and James A. Colbert, also noted that many votes came with explanations that went beyond that one hypothetical. "Many pointed out the known dangers of prescription narcotics, supported patient choice, or described personal experience with patients who benefited from the use of marijuana," they wrote. Those who opposed medical marijuana, by contrast, "targeted the lack of evidence, the lack of provenance, inconsistency of dosage, and concern about side effects, including psychosis." Invited by the authors to write a rebuttal, Drs. Robert L. DuPont and Gary M. Reisfield noted that marijuana can cause lung damage, further harming anyone who already has breathing problems. We checked for additional national surveys assessing physicians’ views toward medical marijuana. The most prominent effort was published April 2, 2014, on WebMD’s website. Of 1,544 doctors surveyed, 69 percent said marijuana can help with certain treatments and conditions; 67 percent said it should be a medical option for patients; and 56 percent supported making it legal nationwide. The survey, drawn from doctors representing more than 12 specialty areas, reported a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent. However, as with the New England Journal of Medicine survey, this effort was voluntary, self-selected and unscientific. The survey and poll come as 23 states, including Oregon, and the District of Columbia have now legalized medical marijuana, with eight of those states signing on in just the past three years. We contacted the Oregon Medical Association to see where Beaver State physicians stand on the issue. "We don’t recommend participation in medical marijuana," Gwen Dayton, the organization’s general counsel and vice president for health policy, wrote in an email. "If a physician wants to, fine, but if they ask us whether they should or not, we don’t recommend it." Asked about the national survey, Dayton said, "They are an esteemed publication. I’d never say anything they print is nonsense." The American Medical Association takes much the same view. While the association is calling for more research into marijuana’s effectiveness as a medical option, it has no language that would give doctors a green light to prescribe it, Kelly Jakubek, the AMA’s public information officer, wrote in an email. We called Liz Kaufman, New Approach Oregon’s campaign director. She said the journal of medicine’s article was posted on New Approach’s Facebook page not because the statistic is viewed as a scientific finding, but because it brings attention to the issue. "This was a study published in the journal, not conducted by it," Kaufman said. "Nor was it a telephone survey. It came from a self-selected set of doctors who gave opinions as individuals. We weren’t making a statement about the New England Journal of Medicine. This is just an article we’re bringing attention to." New Approach Oregon’s stated reason on Facebook was to highlight that its measure wouldn’t change anything regarding medical marijuana. "Our campaign knows that doctors know what’s right for their patients," the post reads. "That’s why the New Approach initiative makes no changes to Oregon’s medical marijuana program." The ruling: New Approach Oregon, a group backing an initiative to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the state, claimed on its Facebook page that "76 percent of doctors approve of medical marijuana use." The figure comes from an unscientific survey published in one of the country’s most reputable health publications. Participants chose to take part and were not drawn from a random sample. New Approach Oregon offered no nuance with its posting, including the fact that the study was not scientific, nor that it was based on a single hypothetical example. The associations representing most physicians in both Oregon and the U.S. are making no such call, at least for now, that marijuana should be a treatment option for doctors. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False. Thoughts on our ruling?

pomt-11763	Says that "perpetrators of domestic violence accounted for 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016, according to the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety."	false	/texas/statements/2017/dec/02/eddie-rodriguez/domestic-violence-not-confirmed-precursor-mass-sho/	An Austin legislator’s imperfect citation of a study led us to gauge whether domestic violence can reasonably be considered a predictor of mass shootings. Answer: No. In a Nov. 9, 2017, email blast to constituents, Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez noted that the shooter at the church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, leaving 26 people dead, had been convicted years before of beating his then-wife and young stepson. According to news accounts, Devin P. Kelley subsequently served a year in a Navy brig. Rodriguez’s email blast said the Texas shootings led him to suggest steps "we can take," among them: "Strengthening existing laws and ensuring they’re implemented correctly to keep guns out of the hands of criminals." Parenthetically, Rodriguez said next that "perpetrators of domestic violence accounted for 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016, according to the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety." Domestic violence and mass shootings Rodriguez’s linkage made us wonder, in part because Everytown’s research drew wide mention after the Texas shootings. A Nov. 6, 2017, New York Times news story quoted Billy Rosen, the group’s deputy legal director, saying: "We have seen over and over this pattern where in these notorious mass shootings, it is a very common thread where the person had a particular history of domestic violence. A history of this particular kind of conduct may really demonstrate that someone has dangerous propensities and should not be allowed to have guns." Time magazine similarly quoted the group’s Sarah Tofte saying: "You could think of domestic violence as a canary in the coal mine for future violence. We may not know everything we need to know about why and when it reverberates outside the home, but we know that it does, and we’ve seen it over and over again." However, the relevant April 2017 report from the Everytown group doesn’t offer data linking past domestic violence to the likelihood of anyone becoming a mass shooter. Rather, the report says that "in 54 percent of mass shootings, the shooters killed intimate partners or other family members." We asked Rodriguez about this contrast. In reply, he conceded in a letter that his email blast lacked clarity. "As I read your question," Rodriguez wrote, "I can understand how my language could inadvertently imply that 54% of mass shooters also had a history of domestic violence, as opposed to the analysis' findings that 54% of the incidents were directly related to domestic violence. "I agree that my language was unclear," Rodriguez wrote, "as ‘perpetrators of domestic violence’ could be read as shooters who had committed domestic violence in the past or, as I meant it, as shooters who perpetrated domestic violence when they ‘shot a current or former intimate or family member.’ While grammatically vague, I had no intention of misrepresenting the group's findings." The legislator’s claim and clarification made us wonder what data actually show about mass shooters having domestic violence backgrounds. April 2017 report The Everytown report says the group drew on news stories, FBI figures and police and court records (in 76 instances) to identify 156 mass shootings in the study period--including 85 (54.5 percent) in which the perpetrator "shot a current or former intimate partner or family member." Mass shootings can be defined in different ways. The Everytown group tallied shootings involving four or more victims, not counting the shooter. In the report’s appendix, which summarizes each identified shooting, we spotted 13, or 8 percent, that occurred after a domestic dispute or in which the shooter had previously been charged with or linked to domestic violence. Around the same time, though, criminologist James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University professor, found more domestic violence links to the shootings catalogued by the group. Fox said in a USA Today commentary published after Rodriguez sent out his email blast that of Everytown’s 85 listed shootings in which a person shot a family member, 41 percent were preceded by other acts of domestic violence. More broadly, Fox wrote, 25 percent of all the men listed as committing mass shootings showed "any indication of prior domestic violence." We asked Fox to share the specifics behind his percentages. By email, he said we’d need to get the spreadsheet directly from the Everytown group. Its spokeswoman, Phoebe Kilgour, had earlier emailed us a sheet lacking entries specifying prior domestic violence charges or convictions. Kilgour, asked for more detail, said the limited information was "what we're comfortable sharing at this point." Separately, Lisa Growette Bostaph, a Boise State University criminologist, responded to our inquiry by saying that her review of Everytown’s information delivered domestic-violence counts matching what Fox reported; she also provided her annotated review of what Everytown listed. By email, Bostaph also cautioned against dwelling on whether mass shooters have documented backgrounds of domestic violence, writing: Parsing "out whether or not a protection order was granted or a criminal charge resulted in a conviction is ignoring everything that we know about domestic violence: that victims are often manipulated and controlled by fear to rescind requests for protection and criminal charges; that victims are often silent about the domestic violence out of fear of involving others who may later be threatened or hurt; fear of angering the perpetrator and risking further violence for "bringing others into our business"; fear that the perpetrator may lose their job and the victim cannot provide for their children on their own; fear that, by leaving their abuser, they could be risking their abuser having custody or unsupervised visitation with their children who are often witnesses to the violence and/or abused themselves. This means that, if the domestic violence victim is also a victim in the mass shooting, we may never know if there was a history of domestic violence. But, does that really matter, when the end result of that relationship was the ultimate act of domestic and/or family violence?" A ‘mass killing’ compilation Fox otherwise alerted us to an ongoing USA Today compilation of U.S. mass killings, drawing from FBI figures plus police and news reports. When we examined it in November 2017, it showed 271 mass shootings of four or more victims from 2006 through Nov. 5, 2017. We sorted those figures to find that 129 of the shootings, or 48 percent, involved family killings including 13 of 23 Texas mass shootings. The day that we looked, the latest listed Texas mass shooting involving family had occurred in Houston in April 2017; a single mother shot and killed four people including her mother and sister. That compilation doesn’t filter out shootings involving a shooter with a domestic violence history. But Fox connected us with Emma Fridel, a Northeastern doctoral student who’s conducted more detailed research rooted in USA Today’s compilation. To our inquiry, Fridel summarized her findings in an email stating that from 2006 through 2016, the country experienced 205 solved mass murders exclusively involving firearms. Of those, Fridel said, she found that 41, or 20 percent, involved one or more perpetrators with a history of domestic violence. (See Fridel’s full analysis, published in early November 2017, here.) Fox, summing up, said: "You could certainly say about half the cases of mass shootings are extreme incidents of domestic violence," which in itself persists as "a serious problem," Fox said. "But it’s not generally a precursor to mass murder," he said. Report: Domestic disputes precipitated a fifth of ‘mass public shootings’ Separately, Time's story after the Texas shootings led us to experts including Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis, who by email pointed us to a 2015 report on U.S. mass murders by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. According to the CRS report, in the 15 years from 1999 through 2013, the United States saw about 8.5 familicide mass shootings per year on average. From another vantage point, the report says, a domestic dispute of some type was allegedly a precipitating factor in roughly a fifth (21.2%) of "mass public shootings," or at least 14 of 66 such incidents. Four other mass public shooting incidents could also be characterized as familicides, the report says, in that a spouse or former intimate partner murdered four or more family members--in each case in a public space. Time’s article also drew us to interview Susan B. Sorenson, who directs the Evelyn Jacobs Ortner Center on Family Violence at the University of Pennsylvania. By phone, Sorenson endorsed Everytown’s statistic--that 54 percent of its catalogued mass shootings were acts of domestic violence. Sorenson also told us there’s not research cementing a cause-and-effect link between someone committing domestic violence and later shooting and killing four or more people. "That’s all speculative," Sorenson said. "We just don’t have that information." From a public health perspective, Sorenson commented, the focus should be on reducing gun violence. She said there are angry men "who abuse women all over the globe. What makes us different is the guns." Our ruling Rodriguez wrote that according to an Everytown study, "perpetrators of domestic violence accounted for 54% of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016." Rodriguez’s statement incorrectly suggests that domestic violence was a precursor to 54 percent of mass shootings. The research he cited did not confirm as much. Rather, it says 54 percent of such shootings involved a person shooting multiple family members. Other research suggests that about 20 percent of individuals who committed such shootings from 2006 through 2016 had a history of domestic violence. We rate Rodriguez’s claim False.

pomt-08125	The national debt grew an estimated $15 billion last weekend.	true	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/09/mark-warner/sen-mark-warner-estimates-national-debt-grew-15-bi/	U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner says Washington must spoon out foul-tasting medicine to ease the nation’s debt. The Virginia Democrat is urging the White House and congressional leaders to consider strong doses of spending cuts and tax increases brewed this fall by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The recommendations, which include trimming or ending the deduction for home mortgage interest, were set back last Friday when they failed to receive a super majority of votes needed on the bipartisan commission to advance them to Congress. Warner, who is not a member of the commission, says the proposals could reduce long-term debt by an estimated $4 trillion over the next decade. "The seriousness of our nation’s fiscal challenges -- the compelling need to address these issues in a responsible and bipartisan way -- did not suddenly dissipate or magically disappear over the course of the weekend that just ended," Senator Warner said in remarks on the Senate floor Monday. "In fact, since the Commission’s final meeting ended on Friday afternoon, the national debt -- the running tally of what the United States government owes -- has increased by an estimated $15 billion." That’s a sobering credit card tab for a weekend, so we looked into the numbers. Asked for a source, Warner spokesman Kevin Hall sent us a national PolitiFact story that looked at a claim by Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., that the debt increased more than $1.7 billion during an 11-hour Wimbledon match in June.. That story looks at the change in debt in a couple of ways. One way uses the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the president's budget, which was released in March. This predicts a $1.368 trillion deficit for 2010. If you divide this by 365 days, you get an incremental, daily addition to the debt of $3.748 billion. Over three days, the total is $11.244 billion. That doesn’t quite live up to Warner’s claim. Another way uses the Office of Management and Budget’s historical tables for federal debt. These tables list the federal debt as it stands every year on Dec. 31. If you take the debt estimate for the end of 2010 ($13.787 trillion) and subtracted the debt as it stood at the end of 2009 ($11.876 trillion) you can determine the debt increase over the course of 2010 ($1.911 trillion). Dividing by 365, you get a daily debt increase of $5.236 billion, or about $15.7 billion over three days. So by that token, Warner’s correct that the debt could increase by an "estimated" $15 billion over three days. We thought it would be interesting to see if it actually had. Unlike the previous PolitiFact story, which relied on an average because it measured a span of hours, Warner’s three-day time span can be checked using official debt figures from the U.S. Treasury. The Treasury keeps historical debt to the penny figures for each business day. We looked at the change from Friday ($13.834 trillion) to Monday ($13.835 trillion). So in reality, not even close. Without rounding, the debt increased only about $1.3 billion over the weekend -- almost $14 billion short of Warner’s claim. Joyce Harris, a Treasury Department spokeswoman with the Treasury’s Bureau of Public Debt, said these numbers are "absolute," with accountants measuring inflows and outflows, and added that calculations based on averages are entirely unsafe due to fluctuations. "Keep in mind that bonds and securities are being redeemed all the time," she said. "Debt accumulation is pretty random," agreed Marc Goldwein, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan New America Foundation. "It isn't even linear from month-to-month, let alone day-to-day. In fact, even in this world of trillion dollar per year deficits we have days and weeks when debt goes down...A small snap shot in time is not a very useful indicator of the debt’s trajectory." Let’s recap. Based on daily debt calculations using Office of Management and Budget data, Warner’s absolutely correct. Looking back using the Treasury’s actual debt figures? Not so much. But we can’t say Warner was off by nearly $14 billion for two reasons: 1) the Treasury’s official numbers aren’t released until one business day after the date they reflect, so he couldn’t have known Monday’s debt figure on Monday, and 2) he is careful in his wording to point to "estimates" rather than claim the figure is correct for that specific period of time. So we find his claim to be True.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2010-12-09T12:16:32	2010-12-06	['None']

pomt-05970	"Speaker Gingrich for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate" for health insurance.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-calls-newt-gingrich-longtime-support/	In the ongoing contest to determine which Republican presidential candidate is "sufficiently conservative," former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum rattled off a list of issues where Newt Gingrich comes up short. One of the marks against the former House speaker, Santorum said in a primary debate on Jan. 23, 2012: Gingrich "for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate." The individual mandate is a requirement that people buy health insurance and is the centerpiece of the national health reform legislation signed by President Barack Obama. It is now almost universally maligned by Republicans. But, as PolitiFact has found before, it wasn’t always the target of Gingrich’s scorn. Going back to 1993 When we first looked into this, we were checking a statement made by Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann in a December 2011 debate. Bachmann, who later bowed out of the presidential race, said Gingrich backed the mandate at two different times -- in 1993 and in 2011. Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Oct. 3, 1993, at a time when the Clinton administration was trying to pass a health-care overhaul. On the May 15, 2011, edition of Meet the Press, host David Gregory replayed a clip from Gingrich’s 1993 appearance that addressed the individual mandate. "I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance." He went on to criticize Clinton’s plan as "destructively big-government." But he also said, "I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that." And since then Gingrich has addressed the individual mandate numerous times since 1993. In 2005, he took part in a health care discussion with none other than Hillary Clinton, saying people should have to buy insurance or post a bond to pay for future care. (Check out the video here.) Quick comparison: an individual mandate requires people to buy insurance or pay a fine in the form of tax penalties. The bond idea also requires people to buy insurance, and if they don’t, to put up money to be set aside to pay for their future medical care. Gingrich repeated his support for a bond in a 2007 column for his think tank Health Transformation, writing, "in order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond." And again in his 2009 book "Real Change: the Fight for America’s Future": "Those who oppose the concept of insurance should be forced to post a bond to cover costs. Allowing individuals to pass their health costs on to others reinforces the attitude that their health is not their problem and adds to the irresponsible, unhealthy behaviors that bankrupt the current system." By the time he appeared on Meet the Press in May 2011, he was calling this concept "a variation" on the individual mandate. "Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care . And, and I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond … or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable," he said. (That remark stirred up so much controversy in Republican circles that Gingrich was compelled to issue a video statement the next day clarifying that he is "completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals. ... I'm against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone, because it is fundamentally wrong and, I believe, unconstitutional.") Working out the details of a bond system to pay for future health care -- such as how much would need to be set aside and how -- poses challenges. "A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in (Mitt) Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game," said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable." Our ruling Santorum said Gingrich "for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate." We found no references earlier than 1993, when Gingrich said "I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance." In the years since, he made repeated statements asserting that people who don’t purchase insurance should have to do so or to post a bond, a concept he calls "a variation" on the mandate. While the specifics of Gingrich’s viewpoint on the individual mandate have shifted -- ending with his opposition to it now -- it’s clear that for most of two decades he planted himself comfortably on the spectrum of compelling people to have health insurance. That’s enough to rate Santorum’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-01-24T12:59:07	2012-01-23	['Newt_Gingrich']

pomt-03364	"A little-known unit of the Department of Justice, the Community Relations Service, was deployed to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/jul/12/judicial-watch/judicial-watch-says-department-justice-unit-organi/	To the right-leaning crowd, it’s the latest blight against the Obama administration. Citing a public records haul, Judicial Watch says the Justice Department’s "Community Relations Service" responded to escalating racial tension in Sanford, Fla., following Trayvon Martin’s shooting death by helping "organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman," his shooter. Sanford police did not arrest Zimmerman because he said he was acting in self defense, churning outrage among the African-American community and national civil rights leaders. But two months later, a special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Rick Scott announced second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman. His trial on those charges was this week, and a verdict is expected soon. Amid the trial, Judicial Watch released the results of federal and state public-information requests it received regarding CRS involvement in Sanford. CRS workers applied for various reimbursements for working in Sanford from March 25-April 12, 2012, Judicial Watch announced July 10, 2013. The group said it obtained the information from a Freedom of Information Act request filed around that time. In a separate "investigative bulletin" post touting the findings, the group went further, saying the "group actively worked to foment unrest, spending thousands of taxpayer dollars on travel and hotel rooms to train protesters throughout Florida." "These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman," president Tom Fitton states in a news release. "My guess is that most Americans would rightly object to taxpayers paying government employees to help organize racially-charged demonstrations." The news sparked outrage among conservative sites, including the Heritage Foundation and The Daily Caller, and attracted mainstream attention at CNN. The Rush Limbaugh Show went with the headline "Obama Regime Organized Trayvon Protests." We wanted to take a closer look. Did the Justice Department team really organize rallies against Zimmerman? The Community Relations Service bills itself as the Justice Department’s "peacemaker," established in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and intended to resolve local conflicts grounded in race. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009 broadened the agency’s charge to include unrest dealing with sexual orientation, religious bigotry or disability. CRS requested a $12 million budget for 61 positions for the 2012-13 fiscal year. Responding to hate crimes and police-community relations typically dominate the agency’s work, according to annual reports. After the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, CRS employees responded to attacks against Muslim and Arab-American communities. Some of the ways the unit works to calm potential riots is by sending its employees to help officials or volunteers manage tense situations when police use force against citizens or when there are major demonstrations or school disruptions, according to the agency’s website. Sometimes they draw up mediation agreements to help parties move forward. News accounts portray CRS employees responding to trouble as inconspicuous, secretive bystanders. They’re not part of the chaos, but quietly monitoring it (usually in navy blue windbreakers, dark sunglasses and caps embroidered with the DOJ logo, according to the Orlando Sentinel). Judicial Watch includes links to travel vouchers it received as part of its FOIA request to build the case that the DOJ team helped organize anti-Zimmerman rallies. The vouchers do not include much information beyond travel and lodging expenses, the date and location of the trip, and a short description of the purpose. The employee’s name is among redacted information. In an interview, Fitton said the voucher costs seem reasonable, but his group still objects to public funds being used to deploy the CRS to Sanford in connection with the protests. Here’s a sampling: "On March 25-27, 2012, CRS deployed to Sanford, FL to work marches, demonstrations and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African American teen by a neighborhood watch captain." Amount paid to voucher: $674.14. A similar itinerary for March 30-April 1, 2012, says, "CRS was in Sanford, FL to provide technical assistance to the City of Sanford, event organizers, and law enforcement agencies for the march and rally on March 31." Voucher cost: $751.60. CRS went to Altamonte Springs on March 30-April 1, 2012, "to provide interregional support for protest deployment in Florida." Total voucher: $751.60. "On April 3-12, 2012, CRS was in Sanford, FL to provide technical assistance, conciliation, and onsite mediation during demonstrations planned in Sanford." Total voucher: $1,307.40. The CRS was contacted by a senior project manager for the city of Sanford as community dissent reared up, according to news reports. A key player in the Sanford controversy is Thomas Battles, the CRS southeastern regional director who has acted as a neutral party in dicey racial issues for three decades, including the Elián González custody case. He does not talk to the media, per CRS policy, but his work has not gone unnoticed. The mayor of Sanford called him "a voice of reason" in the tumultuous weeks following Martin’s death, according to a Miami Herald profile of Battles. Battles did not organize protests, as Judicial Watch claims. His team did meet with organizers and city officials to make sure protests happened peacefully, news stories show, and he helped the city draft a nine-point plan aiming to foster better communications between police and residents. As Judicial Watch points this out, Florida newspapers report he also secured police protection for a group of students who marched 40 miles from Daytona to Sanford over three days. The student group staged a sit-in in front of the Sanford police department’s doors, causing it to shut down for the day. Fitton said helping them get there was inappropriate. Battles also organized a league of local pastors, known as Sanford Pastors Connecting, to help the community move on regardless of the verdict in Zimmerman’s case. Fitton said he remains convinced the Department of Justice unit went too far in siding with the Zimmerman protesters. He pointed to a local pastor’s comments in the Orlando Sentinel about the peacekeepers, saying, "They were there for us," and "We felt protected." But the point of the program was to take steps to avoid exacerbated confrontation that could have cost the taxpayer even more money in the long run, said Robin Davis, director of the University of Florida’s Institute for Dispute Resolution. "I don’t think there’s any cause and effect between this mediation and the prosecution going forth," she said. Our ruling Armed with public documents, Judicial Watch said the Department of Justice sent the Community Relations Service to Sanford in the wake of Martin’s death "to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman." Judicial Watch’s statement contends an element of truth: Justice Department employees were sent to Sanford, in part to deal with community uprising, including protests. But they were sent with the idea of keeping the situation peaceful and calm, not to instigate or condone protests or violence. That’s a critical distinction being ignored in this particular claim. We rate it Mostly False.\ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this fact-check wrongly attributed the misspelling of "foment" to Judicial Watch. That was our mistake, not theirs.

pomt-13489	"I cast the deciding vote extending Medicaid health care coverage to 50,000 of our fellow citizens,"	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/sep/08/colin-van-ostern/was-colin-van-ostern-deciding-vote-medicaid-expans/	New Hampshire’s next governor will have a say in whether the state continues its Medicaid expansion program, which covers nearly 50,000 low-income residents and is set to expire in 2018. Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern pledges to support the program, and touts his background on the subject as proof. "As a member of the Executive Council, I cast the deciding vote to extend Medicaid coverage to 50,000 people," Van Ostern wrote in a mailer sent to voters recently, a point he has repeated on the campaign trail. "I cast the deciding vote extending Medicaid health care coverage to 50,000 of our fellow citizens," Van Ostern said in a WMUR debate the week before the primary. Was Van Ostern the program’s savior? We decided to take a look. New Hampshire’s Legislature approved a bill in 2014 to expand Medicaid for roughly two years to cover low-income adults making less than 138 percent of the poverty level. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan signed the expansion, also known as New Hampshire Health Protection Program, into law that March. As an Executive Councilor, Van Ostern had no participation in that pivotal vote. Many credited Republican leaders in the House and Senate for the vote because a few broke from their party and sided with Democrats in favor of expansion. The Executive Council had a say on the program later that year, when the Department of Health and Human Services brought forward a $292 million contract amendment to pay for and implement expanded Medicaid. The five-member council is in charge of approving state agency contracts that exceed $25,000. The council in 2014 was made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, who presides over the council, urged members to pass the agreement. When she called the roll, all three Democrats voted by voice vote for the contract. The two Republicans opposed it. Was Van Ostern the deciding vote? Not really. Campaign spokesman Matt Trojan said without Van Ostern’s support, Medicaid expansion wouldn’t have passed. But that’s not entirely accurate. The council’s vote was on a contract that allowed the two health care providers to move forward with the program that had already been approved in law. At the time, Van Ostern himself said it was already a done-deal. "There are legitimate policy disagreements, but this has been decided. This has been through the legislative process," Van Ostern said. And the "deciding vote" argument is even more dubious. The claim has typically been used as an attack against Democrats who voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act, including New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. In that case all 60 Democratic votes -- including Shaheen’s -- were needed to pass the measure through the Senate. However, Shaheen, unlike others, was hardly a holdout until the last minute; she gave indications early on that she supported the president’s reform plan. Those claims were typically rated Mostly False. By the same token, the other two Democrats on the Executive Council have equal claim to the deciding vote title. Generally, calling someone "the deciding vote" implies he or she played a pivotal role, such as withholding support or opposition until the last moment. Expanded Medicaid received strong support among Democrats, and as the council’s controlling party, the contract wasn’t expected to fail. Before the vote, Van Ostern and another Democrat both stated they planned to support the agreement. Our ruling Executive Councilor and candidate for governor Colin Van Ostern said he "cast the deciding vote to extend Medicaid coverage to 50,000 people." The Executive Council voted in favor of the contract that allowed expanded Medicaid to go forward, but the vote to approve the program already passed the legislature with bipartisan support. Van Ostern was one of three Democrats who voted for the contract and stated his support ahead of time. Since he did not have a direct vote on the law, and didn’t change his position, we rate his claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7a2e65d7-e114-43f6-882c-5c2c06211bb6	None	Colin Van Ostern	None	None	None	2016-09-08T12:37:53	2016-09-06	['None']

pomt-01518	"When I left office, there was a $7-million surplus in Providence," but in 2008, the city had a $110-million deficit.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/sep/21/vincent-buddy-cianci/ex-mayor-cianci-says-providence-had-7-million-surp/	"A lot can change in a city after 12 years without leadership," Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci says in the first TV commercial he’s released as part of his latest campaign for mayor of Providence. In the 30-second spot that started airing Sept. 10, 2014, Cianci draws a number of comparisons between the state of Providence when he left office in 2002 (for a federal prison cell) and the state of the city in the years that followed. We can sum up his message pretty succinctly: things were good when he was in charge and bad under his successors. "When I left office, there was a $7-million surplus in Providence," Cianci says as the left side of a split screen with the year 2002 at the bottom displays an official-looking letter. As he speaks, the right side of the screen, with the year 2008 at the bottom, reads, "$110 Million Deficit." That was when David Cicilline, now one of Rhode Island’s two U.S. representatives, was in his second term as mayor and before Angel Taveras took office. It’s no secret that Providence’s finances have been in dire straits for much of the last decade, but did the city really plummet into such a deep hole just six years after Cianci’s last year in office? Cianci told us that the first part -- the surplus when he stepped down -- was taken from an Aug. 23, 2002 letter sent to him by Alex Prignano, then the city’s Finance Director. In the letter -- the one that’s shown during the commercial -- Prignano said that the city had a surplus of $7.3 million as of June 30, 2001, the most recent audited numbers at the time. And, added Prignano in the letter, "Fiscal 2002 has just ended and though unaudited, the surplus is anticipated to be once again over $7.0 million." Prignano, it turned out, was right. The surplus had grown in the 2002 fiscal year, rising to $8.3 million as of June 30 of that year, according to city financial reports. (See page 11 of this report.) In respect to the surplus, Cianci was a little conservative in the commercial. When he left office it was actually higher than he claimed. So what about the second part of the claim? Did the deficit really reach $110 million in 2008? Cianci told us that he pulled that number from Providence Journal stories on the city’s precarious financial state after Taveras took over from Cicilline in 2011. Those stories, as Cianci correctly noted, were based on a report on city finances commissioned by Taveras when he took office. That report, which was compiled by a four-person panel of financial experts that included Prignano and former state Auditor General Ernest Almonte, projected a structural deficit in the city in the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the first full fiscal year of the Taveras administration, of $110 million. We’ll get to the reason why they used the word "structural" in describing the deficit, and the importance of that word, in a moment, but first, let’s point out that there’s an obvious discrepancy in the year of their projection -- 2011 -- and the year Cianci uses in his commercial -- 2008. "It didn’t happen overnight," Cianci explained. "It happened over the course of four or five years." By that logic, he argued, the $110-million figure in the report was just as true in 2008 as it was in 2011. The Taveras report doesn’t go back and assess what the structural deficit was in 2008 -- or whether there was one -- but it does look at the situation that the new mayor inherited from the Cicilline administration in the 2010-2011 fiscal year, estimating a structural deficit then of $70 million. Now let’s get back to why we keep using the words "structural deficit" and not just "deficit." We addressed this issue recently in another Politifact Rhode Island item that also focused on Providence’s finances. A person or an entity has a structural deficit if their projected expenses for the coming year exceed their projected income for the same period, Edward M. Mazze, former dean and current professor of business at the University of Rhode Island, said in that piece. In other words, it’s a forward-looking number. Knowing what could happen without action, the Taveras administration worked with city unions to bring down costs for the 2012 fiscal year. The result: a deficit of $11.4 million that year, far short of the projected $110-million structural deficit. So was Providence running a deficit, as the Cianci commercial says, back in 2008? The simple answer is no. After Cicilline took office in 2003, the city’s surplus grew steadily. It actually stood at $22.3 million as of June 30, 2008 -- nearly three times what it was when Cianci left office in 2002. In the years that followed, however, the Cicilline administration drastically reduced those reserves to balance the budget. It also took tens of millions of dollars in loans. Cicilline has blamed the Great Recession and said he had little choice but to use the money to make up for a loss in state aid and to replace one-time federal stimulus dollars. Others have said he acted irresponsibly. The end result was that by early 2011, a couple months after Cicilline left office, there was only $220,000 left in the account -- a meager amount for a city Providence’s size, but still a surplus. We pointed this out to Cianci. In response, he referred to concerns raised in 2009 about the city’s budget practices by James J. Lombardi III, then Providence’s internal auditor and the current city treasurer. At the time, he warned repeatedly that the city’s continued use of reserves to fund the budget was unsustainable. Cianci’s point is that the seeds of Providence’s financial problems were planted around 2008. "That’s when the deficit started to build," he said. Some, including Cicilline and Taveras, have contended that the problems actually began during Cianci’s tenure when the city failed for years to make adequate contributions to its pension fund. (See page 9 of this actuarial report.) We asked Lombardi if he ever estimated a structural deficit for the city before Taveras took office. He couldn’t give a definitive answer, saying that his records from that period have been archived. But he did say that his concerns were probably more narrowly focused. Our ruling In a TV commercial, former Providence Mayor Cianci says, "When I left office, there was a $7-million surplus in Providence," but in 2008, the city had a $110-million deficit. That certainly sounds dramatic. But it’s not entirely accurate. While he was right about the surplus -- it was actually a little higher than he claimed -- he was wrong about the deficit. There’s an argument to be made that some type of structural deficit existed in 2008, but pegging that number at $110-million is a big leap. And Cianci’s claim ignores the difference -- a big one -- between a deficit and a structural deficit. Finally, the ad implies that things were rosy under Cianci and went downhill after he left. That ignores the future problems he caused by underfunding the pension system, the effects of the Great Recession, and the strides Taveras made to bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. The judges were split on this one, but ultimately ruled Half True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-12993	"Germany managed to increase its use of renewables and its output of carbon dioxide at the same time -- because it resorted to cheap coal to keep the lights on at a price its people could afford."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2016/dec/15/jeanne-ives/illinois-energy-debate-ives-german-anecdote-mostly/	On Dec. 1, the last day of the fall veto session, the Illinois General Assembly passed a controversial bill that provides $2.35 billion in ratepayer-funded subsidies to prevent two Exelon-owned nuclear power plants from closing. The legislation also includes up to $220 million a year in funding for the development of renewable energy resources like wind and solar, a provision that won over environmental advocates because it beefs up the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard. While the Future Energy Jobs Bill garnered strong bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner the following week, 56 lawmakers voted against it, with many arguing it would result in higher energy prices. During a floor debate, one of these opponents, state Rep. Jeanne Ives, R-Wheaton, lamented that the bill ignored the free market and favored special interests, including huge profitable corporations and green energy companies. Ives argued the strengthened wind and solar mandates within the legislation would drive up energy prices and wouldn’t improve the environment. As an example, she pointed to Germany, a country widely hailed as a world leader in renewable energy production. "Germany managed to increase its use of renewables and its output of carbon dioxide at the same time — because it resorted to cheap coal to keep the lights on at a price its people could afford," she said. Does Ives’ statement hold true? We checked the record to find out. Cost of clean energy Ives, who argues the energy overhaul ignores the the movement away from wind and solar in Europe, cited an April op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by business columnist Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., who’s also a member of the newspaper’s editorial board. The statement Ives made on the House floor is practically identical to what Jenkins writes. In the article, Jenkins claims the reason Germany saw an increase in carbon emissions despite boosting its use of renewables is because wind and solar are "only competitive to the extent that fossil-fuel plants remain on hand to provide backup power" when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining. Jenkins then addresses the "fight" happening in many states across the United States, saying it "concerns the exorbitant costs imposed on other ratepayers to subsidize backup power for solar adopters." Ives also provided a link to a report by the Institute of Political Economy at Utah State University, which includes a case study about Germany’s solar industry. However, it should be noted one of the authors, Randy Simmons, has ties to the fossil fuel industry and the oil-based conglomerate Koch Industries, which has been accused of trying to undermine the nation’s clean energy push through lobbying efforts. According to the study, Germany’s residential electricity prices increased by about 50 percent between 1998 and 2015, in part because of subsidies provided to renewables like solar. The authors note Germany has begun to phase out solar subsidies because of high costs, despite solar being the country’s desired goal for its energy portfolio. "The German government is not alone in paying large sums of money on behalf of solar power. Because solar power is intermittent, traditional electricity producers have had to make substantial changes to their plants to handle the fluctuating electricity demands," according to the report. A November 2015 article published in The Economist about Germany’s energy market, explains that because electricity generated by wind and solar is free at the margin, "green-power producers offer it for next to nothing in wholesale markets." The next-lowest bids typically come from nuclear power stations, followed by lignite (brown) coal-burning plants, hard coal and then gas-fired power stations. Energy companies begin accepting the lowest bids and once the day’s requirement has been filled, successful bidders are paid the highest price required to clear the market, according to the article. "The surge of solar and wind power is pushing down the clearing price and bending Germany’s energy market out of shape. Power stations burning natural gas increasingly find no takers for their electricity, so they sit idle," reports The Economist. "Meanwhile the cheap, carboniferous lignite power stations burn on." Carbon causes Despite renewables accounting for one-third of power generation in 2015, Germany saw a 1.1 percent increase, or 10 million tonnes, in carbon dioxide emissions when compared to 2014, according to the think tank Green Budget Germany. A higher demand for heating oil and diesel due to cooler temperatures, as well as the use of lignite coal for power generation, were attributed to the slight rise in CO2 emissions. However, the reason dirty coal continues to comprise a significant portion of Germany’s energy portfolio dates back to a social movement and government program against nuclear power that began in the 1970s called the Energiewende, which means "energy transition." The movement was reinvigorated by the Chernobyl accident in 1986, and then again by Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011. In the wake of Fukushima, Germany set an aggressive goal to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2022, while boosting its use of renewables and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. Andrew Barbeau, a senior energy consultant for the Environmental Defense Fund who played an instrumental role in negotiating and crafting the Exelon bill, said there is a "huge corollary" between Illinois and Germany. Barbeau, who recently was in Germany, said Ives’ statement brings up about two-thirds of what’s happening with regard to the country’s energy transition. "It’s a lot about carbon, it’s a lot about fossil fuels, but it’s more about getting rid of nuclear," Barbeau said. "What the environmental groups have been saying… is if you close nuclear plants prematurely without having enough renewables on the grid to replace them, then you’re going to see new coal and gas plants built." Part of the reasoning around the Exelon bill, Barbeau says, was to keep the nuclear plants online until there is enough renewable capacity on the grid to replace them so no new coal- and gas-fired power stations have to be built. "The large driver of those carbon emissions -- and this is what was very clear to the environmental organizations involved in the Illinois debate -- is if you get rid of nuclear too soon, then all of a sudden you have new coal and gas, and carbon emissions will go up," Barbeau said. "And that’s exactly what happened in Germany." Like in southern Illinois where coal provides 40 percent of electricity for consumers, coal comprises 42 percent of power generation in Germany, and thousands of Germans are employed in lignite coal mines. In March 2015, attempts to regulate lignite-burning power stations through carbon taxes were met with fierce opposition from miners and others within the coal industry. Instead, German officials this past spring decided to mothball and decommission eight lignite power stations while compensating plant operators for lost profits. Germany’s federal economics and energy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said this will allow the country to take 13 percent of lignite coal capacity off the market in the coming years, and help meet its carbon emissions target, reports Clean Energy Wire. Our ruling State Rep. Jeanne Ives said, "Germany managed to increase its use of renewables and its output of carbon dioxide at the same time because it resorted to cheap coal to keep the lights on at a price its people could afford." In 2015, renewable energy accounted for nearly one-third of Germany’s total electricity generation, compared to 25.9 percent in 2014. During this same time period, carbon dioxide emissions rose slightly by 1.1 percent. While subsidies for wind and solar is part of the reason Germany’s residential consumers have seen electricity prices rise 50 percent between 1998 and 2015, the country’s aggressive push to eliminate nuclear energy by 2022 has been the main driver behind the coal and carbon comeback. Prematurely closing down nuclear power plants without having enough renewables on the grid to replace them led to an uptick in the use of lignite coal and therefore carbon emissions. As of 2015, coal supplied Germany with 40 percent of its power total power generation, even though renewables’ share surged to 30 percent. This statement is accurate, but requires additional context about Germany’s energy transition.

The record indicates that Clinton has been an advocate for expanded health benefits for National Guard and Reserve members. In 2005, she was one of 23 co-sponsors for legislation sponsored by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina that would allow reserve troops to enroll in Tricare, a Defense Department managed health care program. (Statements on Clinton's Web site don't mention that she was one of many co-sponsors.) The legislation didn't pass, but much of its substance was adopted in the 2007 defense authorization bill. The tone of her ad suggests she was a key player in the passage of the bill, but the record indicates that Graham took the lead in the effort, and she was one of several supporters. So while it's fair for her to say she was an advocate for expanded benefits for Guard and Reserve members, the statement would be more accurate if it indicated she was one of many.

pomt-05633	"And the revenue generated by drilling off Virginia’s coast? $40 million over 10 years."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/23/jim-moran/moran-says-dilling-virginias-coast-will-net-4-mill/	U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, recently spoke on the U.S. House floor against drilling off the shores of Virginia, saying the small amount of government money it would produce is not worth the environmental risk. "And the revenue generated by drilling off Virginia’s coast? $40 million over 10 years," he said on Feb. 15. We wondered about Moran’s seemingly low estimate for revenues, recalling predictions made by many drilling advocates -- including Gov. Bob McDonnell -- that Virginia’s government stands to gain at least $250 million a year. So we looked into the congressman’s claim. Moran was railing against H.R. 3408, which would authorize drilling federally owned oil shale and calls for leases in several coastal regions, including Virginia. Many state officials, including McDonnell and Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jim Webb, support offshore drilling, saying it could provide needed jobs, energy and money for the state. Virginia was included in the federal government’s offshore drilling plan last decade. But President Barack Obama rescinded that in 2010, canceling the sale of leases of 4 million acres off Virginia’s coast after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. A bill that would have allowed drilling 50 miles or more off Virginia’s coast died in the House of Representatives last May. Moran’s office, to back the congressman’s claim, used the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for that bill in arguing against H.R. 3408. The CBO report does say that the federal government will collect only $40 million over the next 10 years. But the analysis, ordered by the House Committee on Natural Resources, is confined to a tiny portion of the government revenue that drilling could generate. Should the Virginia coastal waters be opened for drilling, oil companies would submit bids to the Interior Department for leasing space on the ocean floor and upfront bonus payments they would make to the government for the right to test and drill. The CBO’s $40 million figure is merely an estimate of the bonus payments that would come from drilling off Virginia’s coast, according to Spencer Pedersen, a spokesman for the House Interior Committee. The CBO has not projected other government revenues the venture would produce. The big money, however, would start once oil production began, likely toward the end of the decade. Companies would pay royalties to the federal government that are expected to generate tens of millions of dollars annually during the early years of drilling, and many hundreds of millions of dollars down the road. Energy companies pay the federal government an 18.75 percent royalty on offshore oil and natural gas production. Typically, royalty payments represent about 90 percent of federal revenue from leasing activity on public lands. Virginia officials are hoping for a 37.5 percent cut from all of the offshore drilling payments to the federal government--bonus bids, lease payments and royalties. The federal government shares 37.5 percent with Gulf Coast states. A number of steps must occur, however, before money, oil or natural gas starts flowing. Congress must approve legislation, such as H.R. 3408, that would include the ocean floor off Virginia in a leasing plan, and the president must sign it. Obama, during his State of the Union address early this year, called for increased U.S. oil production and endorsed new lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska’s northern coast. But the president has not indicated whether he’s willing to lift his 2010 moratorium on Atlantic Coast drilling. Should the Virginia coast become part of the plan, the CBO report says the lease sale would not likely occur until 2015. Next, the winning companies would need to map the ocean floor and explore the resources with a few test bores. If the tests were successful, the companies would request a permit from the federal government to build an oil rig. All those steps take time; experts, including a consultant for the American Petroleum Institute, said drilling wouldn’t start until at least 2018 or 2019. There are wide-ranging estimates of the potential government revenues from drilling off Virginia’s coast. We tried to come up with our own number using middle-of-the-road projections for the cost of energy and the amount of offshore resources. The Energy Information Administration’s projection for inflation-adjusted price of a barrel of oil through 2035 is $137.02. Natural gas for the same period is expected to have an average cost of $6.53 per thousand cubic feet. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimated in 2011 that the seabed in the Atlantic Ocean caps 3.3 billion barrels of oil and 31.28 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The Virginia coast comprises about 10 percent of the Atlantic shore, so if the resources and revenue are distributed proportionally, and we assume a 37.5 percent share to the states, the federal government would receive average $410.3 million annually and pay Virginia a $153.8 million cut. The governor’s estimates of annual state revenue of about $250 million uses energy industry estimates based on the upper end of oil and natural gas resource projections. But both estimates are an average annual amount over 30 years of production; it would take more than a decade for production to ramp up, according to the API consultant. In the early years of drilling, the state should expect to realize less than a fifth of the revenues that would come in when oil rigs hit full production. There’s one more big if: The 2011 estimates of the quantity of oil and natural gas in the region are based on surveys that are 40 to 50 years old. There’s really no way to know how much is under the shelf until exploration is done. Our ruling Moran, opposing legislation that would open Virginia’s coast to drilling for oil and natural gas, said the venture would generate only $40 million in government revenue over the next 10 years. The Democrat based his claim on a CBO report but misinterpreted what it said. The $40 million figure refers to a minor source of the revenue Virginia and Washington would share: upfront bonus payments energy companies would give the federal government for the right to test and drill. Beyond the $40 million, the companies would pay to lease space on the ocean floor. But more importantly, Moran omits that the companies would pay royalties on the offshore oil and gas they produced, which make up about 90 of the revenues for federal and state governments. In the early years of drilling, which could begin in 2018 or 2019, the royalties could produce tens of millions. Down the road -- beyond the 10-year period Moran addressed -- the royalties could translate into many hundreds of millions annually. Nothing is certain about drilling off Virginia’s coast, but Moran misused a very limited projection to create a misleading characterization of the venture’s potential. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Jim Moran	None	None	None	2012-03-23T11:53:30	2012-02-15	['None']
pomt-03766	"The average student in Florida, what they actually pay out of pocket at our major universities" for tuition is as much or less than what they spend on cellphones.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/apr/03/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-compares-tuition-costs-cellphone-/	Let’s talk tuition. College tuition increases are a no-go with Gov. Rick Scott, who wants to keep the cost of living low for families. House Speaker Will Weatherford, on the other hand, thinks Florida students are getting a great deal and can afford to pay a little more. Weatherford explained his views at a meeting of the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees state universities, on March 28, 2013. The board’s student member, Cortez Whatley, asked Weatherford why the House recommended a 6 percent tuition increase for state universities. Florida’s tuition is "48th" lowest in the country, Weatherford said. (Quick fact-check: It ranks 41st in 2013. Weatherford has since corrected himself.) "Let me put in perspective something for you that no one’s talking about that should be talked about in this debate," he said. "The average student in Florida, what they actually pay out of pocket at our major universities, I believe all universities, is about the same amount of money as they spend on this." He held up his iPhone. "We’re more than willing to negotiate with our friends in the Senate and the governor, but we think to just take tuition off the table and ignore the fact that we’re ranked so low, and ignore the fact that our students are spending more on cellphones to some extent than they are on tuition, is not right," he said. Students spend as much on tuition as their cellphone? We thought it didn’t sound right. We admit to being a little surprised by what we found. Tuition in Florida Florida’s average price for undergraduate tuition and fees at a public university is $6,069 in 2012-13, according to the Board of Governors. That’s up from an average of $5,531 in 2011-12. Tuition used to be even lower but public universities have been bumping up tuition to offset steep budget cuts. As a result, the price tag for tuition at a four-year public university in Florida jumped 67 percent over the past five years. Florida’s five-year percentage leap for tuition was one of the highest in the country, according to the College Board’s 2012 Trends in College Pricing report. Still, most in-state students don’t pay full price. Many receive scholarships, grants and other financial aid. Once you factor in "gift aid" such as Bright Futures and Pell grants, a student’s out-of-pocket expenses for tuition and fees comes down. Weatherford’s spokesman and the Board of Governors sent us system-wide averages for gift aid versus what students actually paid in tuition and fees for 2011-12. This is for an in-state undergraduate student taking 15 credit hours of courses each fall and spring semester. So the average financial gift amount per full-time, in-state undergraduate student for the school year is $4,646. The average amount of what a student actually paid out-of-pocket for tuition and fees is about $400. The out-of-pocket expense varies widely by family income. Students whose families earn below $60,000 -- and comprise about 44 percent of the university system -- don’t pay out-of-pocket for tuition on average because they receive more gift aid based on need. Many of the students in this income bracket are paying for college independently of their parents, said College Board policy analyst Kathleen Payea. Students whose families earn more receive fewer dollars in gift assistance and pay between $1,500 and $2,000. The amount a student shells out for tuition and fees also varies at each state university. The average student at Florida A&M and Florida Atlantic University, for example, does not pay out-of-pocket for tuition and fees, according to data from the Board of Governors. On the other end of the spectrum, a student at the University of Central Florida pays an average of $1,600. At the University of Florida, the average is $248. You might be wondering, that’s it? Keep in mind this analysis excludes other types of financial aid, such as loans, that students must pay back, as well as money their parents paid in through the Florida Prepaid college savings program. It’s worth noting the average student faces thousands more in expenses that go to the total cost of attending a university -- books, transportation, room and board. At the University of South Florida in Tampa, for example, the average 2012-13 cost of attendance for a full-time, in-state student not living with his or her parents was $20,390. For in-state commuter students, it’s about $16,000. Still, Weatherford was careful to specify tuition. Payea said Weatherford’s comparison about cellphone bills and tuition is awkward, as paying for higher education is a long-term investment unlike a monthly discretionary item like a phone. Still, his example may help defray fears about college costs. "Sticker prices appear to be high, but there are so many subsidies," she said. We’ll note that the state changed Bright Futures eligibility requirements, primarily higher test scores, to make the scholarships harder to get. A University of South Florida analysis determined the changes will most likely reduce the number of black and Hispanic freshmen getting the scholarship, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The price of cellphones Now we turn to the second part of our analysis: the cost of cellphones. About 86 percent of U.S. residents said they have one, according to the Pew Research Center. Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy directed us to a September 2012 Wall Street Journal story in support of his claim. If Weatherford’s point is cellphones are affordable (like two semesters of in-state tuition), the story’s headline does not reinforce it: "Cellphones are eating the family budget." The story describes how the increasing costs of cellphones force families to scrimp elsewhere. Costs are going up even more in the next few years as wireless providers figure out how to make data even faster and more accessible on new networks. The story cites Labor Department data showing annual household spending on phone services (not isolated to just cellphones) was $1,226 in 2011, up from $1,110 in 2007. An estimate from J.D. Power and Associates puts it even higher for this year, showing the average wireless bill reported by consumers to be $111 as of March 2013 (or $1,332 for the year). Those annual bill totals are more than the system-wide average for out-of-pocket costs for tuition and fees (again, about $400). If you isolate cash-paying students, the total tuition bill actually exceeds a year’s worth of cellphone bills, but not dramatically so. Our ruling Weatherford defended his call for a tuition hike before the leaders of the state university system by saying students spend more on cellphones than "what they actually pay out of pocket at our major universities" for tuition. We found his point is accurate if you compare the average out-of-pocket cost for all schools against the average cellphone bill, but there are caveats. Remember, he’s just talking about tuition, not the many other costs involved with a student’s degree. For the cash-paying families that comprise a majority of the system, the comparison is a little off, with students paying more for tuition than the average cellphone. Others spend a lot less on tuition, or a lot more, depending on their university. More than one-third of Florida’s public university students receive enough merit- and need-based financial aid that they do not pay anything for tuition and fees. Weatherford’s claim is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Will Weatherford	None	None	None	2013-04-03T10:28:59	2013-03-28	['None']

pomt-09403	Marco Rubio is a "Miami lobbyist."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/22/charlie-crist/crist-and-democrats-say-rubio-miami-lobbyist/	The Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign, trying to capitalize on the public perception that lobbying is unseemly, describes Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio as a "Miami lobbyist" or "Miami Lobbyist-Politician" in its campaign literature. One recent reference appeared in a March 15, 2010, press release that carried the following headline: "Marco Rubio: Can Florida Afford A Miami Lobbyist-Politician Who Laughs At Ethics?" In the release, the word "lobbyist" was mentioned three times in reference to Rubio. The Florida Democratic Party also labels Rubio as "a lobbyist" in its press releases. In a March 21 statement e-mailed to reporters, the Democrats twice referred to Rubio as a "lobbyist" in criticizing him for not standing up to Tea Party activists. "Looks like Lobbyist Marco Rubio isn’t the only extremist Republican afraid to stand up to the Tea Party’s racial and homophobic slurs today," said the release, which included a story from Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, noting racial slurs hurled against members of Congress as they arrived to the House for the vote on health care reform. So was Rubio a Miami lobbyist? And is he still a Miami lobbyist? We first went to the Miami City database of lobbyists and found no such evidence, and called Miami City Hall as well. A clerk there searched and said there is no Marco Rubio listed as a lobbyist as far back as they keep records – to 2003. Next we went to Miami-Dade County, a separate, larger jurisdiction. It has an elaborate Guide to Lobbyist Registration that outlines "applicable laws governing lobbyists doing business with the government of Miami-Dade County." The procedures include registration, fees as well as a reporting requirement for when a lobbyist is no longer representing a client. There we found that Rubio registered seven times: three times in 1997, a year after he got out of law school, on mundane zoning and code enforcement efforts; twice in 1998 on behalf of a real estate effort and something called the American Sales & Management Org.; and once each in 2001 and 2002 as agent for companies listed as the Main Line Corp., a computer equipment company, and Pan American, a developer. Miami-Dade lobbyist registrar Keith Knowles told us the paper records of that period have since been destroyed – a common county hall practice, with no backup to microfilm or microfiche. But he said the county database still reflects accurate lobbyist filings, and that Rubio filed a form closing out his record as a lobbyist on May 31, 2005. (He served in the Florida House from 2000-2008.) So technically Rubio ceased to be a registered lobbyist with the county on May 31, 2005. But in fact, says Knowles, county records reflect that Rubio paid his last registration fee on April 26, 2002 -- $125 to represent Pan American, and did not renew the required lobbyist’s fee in October of that year, when his two-year $500 registration expired. To provide a little context, it appears that Rubio did some lobbying a year after he got his law degree and while serving as a commissioner in West Miami, a small city in the county. He kept his file active at County Hall during his first five years with the Florida Legislature although he did not have any lobbying clients after 2002. Rubio did some of this work while at the Becker & Poliakoff law firm. So we checked with partner Alan Becker, who confirmed that the last two registrations -- Pan American and The Main Line Corp -- were during Rubio's August 2001-June 2004 tenure there. Becker told us, "I think it's a stretch to say he was a lobbyist. He was a lawyer representing clients who had issues involving government. But the law doesn’t distinguish and requires you to register as a lobbyist." Rubio came to Becker's firm after working for Tew Cardenas, a well-connected lobbying and legal firm. While with Becker, Rubio rose to be majority leader in the Florida House. When Rubio left Becker's firm, for the Miami firm of Broad and Cassel, which did not lobby in Tallahassee, Rubio was in line to become speaker of the Florida House. Becker said the lobbying work done in 2001 and 2002 were "very short representations" before the county and that Rubio was primarily an attorney. "As far as I was concerned I hired a lawyer who represented clients who often had governmental issues and that required you to register as a lobbyist." (Becker gives to Republicans and Democrats and has contributed money to both the Rubio and Crist campaigns.) But Alex Burgos, Rubio's campaign spokesman, the lobbyist claim is a "silly" attack. In a statement last month to the Miami Herald, he said that Rubio "worked as an attorney for law firms that did Request for Proposal (RFP) and land use work in Miami-Dade County." "Out of an abundance of caution, law firms engaged in this type of work often register their lawyers as lobbyists. In fact, all lawyers representing clients on land use matters are supposed to register as lobbyists. While Marco worked on land use contracts and RFPs, he never met with elected officials to influence them on behalf of clients,'' he told the Herald. So, we find that it's quite a stretch for Crist's campaign to call Rubio a "Miami lobbyist," which conjures images of a high-priced lawyer representing fat-cat clients in Tallahassee or Washington. But that's misleading in two ways. The Crist campaign and Florida Democrats use the present tense, indicating that Rubio is a lobbyist. But he formally withdrew nearly five years ago. Also, his work was not what we traditionally think of as lobbying -- the Gucci-wearing attorney who seeks to influence the state Legislature or Congress. He worked at the local level, primarily on zoning matters. So we find the claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-03-22T18:07:42	2010-03-15	['Marco_Rubio', 'Miami']

pomt-05293	"Over the past five years the federal government has paid out $601 million in retirement and disability benefits to deceased former federal employees."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/23/brendan-doherty/ri-congressional-candidate-brendan-doherty-says-fe/	Brendan Doherty, like a lot of candidates, says if he’s elected to Congress in November he’ll put a stop to "rampant fraud and waste" in government spending. On his campaign website, the Republican candidate for the First District seat and former head of the Rhode Island State Police, says he’ll use his years in law enforcement to "shine a light on the unconscionable abuse of hard-earned taxpayer funds." Among examples of abuse he lists are the purported millions of dollars in pension benefits the federal government distributes each year to federal retirees who are, well, dead: "Over the past five years the federal government has paid out $601 million in retirement and disability benefits to deceased former federal employees." We’ve heard stories of dead people voting before, but are they also getting hundreds of millions in pension payments? We called Doherty’s campaign to find out where the candidate got his information. Spokesman Robert Coupe told us he thought the $601 million figure was pretty large when he first heard it from campaign staffers. He said it came from "Wastebook 2011," the latest edition of an annual compilation of questionable government spending put out by Sen. Tom A. Coburn, R-Oklahoma. We checked "Wastebook 2011," which indeed mentions "over $601 million" paid out to deceased federal workers in the last five years, with footnotes citing the source: a report issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s Office of the Inspector General, titled, appropriately enough, "Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased Annuitants." According to the Office of Personnel Management’s report, "the amount of post-death improper payments is consistently $100-$150 million annually." Some of what the federal government calls "improper payments" is outright fraud -- people with electronic access to the deceased’s bank accounts taking the money. And some of it is because the money was electronically transferred into what are now inactive bank accounts. The money can sit there piling up for years before anyone notices. Special efforts have been under way since at least 2005 to reduce payments going to dead retirees and their survivors, the report says. Those efforts have included matching the rolls of eligible recipients with the Social Security Administration’s death records on a weekly and annual basis, doing similar checks with the IRS to see who’s still filing returns, and random phone calls to retirees over 90 years old just to make sure they’re still around. Those steps have helped identify the scope of the problem, Susan L. Ruge, a spokeswoman in the Office of Personnel Management’s inspector general’s office, said in an e-mail. In fiscal year 2010, for instance, the office identified $116.8 million in improper payments going to dead retirees or survivors. But solving the problem is another matter. According to the Personnel Management’s report: "There remains a high probability that egregious loss of monies from the [civil service] fund will continue and require strategic corrective actions." It notes one case of a man illegally pocketing more than $515,000 by cashing in his dead father’s monthly retirement checks -- for 37 years. Ruge said 94 percent of annuity payments are transferred electronically into bank accounts as opposed to the older method of mailing checks. The office of inspector general, she said, has no breakdown as to payments stolen by others with access to those accounts and money lost by languishing into those unattended accounts. "In overpayment cases where no theft has occurred, there is greater potential for EFT (electronic fund transfer) overpayments to continue undetected, simply because no one is monitoring the deceased annuitant’s bank account," said Ruge. If there is good news in any of this it is this: while $601 million going to dead people in the last five years sounds like a lot of money, it represents less than 2.5 percent of all civil service retirement disbursements, the report claims. Our Ruling Doherty’s website says "Over the past five years the federal government has paid out $601 million in retirement and disability benefits to deceased former federal employees." The campaign accurately quoted a figure whose source is a report issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s Office of the Inspector General. We rate his statement True. Rhode Island’s former top cop is setting his bar of expectation pretty high if he’s promising to curb this kind of "rampant fraud and waste." We’ll be watching.

pomt-08388	On possibly raising the Social Security retirement age.	full flop	/texas/statements/2010/oct/24/bill-flores/bill-flores-says-he-has-consistently-opposed-raisi/	In France, the president’s push to raise the age at which residents qualify for retirement benefits incited violent protests. In Texas, a Republican candidate speculated about trying something similar here and protested his own remarks. Bill Flores of Bryan, the Republican challenger to ninth-term U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, said in an Oct. 12 TV interview that he didn't oppose raising the age at which seniors can receive Social Security checks to 70. "I'd have to look at what the actual economics are," Flores told WFAA-TV in Dallas. "I'm not philosophically opposed to raising the retirement age... I accept the fact that I may have to raise my retirement age for that." Flores' comment was politically daring, though it's not out of step with talk among Washington wonks. In July, the nonpartisan Urban Institute said in a fact sheet on retirement policy that increasing Social Security's retirement age "appears to be gaining political traction," noting that in June, the majority and minority leaders of the U.S. House "expressed willingness to raise the retirement age." On its sheet, the institute lists pros and cons to raising the retirement age. Currently, beneficiaries can receive reduced-benefit checks starting at age 62 or choose to get full benefits starting at age 66. In short, raising the retirement age would promote work at older ages, improve the Social Security system's solvency by shortening retirements and reducing lifetime benefits, and better target benefits to the oldest Americans, according to the institute. Among the pitfalls, a new hardship could be imposed on workers with health problems unless Congress improves other programs and raising the retirement age could strain low-skilled workers. Then again, Flores insisted shortly after the WFAA interview that he didn't mean what he said. Before the news clip aired on Oct. 17, Flores asked the station to not run it. According to an Oct. 15 news story posted on WFAA, Flores said he had a "headache" during the interview and "misspoke." Also Oct. 15, Flores issued this statement, according to WFAA: "Voters should be assured that I absolutely do not support raising the retirement age for Social Security." Three days later, according to WFAA, Flores was interviewed on College Station's WTAW-AM, saying: "I am philosophically opposed to raising the retirement age. I misspoke and said I was not philosophically opposed." In his own interview, aired by WFAA Oct. 17, Edwards said: "I would not vote to raise the retirement age to 70 because there are just too many Americans that work hard all their lives and just simply physically couldn't work until they are 70." Edwards subsequently lampooned Flores for backpedaling. In an Oct. 22 press release about the candidates' upcoming debates, Edwards spokeswoman Megan Jacobs said: "After claiming that a 'headache' caused Mr. Flores to say he is 'not philosophically opposed' to raising the Social Security retirement age to 70, we wonder if any ailments will sway his position at these upcoming debates." The same day, the Waco Tribune-Herald added fuel to the fire with a news story based on conservative radio host Shane Warner of Waco publicizing an April interview he had with Flores. In the interview, the audio of which Warner excerpted on his blog Oct. 19, Flores seems to agree that changing the retirement age should be considered. Said Warner: "And how do we do that, what specifically, I mean, do we raise the retirement age? Do we start cutting benefits? What do we do?" Flores: "I think almost everything has to be on the table... You've got to look at a way to grow the economy higher so that you have more tax revenues going into the system, you've got to look at different retirement ages that are based on today's lifespan, and you've also got to look at how we grow the Social Security trust fund itself." When we followed up with the Flores campaign, spokesman Matt Mackowiak sent a statement from Flores: "I am against raising the retirement age. I have been consistent in saying we have to grow our economy and create more jobs to fill Social Security's $16 trillion unfunded liability." Mackowiak told us that he doesn't think the April radio clip "disproves that." In a statement following the WFAA interview from the Flores campaign that Warner posted on his blog, Flores said: "I have consistently opposed raising the retirement age for Social Security." On the blog, Warner counters: "That's not true. He told me in the spring that changing the retirement age should be an option that's on the table to improve the system. Many Republicans talk tough about fiscal responsibility until the stuff starts to hit the fan." Our finding? Flores now says he firmly opposes raising the retirement age and has done so consistently. But twice he has said he's open to looking at raising it. Grab the aspirin. This is a Full Flop on the Flip-O-Meter. We have updated this story to correct the Social Security retirement age that Megan Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Rep. Chet Edwards, said Bill Flores said he is 'not philosophically opposed' to raising it to. Jacobs said that Flores said he 'is not philosophically opposed' to raising it to 70, not 80.

pomt-12405	"NASA will pay you $18,000 to stay in bed and smoke weed for 70 straight days."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/24/blog-posting/persistent-story-about-nasa-paying-people-18000-li/	An online story that claimed NASA pays people thousands to smoke marijuana in bed for months is actually a viral legend that has been in orbit for quite awhile now. "NASA will pay you $18,000 to stay in bed and smoke weed for 70 straight days," read the headline on a Jan. 2, 2017, post on TheSolExchange.com, a blog that is largely concerned with the latest developments in athletic sneakers. Judging by the number of commenters asking to be signed up, there also is an audience for marijuana studies. Facebook users flagged this post as possibly being fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to fight fake news in users’ social media feeds. "NASA has put out an ad looking for people who’re willing to take part in their ‘Rest Studies’ – a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD," the post read. "During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week." There are more details on the post, but you get the gist. We found versions of the same story on several other blogs going back to at least March 2016, all claiming NASA is doling out the big bucks for people who want to lounge all day and spark up. Pretty good hustle, right? Except it’s not true. Well, it’s true that NASA does perform bed rest studies. The goal is to examine the potential effects of weightlessness on astronauts, and lying in bed with your head tilted down at a six-degree angle is apparently a fair substitute. The studies sound pretty much as described at TheSolExchange.com — except for the cannabis part. Several media outlets like the Houston Chronicle, Forbes, Vice and CBS News have written in the past about the studies, which involve people getting paid something on the order of $1,200 per week for 15 weeks (that’s $18,000) to hang out in bed. But it’s not all that great of a time, from the sound of it. Boredom is a constant problem, as every moment of a volunteer’s life is spent in bed for that time. Scientists continually poke and prod them, taking readings and measurements on everything from weight to bone density. Volunteers are told when and what to eat, and have to do everything in bed. That means eating, exercising, showering and even, yes, using the facilities while lying down. A NASA spokesman told us that there have not been any sleep studies that involved consuming cannabis. There also aren’t any more sleep studies currently planned, so it’s not like NASA is suddenly going to try it the next time. Blog posts that have been saying that NASA is paying subjects $18,000 to lie in bed and smoke marijuana for 70 days are pretty far out.

pomt-08866	"Ninety-four percent of small businesses will face higher taxes under the Democrats' plan."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/04/randy-neugebauer/lawmaker-claims-democrats-want-hit-small-businesse/	We're in the middle of a recession, but Democrats want to raise taxes on small businesses. At least, that's become a popular conservative talking point as Congress gets ready to consider the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of 2010. Rep. Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, repeated the charge in a July 29, 2010 blog post on Townhall.com, a popular online forum for conservative editorials. "With 9.5 percent of the population unemployed, these higher taxes would come at a time when taxpayers can least afford it. The threat of the largest tax hike in history is creating widespread uncertainty for small businesses that could otherwise be creating jobs and expanding. After all, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 94 percent of small businesses will face higher taxes under the Democrats' plan. If their taxes are going to be higher, business owners are going to hold off on hiring and expansions. The unknowns for small businesses are simply taxing the certainty out of our economy," Neugebauer wrote. We were suspicious that taxes would increase for so many small businesses, so we decided to look into it. Neugebauer's office sent us a copy of a report issued by the Republican staff from the Congressional Committee on Ways & Means. The document, entitled "Democrats' Ticking Tax Bomb, Part I", states that "starting January 1, 2011 -- less than six months from now -- an unprecedented, $3.8 trillion tax increase is scheduled to kick in, affecting every American who pays income taxes." At the bottom of the first page is a reference to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan tax policy and revenue estimating resource for Congress. JCT estimated that in 2007, 94 percent of U.S. businesses were S corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships, which means that the business owners pay taxes at the individual tax rates, the document states. We first wanted to confirm that in 2007, 94 percent of businesses were S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. Indeed, in 2007, the last year for which data is available, there were a total of 32,087,881 businesses, according to data collected by the Internal Revenue Service. In the same year, there were also 3,989,893 S-corporations, 3,096,334 partnerships, and 23,122,698 nonfarm sole proprietorships. Do the math, and you get a little over 94 percent. But that's just about the only part of the statement that's accurate. It is true that if Congress takes no action, taxes will go up for every single tax bracket starting Jan. 1, 2011. If we assume that reporting income from an S corporation, a partnership, or a sole proprietorship means that one is a small business owner (more on that later), then 94 percent of "small businesses" will face tax increases. But there are multiple problems with such an assessment. First, Neugebauer's statement makes it seem as though the "Democratic plan" is to let all of the tax cuts expire. That is not the case. As we previously pointed out, Democratic officials have consistently said that they intend to let only the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals lapse. The cutoff they usually suggest is $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly. President Barack Obama's 2011 budget proposal sets the cutoff at $195,550 for individuals and $237,300 for married couples. In case you're wondering about the discrepancy, the $200,000/$250,000 figures reflect income in 2009 dollars (i.e. not adjusted for inflation in 2011) before deductions and personal exemptions. What impact would raising taxes on the top two income brackets have on small businesses? According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the same source that Neugebauer cited in his blog post, "In 2011 just under 750,000 taxpayers with net positive business income...will have marginal rates of 36 or 39.6 percent under the president's proposal." That translates into only 3 percent of all taxpayers with positive business income. Yes, you read that right. Only 3 percent of all taxpayers who reported having positive business income will see their taxes go up under the proposed Democratic initiative. We also consulted experts at the Tax Policy Center, a joint project from the liberal-to-centrist-leaning Brookings Institute and the liberal Urban Institute. James Nunns, a researcher at the Urban Institute, directed us to the center's July 2010 analysis of the distribution of business income by statutory marginal rate for the year 2011. The report assumes that Congress goes through with its plan to only increase taxes on individuals making over $200,000 and couples with over $250,000 in income. It turns out, 774,000 tax filers in the top two brackets --the only ones that will see a tax increase -- will have positive business income. Divide that by the roughly 36 million tax filers who report business income (positive or negative), and you get 2.1 percent. In other words, still assuming that having any amount of income from a small business means that you are actually a business owner (big assumption), only about 2.1 percent of businesses will face the prospect of higher taxes based on the Democratic proposal. Finally, as we suggested earlier, reporting income from an S-corporation or a partnership does not necessarily confer the title of small business owner. Anyone who earns money from a source other than a regular job -- for instance consulting or public speaking -- may report it as income from an S-corporation. So too might those who make most of their income from partnerships, such as law firms and medical practices. And it could include investors who have little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company. Consider that, in the highest income tax bracket, the average income of filers who report having some income from business is $718,827. In fact, the TPC analysis shows that in the second-highest tax bracket, only 26.2 percent of the tax filers reported that at least 50 percent of their income actually came from the business. In the highest bracket, the percentage is 32.5. Neugebauer said that "94 percent of small businesses will face higher taxes under the Democrats plan." The statement is problematic in several ways. First, it implicitly assumes that the Democratic plan is to let all of the tax cuts lapse, when, in fact, Democratic officials have consistently said that they intend to raise taxes only for the wealthiest individuals. Second, two independent studies that looked at the impact of the Democratic proposal on small businesses found that only between 2 to 3 percent of tax filers who report having what can be thought of as small business income will be affected. One of those studies came from the very source that Neugebauer incorrectly cited. Finally, reporting business income doesn't equal owning a small business, and data from the Tax Policy Center confirm that in the top tax bracket, only about a third of the tax filers report having at least 50 percent of their income from a business. We looked and looked for a shred of truth and couldn't find one, so we rate this Pants on Fire.	None	Randy Neugebauer	None	None	None	2010-08-04T18:02:43	2010-07-29	['None']
pomt-11938	"Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/12/donald-trump/sen-bob-corker-responsible-iran-deal-donald-trump-/	President Donald Trump escalated a war of words with Sen. Bob Corker by blaming the Tennessee Republican for the Iran nuclear deal Trump has long derided. The dustup between Trump and Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, comes as Trump weighs sending a formal criticism of the deal to Congress. Under the accord, Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The deal was signed in 2015 by the United States, Iran and other world powers — and according to Trump, Corker played an outsized role in its creation, too. "Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal," Trump wrote in an Oct. 8 tweet, hours after Corker tweeted that the White House "has become an adult day care center." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to take a closer look at Corker’s role in the brokering the agreement. Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act Trump’s claim is contradicted by the fact Corker vocally opposed the deal that would eventually emerge from negotiations with Iran in July 2015, and urged Republican colleagues to oppose it, too. The deal "leaves the United States vulnerable to a resurgent Iran wealthier and more able to work its will in the Middle East," Corker wrote in an August 2015 opinion piece in the Washington Post. "Congress should reject this deal and send it back to the president." Corker himself voted against the deal, though Republicans ultimately lacked the votes to reject it. When asked how Trump could say that Corker was responsible for the deal, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said a bill Corker sponsored paved the way for the Iran deal and gave it credibility. "Sen. Corker worked with (Democratic House Leader) Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation, and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal," she said in an Oct. 10 press briefing, adding, "He not only allowed the deal to happen, he gave it credibility." The legislation Sanders was referring to is the Corker-sponsored Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. After initial resistance from President Barack Obama, the bill passed with overwhelming majorities in both chambers, and was signed into law in May 2015. Corker’s office described the law as enhancing Congress’ authority to review any nuclear agreement with Iran before allowing a president to lift congressionally-imposed sanctions. So if Corker’s law aimed to give Congress more say over the agreement, what to make of the Trump administration’s assertion that it paved the way for the deal? "This is astonishingly wrong," said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar on global energy policy at Columbia University, who previously served as the lead sanctions expert for the U.S. team negotiating with Iran during the administration of President Barack Obama. "The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act gave Congress the most direct way of killing the deal, quickly and easily." Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, also said the Trump administration was way off the mark. "It is ludicrous to argue that Senator Corker and Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act are responsible for delivering the nuclear deal with Iran," she said. "If anything, (the law) nearly prevented the deal's implementation and undermined the agreement." The Trump-Corker feud comes at a time when the Iran deal faces intense scrutiny. By law, the Trump administration must report to Congress on the deal every 90 days, including whether Iran is complying, and if it’s in the U.S. national security interest to continue sanctions relief. The next deadline is Oct. 15, and experts say Trump may decline to certify the deal on national security grounds. Decertifying the deal would not immediately kill it. Rather, it opens the door for Congress to quickly reimpose sanctions. Our ruling Trump said, "Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal." Corker sponsored legislation to enhance Congress’ authority to review the Iran nuclear deal before allowing the president to lift congressionally-imposed sanctions. He also vocally opposed the deal, urged lawmakers to reject the agreement and voted against it. We don’t see how this could reasonably be construed as Corker giving the United States the Iran deal. Trump’s claim doesn’t make logical sense. We rate this False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-10-12T14:19:25	2017-10-08	['None']
pomt-14776	"In almost every other country in the world, artists and musicians are paid when their music is played on the radio. In fact, the only countries besides the U.S. who do not have a radio-performance right are China, Iran and North Korea."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/dec/07/kevin-russell/kevin-russell-shinyribs-says-singers-not-paid-when/	A singer records a song, a radio station plays the song and the singer gets a little extra money for that, yes? Not in this country, Kevin Russell of Austin said in an opinion column in the Oct. 28, 2015, Austin American-Statesman. Russell, who leads the band Shinyribs, said U.S. radio stations "don’t compensate the artists and musicians who make the music played by those stations. That needs to change. In almost every other country in the world, artists and musicians are paid when their music is played on the radio. In fact, the only countries besides the U.S. who do not have a radio-performance right are China, Iran and North Korea." We wondered if the U.S. shares this distinction with just those countries. U.S. law has long provided for composers to be paid for over-the-air radio play, we learned, but the actual performers have never gotten money for radio play, the industry premise being that each time a song airs, the performer could get a lift in record sales. Significantly, federal law was revised in 1995 to require services that stream music to pay performers for what goes out over the Internet, though on-the-air or terrestrial radio stations were exempted, according to a February 2015 report by the U.S. Copyright Office pointed out to us by Melissa England, a California public relations executive who responded when we asked Russell how he reached his list of countries. The report, which calls for the exemption to be removed, says that internationally, the U.S. is an outlier; a footnote says: "Only a handful of countries lack" what’s called a radio performance right. In "addition to the United States, the list includes China, North Korea, and Iran," the footnote says. A secondary impact, according to the report, is that other countries do not compensate U.S. performers whose works air on their stations, costing record companies and artists an estimated $70 million to $100 million in annual royalties. England put us in touch with her client, the Recording Academy, which oversees the GRAMMY awards, and Daryl Friedman, a Washington, D.C.-based officer for the group, told us by email that Russell was correct about four countries that don’t provide radio-performance rights. according to research compiled by the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group for recording companies, and verified by industry groups including SoundExchange, Inc. However, Friedman said, other smaller countries take similar approaches. He said the countries that, like the U.S., don’t pay radio performance rights include Bangladesh, Congo, Gabon, Indonesia, Kuwait, Micronesia, Niger, Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe. " I think you get the point the writer was making," Friedman said. "The U.S. stands out." Friedman further said the "U.S. is the only country that is a member of the OECD (Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development—modern, free-market nations), that does not provide a performance right on terrestrial radio. All of the other countries included in this organization that do provide performance rights are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom." We emailed and called the recording association in hopes of learning how its list was compiled and didn’t get an answer to that. Separately, a Washington, D.C.-based advocate called Russell’s claim "essentially correct." Kevin Erickson of the Future of Music Coalition, a nonprofit that says it supports a "musical ecosystem where artists flourish and are compensated fairly and transparently for their work," added by email: "For a variety of reasons, it can be difficult to get complete information on which countries pay for the performance right. Iran and North Korea do not currently pay. China is a bit more ambiguous right now; there may have been a deal struck. We've also gotten some conflicting information on Afghanistan and Rwanda." Following up, Erickson said China still doesn’t pay radio performance royalties and that holds too for the other countries named by Russell. Afghanistan, he said, passed a copyright law in 2008 and might be paying performance royalties and Rwanda appears to be doing so. Erickson said it’s hard to proceed in some countries partly because an infrastructure doesn’t exist to collect and distribute payments. "The U.S. is certainly unique among western industrialized countries" in not paying performers for radio play, Erickson said. Another view Supporters of the existing law say changing it would be a bad move. An undated post on the National Association of Broadcasters website calls radio "the number-one promotional tool for record labels and performers. Free radio airplay provides the record industry increased popularity, visibility and record sales for both established and upcoming artists." If the law were changed, resulting in what the association calls a "performance tax," local stations would be slammed, risking jobs, the post says. Notably, it also says, "numerous radio companies and record labels have negotiated private deals of their own that compensate copyright owners and performers, demonstrating the ability of the marketplace to best address the issue." To our inquiry, an association spokesman, Dennis Wharton, agreed by email that most countries pay radio performance royalties. Then again, he said by email, "most of those countries have state-run broadcasting" and aren’t "nearly as successful as the U.S. We believe the reason the music business and the radio business in the U.S. are wildly successful is because local radio stations are not required to pay onerous fees to record labels and performers." Wharton suggested many performers get money from songs played on radio stations thanks to having or sharing a writing credit on the material. "Local radio stations pay $350 million a year to songwriters when music is played on ‘terrestrial’ (or local) radio stations," he said. "We pay another $80 million to performing artists, record labels and songwriters when a local radio station streams music over the Internet. $350 million plus $80 million equals $430 million that local radio stations are paying every year for the privilege of playing music," he said. Our ruling Russell said: "In almost every other country in the world, artists and musicians are paid when their music is played on the radio. In fact, the only countries besides the U.S. who do not have a radio-performance right are China, Iran and North Korea." He’s right about the four countries, though more than a dozen smaller countries similarly don’t require performers to be compensated when their singing or playing airs over the radio. It’s also worth noting that performers who help compose songs or pieces do get compensated for radio play. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-04292	Says U.S. corporate tax rate is "highest in the world at 35 percent."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/01/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-says-us-corporate-tax-rate-worlds-h/	Finally, a point where Republicans and at least one prominent Democrat agree. Like President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Austin’s U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul says corporate tax rates are too high. To a recent voters guide question on how to combat unemployment, McCaul -- a Republican seeking another term representing the 10th Congressional District -- gave responses that included lowering America’s "corporate tax rate, highest in the world at 35 percent." A decrease to 25 percent would "stop driving American businesses overseas," McCaul said in the guide, produced by the Austin and Texas chapters of the League of Women Voters and the Austin American-Statesman. McCaul faces Tawana Cadien (Democrat) and Richard Priest (Libertarian) on Nov. 6. PolitiFact has recently checked corporate tax rate claims with a different figure, so we decided to compare this statement. McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen told us by email that 35 percent is the top statutory rate for U.S. corporate taxes, citing an April 5, 2012, "backgrounder" from the Council on Foreign Relations. The council, an independent, nonpartisan think-tank, said the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate in the world by two measures: Excluding state and local taxes, the rate was 35 percent. With those sub-national taxes, the rate was 39.2 percent. Most news stories we read while researching this fact-check used the latter rate -- combining federal, state and local. That’s the yardstick used in related PolitiFact articles, and it’s also the statistic that made headlines when an April 1, 2012, rate cut took effect in Japan and moved the U.S. into first place. The rest of the top five are France, Belgium and Germany, according to a September 2011 report by the Washington-based Tax Foundation that gave 2012 federal-plus-state/local rates, weighted to reflect the economies’ sizes so that small countries would not have a disproportional effect on the average. OECD statutory corporate tax rates, 2012 Source: Tax Foundation 2011 report The foundation’s 2011 report and most of the news articles we read for this story limited their comparisons to advanced industrialized countries -- often citing the 34 members of the global Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. We asked foundation spokesman Richard Morrison for help tracking down country-by-country rates that did not include taxes below the federal level, to make an apples-to-apples comparison with McCaul’s 35 percent. Morrison pointed us, via email, to an OECD web page with a chart showing those numbers for 2012. The U.S. rate of 35 percent is the highest on the chart, with the other OECD nations averaging 23.6 percent (figures that, unlike the statistics cited above, are not weighted to reflect size of national economies). So McCaul’s statement holds true for federal-level-only corporate tax rates as well as for the state/local-plus-federal rate. But recent PolitiFact items have also taken into account the rate corporations pay after deductions and exemptions, called the effective rate. In an Aug. 27, 2012, Truth-O-Meter article, PolitiFact New Jersey wrote, "When you factor in various tax breaks, the rate actually paid by U.S. businesses has been among the highest in the world, but not in first place, studies show." The 2011 foundation report summarized 13 studies of effective corporate tax rates across the world, which used different methodologies and were not limited to the OECD roster. The smallest study compared 10 countries; the largest, 183. Those studies found the U.S. effective tax rate ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, which often placed it in the top five, but never No. 1. But the U.S. hit the top spot in a more recent report. Morrison told us the latest such comparison was made in September 2012 for the libertarian Cato Institute. That report calculated the U.S. effective rate at 35.6 percent and ranked it highest among OECD nations but fourth among all 90 nations it examined. How did U.S. rates get to be among the highest? Actually, other countries dropped theirs, we learned by phone from Jonathan Masters, author of the Council on Foreign Relations piece. We found succinct descriptions of the history in Time magazine and The Hill, a Washington, D.C. newspaper. An April 2, 2012, Time blog post says that while the U.S. rate stayed steady for two decades, "the trend internationally has been towards lower corporate tax rates." The Hill’s Aug. 27, 2012 blog post says that in 1986, the OECD nations’ average corporate tax was 50 percent, but "today, it’s 25 percent for those countries -- it has fallen in half. Meanwhile, the U.S. rate, which fell from 46 percent to 34 percent as a result of tax reform in 1986, is now stuck at 35 percent." Our ruling McCaul said the U.S. "corporate tax rate" is the "highest in the world at 35 percent." The rate set by federal statute is the highest, both by itself and when considering the federal rate plus state and local taxes. However, there’s much less consensus about effective corporate tax rates -- the rates corporations actually pay. Studies don’t even agree on what the U.S. effective rate is, pegging it between 23 percent and 35.6 percent. Older studies put the U.S. near the top; a recent study says the U.S. is No. 1 among OECD nations. We rate McCaul’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-04093	"Unlike the gridlock in Washington, more than 80 percent of the bills we passed during this General Assembly had bipartisan support."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/17/tom-niehaus/tom-niehaus-says-80-percent-bills-passed-last-ohio/	Before he passed the gavel to his successor on Jan. 7, former Ohio Senate President Tom Niehaus recorded a farewell speech that put a positive spin on the Senate’s accomplishments under his leadership. The 90-second speech touched on job creation, pension reform and bipartisanship. "Unlike the gridlock in Washington, more than 80 percent of the bills we passed during this General Assembly had bipartisan support," Niehaus said in the online video, which was shared with reporters on Jan. 3. Niehaus, a Republican from Clermont County, was Senate President for the 129th General Assembly, which included 2011 and 2012. Term limits prevented him from running for re-election. Recalling that lawmakers debated many contentious issues the past two years, including collective bargaining reform, bills expanding gun rights, bills dealing with abortion and election law reform, PolitiFact Ohio checked out Niehaus’ claim of cooperation. Niehaus spokeswoman Angela Meleca cited 191 of the 241 bills the Senate passed in the last two years that had bipartisan support. According to Meleca’s figures, the bills with bipartisan support represent just over 79 percent of the total bills passed. Meleca said the Senate clerk’s office provided the figures and Vincent Keeran, the Senate clerk, confirmed the figures. Bills were considered to have bipartisan support if the majority of Senate Democrats supported the legislation, Keeran said. With 10 Democratic senators, that means bills must have received at least six Democratic votes to be considered bipartisan. Senate Democratic Leader Eric Kearney’s office did not dispute the figures. But a spokesman for Kearney said Democrats were not always included in shaping high-profile bills, such as Senate Bill 5, the attempt to restrict public employees’ collective bargaining power. "A lot of the really important ones they push through probably didn’t" have bipartisan support, said Kearney spokesman Mike Rowe. Rowe’s point is well taken – SB 5, for example, received zero Democratic votes – but Niehaus did not claim bipartisanship on specific bills. Niehaus’ claim was that more than 80 percent of the bills the Senate passed had bipartisan support. The actual numbers showed about 79 percent had bipartisan support. But while Niehaus didn’t hit the number on the nose, the driving point behind his claim certainly is accurate. The senator’s point was that the two parties worked together and avoided gridlock.And since the threshold for bipartisanship is that a majority of Democrats support the bill, there clearly was bipartisan support for a significant amount of legislation. On the Truth-O-Meter, Niehaus’ claim rates True.	None	Tom Niehaus	None	None	None	2013-01-17T06:00:00	2013-01-03	['Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-08633	"Do you know that we have pipes carrying natural gas in this country that are made of wood? I'm not joking."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-some-natural-gas-pipes-are-made-wo/	When a natural gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno, Calif., on Sept. 9, 2010, killing four and destroying almost 40 houses, officials asked many questions, most important, how did it happen and how could it have been prevented. But in a Sept. 14 interview on CNN's Larry King Live, comedian and social commentator Bill Maher brought up an issue we would have never thought to raise. "That fireball ticks me off, because we spent $787 billion dollars on a stimulus program when Obama got into office," Maher said. "Now, why couldn't he have said, 'Look, there's a lot of people out of work in this country, and our infrastructure is crumbling and needs repair. Let's just take all that money and put those two thoughts together. Let's have those people who are out of work repair the infrastructure.' Right? What happened to all that money? Why didn't they fix that? An entire town blew up. Do you know that we have pipes carrying natural gas in this country that are made of wood? I'm not joking." Are there really wood pipes for natural gas in use today? We decided to check. First, some background on the main types of piping used to carry natural gas. "Transmission lines" carry gas for long distances, such as from the point of extraction to a regional distribution center. Once the gas arrives at such a facility, it is fed to homes and businesses through narrower branches called "distribution lines." Different types of materials may be better for one type of pipeline than another, depending on such factors as the diameter and pressure of the pipe, the nature of the local terrain and the cost and difficulty of installation. In the early 20th century, wrought or cast iron prevailed in many contexts, but in the 1950s, steel replaced it for many uses. Since the 1980s, engineers have increasingly turned to cheaper, non-corroding plastic pipe where feasible. According to the American Gas Association, plastic now accounts for almost 51 percent of the pipe used in the U.S., while various types of steel account for 46 percent and cast or wrought iron account for about 3 percent. So what about wood? Well, it did have a place in the history of natural gas distribution. According to the website petroleumhistory.org, "wood pipe was used at a very early date in the natural gas industry. In 1821, gas from an excavated gas spring on Canadaway Creek in Fredonia, N.Y., was conveyed in a wood pipe to a nearby user. ... In 1823, gas found bubbling up through joints in the organic shale cropping out along the south shore in Lake Erie was captured and piped to the Barcelona Harbor lighthouse through pine logs. ... There were other early gas occurrences in the Appalachian basin that were utilized by piping through wood pipes." The author of that post, a late petroleum geologist and historian named Samuel T. Pees, recalled attending a 1972 auction of merchandise from a hardware store near the northwestern Pennsylvania oil fields -- the nation's earliest hub of oil extraction dating from the 1850s. "A large number of square joints of wooden pipe (the round hole was drilled in the center) were among the items sold," Pees wrote. "These had probably been on the shelf for many years." So the heyday of wood pipelines -- if there ever was one -- came more than a century ago. They are never installed today, and only rarely are old sections unearthed. When it happens, it's by accident. Officials from both the Association of Oil Pipelines (which represents the petroleum pipeline industry) and the American Gas Association (which represents natural gas companies) said that, on occasion, routine maintenance digs sometimes unearth old sections of wooden pipe. Typically, the wooden pipe that is found is no longer used and simply lies next to active lines made of more modern materials. There's one relatively recent instance we could locate in which an active wood pipeline was found. That occurred in Pennsylvania (though, oddly, it wasn't in the western part of the state, where the oil boom took place in the 1800s, but rather in the Philadelphia area). The pipe was uncovered about a decade ago, encased in clay and incorrectly marked in utility records, said Jennifer Kocher, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, a state regulatory agency. We suspect that this episode is the source of Maher's claim. A Sept. 14, 2010, Associated Press story written in the wake of the San Bruno disaster, said that "a few places in Pennsylvania still had wooden gas pipes as of last year, according to officials there." But that line is in dispute. Kocher, the spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, told PolitiFact that she was interviewed a year ago by an AP reporter but that the article didn't quote her accurately. Kocher said she told the reporter the story of the wooden pipe discovered 10 years ago, but she also emphasized that no wooden pipe has been found since and that none is believed to be in use today. The oldest pipe in use in the state is 120 years old, Kocher said, but it's made of metal, not wood. A spokesman for the AP responded, saying, "The AP’s reporting accurately reflects what we were told by Ms. Kocher last year and we have received no evidence from the state to counter that admission." In a subsequent e-mail, the spokesman elaborated that Kocher had told the AP that Pennsylvania had about 13,000 miles of cast-iron and steel natural gas pipes, and "even a smidgen of wooden pipe.'' For the purposes of our ruling, it matters less what Kocher said last year to the AP than what she told us today -- namely, that there is no known wooden pipe being used in Pennsylvania. That conclusion was seconded by Terry Fitzpatrick, president of the Energy Association of Pennsylvania, which represents electric and natural gas utilities. The group's member companies believe there is none, he said, and to the extent the group focuses on upgrading materials, it looks at replacing unprotected metal pipes with plastic. "There isn't even a discussion of wooden pipe," Fitzpatrick said. Rick Kessler, vice president of the Pipeline Safety Trust, an independent advocacy group formed after a deadly 1999 pipeline explosion, told PolitiFact that his group has not been able to verify that there are wood pipes in use today. Kessler said it verges on being an urban myth. We tried to contact Maher through his network, HBO, but did not receive a response. Our best guess is that Maher or an assistant read the AP report, which was available for at least several hours before the live taping of the Larry King interview. However, our reporting suggests reasons to be skeptical of the claim that wood natural gas pipes are still in use today. A state regulatory agency and several national industry officials told us they were unaware of any functioning wooden pipe anywhere. It's almost inconceivable that any gas company would have installed them in the last century, and any wooden pipe that was still working today would have had to remain unnoticed, in good working condition and never replaced through many decades since. Does this establish conclusively that there is no wooden pipe currently in use? No -- it's impossible to prove that without exposing every inch of the 2 million-plus miles of natural gas pipe in the country. We also can see why Maher would have trusted an AP report (if that's what he did) since we, too, tend to give the AP a high degree of credibility. Still, if you eliminate the AP's claim of existing wood pipe, since Kocher now disputes it, we see no evidence that wood pipe is currently being used. And since the burden of proof for the Truth-o-Meter falls on the speaker, we rate Maher's claim False. CORRECTION: The initial version of this story stated incorrectly that the co-author of the Sept. 14, 2010, AP story, Garance Burke, had been the AP reporter who spoke to Kocher the previous year. In fact, the reporter for the 2009 AP story was Jennifer Peltz.	None	Bill Maher	None	None	None	2010-09-17T17:42:32	2010-09-14	['None']
pomt-11685	Said Dianne Feinstein said "there is no collusion" between the Trump campaign and Russia.	false	/california/statements/2018/jan/02/donald-trump/trumps-false-claim-dianne-feinstein-said-there-no-/	Fact-checkers found President Trump’s recent interview in The New York Times chock-full of false and misleading statements. Trump rattled off falsehoods published in the Dec. 28, 2017 article on everything from how many social media followers he has to what’s known about possible collusion between Russia and his presidential campaign. On that topic, Trump made an eye-opening claim about Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California: "Virtually every Democrat has said there is no collusion. There is no collusion. . . . I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day on television saying there is no collusion." Feinstein is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, two of the three congressional panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. So, a statement from Feinstein declaring "no collusion," would be significant. Was this another false claim or was there some truth to Trump’s words? We set out on a fact check. Our research A White House spokesman did not respond to our request for evidence backing up Trump’s claim. The president, however, was apparently referring to Feinstein’s Nov. 5, 2017 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in which she discussed the Russia investigation but never flatly said there’s no collusion. As NPR reported in a similar fact check, Feinstein’s interview took place "following the guilty plea of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. Charging documents described conversations Papadopoulos had with Russian-linked individuals where he was promised ‘dirt’ on Hillary Clinton, as well as hacked emails." In the CNN interview, Tapper asked Feinstein whether she had "seen any evidence that this dirt, these emails, were ever given to the Trump campaign." Feinstein replied: "Not so far." Sen. Feinstein's interview on CNN Tapper then asked: "Have you seen any communications that suggested that the Trump campaign wanted them to release them through a different means?" Feinstein answered: "I have not." The senator’s words were in response to a specific portion of the Russia investigation. They are not the same as saying "there is no collusion." Feinstein spoke more generally about collusion during an Oct. 8, 2017 CBS interview, saying she did not know whether it had taken place. "It's an open question because there's no proof yet that it's happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller's investigation," Feinstein said referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In this case, again, Feinstein did not say there is no collusion. Tom Mentzer, Feinstein’s spokesman, said he was not aware of the senator ever making such a statement. Feinstein is running for re-election in 2018 and is being challenged by State Senate Leader Kevin de León, also a Democrat. Similar Trump claim In May 2017, Trump made a similar mischaracterization. He tweeted that former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper "and virtually everyone else" said "there is no collusion" in the Russia investigation. PolitiFact National found Trump twisted Clapper’s words from a March 2017 interview in which Clapper said he had no knowledge of improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In response to Trump’s tweet, Clapper later said: "I don’t know if there was collusion or not," and that he did not believe the probe is "a witch hunt." PolitiFact rated Trump’s claim Mostly False. Our ruling President Trump recently claimed Sen. Feinstein said "there is no collusion," between the Trump campaign and Russia. He apparently based his statement on responses Feinstein gave in a November 2017 CNN interview about the Russia probe. While Feinstein said she had "not so far" seen specific evidence about one portion of the investigation, that’s far from declaring there was no collusion. Speaking more broadly about whether collusion took place, Feinstein said in an October 2017 interview that it's "an open question." The president’s claim distorted the senator’s words and gave the wrong impression. We rate Trump’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-11324	"Congresswoman Martha McSally voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent. Then she got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2018/apr/11/arizona-democratic-party/arizona-democratic-party-claims-gop-lawmaker-mcsal/	The Arizona Democratic Party is putting Republican Congresswoman Martha McSally under the spotlight as a national conversation unfolds about internet privacy and the unauthorized sharing of user data. "Congresswoman Martha McSally voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent. Then she got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info," claimed the Arizona Democratic Party on a marthamcsally.forsale website. The website lists different types of personal information "exposed by Rep. McSally," including Social Security number, credit card numbers, children’s information, smartphone app data and internet browsing history. McSally is vying for the Senate seat vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring when his term ends early January 2019. Other Republicans also running are Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward. The primary election is Aug. 28. Did McSally vote "to let companies sell" internet data without users’ consent and "got paid $42,000" by the corporations allowed to sell such data? The Arizona Democratic Party’s claim has some elements of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. McSally voted to repeal internet data rules that had not taken effect. Her vote was not "to let" companies sell data (they were already legally allowed to do that); it was to halt new rules requiring companies to seek users’ explicit consent before doing so. Companies don’t generally sell internet data, they rather sell access to users by allowing advertisers to target specific demographics, telecommunications experts told PolitiFact. McSally "got paid $42,000" by corporations allowed to sell users’ personal information? The Arizona Democratic Party bases this claim on campaign contributions McSally received after the March 28 vote. Federal Election Commission data shows that political action committees for telecommunications companies and their employees donated about $42,000 to McSally’s campaign or an affiliated political action committee. McSally’s campaign spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair called the Arizona Democratic Party’s claim "absurd and offensive." "This rule favored organizations like Facebook. It gave them more access to data than other companies, and did nothing to protect Arizonans' information from them," Sinclair said. Background on the vote Congress, including McSally, in March 2017 voted to get rid of internet privacy rules the Federal Communications Commission created during the Obama administration. They were scheduled to take effect December 2017 under the Trump administration. The rules were intended to give consumers more control over how internet service providers (ISPs), such as Verizon or Comcast, used their data. They required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history and other "sensitive information," such as Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. (Facebook is not an ISP, so the new rules didn’t apply to Facebook.) Arizona’s Flake challenged the rules under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, arguing that Obama’s FCC went too far and that internet privacy issues have been under the FTC’s purview, not the FCC’s. The vote removed the FCC’s authority to regulate the sale of consumer data, said Nicol Turner Lee, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings Institution. ‘Voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent’ This part of Arizona Democratic Party’s claim ignores several key facts. Before the vote, companies were already legally allowed to sell internet data, but were not doing so to begin with, experts said. "The new privacy rules for broadband internet access service providers hadn’t gone into effect so, practically speaking, data collection practices remained the same," said Brent Skorup, a senior research fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The main issue involved "de-identified" browsing data (data that cannot reasonably be linked to a particular consumer, computer, or device) and whether it was considered sensitive when broadband internet access service providers had it, Skorup said. "The Obama FTC in 2012 said no, de-identified browsing data isn’t sensitive; the Obama FCC in 2016 said yes, it is sensitive," Skorup said. "Congresswoman McSally’s vote was, effectively, a vote to restore the Obama FTC’s privacy policies and halt the Obama FCC’s proposed policies." Skorup emphasized that ISPs cannot and could not collect sensitive user data — such as health information, financial information, children’s information, Social Security numbers, and geolocation information — without express consumer consent. The vote caused Americans to lose whatever potential privacy rights they would have and should’ve had, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit advocating for consumers on digital privacy and consumer protection issues. Yet internet service providers aren’t selling or giving users’ data to advertisers, Chester said. They keep the data and use it to deliver targeted ads, he said. "It’s not about selling your data, it’s about selling access to you," Chester said. Information generally isn’t sold by ISPs, but rather those seeking to advertise could go to ISPs with a demographic they are hoping to target, and ISPs could then use either aggregate or otherwise anonymized data to send advertisements to the right groups of people, said Doug Brake, director of telecom policy at Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank. "The FTC has detailed guidelines on the types of consent that are necessary for different types of data, with more sensitive data requiring express opt-in consent. … From what we know, ISP policies are all consistent with FTC guidelines, and they remained in place through the passing and repeal of the Obama-era FCC rules," Brake said. (Cox Communications and other internet providers, issued statements after the vote saying they do not sell personally identifiable information or web browsing history.) "Got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info" The Arizona Democratic Party based this claim on contributions made after the March vote to McSally’s campaign by political action committees tied to telecommunications companies and their employees. (Federal law generally prohibits corporations from making contributions to candidates for federal offices.) The Arizona Democratic Party pointed to a March National Journal article citing data from the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance data at OpenSecrets.org. "Over the course of her career, McSally has taken nearly $100,000 in campaign contributions from sources such as AT&T, Verizon, and Cox Communications, all of whom provide internet services," the article said. Specifically after the vote, Federal Election Commission filings show McSally received $37,000 in such contributions and that Comcast contributed an additional $5,000 to a political action committee affiliated with McSally, the National Journal reported. Contributors to McSally for Congress since the March vote include Cox Enterprises PAC, Verizon Communications Inc. Political Action Committee, and Comcast Corporation & NBCUniversal Political Action Committee. Our ruling The Arizona Democratic Party launched a website that claimed, "Congresswoman Martha McSally voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent. Then she got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info." McSally’s vote did not allow companies to sell internet data — that was already legally allowed. Still, experts said companies generally don’t sell data to third parties such as advertisers, rather use the data to deliver companies’ ads. McSally’s campaign received about $42,000 after the March vote from political action committees tied to telecommunications companies. McSally also received contributions from those groups prior to the vote. We rate Arizona Democratic Party’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-14525	Nevada is "still a state that is 80 percent white voters."	false	/nevada/statements/2016/feb/17/brian-fallon/clinton-spokesman-wrongly-says-nevada-80-percent-w/	After a big loss in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign is lowering expectations in Nevada. Several campaign representatives, including spokesman Brian Fallon, are attempting to compare the state’s population to the fair-skinned denizens of Iowa and New Hampshire to help lower expectations in the state against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ surging campaign. Here’s what Fallon said in full: "There’s an important Hispanic element to the Democratic caucusgoer universe in Nevada," he said to NBC’s Chuck Todd on Feb. 9, 2016. "But it’s still a state that is 80 percent white voters. You have a caucus-style format, and he’ll have the momentum coming out of New Hampshire presumably, so there’s a lot of good reasons he should do well." Given Nevada’s population diversity, that "80 percent white" claim has struck several observers, including veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston, as highly questionable. Clinton herself has even addressed the claim, saying in a recent interview that Nevada is "one of the most diverse and exciting states in our country." We thought it merited fact-checking. Unfortunately, there’s no official state office that collects the ethnicity of registered voters, so any claims related to demographic turnout rely mainly on aging exit polls from elections four to eight years ago. And due to Nevada’s recent emergence as an early state in the primary season, only the competitive 2008 contest stands as a valid comparison to the upcoming caucus. White voters made up around 65 percent of the vote according to 2008 caucus exit polls, with black and Hispanic voters each taking around 15 percent of the vote. About 118,000 voters, or 30 percent of registered Nevada Democrats, participated in the 2008 caucuses. The Clinton campaign pointed to comments it made to Ralston that some caucus modeling "showed an 80 percent turnout in Nevada come Feb. 20" for white voters. But there’s little evidence that increasing minority participation in Nevada elections would suddenly reverse itself. Joe Lenski, an executive with exit-poll giant Edison Research, said there’s no indication that massive growth in white voter turnout is coming in Nevada. "The three times we’ve measured either caucus or general turnout in the last eight years has given us no number that high," he said. Demographic trends in Nevada don’t seem to favor the Clinton campaign’s position. Nevada is poised to become one of a handful of states with a majority-minority population within the next five years. Nevada’s population has trended to slightly older and more Hispanic since 2008, state demographer Jeff Highcastle said. According to 2014 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, whites make up a slim majority of the state’s population, while Latinos make up more than a quarter at 28 percent. That’s a huge difference from Iowa and New Hampshire, where census data shows close to 90 percent of the population in both states is white. It’s important to clarify that the state’s population diversity doesn’t necessarily translate into diversity at the polls, especially with low-turnout caucuses. Scant polling and the wild-card of same-day voter registration makes predicting caucus turnout difficult. But Hispanic voters do make up a sizable portion of the Nevada electorate. The nonpartisan Pew Research Center finds that around 17 percent of eligible Nevada voters are Hispanic, which ranks sixth nationally. Our ruling A Clinton campaign spokesman claimed that Nevada is a state with "80 percent white voters." Even looking at the best-case scenario, it’s difficult to imagine a sudden reversal in the trend of increasing minority voter participation in Nevada elections. Given past turnout levels and the ethnic makeup of the state, the claim of "80 percent white voters" deciding the state’s caucus doesn’t hold up. We rate the campaign’s claim False.

pomt-06375	"Because of Barack Obama 32 million new people will have healthcare."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/barack-obama/obama-ad-claims-credit-millions-gaining-health-car/	A banner ad featuring the president's smiling face proclaims "Because of Barack Obama" followed by four statements about his accomplishments as president. One of the claims: that 32 million new people will have health care. We decided to check how accurate it was. (You can see a full copy of the ad at the bottom of this report.) The numbers The Obama campaign directed us to the Congressional Budget Office, which early on estimated that 32 million Americans would be covered by health insurance by 2019 under the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress and signed by Obama in 2010. CBO director Doug Elmendorf, in testimony before Congress in March 2011, moved up that timetable to 2016. That would leave about 23 million residents uninsured, the CBO said, and about one-third of those would be undocumented immigrants. Under the legislation, the percentage of legal non-elderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently to about 94 percent. Many of those newly insured will be people who are added to Medicaid, perhaps 16 million, according to the CBO. This isn’t to say that the CBO’s estimates are unquestioned. Critics of the law say the way it is structured is ultimately not workable. Rea Hederman, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, pointed out that state governments share some costs of Medicaid patients -- a burden they are trying to reduce. Hederman also predicted that "premium increases are likely to increase the uninsured rate over time." In other words, as the costs of insurance rise there could be more people without insurance. The cause Is all this "because of Barack Obama?" We asked Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Va. His answer: not entirely. Going back to the 2008 presidential race, Jost said, Obama made health care reform a central issue of his campaign, but he ran against an individual mandate that would require people to purchase health insurance or face a fine. Then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton backed it, but candidate Obama said it should only cover children. The landscape changed after Obama was elected and so did his position on the individual mandate. The fight to pass health care reform grew bitterly divided. In the fall of 2009, Jost noted, and particularly in the winter of 2010 after Republican Scott Brown won a Massachusetts Senate seat that cost Democrats their filibuster-proof majority, "it was only the leadership of President Obama that got the job done." "The (health care law) would never have passed without his leadership and his pressure on the House and Senate to cross the finish line," Jost said. Still, the law was not his creation. Democratic senators Max Baucus, Harry Reid, John Rockefeller and Tom Harkin were the main authors, and Jost added that a number of Republicans got provisions into the act. And even now that the bill has become law, its future is uncertain. Most importantly, it is being challenged in the courts in multiple states on the grounds that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. In separate rulings, the 11th U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta struck down the mandate but upheld the rest of the law, while the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati concluded that the law’s insurance requirement is constitutional. The matter is widely expected to end up in front of the United States Supreme Court, and if the individual mandate is struck down, it’s reasonable that millions fewer Americans will gain health coverage. Why? Because "when coverage is optional, older and sicker people who expect to have substantial health expenditures are the most likely to be insured, while younger and healthier people with little expected health spending have a greater tendency to be uninsured," a recent story in Health Affairs, a health policy journal, said. The law is designed to avoid this effect by mandating that everyone has coverage so that costs are spread across the population. A number of studies have examined the effect of the law without the mandate. Health Affairs concluded that about 8 million fewer people would be insured without the mandate. A study by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, estimates 24 million fewer insured, and the CBO came down in the middle, predicting that 16 million fewer people would be insured without the mandate. Of course, if you’re Obama, you’re going to campaign on the assumption that the health care law, including the individual mandate, will be upheld. Our ruling The Obama campaign ad said "Because of Barack Obama 32 million new people will have healthcare." As things now stand, the predicted number holds up. Though an estimate, it comes from a nonpartisan source, the Congressional Budget Office. But the health reform law, and the individual mandate in particular, faces serious challenges. If it is ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court, millions fewer will gain insurance coverage. Finally, the president isn’t solely responsible for health reform becoming law. It was the result of an epic fight in Congress that pitted the two parties against each other. Obama, however, was a major force for that fight ending in passage of the law.

pomt-00455	"Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/17/teapartyorg/no-nancy-pelosi-didnt-tell-democratic-candidates-l/	A tea party website took an interview on MSNBC with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and leapt to a conclusion about the message she was sending to midterm candidates. "Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it," said an Aug. 15 headline on teaparty.org, which attributed the story to the Conservative Tribune. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story quotes part of Pelosi’s interview on AM Joy on MSNBC Aug. 12. Much of the interview focused on the midterms and the Democrats’ message to voters. The interviewer, Jonathan Capehart, also asked Pelosi if she planned to give up the speakership if the Democrats take back the House. (NBC reported Aug. 10 that 50 Democrats running for the House say they won't support the California lawmaker for speaker. The New York Times then found 60 Democratic House candidates have said that they prefer new leadership if the party wins back the House in November.) The Conservative Tribune story combined actual quotes from Pelosi with its own extrapolation of what she "essentially" meant. Here’s what Pelosi actually told MSNBC: "Well first of all, let me just say this, and I know NBC has been on a jag of this. This is one of their priorities to undermine my prospect as speaker. But putting that aside, I have not asked one person for a vote. "I haven’t asked a candidate or an incumbent for a vote. What’s important, and I know better than anybody how important it is for us to win this election because I see up close and personal what the Republicans and this president are doing. "I do not think our opponents should select the leaders of our party. The Republicans are spending millions -- tens of millions of dollars against me because they’re afraid of me, because I outraise them in the political arena, because I outsmart them at the negotiating table and because I’m a woman who’s going to be a seat at that table. "And that, for me, is very important. If Hillary Clinton had won and had sat at the head of that table, it’d be different. But I’m not yielding - I’m not yielding that. Now I do believe that none of us is indispensable, but I think I’m the best person for the job and I won’t let the Republican ads, which are just flooding these districts." "And I say to the candidates ‘do whatever you have to do, just win, baby.’ I know one in five children in America lives in poverty. We must win this. When the caucus decides, it will decide whose name they will send to the floor - only then, after the election, will I ask people for their support." So Pelosi did say that candidates should "do whatever you have to do" when asked to respond to Democratic candidates saying she should hand over the gavel, but she didn’t tell them to lie to their constituents. Later in the interview, Pelosi shared some other advice she gives to candidates: "don’t even mention Donald Trump. It’s not about him, he’s self evident. It’s about your relationship to the constituents. Their financial security, which is related to health care, cost of prescription drugs, cost of premiums, Medicare, Medicaid, pre-existing condition as a benefit. ..." Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill said he had nothing to add. We sent an email to the teaparty.org website and a Facebook message to the Conservative Tribune and we did not get a response by deadline. Our ruling A headline said, "Pelosi sinks to new low, tells Dems: if you have to lie to voters to win, do it." Pelosi said in an interview on MSNBC that she says to "candidates do whatever you have to do, just win, baby" but we found no evidence she told them to lie. Pelosi’s additional advice to candidates was to not make the election about Trump but make it about voters’ financial security and health care. We rate this headline False.

pomt-06792	"One in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/15/paul-krugman/one-four-texans-lack-health-insurance/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared over the weekend that he was running for the Republican nomination for president. In his announcement speech, he said that if elected, he would rein in the federal government just as he's pursued policies of lower taxes, less spending and less regulation in the state of Texas. Those policies, he said, have resulted in strong job growth. No, they didn't, replied Paul Krugman, the liberal New York Times columnist. Krugman wrote in his column that simple population growth, among other things, has fueled new jobs in Texas. Meanwhile, Krugman said, unemployment has risen in Texas just like it has in other states. "In June 2011, the Texas unemployment rate was 8.2 percent. That was less than unemployment in collapsed-bubble states like California and Florida, but it was slightly higher than the unemployment rate in New York, and significantly higher than the rate in Massachusetts. By the way, one in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation, thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach. Meanwhile, Massachusetts has near-universal coverage thanks to health reform very similar to the 'job-killing' Affordable Care Act." Krugman was right on his unemployment numbers -- we checked them with the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. But we were interested in checking his claim about health insurance, that "one in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation, thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach." To check this, we turned first to the U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts a regular survey on health insurance status, the Current Population Survey. According to the latest numbers, 26.1 percent of Texans had no insurance in 2009 -- just about equal to the one-in-four number Krugman cited and the highest number among the 50 states. The Census Bureau also averaged its data for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009. In that analysis, Texas also ranked first, with 25.5 percent uninsured. Gallup also conducts polls on whether people have insurance or not, and most recently polled during 2010. For that year, it concluded that 27.8 percent of Texans lack health insurance, which comes to nearly 3 in 10. That too made it the state with the highest uninsured rate in the country. Krugman adds the kicker that these numbers are "thanks largely to the state’s small-government approach," suggesting that the conservative philosophies of Perry and other state leaders result in less health coverage. We asked Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that advocates for low- and middle-income Texans, about the uninsured in Texas. She noted several relevant trends. • Employment-sponsored health insurance is declining, as it is across the nation. But Texas is 8 to 10 percentage points below average when it comes to workers covered by their employers. • Enrollment in government plans that insure the poor such as Medicaid, is about the average in Texas, even though poverty rates in Texas are higher. • Texas generally takes a hands-off approach when it comes to regulating health insurance. • The income limits for parents to qualify for Medicaid are set extremely low -- $188 per month for a family of three, for example, which excludes many working poor families. (As in most states, healthy adults without children can't qualify for Medicaid at all.) "We have not done things that other states have done to make health care more affordable and accessible," Dunkelberg said. On the other side of the political spectrum, John C. Goodman of the Texas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, which advocates free market approaches, said Texas uninsurance rates are explained by ethnicity and poverty. "The state’s population is disproportionately Hispanic and Hispanics tend to have twice the uninsured rate. Also, we have a lot of low-income people in the state," he said. In ruling on Krugman's statement, we're looking at his statement, "One in four Texans lacks health insurance, the highest proportion in the nation." He got his numbers right, so we rate his statement True.	None	Paul Krugman	None	None	None	2011-08-15T17:26:20	2011-08-15	['Texas']

pomt-12255	Says John Podesta "refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/11/donald-trump/did-john-podesta-deny-cia-and-fbi-access-dnc-serve/	In the midst of talks on the global economy, climate change and immigration at the Group of 20 summit in Germany, President Donald Trump said there was another issue grabbing attention. "Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We’ll set aside the question of what "everybody" was talking about in Hamburg. A bigger issue is that Trump’s premise about Podesta, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair, gets the facts wrong on several counts. John Podesta’s role Trump claimed that Podesta denied handing over a DNC server to intelligence agencies, but Podesta never chaired the DNC, nor had any involvement in the DNC’s handling of their email server, according to DNC spokesperson Adrienne Watson. "I had nothing to do with the Democratic National Committee — I chaired Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign," Podesta wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post. "So there was no DNC server for me to refuse to give, and I was never asked for one." The op-ed followed a seven-tweet backlash at Trump’s statement, where Podesta denied the claim and told Trump "the Russians committed a crime when they stole my emails to help get you elected President." See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Podesta was, however, a victim of the same phishing trick as the DNC, led by group of hackers that the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence linked to the Russian government. "The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations," the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence wrote in a joint statement released on Oct. 7, 2016. "The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts," the statement added. CIA and FBI’s roles Setting aside Podesta’s role, Trump is returning to an old talking point questioning the DNC’s cooperation with the intelligence community. In March 5, Trump tweeted: "Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible?" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com He tweeted a similar remark on March 21. "What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?" See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com In his testimony in January on the cyber attacks, then-director of the FBI James Comey said the agency never got access to the machines themselves, but obtained access to the forensics from a review of the system performed by CrowdStrike, a third-party cybersecurity firm. "We got the forensics from the pros that they hired which -- again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this my folks tell me was an appropriate substitute," Comey said. "The DNC coordinated with the FBI and federal intelligence agencies and provided everything they requested, including copies of DNC servers," Watson said. She added that the copy contains the same information as the physical server. The FBI joined CrowdStrike’s efforts to boot Russia from the server, but then-Homeland Security Department secretary Jeh Johnson complained the DNC rebuffed their offer to help. This was because Russia was already out of their system by then. Trump's mentioning the CIA’s involvement came as a surprise to both Podesta and the DNC. "The CIA has no role in domestic intelligence-gathering — in fact, it’s prohibited," Podesta wrote in his op-ed. "The CIA would never ask anyone at the DNC for a server. Whether the FBI asked the DNC for access to a server, I don’t know, beyond what I’ve read." According to Watson, the CIA never requested access to the email server. The CIA provided no comment, but notes on its website its mission is focused on overseas, rather than domestic, intelligence-gathering. We asked the White House for comment, but we didn't hear back with an on-the-record response. Our rating Trump tweeted that "everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA." Trump’s premise here is wrong. Podesta had nothing to do with the DNC server because he didn’t work at the DNC; he worked for Clinton’s campaign. The DNC claimed they received no direct requests from the CIA, and the CIA did not comment. The DNC says it cooperated with the FBI, providing information on the server through a third-party vendor.The FBI provided no comment, but then-FBI director Comey said it was an appropriate substitute.

pomt-13895	The House Zika bill "limits access to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus" in Puerto Rico.	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/28/bill-nelson/democrats-zika-impact-planned-parenthood-exclusion/	Emergency money to block the spread of the Zika virus won’t be coming any time real soon. A $1.1 billion funding measure failed to win enough support for an up or down vote in the Senate. The major stumbling point wasn’t the money (though Democrats wanted additional funding). Rather, it was the strings that were attached to the measure as it relates to combatting the virus in Puerto Rico. After the House passed the bill on a largely party line vote, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., berated it. ""The House Zika bill is a disaster," Nelson said June 24, 2016. "Not only does it take $500 million in health care funding away from Puerto Rico, it limits access to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus and prevent terrible birth defects. This is not a serious solution." We wondered about Nelson’s claim that the House Zika bill "limits access to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus," in Puerto Rico. What the bill said The conference report (the bill that emerged from negotiations between top Senate and House Republicans) included two pots of money of particular importance for Puerto Rico. There was $80 million through the Social Services Block Grant program, and $40 million for community health centers. By and large, these dollars were targeted toward Puerto Rico, where the Zika virus has been transmitted widely by mosquitoes. The words that limited how this money could be spent applied to the block grant program. Those dollars were "for health services provided by public health departments, hospitals, or reimbursed through public health plans." Helen Hare, spokeswoman for the Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, told us this language cut out Profamilias, the Puerto Rican branch of Planned Parenthood. "They are a key provider of women’s health care in Puerto Rico, and women would not be able to get the kind of care they need to protect themselves," Hare told us. This is about more than abortion services, Democrats say. Zika can be transmitted through sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, "Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex if used correctly from start to finish." Hare said Profamilias served 8,000 people in 2015. Republicans counter that the bill would have funded many health clinics and women would not be denied care. Jennifer Hing, spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee, told us that even though Profamilias would be ineligible, the money could go to clinics across the island. There’s no debate that the limits applied to Profamilias. So the central question is, would that restriction make much of a difference? There are two ways to sort this out. You can look at where clinics are located and you can look at if they serve different types of women. Mapping health care Many Puerto Ricans live in rural areas and struggle to get by on very modest incomes. Martin Kramer with the Health and Human Services Department’s Health Resources and Services Administration told us that the island territory has 20 community health centers operating at 84 sites. HHS sent them $5 million in April to fight Zika. "That money was for contraceptive services, community education and to hire new staff," Kramer said. Thanks to the Primary Care Association of Puerto Rico, there’s a map of where those clinics are. According to HHS, that network provides contraceptive services to more than 16,600 women each year. The map shows the municipal boundaries that serve as Puerto Rico’s counties. We went to the HHS Data Portal and a list of clinics in the public health insurance plan to add in hospitals and public health clinics. Out of a bit under 20 municipalities not served by the community health clinics, we found about eight that lacked any facility that we could identify. What’s important to note is that everywhere Profamilias lists a clinic -- Arecibo, Caguas, Carolina, Isabela, Moca, Ponce and San Juan -- has another type of facility that would have been eligible for additional funding to combat the spread of Zika. Profamilias clientele One expert we spoke with said that while Puerto Ricans may have had access to another clinic, Profamilias serves a specific type of client. "The Planned Parenthood-style clinic tends to serve very young, very poor women," said Peter Shin, an associate professor in public health at George Washington University. Shin has studied health services in Puerto Rico. "It takes a different set of tactics to reach the teenage or young adult women," Shin said. Shin said these clinics generally do better at connecting with women who are more at risk at having unprotected sex. In addition, because poverty and Zika often go hand in hand, these women are more at risk because they are poor. Our ruling Nelson, along with many other Democrats, said the Zika funding bill would limit access to family planning and contraceptives that would help stop the spread of the Zika virus. The legislation would have blocked the flow of money to one organization, Profamilias, the Planned Parenthood chapter in Puerto Rico. However, the bill also provided funds that would potentially help clinics and hospitals in nearly every municipality on the island. There would be some pockets without services, but it is unclear that Profamilias would be positioned to fill those gaps. At the same time, Profamilias serves women who might be more at risk of infection because they tend to be young and poor. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-01242	"The Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/16/chris-wallace/chris-wallace-harry-reid-blocked-any-vote-keystone/	The Senate is poised to take up legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline in a few days, causing some to speculate what’s behind the sudden urgency. Legislation approving construction of the controversial pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico, has so far stalled under the Democrat-controlled Senate. Many Democrats oppose Keystone, but some red-state Democrats would like to see it happen. On Fox News Sunday Nov. 16, host Chris Wallace painted the upcoming vote as a last-ditch effort to help Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., as she faces a tight runoff vote against a Republican challenger. Otherwise, why would Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rush to a vote, he asked. "The Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years," Wallace said. Soon after, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., appearing on the show, tried to correct the record -- saying Reid has offered up a Keystone vote multiple times. "Harry Reid twice offered votes on Keystone on the Shaheen bill," Whitehouse said, referring to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. "And the Republicans refused to allow those votes because they didn’t want the Shaheen bill to pass before the election. It would have been good for her in New Hampshire to pass a major piece of bipartisan legislation like that. So the Republicans had a chance to vote on Keystone and turned it down." With Whitehouse’s comments in mind, we decided to see if Wallace was correct to say Reid has "blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years." The Shaheen bill Back in May, the Senate was considering a bipartisan energy efficiency bill sponsored by Shaheen, a Democrat, and Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. Twice, Reid said he would allow a Keystone pipeline vote if the Senate approved the Shaheen bill first. But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Republicans rejected both offers. It’s a little more complicated than a simple trade, of course, because Reid had blocked several Republican amendments to the Shaheen bill. So, in a sort of protest vote against Reid, who routinely quashes Republican measures, Republicans rejected his offer, killed the Shaheen bill and lost an opportunity to vote on Keystone. One of the amendments that Republicans tried to attach to the Shaheen bill would have approved the Keystone pipeline. Landrieu, Shaheen and Reid made the same offer again in the summer, and Republicans again rejected it. Bottom line: To hear a Democrat tell the story, Republicans passed on an opportunity to vote on Keystone. But to a hear a Republican tell it, Reid attached so many strings to the Keystone vote, that there was no way Republicans would have been able to support it. Other measures The Shaheen bill wasn’t the only time the Senate has considered Keystone legislation in the past couple of years. For example, in March 2012, the Senate voted on a Keystone approval amendment, sponsored by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D. The measure failed, even with some Democrats voting alongside Republicans. In March 2013, the Senate passed a similar Hoeven amendment, 62-37, approving the Keystone pipeline. But the amendment was non-binding -- and thus largely symbolic. The amendment was attached to a Senate budget resolution, which Reid does not have the ability to block. There have been five standalone bills in the Senate seeking Keystone approval, one introduced by Landrieu and four introduced by Hoeven. None have come up for a vote. The House, on the other hand, has approved the Keystone pipeline nine times, according to Congressional Quarterly, most recently on Nov. 14. Of course, none of these measures have made it through the Senate, contributing to Republicans’ complaint that House bills die at Reid’s desk. Our ruling Wallace said "Reid has blocked any vote on the Keystone pipeline for years." In actuality, several amendments approving Keystone have come up for a vote in the Senate. And Reid and other top Democratic senators have offered Keystone votes several times as part of a broader legislative compromise. But Reid has generally blocked a simple up-or-down vote on the pipeline, using it either as a bargaining chip or by ignoring legislation coming from the House. Wallace’s claim is partially accurate but goes too far by saying "any vote." We rate it Half True.

pomt-14920	"There have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year – more than any other country in the world."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/nov/01/david-cicilline/david-cicilline-mixes-shooting-data-call-stronger-/	On the floor of the U.S. House, Rep. David Cicilline reached for a statistic to bolster his argument for stronger background checks on gun buyers. "There have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year – more than any other country in the world," the Rhode Island Democrat said. It’s clear the United States has a problem with rampage shootings carried out in schools and workplaces. But more mass shootings than anywhere else in the world? Had Cicilline considered any of the world’s war zones? Richard Luchette, the Cicilline staffer who had sent us a YouTube video of the congressman’s remarks, provided two sources that Cicilline used in his speech: a website called Mass Shooting Tracker and a recent Wall Street Journal article with the headline "U.S. Leads World in Mass Shootings." Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced data website that compiles media reports, has documented more than 300 incidents in the U.S. this year in which four or more people were shot. The total number of incidents meeting the site’s definition of a "mass shooting" could be greater than what’s reported on the site. The tracker has its issues. For one, its definition of a "mass shooting" does not require anyone to be killed. For another, some shootings may not make it into the news media. "Mass shooting" is not the term that the Congressional Research Service developed for its widely circulated report on the types of shootings taking place in schools and workplaces. The congressional report focuses on shootings in a "relatively public" location in which either a gunman or gunmen select victims "somewhat indiscriminately" and kill, four or more people. The report calls such shootings "public mass shootings." Also, on Oct. 8, PolitiFact Florida gave U.S. Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz a ruling of half true for a statement about mass shootings that PolitiFact said relied too heavily on the tracker site data. But the Mass Shooting Tracker has documented more than 300 shootings with at least four people wounded and Cicilline quoted its findings accurately. The second half of the congressman’s claim is more problematic, in large part, because it has little in common with the first half of the claim. The Wall Street Journal article cited by Luchette refers to research assembled by Adam Lankford, an associate professor of at the University of Alabama Department of Criminal Justice. Lankford examined "public mass shootings" in the United States and around the world from 1966 to 2012. He did not consider mass shootings in war zones or mass shootings motivated by gang rivalries. He identified a total of 292 shooters whose violence met his specific criteria for a public mass shooting, including at least four deaths. He determined that 90 of these shooters, 31 percent of the world’s total, had carried out their attacks in the United States. And that this was more than in any other country. "Any politician who says that is correct, according to my research of these types of crimes," Lankford says. Our ruling In the YouTube video that Cicilline’s staff sent us, the congressman said: "There have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year – more than any other country in the world." The problem with that sentence is that he mixes disparate facts to draw a single conclusion. The "mass shootings" of the first part are not the same as the "public mass shootings" of the second part. And so while both parts are basically correct, Cicilline was off base when he put them together. The Mass Shooting Tracker does not tally foreign shootings. And the social scientist from the University of Alabama looked at different events from a different period of time. The first half of his sentence is true and the second half is true. But two trues, in this case, don’t make the whole truth. For that reason, the judges rate Cicilline’s claim Half True.

pomt-06861	"If the debt ceiling is surpassed, our nation will not go into default as some suggest."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/02/marco-rubio/rubio-says-if-debt-ceiling-was-surpassed-us-would-/	In the days leading up to the Aug. 1, 2011, vote in the U.S. House on raising the debt ceiling, members of the House, the Senate and President Barack Obama engaged in a war of words about what would have happened if they couldn't reach an agreement. As the vote approached, Obama urged the public to contact their representatives in order to push them to reach a deal. The phone lines in congressional offices were flooded with calls from voters across the country urging politicians to seal the deal. On Aug. 1, the U.S. House voted 269-161 in favor of raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling in stages -- the first one immediately. The Senate voted 74 to 26 on Aug. 2 for the deal, which also included cutting deficits by $917 billion over 10 years through spending reductions in defense, education and other programs -- but not Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. A PolitiFact reader forwarded us a July 29 e-mail he received from U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida's junior senator and a Republican -- who later voted against the bill -- about the debt ceiling. Here is one paragraph from Rubio's e-mail that stood out to us: "The debt ceiling is the total amount of money owed by the United States by both the general public and the federal government to either foreign or domestic lenders. If the debt ceiling is surpassed, our nation will not go into default as some suggest. The debt ceiling can be raised, lowered or remain the same when Congress allows it to come to a vote. What we must do is prioritize our debt payments in the event that the ceiling is not raised, and I support legislation which would ensure that interest payments, Social Security benefits and pay for our men and women in uniform go out in a timely manner." Rubio wrote that he would not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless it was accompanied by other reforms including to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. There were a few points that interested us in Rubio's response, but we decided to focus on his suggestion that the United States could avoid default even if Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling before the Aug. 2 deadline. The Truth-O-Meter has examined multiple claims about the debt ceiling, including one by Georgia Republican U.S. Rep Tom Price, who said on CNN July 24: "Well, the U.S. won't default, because default means that you don't pay your creditors," Price replied. "And it takes about 10 percent of the money that's coming in right now..." Price argued that a failure to pay bills would not equal default, and what mattered was that the United States continued to pay interest owed on bonds. Republican U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota made a similar argument during a July 13, 2011, press conference that "it is simply not true" that "if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, that somehow the United States will go into default, and we will lose the full faith and credit of the United States." While cash would have covered bondholder obligations at least for some time, the government could have prioritized some payments -- likely Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- but then would have been unable to pay others -- perhaps veterans benefits, educational programs and payments to vendors and contractors. The Truth-O-Meter check on Bachmann explained: "But the assumption here is that the markets would be satisfied as long as the interest on bonds was paid, even if doing so meant delaying payments to any number of other creditors to the federal government, from Social Security beneficiaries to federal workers to Pentagon contractors. ... Our experts largely agreed that -- contrary to Bachmann’s implication -- a failure to pay any of its bills, not just interest to bondholders, would be classified as a default." Even though we've dealt with this question twice already, we've decided to take it up again due to continuing reader interest in the topic as well as additional evidence that has come to light since our original items were published. We contacted Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos to ask for an explanation why Rubio argued that not raising the debt ceiling would not lead to default. "You have to read that entire paragraph for context, not simply extrapolate one sentence," Burgos replied by e-mail. "When the debt ceiling is surpassed, the government is still taking in revenue and can prioritize payments to meet its obligations on interest owed, to Social Security recipients and the military. It does not have to amount to a full-scale, across-the-board default on these obligations. That entire paragraph outlines steps Senator Rubio believes our government should take to ensure these payments are prioritized in the event that Congress does not raise the debt ceiling." Rubio signed on as one of more than 20 co-sponsors of a bill by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., "The Full Faith and Credit of the United States and Protecting America’s Seniors and Soldiers Act", which would require the Treasury Department to prioritize payments on publicly held debt, Social Security and active-duty military pay in the event the federal government failed to raise the debt limit before Aug. 2, Burgos wrote. But what if you prioritize your debts and pay some but not all of them? Would that represent a default, even a partial one? We think it's appropriate to consider the legal definition of default. That is "a failure to perform a legal duty -- for example, a default on a mortgage or a car loan happens when you fail to make the loan payments on time, fail to maintain adequate insurance or violate some other provision of the agreement." That would suggest that if the government fails to pay bills other than interest payments it might qualify as a default. But we also contacted a range of economic experts for their opinion of both the legal and commonsense definitions. A number of our experts agreed that if the government paid some bills and not others, it would be considered a default -- or as one expert, Kathy Ruffing at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, called it "selective default." "If the debt ceiling is not lifted, the U.S. will not be able to honor all of its obligations and in that sense will surely default," Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at Stern School of Business at New York University wrote to us before the House's vote. Ruffing argued in a report that the government would default on some obligations: "The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) estimates that between August 3 and August 31, a prolonged inability to borrow would force the federal government to cut expenditures by 44 percent. That would affect federal employees, defense contractors, hospitals and doctors, state and local governments, farmers, colleges and universities, program beneficiaries, and millions of others. All of these people and organizations rely on timely federal payments to meet their own bills and payrolls, and an interruption would set off a domino effect of lower demand and missed payments throughout the U.S. economy." Even if the government prioritized certain expenditures, financial markets would not be "reassured if they saw a cash-strapped superpower picking which bills it could afford to pay today," Ruffing wrote. Dean Baker, of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote that it would only technically be a default if the government missed a payment on debt. "However, once we hit our borrowing limit the government has a limited capacity to prioritize payments as Sen. Rubio wants," Baker wrote. "First, the Constitution tells the president to spend money appropriated by Congress. Nixon lost a case at the Supreme Court where he claimed he could choose not to spend money. So arguably Obama does not have the authority to prioritize payments. This means he makes one set of payments, then he doesn't have money to pay interest on the debt." Ultimately people could have had legal claims for money that they were owed and a judge could have ordered the government to pay up -- and "then they don't have the cash to pay the interest on the debt," Baker wrote. "There is a limited grain of truth in that Aug. 2 was not literally a drop-dead date, but the idea that the government could operate for any sustained period of time without facing default is ridiculous." Some of our experts said there's room for some disagreement. Donald Marron, professor at Georgetown University and former acting director of the Congressional Budget Office argued that it depends how one interprets "default." "I believe he is correct that the U.S. would not need to default on its debt obligations. I believe Treasury said last week that it would prioritize payments to make sure interest is covered. Some people use the word default, however, to include the idea of missing any financial obligation. Under that definition, prioritization would count as a form of default, since someone would not receive timely payment from the federal government." Barry Bosworth, senior fellow in economic studies at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution wrote ".... I agree that his priority to debt payments is correct in that most would not consider that a default. .... However, some legal experts would argue that the government has defaulted on its commitments (broadly defined) when it does not honor the bills that are submitted to it. However, the failure to pay bills in a timely fashion has happened in the past (mid 1990s), particularly by state and local governments, and it was not considered a default." And J.D. Foster, senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation argued that "the accuracy of this statement depends in part on how much you're willing to take into account the preceding sentence, which specifically refers to the debt. If the debt ceiling is not raised, then we will not go into default on the debt because as everyone now understands, the interest would be paid. This is, for many, the No. 1 issue. However, taken in isolation, the statement is incorrect because the nation would go into a technical default if the debt ceiling were not raised if only because Congress has passed laws the president has signed requiring certain spending be undertaken for which the funds would be lacking." Meanwhile, key ratings agencies weighed in with their interpretation since our previous items have appeared. On July 26 -- around the same time we were publishing our Tom Price item -- The Wall Street Journal reported in a blog post that the influential ratings firm Moody's provided its definition of default: "What would Moody’s consider a default? We do not consider delayed payments for obligations other than debt service to be a default," the post said. "In other words, President Barack Obama could make good on his warnings that Social Security checks wouldn’t go out, and that wouldn’t constitute a 'default.'" David Beers, the global head of sovereign ratings for another key ratings agency, Standard & Poors, said in a July 27 interview with CNBC that "it would not be default so long as the government is continuing ... to pay its debt as it matures and its interest payments. But we would suspect that that's not a tenable situation for very long." Our rating Rubio told a constituent in an e-mail: "If the debt ceiling is surpassed, our nation will not go into default as some suggest." We focused on whether it would be considered a default if the United States had chosen to pay some bills but not others, due to prioritization decisions amid a cashflow problem. The legal definition would seem to suggest that the U.S. would be in at least partial default under that scenario, and a number of experts agreed with that view. Other experts said there's some wiggle room in how you define "default." Ultimately, much of the statement's accuracy hinges on whether you consider ratings agencies to be the ultimate guardian of the term "default," or whether you consider a legal or commonsense definition to apply. We acknowledge that there are a range of opinions on this matter, but it has become clearer since our prior attempts to tackle this question that the ratings agencies are willing to overlook any defaults beyond those involving bondholders when they measure the nation's creditworthiness. By virtue of their position, the ratings agencies carry significant weight on this question. Still, we feel Rubio wrongly downplayed the likelihood of technical defaults on other creditors, such as federal contractors. We believe that the nation can be in default on some obligations even if the agencies choose to ignore them as they calculate their ratings. On balance, we rate Rubio's claim Half True.

pomt-08733	Says a highway was closed in El Paso because of bullets flying across the border.	true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/01/greg-abbott/ag-greg-abbott-says-el-paso-highway-was-closed-bec/	Asked last week whether he would support an Arizona-style immigration law in Texas, Attorney General Greg Abbott pivoted to a theme popular among state leaders recently: the threat to public safety of violence along the Texas-Mexico border. "The challenges that we are seeing on the border are unprecedented," Abbott said during a Thursday interview with the Texas Tribune. "The challenges to the health, safety and welfare of Texans are greater than they've ever been." Among the examples Abbott gave was "the closure of a highway in El Paso for a time period because of safety issues because of bullets flying across the border." We wondered whether Abbott, a Republican who is being challenged by Democratic nominee Barbara Ann Radnofsky this fall, got that right. Did bullets really cross the border, causing the highway to be closed? One thing is certain: Border violence has been on the minds of Texas officials as the war between Mexican drug cartels continues to rage. El Paso, the state's sixth-largest city, adjoins Juárez, a city the Associated Press has described as "ground zero in Mexico's relentless drug war." In an Aug. 24 dispatch, the AP said that "wildly aimed gunfire has become common in Juárez, a sprawling city of shanty neighborhoods that once boomed with manufacturing plants." Last month, we rated Half True a statement by Gov. Rick Perry that bullets from Mexico had hit El Paso's city hall and bombs had exploded in that city. He was right about the bullets, which struck city hall on June 29, but was off on the bomb (although a car bomb was set off in Juárez in July). And in March, we found Barely True U.S. Sen. John Cornyn's statement that spillover violence was "real and escalating." President Barack Obama, who fielded a letter from Perry urging more troops along the border during an Austin visit last month, returned to Texas on Tuesday to speak to soldiers at Fort Bliss in El Paso before he gave a national address from the Oval Office to mark the end of the United States' combat mission in Iraq. But back to those flying bullets. In response to our inquiry, the attorney general's office sent us an AP report describing an Aug. 21 incident. We contacted the El Paso Police Department, and spokesman Darrel Petry told us that just before 6 p.m. that day, Border Patrol agents heard gunfire in western Juárez. The AP has described the shooting as a "30-minute firefight between gunmen and local and federal police." The El Paso Times has reported that a man in his 20s was killed in Juárez and that three Juárez police officers were wounded in the incident. Petry told us that at the request of the Border Patrol, the El Paso Police Department shut down Paisano Drive between Santa Fe Street and Executive Center Boulevard, a stretch of about 3.5 miles. Paisano, also known as U.S. 85, runs through downtown El Paso and along the Rio Grande. Petry said the road, which he described as four lanes with stop signs and stoplights, was closed for about 30 minutes. Petry, who told us that he has worked at the police department since 1982, said he could not remember another time that an El Paso street had been closed because of gunfire in Mexico. According to an Aug. 24 El Paso Times article, a building at the University of Texas at El Paso was struck by a bullet that police suspect was fired during the incident across the border. An Aug. 22 press release from the university said that there were no injuries and that the "bullet struck the south door of Bell Hall, went through the glass panel in the door and was found embedded in an office door frame." During an Aug. 23 news conference that we watched online, the president of the university, Diana Natalicio, said campus police found the bullet hole during a routine patrol the morning after the gunfight. "We are living next door to a city that is carrying on with gunfights on a fairly regular basis," Natalicio said. She said she thought that the increase in violence in Juárez had hurt El Paso's image, which she described as safe. So, were there any other suspected bullet crossings from the Aug. 21 gunbattle in Juárez? An El Paso police statement released the next day said that officers who helped close Paisano "did not report seeing any bullets cross the border" but that police had received a report that a bullet may have hit a vehicle in El Paso. Petry told us that police had not confirmed that report. Also, an Aug. 25 El Paso Times article reported that employees of the Rescue Mission of El Paso, a homeless shelter on Paisano Drive, said one of its buildings had been hit by a bullet. According to an Aug. 31 story on the Times' website, U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, said he and Obama talked about the "rollercoaster violence along the border" and about the bullets that hit El Paso City Hall and UTEP during the ride to Texas on Air Force One. So, where does that leave Abbott's statement? Gunfire in Mexico did spur El Paso authorities to close a section of U.S. 85, an action that a police spokesman said was unprecedented. One bullet was found in a Texas university building, and other reports, though unconfirmed as yet, indicate more "bullets were flying across the border," as Abbott said. We rate his statement True.

pomt-10330	Says Obama flip-flopped on banning handguns.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/24/let-freedom-ring/on-the-fence----consistently-/	A new TV ad from the conservative group Let Freedom Ring says Sen. Barack Obama is a flip-flopper. The ad begins with Obama surrounded by newspaper headlines, with the words "FLIP-FLOPPER?" on the screen. "People are saying that Sen. Obama's recent changes of position have made him a flip-flopper," the announcer says. "He's not! Flip-floppers only hold one position at a time." As photos show Obama talking from both sides of the screen, the announcer says "Sen. Obama is different: He holds two positions at the same time." The announcer then lists the issues on which Obama has allegedly flipped: "Both ways on banning handguns . . . Both ways on public campaign financing. ... And now, both ways on withdrawing from Iraq." The ad concludes, "He's 'Both Ways Barack.' Worse than a flip-flopper!" We address other claims from the ad in this article. Here, we'll address the allegation about flip-flopping on gun control. (Much of our material below comes from our previous ruling on Sen. John McCain's flip-flop allegation.) When the Supreme Court in June 2008 ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm and that the Washington, D.C., gun ban is unconstitutional, Obama and John McCain issued statements with their reactions. McCain quickly pronounced it "a landmark victory for Second Amendment freedom." McCain noted that while he was among a bipartisan (though mostly Republican) group of congressmen who signed a "friend of the court" brief arguing against the D.C. law, Obama did not. "Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness," McCain stated, "today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right — sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly." Obama said the Supreme Court ruling affirmed what he had been saying all along. "I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms, but I also identify with the need for crime-ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common-sense, effective safety measures. The Supreme Court has now endorsed that view, and while it ruled that the D.C. gun ban went too far, Justice Scalia himself acknowledged that this right is not absolute and subject to reasonable regulations enacted by local communities to keep their streets safe. Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country." The McCain campaign responded by accusing Obama of waffling on the issue. "Throughout his time in elected office, Barack Obama has taken multiple positions on banning handguns and the D.C. handgun ban. He has stated his belief that handgun bans were constitutional and he supported them. Then he actually refused to state a position." Silent on the D.C. ban In the months leading up to the Supreme Court decision, Obama did, in fact, skirt the issue of whether he thought the D.C. gun ban was constitutional. He repeatedly said he believed the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to bear arms, but that it does not preclude local governments from enacting "common sense" laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. The main issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to possess a firearm, or whether it only protected possession of a firearms connected to service in a militia. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it was an individual right. Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Center and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says the Supreme Court ended up right where Obama was. "Obama has said pretty consistently that he felt the Second Amendment provided an individual right to own a gun," he said. McCain's case against Obama But the McCain campaign said Obama has waffled, that he has supported the D.C. gun ban in the past. They provide three main pieces of evidence: • The first is a 1996 voter questionnaire Obama completed while running for a seat in the Illinois Senate. The "Independent Voters of Illinois" asked if the candidate supported state legislation to "ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns." Obama's answer: "Yes." The 1996 voter form surfaced again last year. The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who "unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position." The Web site Politico.com investigated and found that while Obama's campaign claimed Obama never saw or approved the responses in the questionnaire, the campaign at the time filed an amended version, which appeared to include Obama's own handwritten notes added to one answer (not the one on gun control). Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama's campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, "He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn't change the fact that some answers didn't reflect his views." • The second alleged contradiction comes from a Chicago Tribune article on Nov. 20, 2007, in which the Obama campaign is quoted as saying Obama "believes that we can recognize and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and the right of local communities to enact common sense laws to combat violence and save lives. Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constitutional." The statement, which came from an unnamed campaign aide, "was obviously an inartful attempt to explain the senator's consistent position," Obama spokesman Bill Burton told ABC News. • Lastly, the McCain campaign notes that in a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008, Obama did not dispute a questioner's characterization of Obama's position as supporting the D.C. handgun ban. Here's the text of the exchange: Leon Harris of WJLA: "One other issue that is of great importance to the people of the district here, is gun control. You said in Idaho here, recently, that "I have no intention of taking away folks' guns." But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you've said that it's constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?" Obama responded, "Because I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it's important for us to recognize that we've got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people — law-abiding citizens use it for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for protecting their families. We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage. And so I think there is nothing wrong with a community saying, we are going to take those illegal handguns off the streets, we are going to trace more effectively how these guns are ending up on the streets, to unscrupulous gun dealers, who often times are selling to straw purchasers, and cracking down on the various loopholes that exist in terms of background checks for children, the mentally ill. ...We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measures that I think respect the Second Amendment and people's traditions." A look at the votes The National Rifle Association isn't buying Obama's "election-year rhetoric" in support of individuals' right to keep and bear arms. The NRA says Obama's voting record — which they have consistently rated an "F" — suggests he would be "a serious threat to Second Amendment liberties." Here's some of Obama's voting record: As a state senator in Illinois in 2004, Obama voted against a measure to lower the minimum age to apply for a Firearm Owner's Identification Card from 21 to 18. That same year, an Illinois state senator proposed giving people who violate city gun bans the right to use self-defense as a legal argument if they were charged for violating a ban. Obama opposed the measure. As a U.S. senator, Obama voted in July 2005 against a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers or dealers resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRA contended the bill was designed to bankrupt the firearms industry. McCain voted in favor of the prohibition, which passed 65-31. Obama also voted for an amendment to expand the definition of prohibited, armor-piercing ammunition. The NRA claimed it would have banned much of the rifle ammunition commonly used for hunting. McCain voted against it and it failed. Both Obama and McCain voted in favor of a requirement that manufacturers and importers of handguns provide child safety locks. In 2006, both Obama and McCain voted for an amendment to prohibit the confiscation of a lawfully owned firearm during an emergency or major disaster. According to Obama's campaign Web site, Obama supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent, "as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets." On the fence So here's what we have to support the claim of an Obama flip-flop: one answer to a questionnaire in 1996 that Obama claims was completed in error by a staffer; a quote attributed to a campaign aide in 2007, also later disavowed by Obama; and failing to dispute the characterization of his position in a campaign forum in February. It's a bit too convenient for the Obama campaign to dismiss a record it doesn't like by claiming that twice in his career aides misstated his position on gun control. At the end of the day, voters simply have to decide if they believe Obama's explanation or they don't. Finally, there's the question in the forum in which Obama's position was characterized as supporting the D.C. gun ban, and that it was constitutional. Obama's answer seemed like an attempt to cling to his position atop the fence, repeating his belief that the Second Amendment affirms an individual's right to own a gun, but that local governments ought to be able to limit that right. But what about D.C.'s outright ban of guns? Obama not only didn't correct Harris' characterization of support for the D.C. gun ban, his answer seemed to affirm that it was accurate. At the very least, if Harris was wrong, here was the perfect opportunity to set the record straight. By and large, Obama's fence-sitting has been pretty consistent. Still, twice claiming an aide botched your position and failing to go on record even when directly asked about it gives the flip-flopping charge enough ammo to merit a Half True.

pomt-07909	Says gun ownership information could be recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law.	false	/florida/statements/2011/feb/01/jason-brodeur/florida-lawmaker-suggests-doctors-can-use-gun-info/	A freshman Florida lawmaker is grabbing national headlines for sponsoring a bill that would make it a felony for doctors to ask their patients if they own guns. State Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, has filed HB 155, the Privacy of Firearms Owners Act, which seeks to punish doctors with fines up to a $5 million for asking a patient or a patient's family about gun ownership and gun habits. The proposal is a reaction to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which encourage physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offering advice to avoid preventable accidents. The long list of recommendations includes mainly innocuous tips like "Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children," and "NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag." Physicians also are encouraged to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play. "More than 5,000 children and adolescents are killed by gunfire each year -- injuries almost always inflicted by themselves, a sibling or a friend," the doctor's group says as part of suggested counseling for parents. "Handguns are especially dangerous. If you choose to keep a gun at home, store it unloaded in a locked place. Lock and store the ammunition in a separate place." Brodeur says the advice is out of bounds and that it infringes on people's privacy protections. The controversial measure has proven fodder for CNN's Anderson Cooper. But what has so far been left out of the debate is Brodeur's suggestion that his bill could have even more privacy implications because of the passage of the federal health care overhaul in 2010. The law is now facing an aggressive court challenge. Speaking to the Fort Myers News-Press, Brodeur said he's concerned about doctors asking patients about guns in the home and then allowing that information to get into the hands of the government or insurance companies. "What we don't want to do is have law-abiding firearm owners worried that the information is going to be recorded and then sent to their insurance company," Brodeur said. "If the overreaching federal government actually takes over health care, they're worried that Washington, D.C., is going to know whether or not they own a gun and so this is really just a privacy protection." The federal health care law is 974 pages long -- long enough for important details to get sometimes overlooked (we like this one) and long enough for outrageous claims (like here, and here, and our favorite, here.) We wondered where Brodeur's claim fit in. The health care law and guns So much can be revealed by simply reading the health care law, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Or if that's too much -- just try searching for keywords. We accessed the final version of the law through the White House's web site. Then we searched for the word "gun." Here's what we found: "(c) PROTECTION OF SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS." So we read on. The gun provision of the law has two main thrusts -- that no one in the government can use the health care law to collect gun information and that insurance companies cannot adjust their rates because someone owns a gun. "A premium rate may not be increased, health insurance coverage may not be denied, and a discount, rebate, or reward offered for participation in a wellness program may not be reduced or withheld under any health benefit plan issued pursuant to or in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or an amendment made by that Act on the basis of, or on reliance upon -- (A) the lawful ownership or possession of a firearm or ammunition; or (B) the lawful use or storage of a firearm or ammunition," the law reads in part. That gun language was added by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid specifically to placate gun owners, who argued that the health care law could be used as a way for the federal government to create a national gun registry or charge gun owners more for insurance. So to avoid any (more) backlash about the law, Reid included a provision to further protect gun owners from either seeing their insurance rates increase, or from having their names collected and entered into some federal gun owner database. "In the face of all this abuse, Senator Reid was pressured by Gun Owners of America and his constituents into making a face-saving move," the lobbying group Gun Owners of America wrote on its blog. "He wanted to silence the pro-gun community’s objections, so he took steps to strip the bill of any gun rights concerns." More on a gun registry The health care law cannot be used to collect gun data, and it cannot be used to raise the insurance premiums of gun owners. But we wanted to step back and ask an even more basic question. Does the federal government keep a database of gun owners as Brodeur is asserting? "There is no national firearms registry," said Jim Wright, a gun policy expert who teaches at the University of Central Florida. William J. Vizzard, a criminal justice professor at California State University Sacramento who spent 27 years working for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, agreed. The government does track some high-powered weapons like machine guns, grenades and short-barreled shotguns but not common firearms like handguns and rifles. There is no searchable database, and records are kept with gun dealers, Vizzard said. Some states do register firearms, said Daniel Vice, a senior attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. But not Florida. "To say this is a response to Obamacare would be less accurate than to say this is in response to a more general problem going on long before Obamacare," added David Kopel, research director of the conservative-leaning Independence Institute and an adjunct professor of law at the University of Denver. Kopel said he believes the real issue is with the proliferation of electronic medical records, which means that if a doctor asks a patient about guns, a permanent electronic record will be created and maintained. And though that record cannot be expressly used by insurance companies or the government, the record exists. His point might be worth discussing. But in this case, it's not what we're checking. Our ruling We left a message with Brodeur's legislative office, but did not hear back. Brodeur told the News-Press that his bill -- which would prevent doctors from asking patients if they own a gun -- was crafted to combat privacy concerns resulting from the passage of the federal health care law. It turns out Brodeur's trying to right a "wrong" that isn't wrong. The health care law included specific protections for gun owners -- so they wouldn't see insurance premium increases and their information wouldn't be included in a gun owner database or registry. We find this claim False.	None	Jason Brodeur	None	None	None	2011-02-01T18:18:59	2011-01-16	['None']
pomt-00910	"You had more women getting computer sciences degrees in the '80s by a factor of 2-plus than you do now."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-women-earned-twice-many-compu/	In a public appearance during her not-yet-announced presidential campaign, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke before an audience in Silicon Valley to beta-test some economic messages. At one point, Clinton mentioned the challenges facing women in the historically male-dominated field of computing. She capped this reference with a surprising statistic: "You had more women getting computer sciences degrees in the '80s by a factor of 2-plus than you do now. … Why aren't more girls and women going into this field? What was different about being a high school or college student in the '80s than it is today? I think we need to unpack that." Is it really true that the mid 1980s were a golden age for women in computing, and that it’s been all downhill since then? What the numbers show When we contacted Clinton’s staff, a spokesman declined to comment. But we were able to find some official data tracking these trends, thanks to Randy Olson, a Ph.D. candidate in Michigan State University's computer science program who had blogged about this topic. First, let’s look at a graph Olson assembled that shows the percentage of bachelor’s degrees conferred to women in the United States between 1970 and 2012, separated out by major. The second-to-lowest category on the chart, in a shade of light gray, is computer science. The graph makes it easy to see the general trend for women in computer science. The percentage of all computer-science degrees that went to women rose from less than 5 percent in 1970 to nearly 40 percent in the early-to-mid 1980s. Then, it began falling steadily, sinking to below 20 percent in the most recent data a few years ago. So Clinton has captured the general trend correctly. But after looking at the original data source for Olson’s chart -- a table from the federal Department of Education -- Clinton's numbers are a bit off. Here’s a summary for the relevant years: Academic year Number of women receiving computer science bachelor’s degrees Percent of all computer science bachelor’s degrees granted to women 1980-81 4,919 32.5 1981-82 7,049 34.8 1982-83 8,924 36.3 1983-84 12,023 37.1 1984-85 14,384 36.8 1985-86 15,129 35.7 1986-87 13,805 34.7 1987-88 11,237 32.4 1988-89 9,417 30.8 1989-90 8,188 29.9 2011-12 8,611 18.2 If you use the raw numbers of women earning bachelor’s degrees in computer science, the ratio from the 1980s to today never quite reaches goes above 2-to-1, as Clinton said it did. The highest it gets is 1.76-to-1. That said, 1.76-to-1 is not that far off from 2-to-1. Clinton is slightly more accurate when using the percentage of all computer-science bachelor's degrees going to women. Using that statistic, she's correct for two years out of the 10 that decade, and she’s pretty close for several of the other eight years. In one sense, though, Clinton underestimates how much ground women lost in computer-science bachelor’s degrees over this period. Since 1983-84, the number of women earning bachelor’s degrees in any field almost doubled. So in 1983-84, computer science degrees accounted for 2.4 percent of all bachelor’s degrees conferred to women. By 2011-12, that had shrunk to less than 1 percent. This is an especially notable trend because it runs counter to what’s been happening in other scientific fields. As Olson’s chart shows, the share of degrees granted to women in biology has risen from just under 50 percent to just under 60 percent over the same period. In the physical sciences, it has gone up from just under 30 percent to about 40 percent. And in engineering, it has risen from about 14 percent to 18 percent. Why has the number of women earning computer science degrees tumbled? So the decline in computer science is atypical. But why? Experts we checked with offered some informed speculation. Universities haven’t expanded computer-science programs quickly enough to meet the surge in student interest, an imbalance in supply and demand that persists to this day, said Margaret O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington and author of Cities of Knowledge: Cold War Science and the Search for the Next Silicon Valley. "There are not enough seats in upper-level computer-science courses to meet demand," she said. "So introductory courses become weed-out courses that turn students off if they don’t already have a fierce passion for the discipline." This ended up favoring men. The home-based personal computer arrived in the mid 1980s, and it was marketed "almost entirely to men and boys," NPR noted last year. And the popularization of the "hacker" persona reinforced it further. "Hackers were almost uniformly white, adolescent, middle-class males," said Nathan Ensmenger, associate professor of informatics at Indiana University. This pattern continued into the workplace. Many companies had "a 'frat boy' atmosphere," said Ed Lazowska, the Bill & Melinda Gates chair in computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. "They simply weren't welcoming places for women. And stereotypes are hard to stamp out, even if and when behavior actually changes." Ironically, it wasn’t always this way. In the 1940s and 1950s, computer work was seen as something akin to being a telephone operator -- a rote technical skill that women had traditionally handled. So the first electronic supercomputer -- ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania -- had an entirely female programming staff, O’Mara said. Similarly, in the 1950s, IBM had "systems service girls," who were sent out to fix your computer if it got buggy. "But as computing became big business, the startup culture, and its unstable life and all-consuming hours, ruled," O’Mara said. " Women got edged further and further out of the picture." Our ruling Clinton said, "You had more women getting computer-sciences degrees in the '80s by a factor of 2-plus than you do now." The difference in raw numbers never quite hit the 2-to-1 ratio she cited, but it did get pretty close. She is correct that the share of computer science degrees earned by women peaked in the mid 1980s and has fallen since then. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-03-03T09:48:16	2015-02-24	['None']

pomt-05901	Says Mitt Romney’s campaign "has already spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his entire presidential run."	false	/florida/statements/2012/feb/03/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-mitt-romney-campaign-spen/	The night Mitt Romney swept the Republican primary in Florida, Democratic National Committee chair and U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz accused him of buying his victory. "Mitt Romney’s victory tonight in the Florida GOP primary comes as no surprise – Romney and his super PAC outspent his nearest opponent by running 13,000 ads to Newt Gingrich's 200, carpet-bombing the airwaves with negative ads. In fact, Romney’s campaign has already spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his entire presidential run," said the South Florida congresswoman in a DNC press release on Jan. 31, 2012. If Wasserman Schultz’s statement is true, that means a staggering amount of money will be spent this year, as the campaign still has nine months to go. We decided to check it out. We soon realized that there was no way Wasserman Schultz’s statement could be accurate. McCain spent much more in his general election effort than Romney has spent on the primary so far. Let’s go through the numbers. McCain’s ad spending in 2008 For an analysis of McCain’s ad spending, we turned to the Wisconsin Advertising Project, now the Wesleyan Media Project. In a report about the 2008 election, the group found the McCain campaign spent about $12 million during the primary season and then more than $162 million from June through November, for a total of $174 million. The report also shows that a majority of McCain’s ads were negative, as were Barack Obama’s. "During the final presidential debate Sen. John McCain argued that Obama had ‘spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history,’ while Barack Obama accused Senator McCain of running an entirely negative campaign," the report said. "In a way, both candidates were correct. … At certain points in the campaign Barack Obama aired nearly as many negative or contrast ads as John McCain aired altogether. As a proportion, however, it is clear that most of McCain’s ads were negative in tone." Romney’s ad spending Next, we looked at what Romney has spent on the primary. Several news reports have said the Romney campaign and the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future have spent approximately $15.4 million on TV and radio ads in Florida based on data from Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group. CMAG would not answer our specific questions about their data since PolitiFact is not one of their clients. We could not find a total dollar figure for how much Romney spent through Jan. 31 on negative ads. However, the president of CMAG, Kenneth Goldstein, told the Daily Beast that the 2012 primary was "the most negative election ad atmosphere I've ever seen." "I have absolutely never seen television advertising so negative in a Republican presidential primary," he added. The Daily Beast reported that 92 percent of spending on behalf of Romney was negative. What Wasserman Schultz said Whatever the final spending tally is for the Romney campaign and pro-Romney super PAC, it’s clearly much less than John McCain spent in the general election. After PolitiFact Florida questioned the numbers, DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse said the press release garbled its talking point. "Where it says ‘presidential’ it should have said ‘primary,’" he said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that "Romney’s campaign has already spent more on negative ads than John McCain did during his entire presidential run." We couldn’t find a precise figure for what Romney spent on negative ads in all the states combined through the end of January, but it’s clearly much less than what McCain spent on his entire general election run. But it was her dramatic contrast between primary spending and general election spending that caught our attention, and that point is clearly wrong. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04305	"There are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care; they rely on it for mammograms."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/30/barack-obama/barack-obama-critics-clash-whether-planned-parenth/	In recent weeks, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have sparred over Romney’s promise to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Romney has made his pledge several times, most recently in speaking to reporters in Ohio in mid-October, when he said, "I think I’ve said time and again that I’m a pro-life candidate and I’ll be a pro-life president. The actions I’ll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget." On several occasions, Obama has countered that doing so would hamper women’s health services. "When Gov. Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care -- they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings," Obama said during the second presidential debate on Oct. 17, 2012. Obama reiterated the point during a campaign appearance a day later in in Manchester, N.H., saying, "Gov. Romney said he’d end funding for Planned Parenthood, despite all the work it does to provide women with mammograms and breast cancer screenings." Obama even repeated it on NBC’s Tonight Show with Jay Leno, saying, "You’ve got issues like Planned Parenthood, where that organization provides millions of women cervical-cancer screenings, mammograms, all kinds of basic health care." Planned Parenthood says that nearly 3 million people in the United States visit Planned Parenthood affiliate health centers every year, so Obama is correct on the scale of how many people use its health services. And he’s right about the group offering cervical cancer screenings (it provided 769,769 pap smears in 2010) and contraceptive services not including abortion (more than 3.7 million cases in the same year). However, Planned Parenthood’s relationship with mammograms specifically, is a bit more complicated than Obama suggests. As PolitiFact Georgia wrote earlier this year, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards denounced proposed federal cuts in February 2011 on HLN’s "The Joy Behar Show," saying that millions of women in the country would lose access to health care, not to abortion services but to basic family planning services, such as mammograms and cancer screenings. But Richards was immediately challenged on her statement by the California-based anti-abortion group Live Action, which secretly recorded phone conversations between an actress and employees at various Planned Parenthood clinics. The actress, supposedly seeking a mammogram, was told the service was not available and in some cases was referred elsewhere. Richards said her comments on Behar’s show were taken out of context. So what exactly does Planned Parenthood do regarding mammograms? The organization reported that in 2010, it provided 747,607 breast examinations. But the organization acknowledges that those involve physical examinations by medical professionals, not mammograms. "Although Planned Parenthood health centers do not offer mammography, each affiliate must have a physician available who is able to evaluate patients identified with abnormal breast findings who have been referred by clinicians, either on-site or by referral, and each affiliate maintains a list of radiologists and breast disease specialists to whom Planned Parenthood patients can be referred," the group says. A statement posted on Planned Parenthood’s website, dated Oct. 17, 2012, explained the group’s approach. "Planned Parenthood helps women nationwide get access to mammograms, as part of the range of health care Planned Parenthood health centers provide to nearly three million people a year. Planned Parenthood doctors and nurses do this like any other primary care provider or ob-gyn does," the statement said, adding that "women rely on Planned Parenthood for referrals for and financial help with mammograms and specialized diagnostic follow-up tests (like ultrasounds and biopsies) when indicated by age, history and/or clinical breast exam." The statement continued, "Like the vast majority of primary care physicians and ob-gyns, Planned Parenthood doctors and nurses refer patients to other facilities for mammograms based on breast exams, age, or family history. For many women, Planned Parenthood is the only health care provider they will see all year, and thus the only way they will get a referral for a mammogram Planned Parenthood medical professionals have established relationships with local breast imaging centers and specialists. In some instances case management is done by the Planned Parenthood health center and in others the management is coordinated by the specialist." Our ruling Obama said that "there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care; they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings." The critics have a point that Planned Parenthood does not actually provide mammograms; instead, the organization refers patients who need them offsite. Supporters of Planned Parenthood also have a point that the organization serves as an important link between some female patients and the mammograms a doctor determines they need. On several occasions, Obama has oversimplified and exaggerated what Planned Parenthood does, but he’s also not entirely wrong that the group makes it possible for many women to get mammograms they need. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-30T16:53:02	2012-10-17	['None']
pomt-14978	Wisconsin’s Government Accountability Board "wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-board-wanted-accept-mickey-m/	Legislative Republicans are fast-tracking a bill to scrap the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, and Gov. Scott Walker turned to Twitter to urge them on. Republicans say the board engaged in unfair treatment of their candidates during the 2011 and 2012 recall elections for Walker and several state senators. They also are critical of its implementation of a voter ID law and its participation in what one GOP senator has called a "witch hunt" of conservatives. In advance of a hearing on a bill to replace the accountability board with two new bodies, Walker tweeted eight times Oct. 12, 2015 on the subject, each time using the #ReformGAB hashtag. In one, he brought up two familiar names: "GAB wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions. #ReformGAB." Is Walker right? When we asked Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick for evidence to support the claim, she referred us to a Dec. 14, 2011 report on WISN TV and a story that appeared on Politico on the same day. Patrick noted that the WISN story said that "these names would be counted as long as they were properly dated and included a Wisconsin address." Patrick also cited a Dec. 13, 2011 video posted by the conservative MacIver Institute and said it shows that the "GAB specifically states they will accept Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures." That got us digging into the PolitiFact archives. On Dec. 18, 2011, we looked at this claim from MacIver’s video: "Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures" on recall petitions. We rated it Mostly False. The claim stems from a comment made by GAB elections specialist David Buerger during a Dec. 13, 2011 meeting of the board. Buerger was asked about Mickey Mouse and Hitler and responded: "We will flag them, but we will not strike them without challenge." The MacIver video said the board decided to "accept" the fictitious signatures, as in counting them toward the total of about 540,000 that was required to force a recall election. That was not the case. Indeed, Buerger noted explicitly they would be "flagged" for more review, just not automatically stricken. Here is one window on how technical the verification process is: In 2011, the board did immediately strike an Adolf Hitler signature -- since it listed an out-of-state address (Berlin, Germany). As our item noted: "For such signatures to actually be counted, they would have to pass undetected through petition circulators, the recall committees, a pair of Government Accountability Board reviewers, Walker’s representatives and other groups that review the petitions. If such signatures were found, Walker could formally challenge them to the board to get them stricken." According to state law governing recall elections, it’s up to the candidate being recalled to challenge names on the petitions. The statute says: "The burden of proof for any challenge rests with the individual bringing the challenge." Patrick, the governor’s spokeswoman, pointed out that the Walker campaign won a court order on Jan. 4, 2012 directing the board to be more aggressive in seeking out and eliminating "duplicate and fictitious signatures and illegible addresses in recall petitions." That order was later overturned by an appeals court. GAB spokesman Reid Magney told us in an email: "Out of 930,000 signatures submitted on petitions to recall the governor, there were 4,001 duplications and four fictitious signatures (Adolf Hitler, Mick E. Mous, Donald L. Duck, and I Love Scott Walker Thanks)." To be sure, Walker’s claim is not identical to the one we reviewed from MacIver. Walker tweeted that board wanted to consider the signatures "as valid." MacIver asserted they would be accepted -- which, as we noted, still allows for a challenge that would knock them out. Our rating Walker tweeted that the GAB "wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions." But there’s no evidence to support that. The process would not have immediately struck them. Rather, it would have flagged them for review. And there were numerous layers of scrutiny before it would have been determined valid. Walker took a Mostly False statement and embellished it. We rate his claim False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-10-16T10:44:29	2015-10-12	['Adolf_Hitler', 'Mickey_Mouse']

pomt-10637	"Barack Obama hasn't passed any (bills)."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/07/joe-biden/obama-sponsored-a-bill-that-became-law/	Before he bowed out of the race, Sen. Joe Biden dismissed the legislative accomplishments of three Democratic primary rivals with whom he served. About Barack Obama, he said, "Barack Obama hasn't passed any." By that wording, Biden is wrong. Obama, who was sworn into office in January 2005, spent much of his time in the Senate taking a high-profile position as spokesman for Democrats' efforts to overhaul congressional ethics standards, including his own bid to make Senate colleagues pay the full charter rate, rather than first-class airfare, for rides in corporate jets. The effort drew the ire of such senior senators as Ted Stevens of Alaska, whose state is so big that corporate planes are often the only way to get around. Senate leaders included that jet travel requirement in a lobbying practices and disclosures bill signed into law in September 2007. But as a member of the minority party, Obama also worked across the aisle with Republicans to push several measures that became law in 2006. Working with Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Obama won enactment of a law creating a single, searchable database of all federal contracts, grants and loans. He also partnered with senior Indiana Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, the former chairman of the Foreign Relations panel, to sponsor legislation to strengthen international efforts to destroy conventional weapons, though it did not advance out of committee. Separately, Obama was lead sponsor of a bill to provide relief and promote democracy in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was signed into law in December 2006. He introduced legislation in 2005 to require federal preparations for an avian flu pandemic, but it didn't advance. And he weighed in on another "good government" initiative during congressional debate on tougher lobbying disclosure standards, by backing the creation of an independent "Office of Public Integrity" that would investigate congressional ethics cases and receive and monitor financial disclosure reports required from members of Congress, officers and employees of Congress and lobbyists. The bid failed in 2006 due to opposition from members of the Senate Ethics Committee, who said it would politicize the panel. Another attempt to include it in the Democrats' ethics bill failed in early 2007. Obama's tendency to focus on nonidelogical issues is pragmatic, because they tend not to have powerful enemies or, if they do, are shielded by solid support in both parties. But some of his initiatives have languished, either because he was a junior member of the Democratic caucus or because they encountered institutional resistance. One would have rewarded troubled school districts with extra federal help in exchange for deep changes. Though advocacy groups generally gave him positive marks for taking action, Obama's absence from heated political battles makes it difficult to assess his effectiveness as a legislator. Still, he has passed one bill signed into law, making Biden's statement False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-01-07T00:00:00	2007-12-31	['None']
pomt-05580	"We have the lowest per-capita spending of any state in the nation" except for South Dakota.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/03/stacey-abrams/abrams-state-capita-spending-next-last/	State House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams thinks teachers and other government workers deserve salaries that rise with the cost of inflation. She also thinks that many Georgians don’t want to pay for them, Abrams told attendees at a recent Atlanta Press Club luncheon. Consider state government spending numbers. "Other than South Dakota -- and I think it’s because we just don’t have as many moose -- we have the lowest per-capita spending of any state in the nation," Abrams said in a March 27 speech. The second lowest per-capita spending of any state? We asked Abrams to tell us more. (This item will not evaluate Abrams’ moose claim, though we warn her that she may receive calls from irate fans of South Dakota elk. Elk are common there. Their moose cousins tend to live further north and to the west. ) Leaders in Georgia and elsewhere regularly argue over whether state employees get enough pay. Some, such as state Rep. Jan Jones, a Republican from north Fulton County, argue that if you consider teacher benefits and salary package as a whole, they’re paid well. PolitiFact Georgia gave Jones a Half True on a claim that Georgia ranks first nationally in teacher salary and benefits if you adjust for cost of living. The new 2013 budget does not include cost-of-living pay raises for most of the state's more than 200,000 teachers and employees. They have not received them since shortly after the start of the Great Recession. A 2011 analysis by USA Today shows that Georgia public employees make less than those in other states, but it’s not clear whether the study adjusts for the state’s cost of living. Abrams pointed us to data from the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a think tank that focuses on state issues, for more information on per-capita spending. Generally speaking, state per-capita spending is the amount of money the state spends in a fiscal year on things such as salaries and services, divided by the state’s population. Policymakers often use the figure to argue that a state is spending too much or too little. GBPI sent us rankings its researchers made with data from the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution think tanks. The Tax Policy Center’s research is widely used by experts with different political leanings. The Tax Policy Center’s data is based on numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local finances, which is a common source of information for state policy experts. GBPI used 2009 data, the latest numbers available, to compare Georgia with other states and the District of Columbia. Georgia spent $6,543.81 per capita, ranking 49th out of 51, or third from the bottom. The two highest were Alaska and the District of Columbia. Alaska spent $17,802, while D.C. spent $16,906. Pennsylvania is at the median, spending $7,780 a year. Abrams was close, but not quite on target. Now, there’s more than one way to rank state spending per capita. The GBPI ranked Georgia by a measure that combines spending by state and local governments. Researchers often prefer this measure because statewide governments split the cost of services with their local counterparts in different ways, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center. For instance, one state may prefer to shoulder most of the costs of education on the state level, while others may prefer to fund education at the local level. The census also collects spending by states only, so we took a look at its 2009 data. Georgia was tied for last place in total state spending. It tied with Florida for second-to-last place in "direct expenditures," a slightly different measure that excludes intergovernmental spending. None of these data show South Dakota trailing Georgia in per-capita spending. Regardless, these data all support Abrams’ broader point. In 2009, Georgia was near the bottom in state per-capita spending. According to one measure -- total state spending -- it’s tied for second. We rate Abrams’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-11123	Philadelphia Eagles players stayed "in the Locker Room for the playing of our our National Anthem" or were "kneeling."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/jun/05/donald-trump/president-trump-said-eagles-players-kneeled-anthem/	It was the eve of June 5 — the night before the Eagles were supposed to visit the White House — when President Donald Trump announced an abrupt change of plans. The President released a statement Monday night informing the public that he had uninvited the Birds from the traditional post-Super Bowl victory visit. Why? In part because "only a small number of players decided to come," and in part because Trump said that players had been kneeling or standing in the locker room during the national anthem, which he said was "disrespectful." Many people on the internet made the reasonable assumption that Trump was talking about Eagles players. But here’s the thing: none of the Eagles kneeled during the national anthem in 2017. According to a study released by Sports Pundit, the Birds were one of just seven teams in the NFL with a perfect non-kneeling record for the entire year. And they didn’t wait in the locker room either, per ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi. We found no reports that said players stayed in the locker room. The only on-field activism displayed by some Eagles players was the raising of their fists during the national anthem, which was kickstarted by safety Malcolm Jenkins. There’s one tiny exception: cornerback Ron Brooks kneeled once, but he was cut before the season started. The movement among NFL players to kneel during the national anthem began back in 2016, when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the 2016 preseason to protest police brutality and racial inequality. And other players followed suit. A record number of players kneeled during Week 3 of the 2017 season, after President Donald Trump stated that players who did so should be fired. Last month, NFL owners unanimously approved a new policy that would require players to stand if they are on the field during the national anthem, and slap teams with a fine if they disobey. Under the new rule, players would still be able to wait in the locker room during the anthem. In its reporting on Monday night, Fox News circulated images of a handful of Eagles kneelingbefore games, implying they did so in protest. Players jumped to defend themselves, saying the photos of them kneeling were actually moments of prayer, not protest. Executive Producer Chris Wallace later apologized for the "misleading" footage. The Eagles released their own statement — basically a subtweet of the President that didn’t acknowledge the issues at all. Pennsylvania politicians have since jumped in on the action. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney called Trump a "fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one will attend." Yeesh. So that’s what happens when you insult Kenney’s hometown team. Senator Bob Casey said he still supports the Birds, and he invited players to celebrate at the state Capitol. U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle echoed that sentiment, welcoming the team to Harrisburg for Wawa coffee (on him). Our Ruling Trump said he canceled the Eagles’ visit to the White House in part because some players declined to attend, and in part because "staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling." But according to a study from Sports Pundit, there were zero Eagles players who kneeled during the national anthem during the 2017 season. And according to ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi, they didn’t wait in the locker room either. We rate the claim False.

pomt-07837	The federal health care law is "probably the biggest tax increase ever in the history of our country."	false	/florida/statements/2011/feb/14/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-health-care-bill-biggest-tax-incre/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott's new job isn't getting in the way of his old hobby -- criticizing the federal health care law. Scott, who in 2009 formed Conservatives for Patients' Rights to oppose health care reforms being proposed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress, has continued to fight the health care reforms from his new perch as governor of Florida. The multimillionaire former hospital chain CEO promises to support lawsuits seeking to declare the law unconstitutional, and on Feb. 3, 2011, called on Obama to repeal the tax provisions of the health care law. In a speech to tout the release of his first state budget, Scott challenged Obama to repeal or roll back taxes and fees increased to help pay for the increased coverage the health care seeks to provide. Scott said Obama should follow Florida's lead -- where Scott was planning to cut state school property taxes and the corporate income tax. The federal health care law is "a massive tax increase, probably the biggest tax increase ever in the history of our country," Scott told about 100 Chromalloy employees during a tour of their aerospace manufacturing plant in Tampa. "Those tax increases, they are taking money out of your pocket. They are taking money out of your company's pocket. They are taxing things that you buy. All that is taking money out of our economy and throwing more money at the federal government, which makes no sense." Scott spent more than a year fighting the passage of the health care bill, so he certainly knows the legislation. But does he have the line right about being the "biggest tax increase ever?" The health care law certainly is, on the whole, a tax increase. Major tax provisions The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, provided members a detailed breakdown of tax impact from 2010-2019. • Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called "Cadillac plans" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, there's a new fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2013, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices starts. The 10-year total: $20 billion. • Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. • Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. There also is money in the law going the other way. The plan includes government money, in the form of tax credits, to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower-income people who don't get insurance through their employer. For the record, many Republicans and tax experts argue those shouldn't count as tax cuts. And there is a tax cut for some very small businesses that allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees. Combined with various other revenue-generating provisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenues coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019. Does that translate to the biggest tax increase in American history? Comparing tax impacts of legislation First, we need to set some goal posts. There are many ways to define or measure the size of a tax increase, and not all tax increases have been measured the same way over time. The health care tax provisions, for instance, take effect between 2011 and 2018, meaning the full effect of the legislation won't be felt until near the end of the decade. On top of that, it doesn't make sense to compare 2019 dollars to 1985 dollars. You have to adjust for inflation, or express the amount as a total of Gross Domestic Product at the time, which is a way to measure the relative impact of a tax provision at the time it was enacted. To make matters even more complicated, there are tax cuts that are direct results of tax increases, and vice-versa. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), for example, was passed largely to reverse revenue losses from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA). For our comparison, we used a method perfected by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940-2006. He used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation and calculated the impact as a percentage of GDP. For 1940-1967 calculations, he used a single-year snapshot of the revenue impact of the tax legislation. For more recent tax bills, from 1968-2006, Tempalski used a two-year average of the revenue effects. Tempalski wrote: "The comparison of tax bills for the first period should be examined with some caution, because the revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. The comparison for the second period can be viewed with more confidence, because the estimates are relatively consistent." As a percent of GDP, here are the top five tax increases from 1940-2006, according to Tempalski: 1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP; 2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP; 3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP; 4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP; 5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: .97 percent of GDP; And here are the top five tax increases from the "modern" era of 1968-2006: 1. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP; 2. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: .8 percent of GDP; 3(t): Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: .5 percent of GDP 3(t): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; .5 percent of GDP; 5: Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; .49 percent of GDP. The 2010 health care law The list obviously does not include the health care law, which passed in 2010, and a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury says it hasn't been updated. So we calculated our own percent of GDP figure. We used 2019 as our baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of the law will be in effect. In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion. We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to .49 percent of total GDP. Depending on your rounding, that would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax cuts proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. The health care-related tax increases are smaller than the tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961. The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represents the first significant tax increases since 1993. But for Scott to suggest they are the largest in U.S. history is inaccurate. We rate this claim False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-02-14T09:41:29	2011-02-03	['None']
pomt-12280	"We're pretty much at the 50 percent mark" on deportations of MS-13 gang members.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/30/donald-trump/trump-falsely-claims-his-administration-has-deport/	President Donald Trump recently claimed that in the five months he’s been in office, his administration has deported about half of MS-13 gang members, one of the largest criminal organizations in the United States around since the 1980s. Trump singled out enforcement efforts against the MS-13 gang during an immigration roundtable discussion on two House bills written to withhold funds from jurisdictions that shield immigrants and to impose stricter penalties for criminal immigrants who re-enter the country. MS-13 gang members are "bad people, and we've gotten many of them out already. You know, we're pretty much at the 50 percent mark," Trump said June 28. "We're getting them out as fast as we can get them out, and we're freeing up towns." Trump’s comment caught our attention since this is one of the most notorious gangs in the country. Is he halfway there in deporting thousands of MS-13 gang members? Not exactly. There’s an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. The latest data shows immigration officials have deported 2,798 gang members in fiscal year 2017 — that’s members of all gangs and includes several months when former President Barack Obama was in office. MS-13 in the United States Trump’s June 28 remarks weren’t the first he’s made about MS-13 and his administration’s efforts against them. At a rally this month in Iowa, he told supporters his administration was "moving them out of the country by the thousands." In April, he falsely tweeted that Obama’s policies allowed MS-13 to form across the United States, and again that his administration was removing them fast. But multiple experts told us there is no evidence Obama’s policies caused the gang’s growth in the country. MS-13 grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. It’s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000 members worldwide, the Justice Department said in an April 18, 2017, fact sheet. It’s difficult to peg down exactly how many MS-13 gang members there are in the United States. Trump’s Justice Department in April said there were more than 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. FactCheck.org noted that for years the 10,000 figure has been a consistent estimate. MS-13 deportations under Trump We asked the White House for evidence backing Trump’s claim, but did not get an on-the-record response. A specific number of MS-13 gang members deported is not available because officials don’t track removals by specific gang, Dani Bennett, spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement previously told us. (The FBI says there’s around 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs criminally active in the U.S. and Puerto Rico — with an estimated 1.4 million members.) But ICE "does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations," Bennett said, adding that deportations include foreign fugitives wanted for crimes committed abroad and who are removable under U.S. immigration law. So far in fiscal year 2017, ICE said it has removed 2,798 gang members. Even if all of them were MS-13 gang members, that would still be short of Trump’s claim that "we're pretty much at the 50 percent mark" — since the Justice Department in April said there’s an estimated 10,000 gang members in the country. Also, fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, when Obama was still in office. Our ruling Trump said, "We're pretty much at the 50 percent mark" on deportations of MS-13 gang members. Trump’s Justice Department has said there’s an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. The latest available data from ICE shows 2,798 gang members have been removed in fiscal year 2017. But that includes members of all gangs, not just MS-13. Even if all were MS-13, that would not be half of the estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the country. And fiscal year 2017 includes more than three months that Obama was in office.

pomt-12120	"The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/17/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-wrongly-says-united-states-ended-sl/	Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson said on his primetime talk show that while many are arguing for the removal of Confederate monuments because they legitimize slavery, America should get some recognition for stopping the practice globally. On the Aug. 15, 2017, episode of Tucker Carlson Tonight, the host was discussing with political commentator Jasmyne Cannick whether former U.S. Sen Robert Byrd’s name should be removed from a building because Byrd was once a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. Cannick said that offensive or racially insensitive monuments or dedications may be reviewed in time, but Americans should still remember to mark its history properly. Carlson affirmed her answer with a remark about the result of the Civil War. "The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too," he said. President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, and the 13th Amendment formally abolished slavery in the United States after it was ratified following the end of the Civil War in 1865. But did that stop slavery across the planet? Experts told us there was no way that was true. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Beyond the Civil War We don’t know exactly how Carlson was defining slavery, whether as a government-sanctioned practice or criminal enterprise. We reached out to the show and to Fox News Channel but did not get a response. But he’s not right in any case, historians told us. Slavery has been instituted by myriad cultures, empires and nations around the globe for centuries, they said. There have been patterns of abolishing slave trades and then the practice of slavery, before later reinstating them. In the modern context, the roots of the abolitionist movement really began in Great Britain in 1787. The Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade set the stage for organized, widespread protests against slavery. "If anyone could lay claim to leading anti-slavery forces in the world it was Britain, which after it abolished the slave trade and slavery made anti-slavery a leading aspect of its foreign policy and policed the Atlantic to end the slave trade," University of Connecticut history professor Manisha Sinha said. The British stopped its own trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1807, and America did the same a year later. Vermont did become the first state to ban slaves in 1777, but it remained in practice among wealthy landowners into the 19th century. Other northern states also began to ban slavery, but the practice in the United States and abroad continued for far longer, eventually becoming the flashpoint of the Civil War. Several Western nations ended slavery before the United States did. Spain abolished it in 1811, although Cuba refused the royal decree. Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Portugal all banned the slave trade — but not the owning of slaves — shortly thereafter. The British didn’t officially abolish slavery until 1833. Then other European powers began to follow suit. Several Latin American countries and a handful of other places like the principality of Moldovia banned slavery through the 1850s. Fast forward to the 1860s, when the Confederate States of America’s surrender to Union forces dovetailed with the official end of slavery here. But that wasn’t the last word on slavery. "The 13th Amendment abolished chattel slavery in the United States, but slavery continued in Cuba and Brazil until the 1880s, and in other places in the world well into the 20th century," Georgetown University history professor Adam Rothman said. Slavery and indentured servitude in Cuba finally ended in 1886, while Brazil stopped the official practice of slavery two years later. That’s still not the end of the story, however. "Slavery still exists in most every corner of the world," Siddharth Kara, director of the Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery at Harvard, told us. "When people speak about the abolition of slavery, what they mean is the abolition of the legally sanctioned institution of buying and selling other people like property." But forced labor continued, perpetrated by the likes of Nazis and the Soviet Union. Child labor and bonded labor, in which people must work to pay off debts, remains a problem, particularly in the Third World. The Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize in 2016 for documenting cases of slavery in the seafood industry in Southeast Asia. "The global campaign against modern slavery has been going on for a long time under the auspices of international anti-slavery NGOs and organizations like the U.N., which the U.S. participates in," Rothman said. "But at the same time, it's likely that forms of unfree labor akin to slavery lurk in the dark shadows at the end of the global supply chains of American businesses." Our ruling Carlson said, "The United States ended slavery around the world, and maybe we should get some credit for that, too." The practice of treating other human beings as property that can be forced into labor continued as official policy for more than decades in Cuba and Brazil after the Civil War. Historians said slavery continued to exist across the world into the 20th century, and conditions comparable to slavery still exist. Any credit for originating the ideals leading to the end of slavery as most people would define it should go to the British, historians said, who formally organized abolitionist thought long before the United States adopted any official policy.

pomt-14684	"The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-strongest-most-durable-ec/	President Barack Obama presented a range of statistics designed to show his economic record in a positive light during his 2016 State of the Union address. He kicked it off with this assertion: "The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world." A reader asked us to fact-check this after hearing a similar claim by Obama in an interview with Matt Lauer in the run-up to the State of the Union. So we took a closer look. We should note up front that many of the experts we checked with considered Obama’s claim to be vague and difficult to prove. "This is the type of braggadocio statement that is hard to interpret in a rigorous way," said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution. However, many of the same experts agreed that if you had to choose one country for the title of "strongest, most durable economy in the world," it would be the United States. White House evidence: GDP and jobs When we asked the White House for their evidence, a spokeswoman said the United States is the world’s largest economy at current market exchange rates. Also, she added, the United States’ gross domestic product -- the sum of all economic activity -- is up by a cumulative 9.7 percent since the first quarter of 2008. That’s about twice as fast as the increase in other industrialized economies, according to a data collected by Haver Analytics from International Monetary Fund and World Bank figures. The White House also pointed to strong job growth. Since 2010, the United States has added as many jobs as all the rest of the advanced economies combined, according to Haver data. (We have rated Half True a claim by Obama in his 2015 State of the Union address, that "since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined." We found that Obama was correct on the numbers but ignored persistent declines in the labor force participation rate.) How fast will world economies grow in 2016 and 2017? Experts told us that these two statistics -- gross domestic product and employment -- are reasonable ones to use as evidence for Obama’s claim, so we took a fresh look at the data. We interpreted Obama’s phrases -- "right now" and "the strongest, most durable economy" -- to suggest a focus on what’s happening now and into the immediate future, rather than looking at past growth rates. We turned to projections for GDP growth over the next two years released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of economically advanced countries. The group looked at 43 countries, ranging from large, advanced economies to smaller, advanced economies to large, emerging economies. The United States ranked almost exactly in the middle of the OECD’s list -- No. 21. Experts told us, however, that a middling ranking on this list doesn’t necessarily mean the United States’ economic outlook is weak. (The full chart is at the end of this article, ranked in descending order by projected GDP growth in 2016). For starters, many of the countries with higher projected growth rates have significantly smaller economies, making a comparison with the United States apples-to-oranges. These countries include Ireland, Iceland, the Slovak Republic, Poland, Israel, Latvia, Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia. In addition, a few countries have much higher projected growth rates, but they are generally considered emerging economies, making for a different but equally questionable type of apples-to-oranges comparison. These include the top three countries on the projected-growth list: India, China and Indonesia. "Many developing and emerging market countries will surpass the United States in terms of GDP growth, but that's not really a fair comparison," said Jon Hoddenbagh, an assistant professor of international economics at Johns Hopkins University. "It's easier to ‘catch up’ in productivity when you are well below the technological frontier, and more difficult to grow at the technological frontier itself, which is where the United States and other advanced economies find themselves." Meanwhile, the recent financial wobbliness in China doesn’t exactly bode well for it being considered "durable" despite its rapid GDP growth in recent years. China’s troubles in turn have slowed growth in other emerging-market countries, especially commodity exporters like Brazil and Russia. The United States vs. its G7 rivals The most direct comparisons to the United States are probably the other six members of the elite Group of 7 economies — the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. And all of them rank below the United States when measured by projected growth for 2016 and 2017. As for employment, the United States scores well among its closest competitors. Hoddenbagh pointed to data showing only one of the Group of 7 with a lower unemployment rate than the United States’ current 5 percent. Japan’s unemployment rate is 3.3 percent. "There are small countries like Singapore and Denmark that have even lower unemployment rates, but an unemployment rate of 5 percent is considered near the full employment level," Hoddenbagh said. "Relative to other large advanced economies, the U.S. economy is in a good position." Hoddenbagh added that the the strength of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies indicates the relative strength of the U.S. economy compared to other advanced, industrialized nations. He noted that the Trade-Weighted U.S. Dollar Index is at its highest level since 2003. Germany has been an economic bulwark for Europe. But while Germany has a lower debt-to-GDP ratio than the United States does, it’s also grappling with a higher unemployment rate, greater risks from the economic weakness of its European neighbors, and a larger-scale challenge than the United States in integrating refugees into its population, Hoddenbagh said. "I find it a stretch to argue Germany is leaps and bounds ahead of the United States economically," he said. "Relative to the weak performance of many other countries, the U.S. economy doesn't look so bad." Other experts agreed that Obama’s proposition is reasonable. Obama’s comment "should be regarded as substantially correct," said Simon Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Our ruling Obama said that "the United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world." It’s a claim that’s vague and hard to assess, but when comparing the United States to the most advanced economies in the world, one can make a credible case that the United States is in the strongest position, at least "right now." We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-00533	"Texas now has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country. And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jun/19/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-second-best-high-school-/	America, Rick Perry trumpeted, be like Texas. Declaring his candidacy for president, the former 10-year governor saluted job gains on his watch, then turned to public education. "Texas now has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country," Perry said. "And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics." Most everyone likes rankings. We wondered about these because in February 2013, we rated Mostly True a Perry claim that the state’s high school graduation rates were the nation’s third-highest. In 2011, Texas tied with five states with the No. 3 graduation rate of 86 percent. Unsaid by Perry: Three states had higher rates. So Texas could best have been described as fourth-ranked. Also, by another gauge — comparing graduates to the number of students in ninth grade three years earlier — Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Perry’s backup information To our inquiry about Perry’s latest claim, his campaign spokesman, Travis Considine, guided us to a U.S. Department of Education web page presenting graduation rates for the states, plus a chart showing such rates by race/ethnicity. By email, Considine said that in 2012-13, the Texas high school graduation rate of 88 percent ranked second nationally. The same year, according to the federal information, Texas graduation rates for Hispanic and black students exceeded the rates in any other state. Government: Graduation rate placed Texas third for 2012-13 We took his cue, finding the government’s January 2015 chart indicating the state’s 2012-13 graduation rate of 88 percent tied Texas for second nationally with Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Iowa led with a 90 percent rate. According to a note under the National Center for Education Statistics chart, the government’s four-year "adjusted cohort graduation rate" was based on the "number of students who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class." That is, according to the note, the size of the potential graduating class was adjusted starting the first year of high school by adding students who subsequently transferred in and subtracting students who transferred out, moved to another country or who died as reported by each state. On this front, we also checked with the Texas Education Agency. Spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised by email that a follow-up federal chart, dated February 2015, presented each state’s graduation rate as a three-digit figure, including tenths of a percentage point. This added detail resulted in Texas landing third nationally, still tied with Wisconsin. TEA said in a March 2015 press release: "The Texas graduation rate hit 88.0 percent for the second consecutive year, tying Wisconsin for the nation’s third highest. Only Iowa at 89.7 percent and Nebraska at 88.5 percent posted higher graduation rates for the Class of 2013." To see if there was another way to shake these figures, we rounded each of the rates in the chart to two digits. Nope: Texas still placed third, tied with Wisconsin, North Dakota and New Jersey. Government: Texas No. 1 in graduation of Hispanic, black students The same chart bore out Perry’s claim about Texas having the highest graduation rates for Hispanic and African American students. The 85.1 percent Texas Hispanic graduation rate in 2012-13 was higher than such rate for other states, edging the 82.5 percent rates for Hispanic students in Indiana and the 82 percent rate for such students in Arkansas. Likewise, according to the chart, Texas ranked No. 1 that year for its black graduation rate, 84.1 percent, besting No. 2 New Hampshire, which had an 82 percent rate, and North Dakota, with an 80 percent rate. Another gauge puts Texas in middle of pack From past fact checks, we recognize another method often used to gauge graduation successes. In this vein, we rated as True a 2010 claim by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White that Texas then ranked 43rd nationally for its 61.3 percent graduation rate in 2008-09. That conclusion was based on comparing the year’s number of graduates to the number of ninth-graders four years earlier, an indicator often called "attrition." The intent is to get a snapshot of how many students graduate in four years. In 2011-12, the latest year of available data, Texas had an 82 percent "averaged freshman graduation rate," according to a center chart, putting it in a tie with four states. Twenty-one states had better rates; Vermont and Nebraska ranked first with 93 percent rates. To our inquiry, Julian Vasquez Heilig, a professor at California State University Sacramento who has been critical of how Texas achieves its reported graduation rates, urged us to put stock in the attrition indicator because, he said, it shows the substantial dropoffs in student enrollment between ninth grade and the end of 12th grade. The latest Texas example: In 2010-11, according to the TEA, 390,665 students were in ninth grade. Three years later, the agency says, there were 308,851 12th-graders, a 21 percent difference. That same year, 2013-14, 303,109 students graduated, the agency says. That graduating class, by our calculation, was 78 percent the size of the ninth-grade class three years before. By email, Heilig suggested such enrollment drop-offs suggest a soft spot in the calculation of the graduation rates that place Texas among the nation’s best performers. He said that’s probably because the rates are rooted in each school district reporting the progress of each student, making it at least possible for administrators to record dropouts as students who left for legitimate reasons — such as moving to another state. In May 2014, Heilig laid out his own look at how Texas schools apply student "leaver" codes here. A TEA spokeswoman expressed confidence in how Texas tracks students. Lauren Callahan said by email that if a district’s reported reasons for students leaving school look suspicious, it can trigger a state review. "Is some leaver information ultimately inaccurate?" Callahan said. "Yes, but it is usually not because someone is intentionally lying. People just change their minds. At the time a student withdrew from public school, the parent signed a document saying the child was being transferred to a private school, for example. Ultimately something happens and the child never enrolls anywhere." Our ruling Perry said: "Texas now has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country. And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics." Almost: In 2012-13, per federal statistics, Texas ranked No. 3 in overall graduation rates and No. 1 for its African American and Hispanic rates. Then again, comparing graduates to the number of ninth graders enrolled three years earlier, Texas in 2011-12 had an 82 percent "averaged freshman graduation rate," tying with four states and trailing 21 states.

"Singer Tina Turner: This Thanksgiving is the first time in 8 years that I am thankful for our president, God bless him and his supporters," stated the headline in dailynewsforamericans.com Nov 23. We found the story after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We searched Nexis and Google and found no evidence that Turner made such a statement. The website dailynewsforamericans.com is largely about famous entertainers reacting to Trump. We found no disclaimer or contact information on the website, which calls itself a "tested and trustworthy team" but posts fake news. The article only contains a headline and a link to an interview with Turner on the show of British talk show host Jonathan Ross in October. Turner didn’t mention Trump at all during the interview. Instead, the interview covered topics such as the musical in development about her life, her marriage to Ike Turner and decision to leave him, her career and retirement. The headline stated that Turner was thankful for our president for "the first time in 8 years," a jab against Obama. We didn’t find many references to Turner weighing in on American presidential politics in recent years. In 2013, Turner relinquished her U.S. citizenship after living in Switzerland for about two decades. We do know that at least in the beginning, she was a fan.

pomt-04204	Democratic Party candidates for the state Assembly "actually received 200,000 more votes statewide" than their Republican counterparts in the 2012 election	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/05/sandy-pasch/pasch-says-democrats-outpolled-republicans-statewi/	Even as Democrats celebrated their statewide electoral successes in the Nov. 6, 2012 elections, the party faced the sobering reality that Republicans had regained complete control of the state Capitol. In the party’s statewide radio address a few weeks later, Assistant Minority Leader Sandy Pasch (D-Shorewood), scoffed at the idea that voters had validated the Republicans’ agenda. "The people of our state sent a clear message in this election – they are sick and tired of partisan politics trumping the best interests of middle-class families," Pasch said. She added: "And Republicans cannot claim a mandate for continuing their extreme agenda, as Assembly Democratic candidates actually received 200,000 more votes statewide." The claim about a Democratic popular-vote advantage jumped out at us. After all, Republicans won 60 of the 99 Assembly seats on Election Day, giving them a 60-39 advantage next year, a margin nearly identical to the previous two years. (In the state Senate, control flipped from the Democrats to the GOP). Is it possible Assembly Democratic Party candidates ran up a vote advantage while losing more than 60 percent of the races? Pasch’s office said she got the figure from a Nov. 13, 2012 opinion piece authored by State Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate and published in the Journal Sentinel. Tate said when the final vote tallies were confirmed, the margin would be "close to 200,000" in favor of Democrats. Losing the popular vote while winning a big majority would be unusual. In the 2010 Assembly races, for example, the GOP took control of the Assembly and Senate before temporarily losing the Senate after recall elections in 2011. That year state GOP Assembly candidates ran up a 263,000 vote edge over their Democratic counterparts. Republicans won 57% of the votes, collectively, in the Assembly races across the state. The two elections before that, in 2008 and 2006, saw the opposite: Democrats picked up seats. And in doing so, they ran up a huge majority of the collective vote in Assembly races, more than 60 percent in both cases, according to research by Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal political group One Wisconsin Now. So what about 2012? We crunched district-by-district numbers from the official results reported on the state Government Accountability Board website. And we found the historical trend flipped on its head. We counted a 174,000-vote edge for Democrats in the 99 races in the final tally. Statewide the Democrats won 53 percent of the 2.7 million votes cast in those local Assembly races, compared to 46 percent for Republicans, we found. The rest went to independents and other parties. Democrats blame the new redistricting plan, pushed through by Republicans for packing Democratic officeholders into supermajority districts and giving the GOP a majority of redrawn, conservative-leaning areas. Pasch called it a "gerry-mandate." A Republican political strategist, Mark Graul, owner of Arena Strategy Group, said he thinks redistricting was a factor but that in some districts Republicans simply outperformed their Democratic Party counterparts. In this item, we’re not evaluating Pasch’s claim that "Republicans cannot claim a mandate" in light of the Democratic vote majority. Her assertion struck us, and experts we consulted, as an opinion statement. But here are a few additional facts that help explain the vote totals and put the results in context. Behind the popular vote figures that Democrats cite are some stark figures that favor the GOP. If you look just at contested Assembly races featuring both a Republican and a Democrat, the GOP won 56 of 74 matchups. That’s 76 percent. In the 74 contested races, Republican outpolled Democrats by 155,000 votes. The overall Democratic edge in all races traces to the party’s 329,000 vote edge in races where only one party or another was on the ballot. As you might guess from those figures, Democrats dominated the uncontested races, including in Pasch’s district in Milwaukee and suburban Shorewood. Republicans wouldn’t or couldn’t field a candidate in a whopping 21 districts (most in vote-rich Milwaukee and Dane Counties), while Democrats fielded a contender in all but four. That’s a big switch from two years earlier, in 2010, when it was Democrats who sat out more races. In fielding so many candidates, Democrats might have been hoping to goose turnout in other races, said Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin Milwaukee political scientist elected five times as a Democrat in the state Assembly and Senate in the 1970s and 1980s. Our rating Pasch, citing Democratic Party research based on unofficial and preliminary vote data, claimed that "Assembly Democratic candidates actually received 200,000 more votes statewide" despite Republicans winning more than 60 percent of the seats. The final, certified election results showed a 174,000 edge for Democrats, despite the fact they won only 39 seats. We think that her statement rates a Mostly True.

pomt-02789	Obamacare is a "massive, massive income redistribution" with "$250 billion a year in Medicaid expansion (and) in the subsidy structure that's basically being paid for by people on Medicare, through Medicare cuts, and a lot of tax increases."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/05/james-capretta/capretta-says-obamacare-massive-income-redistribut/	Conservatives have many reasons to dislike Obamacare but one of the most fundamental is, as with any government program, it interferes with private-sector decisions by collecting money from some people and spending it in ways that might not benefit them directly. This point came up on Fox News Sunday when host Chris Wallace asked if Obamacare involved massive income redistribution. One of his guests, James Capretta with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a group with ties to conservative organizations, agreed wholeheartedly. "If you think about it, it's $250 billion a year in Medicaid expansion, in the subsidy structure, that's basically being paid for by people on Medicare, through Medicare cuts, and a lot of tax increases," Capretta said. "It is a massive, massive income redistribution." In this fact-check, we look at whether the new health care law is a "massive, massive income redistribution" that has taken $250 billion a year out of taxes and from people on Medicare and moved it into Medicaid expansion health care subsidies. Capretta told PunditFact that he drew his numbers from the entity that lays down the benchmark for all of these discussions, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress. In a May 2013 report, that office projected that in 2023, the Affordable Care Act would spend $250 billion specifically to offer Medicaid to a larger number of poor people and subsidies to make private insurance more affordable to people making up to 400 percent of federal poverty (about $92,000 a year for a family of four). Capretta argued that since the law reduces deficits, that $250 billion, and more, must come from somewhere and he correctly points to reductions in Medicare spending and a variety of tax increases. The Obamacare balance sheet The most detailed figures from the Congressional Budget Office are for 2022, not 2023, but the pattern remains the same. A quick reminder: The Medicare spending reductions we’re talking about are not cuts in the sense that Medicare will spend less than it does today. The reductions are in the future growth of Medicare spending, not a cut in existing programs. That said, on the government balance sheets, in 2022 the health care law "saves" $133 billion from Medicare, Medicare Advantage (an alternative insurance program within Medicare), and a program that pays hospitals that serve more than their fair share of poor, uninsured patients. Another $161 billion in new revenue is collected from five different sources. That list includes penalties paid by individuals and employers for not buying or offering insurance, taxes on higher income earners (above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples), a tax on the most generous insurance plans (the Cadillac tax), a tax on medical device and drug manufacturers, and a grab bag of other taxes. That’s a total of $294 billion. What does the government do with the money? As Capretta said, it spends most of it on an expansion of Medicaid and on subsidies for people purchasing health insurance through state and federal marketplaces. Around $45 billion goes toward deficit reduction. Does that make Capretta right? John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute, an academic research center in Washington, said yes and no. "There’s definitely redistribution going on," Holahan said. "All the Medicaid and subsidies clearly go to lower income people. Where he’s wrong is in calling it massive. It’s very small." Holahan said relative to the size of the economy, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates at $21.7 trillion in 2022, the total redistribution amounts to about 1 percent, but even that, Holahan said, is "a wild exaggeration." The primary reason, he said, is that except for the new or increased taxes on wealthier Americans, it is difficult to know who are true losers in the new system. Insurance companies, for example, might pay more in taxes, but they also gain from the revenues they get from subsidized policies. And to one of Capretta’s main points, it’s equally unclear whether the Medicare savings come from people on Medicare. Tracking the redistribution When Capretta said that the Affordable Care Act changes are "being paid for by people on Medicare, through Medicare cuts" he simplified a complex situation. The single largest source of dollars to cover the cost of expanded coverage comes from paying hospitals and doctors less for the same work. Jeffrey Clemens, a health economist at the University of California - San Diego, said this will hit the incomes of providers. The question is, what happens next? "When it becomes less profitable for providers to treat Medicare beneficiaries, they become less interested in seeing Medicare beneficiaries," Clemens said."Their time can be more profitably spent with the privately insured." If a hospital pulled out of Medicare, that would hurt its Medicare patients. But Ann Marie Marciarille, a specialist in health policy at the University of Missouri School of Law, said providers have a track record of staying with the program, largely out of self interest. "The federal government may not pay Medicare rates that top some commercial insurance but these rates top all Medicaid reimbursement rates," Marciarille said. "Even more importantly, the federal government pays its bills eventually." Tom Getzen, executive director of the International Health Economics Association and a professor at Temple University’s Fox School of Business and Management, said curtailing Medicare payments is nothing new. Getzen says providers can adapt through innovation, and he notes that projects in the Medicaid program show that less money doesn’t always mean less quality. "Recipients in many ‘tight’ managed care HMOs actually feel as if they are getting better service than before under fee-for-service which was more lucrative for most providers," Getzen said. There is one group of Medicare beneficiaries that is likely to be hurt. These are the people who purchase Medicare Advantage policies. This program has grown through subsidies that the Affordable Care Act phases out. Marciarille said this will cause dislocations that will hit mainly those she characterizes as "near poor." Scott Harrington, professor of Health Care Management at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, said of all the changes in Medicare, "insurance companies and hospitals that sell Medicare Advantage policies will take the biggest hit." Without the current subsidies, the market for these plans is projected to shrink, although recently enrollments spiked up. A look at the Obamacare taxes Capretta also mentioned tax hikes. The ones that most clearly redistribute money are the ones on wealthier Americans. In 2022, they can expect to pay $46 billion more. But then you have tax hikes that hit various players in the health care industry, plus the penalties on individuals and employers. While there is no shortage of speculation on how those taxes will play out, Getzen offered a more general summary of their impact. "It tends to get spread around, but probably falls more heavily on the top 50 percent," Getzen said. "In part because you cannot really get much from the bottom 25 percent." Our ruling Capretta said Obamacare represents a massive redistribution of income, with the expansion of Medicaid and premium subsidies paid for by people on Medicare and through a host of other taxes. He is correct that money is being redistributed to fund the expansion of public and private health insurance. It it also true that higher income earners will pay an estimated $46 billion more in taxes. But that amount represents only about 15 percent of the total dollars generated by the Affordable Care Act. The rest of the burden will skew toward the upper half of the income ladder but those making less will also shoulder some of the burden. Massive is a subjective term but in this case, particularly relative to the total economy, the case is weak. Regarding the reduced payments to Medicare providers, there is a range of possible outcomes. Providers could get by with lower compensation, they could become more efficient, they could reduce access to services or they could reduce the quality of service. It is not a foregone conclusion that Medicare patients will suffer. The likely exception is for people who currently pay for Medicare Advantage, a program that loses its present subsidies.

pomt-04418	As governor, "Mitt Romney raised nursing home fees eight times."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/15/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-raised-nursing-home-fees-eigh/	A new Obama campaign ad urges middle-class voters to pay attention to Medicaid, the government health program most commonly known for providing care to the poor, and to the changes Mitt Romney will make to it. Against images of middle-age couples caring for elderly parents, a narrator says "It’s one of the hardest decisions a family can make, realizing a nursing home is the only choice." It continues, "for many middle-class families, Medicaid is the only way to afford the care. But as a governor Mitt Romney raised nursing home fees eight times, and as president his budget cuts Medicaid by one-third and burdens families with the cost of nursing home care." "We have a president who won’t let that happen," the narrator concludes, as images appear of Obama interacting with seniors. We decided to check the facts about Romney’s decisions about nursing home fees while governor of Massachusetts. Medicaid and the middle class First, some background. Medicare is the government health care program for seniors, who pay into it during their working years through payroll taxes. It covers Americans 65 and older, with hospital stays, doctor visits and prescription drugs. It does not, however, pay for long-term nursing home care. So middle-class people end up turning to Medicaid to pay for that care once they’ve exhausted their own finances. The two presidential candidates have starkly different plans for the program. Obama, through his signature health care law, plans to expand the program to help more poor people get health coverage by raising income limits for who can qualify. Romney wants to convert the program to a block grant administered by the states. Critics say the resulting funding cuts will force states to tighten eligibility and ultimately drop people from the program. Back in Massachusetts As backup for the claim about nursing home fees, the Obama campaign cited increases Romney implemented to the cost of state licenses for nursing homes of different sizes. The fees increased on a scale according to the number of beds in each nursing home facility. They went up as follows: • 1 to 30 beds, from $95 to $285; • 31 to 60 beds, from $160 to $480; • 61 to 90 beds, from $225 to $675; • 91 to 120 beds, from $295 to $885; • 121 to 150 beds, from $360 to $1,080; • 151 to 200 beds, from $425 to $1,275; • more than 200 beds, from $495 to $1,485. In addition, Romney established a $9.60 per day user fee on nursing home beds not covered by Medicare. The money was meant to be returned to the nursing homes in the form of higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. The Romney campaign acknowledged the fee increases on nursing home licenses but took issue with the "eight times" characterization. We agree: The fees were not raised eight times -- they were raised once, on seven different levels of nursing homes in mid-2003, which was also when the user fee was implemented. We also find it misleading to connect this fee increase with the statement that "for many middle-class families, Medicaid is the only way to afford (nursing home) care." But the licensing fees were charged to nursing home providers, not Medicaid beneficiaries. While it’s reasonable that increased operating costs could have an effect on patients down the line, or even force some facilities out of business, Medicaid benefits were not directly affected by the fee increases. Our ruling Obama’s ad says that "for many middle-class families, Medicaid is the only way to afford nursing home care. But as a governor, Mitt Romney raised nursing home fees eight times." It would be more accurate to say Romney raised the licensing fee for seven levels of nursing facilities one time, in addition to the per-day bed tax. And all the fees were levied on the nursing homes themselves, not the middle class families struggling to afford nursing home care mentioned in the ad. Both those elements of the statement are inaccurate and misleading. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-15T18:01:37	2012-10-09	['None']
